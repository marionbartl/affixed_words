Why did the Dow just lose 1,000 points ?
Here 's a comforting answer :
No one knows .
But everyone is freaked out .
Peter McKay offers context :
The Dow went into freefall , tumbling through 10,000 , before dropping as much as 998 points , or 9.2 % .
The biggest closing point drop in the Dow 's history occurred on Sept. 29 , 2008 , at the height of the financial crisis , when the Dow ended the day down 777.68 points , or 6.98 percent .
The Dow has since pared its losses but remains sharply lower , down 492 points , or 4.45 percent .
So what 's going on ?
A lot of people are blaming it on a mixture of a computer glitch that made a couple major stocks ( notably Proctor & Gamble ) look like they 'd tanked and fears over Greece .
Megan McArdle rounds up some additional theories .
But whatever the ultimate trigger , the drop was too big for the cause to be this uncertain .
What you 're seeing here is a very , very fragile market .
There 's so much unknown risk out there -- notably , but not solely , in Europe -- that quick movements are sending everyone running for the door .
That is to say , we 're seeing the return of financial - crisis psychology , where people fear because they do n't know .
That 's why very calm people like David Cho are saying very scary things .

WASHINGTON , Calif. , May 9 ( UPI ) --
Americans are facing the prospect , some say the specter , of a national ID card .
At least one civil liberties advocate warns the proposed card would bring government " into the very center of our lives . "
The card -- part of a much larger Democratic proposal in Congress for immigration reform revealed last month -- would be " biometric . "
It could carry an individual 's fingerprints and facial and iris scans like the British national identification card .
In face - to - face transactions , such as an employment interview , it would prove you are you .

Everyone would have to produce the card to get a job , or keep a job .
If the larger proposal is approved by Congress , by no means a done deal , any constitutional challenge to a purportedly intrusive national ID card would depend on how far the U.S. Supreme Court would allow the national government to " burden " an individual to achieve a legitimate government purpose .
One obvious and legitimate government purpose would be preventing identity fraud by illegal immigrants and others .
A universal ID card even has national security implications .
When U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft unleashed the FBI on illegal immigrants after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , agents found thriving underground operations producing fraudulent identity documents .
So , how far would the justices let the government go ?
Judging by the high court 's most recent actions -- pretty damn far .

Before going into Supreme Court precedent , it might be useful to describe what the new cards would be .
On a five - year timetable the biometric cards would replace Social Security cards and would be used to prove eligibility for employment .
Card scanners would be issued to all U.S. employers .
The cards would at least have the capability of being linked to a central data system .
Like all controversial government programs , the proposed national ID card has an innocuous name :
When Senate Democratic leaders unveiled the new program last month they called it Biometric Enrollment , Locally Stored Information and Electronic Verification of Employment -- or " Believe , " for short .
In some ways , the Believe system would be like the old one .
The biometric card legally could only be used to verify employment eligibility , much like the current Social Security cards , and U.S. corporations already are required to keep the Social Security numbers of employees on record .
The difference would be in the biometric information and the universality of the employment requirement .
However , the opportunities for abuse by unscrupulous government employees are obvious .
The proposal rang alarm bells at the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington .
While criticizing several aspects of proposed immigration reform , the group is concentrating its criticism on the ID cards .
" If the biometric national ID card provision of the draft bill becomes law , every worker in America would have to be fingerprinted and a new federal bureaucracy -- one that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars -- would have to be created to issue cards , " the organization said in a statement .
" The ACLU strongly opposes the inclusion of a biometric national ID in this or any comprehensive immigration reform bill and urges senators to reject such an ID card . "

In his own statement , Christopher Calabrese , ACLU legislative counsel , said : " Creating a biometric national ID will not only be astronomically expensive , it will usher government into the very center of our lives .
Every worker in America will need a government permission slip in order to work .
And all of this will come with a new federal bureaucracy -- one that combines the worst elements of the ( Department of Motor Vehicles ) and the ( U.S. Transportation Security Administration ) .
America 's broken immigration system needs real , workable reform , but it cannot come at the expense of privacy and individual freedoms . "
Unusual support for the ID card proposal comes from Kevin Drum , writing online for Mother Jones magazine .
Drum pointed out Democratic congressional leaders " go to great lengths to say that it is not a national ID card , and make it ' unlawful for any person , corporation ; organization local , state , or federal law enforcement officer ; local or state government ; or any other entity to require or even ask an individual cardholder to produce their Social Security card for any purpose other than electronic verification of employment eligibility and verification of identity for Social Security Administration purposes . '
" But it 's still a biometric national ID card .
...
Essentially , if you want to participate in the American economy , you need this card . "
Still , Drum said : " I 'm in favor .
It 's not as if these things are security panaceas or anything , but they'd be pretty useful for things like reducing employment fraud or voter fraud .
...
Every time this comes up I hear lots of vague but alarming talk about police states and the end of liberty , but nothing concrete about how this would really change things much ...
As for making it easier for the federal government to track us , please .
They already have all the tools they need to track us .
It 's called a Social Security number .
A non-fakable Social Security number would be an improvement , not a further infringement on our liberty . "

So what would happen if the national ID card proposal becomes U.S. law , it faces a constitutional challenge as an invasion of the constitutional right to privacy and the Supreme Court agrees to hear the dispute ?
A case with many parallels is 2008 's Crawford vs. Marion County Election Board .
In that case , the state of Indiana enacted a law requiring citizens voting in person to present government - issued photo identification , such as a driver 's license , at the polls .
A federal judge said the evidence in the case did not support an attack on the law , and a U.S. appeals court ruled the " burden " placed on voters was offset by the prospect of reducing fraud .
The Supreme Court also ruled for the state 6 - 3 , though the ruling came in two opinions .
Each opinion was supported by three justices .
Liberal Justice John Paul Stevens , who retires at the end of the current term , announced the judgment in favor of the law and wrote one of the majority opinions .
He was joined by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts and moderate conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy .
Stevens dismissed Democratic claims that the law was enacted by majority Republicans in the Legislature to keep poor voters , those least likely to have a driver 's license or a passport , from voting .
" If a non-discriminatory law is supported by valid neutral justifications , those justifications should not be disregarded simply because partisan interests may have provided one motivation for the votes of individual legislators , " Stevens wrote .
" The state interests identified as justifications for ( the law ) are both neutral and sufficiently strong to require us to reject petitioners ' facial attack on the statute .
The application of the statute to the vast majority of Indiana voters is amply justified by the valid interest in protecting ' the integrity and reliability of the electoral process . ' "

In an opinion joined by fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito , Justice Antonin Scalia helped form the six - justice majority , but had different reasons for joining the majority .
" The universally applicable requirements of Indiana 's voter - identification law are eminently reasonable , " Scalia wrote .
" The burden of acquiring , possessing and showing a free photo identification is simply not severe , because ( citing precedent ) it does not 'even represent a significant increase over the usual burdens of voting .' ...
And the state 's interests ... are sufficient to sustain that minimal burden .
That should end the matter . "
Justice David Souter , now retired , dissented in an opinion joined by fellow liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer dissented separately , but Souter 's criticism was harsher .
" Indiana 's ' Voter ID Law ' threatens to impose non-trivial burdens on the voting right of tens of thousands of the state 's citizens ... and a significant percentage of those individuals are likely to be deterred from voting , " Souter wrote .
" The statute is unconstitutional under the balancing standard of ( 1992's Burdick vs. Takushi ) : A state may not burden the right to vote merely by invoking abstract interests , be they legitimate ... or even compelling , but must make a particular , factual showing that threats to its interests outweigh the particular impediments it has imposed . "
Given the court 's ruling in Crawford , the chances of success in a legal challenge to a national ID card are slim .
However , the political prospects offer more hope for opponents .
The blogosphere is alive with speculation the Democrats do n't really want to enact the national ID card , that they really want to use the proposal as a cat 's paw to put Republicans in a bind , though there is no evidence that they are n't sincere .

But Senate Republicans are reacting to the proposal with suspicion .
Even Mother Jones 's Drum says , " There 's not much chance of this proposal getting anywhere . "
The difficulty in immigration reform is demonstrated by the REAL ID Act , enacted by a Republicans in Congress in 2005 and signed into law by President George W. Bush .
Many called it a GOP attempt to establish a national ID card .
The act was designed to toughen state standards for issuing driver 's licenses and other ID documents , and tighten the rules for temporary worker visas and asylum , among other things .
The problem -- the states are ignoring it .
All 50 states asked for extensions of the deadline to comply , and 25 states have said they do not plan to participate in REAL ID , given the Obama administration 's opposition .
In fact , the Las Vegas Review - Journal reported last week that Nevada will stop issuing driver 's licenses that meet the REAL ID standards .
A 120 - day period allowing the license standards , ordered by the governor , has lapsed because the Legislature has so far refused to make it permanent , faced with opposition by conservative groups and the ACLU .
Twitter had committed to rolling its own client for Android not long ago -- and like clockwork , here it is .
Looks like the OS integration goes pretty deep , too , with support for Éclair 's Quick Contact bar and tweeting straight from the Gallery app ; you 've also got a timeline widget for your home screen , and you can even see your friends ' latest tweets from your contact list and the Google Talk app .
It sounds like Twitter worked pretty closely with Google to make this happen , contributing the code to Android 's trunk for open sourcing in the near future -- and developers will even have access to a set of standard Twitter APIs for their own applications .
The only downside appears to be that you need Android 2.1 to use it , but that 's just an excuse to run out and upgrade to a sweet new phone , right ?

Yet there is something curious here , in the sense of peculiar : a meaning that , the exhibition tells us , prevented the Reys ’ British publisher from following the American example in naming the monkey .
The suggestion of “ strange George ” would have also seemed a tasteless allusion to George VI , then the British king ( which is why the character became known as Zozo in Britain ) .
At first , the peculiarity is not apparent .
The material for this show was gathered by the museum ’s curator Claudia J. Nahson , who combed through the extensive archives left by the Reys to the de Grummond Children ’s Literature Collection at the University of Southern Mississippi .
It is an enticing , appealing , intelligent show , for which Ms. Nahson has included personal memorabilia ( including a wedding invitation sent out in 1935 , soon after Hans Augusto Reyersbach shortened his last name to Rey , and Margarete Waldstein shortened her first name to Margret ;
Hans depicted himself as an artist ’s palette , and Margret , a photographer , as a camera ) .
There are letters ( including some fascinating prewar correspondence with the French publisher Jacques Schiffrin , who tested out one of the Reys ’ early books on his son , André ) and watercolors of George at his best , along with little - known characters from other books ( like Raffy the giraffe , on whose neck a George - like monkey rides to sunlit safety above the clouds ) .
In all , there are about 80 drawings and watercolors , along with photographs Margret took of Paris in the 1930s .
The exhibition is also true to its pictorial subject .
It playfully expands some drawings into full - scale sets ( you enter the first gallery through a portal resembling the entrance to a French hotel in one of the Reys ’ prewar books ) , creates a children ’s reading room ( with pillows shaped like Georgian creatures ) and features a gallery of the Reys ’ later work , whose sets evoke the places they ultimately considered home : first Greenwich Village , then Cambridge , Mass .
And the peculiarity of the Curious George books ?
Like the Babar tales ( which also grew out of the milieu of 1930s Paris ) they have an almost colonial - era vision of the uncultivated naïf at large in the imperial world .
But George is far more childish .
One appeal of these volumes is their almost manic celebration of innocent desire .

“ Little monkeys sometimes forget , ” we read of the warnings he regularly violates .
Seeing something interesting , George , of course , “ could not resist . ”
He lifts a lid on a pot of spaghetti , plays tricks on his bicycle , races down a fire escape , climbs a tree in a natural history museum .
His curiosity is clever , but consequences are never foreseen : he seems to be a fearless 5 - year - old .
A VICAR will today officiate at her own son ’s wedding .
Nick Butler , 30 , and Lizzie Brown , 28 , will marry in Blewbury and it will be a double celebration for the Revd Louise Butler , 57 , because it is also her birthday .
She said : “ It was one of the first things they asked when they got engaged : would I like to take the service ?
“ I accepted without a moment ’s hesitation , and said I would love to do it .
Now I am chewing my nails and hoping I can stand up to it emotionally . ”
Mr Butler , a former Blewbury School and St Birinus in Didcot pupil , met his bride - to - be as a singer at Oxford Gospel Choir .
Miss Brown is the choir ’s conductor and composer .
The reception is being held in a marquee in the grounds of a friend ’s house , before the couple travel to the south of France for their honeymoon .
Mr Butler , of Bridus Mead , Blewbury , said inviting his mum to oversee the cemetery was one of the first things he had thought of when he became engaged to Miss Brown , of Windmill Road , Headington .
He said : “ We gave her the first opportunity , but asked her to think about it properly .
“ I knew her first reaction would be to say yes , but I wanted to make sure she could get through the service .
“ I think she will hold back the tears until maybe the end . ”
Lou Reed To Stage Concert for Dogs
Image via Wikipedia
American musician Lou Reed and his wife , performance artist Laurie Anderson , are planning an “ inter - species social gathering ” — otherwise known as a concert for dogs .
Yes , a dog concert .
The show , aptly titled Music for Dogs , will be held outside the Sydney Opera House in June and will feature “ high - frequency music ” composed for canine ears , reports the BBC .
Humans , sadly , wo n’t hear much .
The recital , which will last only 20 minutes because “ dogs do n’t have a giant concentration span , ” wo n’t be the couple ’s first stab at animal entertainment .
They already make sweet , sweet music for their rat terrier , Lollabelle .
“ She likes things with a lot of smoothness but with beats in them , ” Anderson says .
And you thought cat people were crazy .

WASHINGTON —
The government says it recovered $ 2.5 billion in overpayments for the Medicare trust fund last year as the Obama administration focused attention on fraud enforcement efforts in the health care industry .
Investigators have new tools this year to help crack down on health care fraud , with the Justice Department and the Health and Human Services Department working cooperatively to police companies .
The newly enacted Affordable Care Act is designed to lengthen prison sentences in criminal cases , and the new law provides an added $ 300 million over the next 10 years for stronger enforcement .
It also gives the government new authority to step up oversight of companies participating in Medicare and Medicaid .
Smart USA is showing off the electric version of the ForTwo on the East Coast this week .
Not a moment too soon , either .
That 's because Smart hopes to have 250 of the little two - seat buggers in the hands of consumers as soon as this fall , when it goes into test as a prelude to volume production in 2012 .
About 100 of them are already running around England .
Using a standard 220 - volt outlet , the electric Smart takes 3.5 hours to charge the battery from 20 % to 80 % of its capacity .
It takes less than 8 hours to fully recharge .
It also can be charged using a standard 110 - volt wall outlet .
The vehicles can reach highway speeds and offers a range of about 82 miles on a single charge .
" The Smart ForTwo electric drive is the ultimate statement on innovative automotive conservation and further defines the brand 's independent spirit , " said Jill Lajdziak , president of Smart USA .
Smart is made in France by Germany 's Daimler , parent of Mercedes - Benz .
Sales have fallen in the U.S. for the conventional version as gas prices have moderated , Smart was unable to produce follow - on models and the fad factor of the brand has started to wear off .
But electric drive could be just what Smart needs to become the cutting edge of cool again .
One evening a fellow prisoner kept asking Madoff about the victims of his $ 65 billion scheme and Madoff , angered , said : " F*** my victims .
I carried them for twenty years , and now I 'm doing 150 years , " the magazine reported .
Madoff saw his years as the mastermind of the gigantic pyramid scheme as a " nightmare " and he told investigators that he wished he had been caught six , eight years before he was , according to the article .
He was past apologizing and created his own version of events in prison , the magazine wrote .
" People just kept throwing money at me , " Madoff is said to have told a prison consultant who advised him on how to endure prison life .
" Some guy wanted to invest , and if I said no , the guy said , ' What , I 'm not good enough ? ' ? "

Fearing that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico will deal a severe blow to the bluefin tuna , an environmental group is demanding that the government declare the fish an endangered species , setting off extensive new protections under federal law .
Scientists agree that the Deepwater Horizon spill poses at least some risk to the bluefin , one of the most majestic  and valuable  fishes in the sea .
Its numbers already severely depleted from record levels , the bluefin is also the subject of a global controversy regarding overfishing .
The bluefin is not the only fish that spawns in the gulf , and while it is often a focus of attention , researchers are worried about the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on many other species .
In fact , scientists say , it is virtually certain that billions of fish eggs and larvae have died in the spill , which came at the worst possible time of the year .
Spawning season for many fish in the gulf begins in April and runs into the summer .
The drilling rig exploded on April 20 , and the spill has since covered thousands of square miles with patches of oil .
The United States enacted an estate tax in 1916 , and when John D. Rockefeller , America ’s first billionaire , died in 1937 , his estate paid 70 percent .
Since then , the rates have fluctuated , but this is the first time the tax has been repealed altogether .
The bonanza in tax savings for Mr. Duncan ’s descendants is sure to be unsettling to those who have paid estate taxes on more modest wealth — until Jan.
1 of this year , it applied to any estate valued at more than $ 3.5 million , taxing only the money exceeding that threshold , or $ 7 million for a couple ’s estate .
Although the tax affects only about 5,500 estates a year , it is such an incendiary issue that when Congress unexpectedly let it lapse at the end of 2009 , financial advisers warned that it might play a macabre factor in the end - of - life decisions being weighed by heirs of elderly Americans .
Some estate lawyers worried that tax considerations might prompt their clients to keep an ill relative on life support through the end of 2009 to get the favorable treatment — or worse , resist life - prolonging measures to hasten a relative ’s demise before the end of 2010 .
The one - year lapse in the estate tax was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2001 , an accounting quirk in his package of tax cuts .
Although Democrats pledged to close that gap and reinstate a tax for 2010 when they took control of Congress , they failed to reach an agreement last December .
The Senate Finance Committee is now trying to forge a compromise that would reinstate the tax , but even if that effort succeeds , it is unclear whether any changes might be retroactive and applied to those who have died so far in 2010 .
Many lawyers say Mr. Duncan ’s heirs have the means and motivation to wage a fierce court battle to challenge the constitutionality of any retroactive tax .

StarCraft 2 Interview
This is not Frank Pearce
This is not Sarah Palin
is coming and the looming shadow of what could be the biggest release of 2010 hangs heavily over us , filling our thoughts .
It ’s practically impossible to escape ’s influence , in other words .
So , when we got a chance to sit down for tea and biscuits with a heavily jetlagged Frank Pearce , Blizzard ’s Executive Vice President of Product Development , and a slightly more lively Bob Colayco , Blizzard ’s PR Manager , how could we possibly pass it up ?
Well , for us , with the Battle .
net service and so on , we really want our games to be balanced and viable for as long as there are fans playing them .
So even today , 12 years after the release of the original , we ’re still supporting the originalon Battle .
net and we ’ll continue to do so even after the release of the sequel .
And , you know , is one of those games you can pick up and sit down with and just bang out a match in under 20 minutes and it ’s a really fun experience .
Also , I do n’t think that …well , fun is n’t defined by technology – it ’s defined by the gameplay experience .
Oh , yeah .
That ’s the great thing about our company , our sales team and our marketing team ; they do n’t look at a product and assume that the lifespan for it is only six months , right ?
They look at it as a product that ’s going to last for years .
I do n’t know what the retail market specifically is like in the UK , but in the US you can still go down to Best Buy and pick up a copy ofI have no idea , I really do n’t .
Um …yeah , no clue .
Bob , do you ?
It ’s hard to say .
I guess there was just a unique environment in Korea at the time the game came out and the culture there is to play games in PC Cafes , not so much holed up in your bedroom on your own .
Over there it ’s like an evening out , to go to a PC Café there and , while it may seem a bit strange to us , it ’s not to them .
There ’s something about playing with others that heightens the experience , even for bad games .
You play a bad game in multiplayer and , if you ’re with a bunch of friends , it can be really funny .
So , take a good game and imagine how much it can improve .
Another factor , certainly in Korea anyway , is that so many players play– whether professionally or not – that they have a really , really strong understanding of the game and strategies behind it .
So , when they watch amatch then they understand the intricacies of it better than another person does .
So , when the TV networks broadcastmatches , the viewers have such a solid understanding that it ’s a real , meaningful experience for them .
I think that in other regions there just is n’t that same intimate understanding in terms of what the game is as a competitive multiplayer arena .
I think that ’s a big factor in Korea .
Last week I looked at one possibility for the Oilers ' second choice in the second round [ # 48 overall from Nashville ] , Martin Marincin , the hulking Slovak defenseman .
This week I submit a possibility for the Oilers ' second pick , the 31st overall .
He 's yet another European player that few have heard of - Tom Kühnhackl , a 6 ' 2 " 172 lb forward from the Landshut Cannibals , playing in the second division of the German league .
Kühnhackl turned pro at the age of sixteen and in his sixteen and seventeen year old seasons , he posted better than .5 points per game in the German second division .
He 's not as well known as he should be as he was forced to withdraw from the World Junior Championship due to injury .
Had injuries not befallen Kühnhackl , it 's likely that he would be a mid-first round lock this June .
Tom is the son of Erich Kühnhackl , considered the greatest German hockey player ever , and voted as such in the year 2000 .
Erich broke into the Bundesliga at age eighteen , and in his second full season he would record 28 points in 35 games - his career low .
Dad totaled 1500 career points in Germany , leading the league in points eight times and he was a seven time all - star .
Erich also won three Bundesliga championships .
He won a bronze medal in 1976 at Innsbruck and played in two other Olympic games and in ten World Championships .
He appeared in over 200 international games , a German record .
If there ever was a player with a pedigree heading into a draft , Tom Kühnhackl is your man .
Is Kühnhackl worth the 31st overall pick , or is this a player that the Oilers could target with the 48th overall pick ?
Once again we go back to the always - outstanding Bruins 2010 Draft Watch for a scouting report on Kühnhackl :
He 's an elite talent who , prior to the season , was seen in some circles as a top - 10 prospect , but is slipping ( ranked 10th on the European skaters list by Central ) .
If he is there early in the 2nd , Kuhnhackl would be a steal .
He 's an explosive player with a very quick stick and a high - end hockey IQ .
He 's a beanpole ( 6 - 2 , 172 pounds ) who has a lot of filling out to do , but scouts love his live athletic build and know he 'll pack on enough mass to handle the physical aspects .
Erich was 6 ' 5 " and 198 lbs , so Tom 's got lankiness is in his genes , but the kid should be expected to add another 30 pounds to his frame .
He came into the Bundesliga as a center , but he 's played left wing for the Cannibals thus far as a professional .
One positive for Kühnhackl 's draft position is that he 's committed to moving to North America for the 2010 - 2011 season .
From The Scouting Report :
He ’s a big forward who moves well and has a solid goal scoring touch .
Some may have expected more from the German this season , but he still managed to produce well playing in a Men ’s league .
He ’ll be transitioning over the pond to Windsor next year , where many North Americans will have a better gauge on his development .
Kühnhackl will make the jump to North America next year and play for the OHL champion and Memorial Cup winner , the Windsor Spitfires .
His willingness to play in the CHL next year should push his draft position up a handful of spots over where he would have been taken had he planned to stay in Germany .
Windsor General Manager Warren Rychel has said : " He 's a great skater and he 's gifted with the puck . "
He 'll have the opportunity to show off those skills next year as he may replace the departing Taylor Hall .
Windsor could lose four first round draft selections from the championship team , so Kühnhackl will have an immediate stage .
Kuhnhackl 's scouting record on himself :
" I think I 'm the kind of player that my dad was .
He 's tall , I 'm tall .
I use my body to protect the puck .
I can get the puck to the net to create scoring chances , see the open guy . "
In the long view , Kühnhackl has been compared to Marco Sturm in that he is fast , agile , possesses great acceleration and plays well in both zones .
He 's much larger than Sturm , and possesses more high - end skill .
Both Kühnhackl and Sturm , as well as Erich , came out of the same development program in Landshut , yet another pointer towards the younger Kühnhackl 's pedigree .
EHC München General Manager Christian Winkler called Kühnhackl a " feast for the eyes " :
" A feast for the eyes , what has the boy on it .
There are not many talents like him in Germany .
I will not impose on him the name Kühnhackl more , but he reminds me of Marco Sturm . "
I 'll take a feast for the eyes in the second round .
Let me take you into a situation that illustrates the church institution 's instinctive reaction to cover - up scandal .
It was a workshop in 2000 for new Jesuit superiors .
The presenter , a former provincial , was discussing the circumstances when a superior could break the bond of confidentiality between himself and the men he was in charge of .
He said something could be shared with the provincial " If it was a matter of danger for the individual or to others . "
I asked , " What do you mean by others ? "
His response was concise and immediate : " The Jesuit order . "
( Not , as I expected , " students , parishioners , those we are counseling , etc. " )
I was stunned by his answer , and the fact that none of the other 40 participants expressed any disagreement with it .
That same evening we heard a talk by a newly installed bishop .
He had worked in another diocese prior to his current post and said he often appeared in court to defend priests facing charges .
He described how , as he was walking into court , he would recite to himself , " I 'm sorry , Your Honor , but I do not remember . "
Those attending the dinner laughed loudly .
One wonders if either of these revelations would have occurred if " outsiders " ( lay people , the parents and victims of sexual abuse by priests ) had been present .
I strongly doubt it .
I am , however , convinced that the two interlocking issues that contribute to sex crimes against young victims are precisely this misuse of confidentiality and power in the insular clerical culture , and the Vatican 's fixation on celibacy .
The church 's fixation on celibacy became obvious eight years ago when I decided to implement my decision to leave the priesthood .
The process is complex and little known , even by clerics .
To obtain permission to leave the Jesuits I had to write a letter to the general of the order in Rome , stating my reasons .
I had to write a similar letter to the pope , asking to become an " inactive priest . "
( I imagine it as having my hands tied behind my back , with the church saying I still possess the powers of a priest but without authorization to use them " unless there is a state of emergency or someone is in imminent danger of dying . " )
I was told the process would be completed within 6 - 8 weeks .
Writing the two letters seemed simple enough .
However , there was one hitch : if I also wanted to be released from my vow of celibacy I would have to go through a series of steps , similar to those required for couples who seek an annulment from their marriage .
I would need to have individuals who knew me before I was ordained to testify as to my freedom and maturity when I made this choice in 1970 .
The theory is that evidence will be found indicating I was not truly free and mature to choose celibacy in the first place .
If , indeed , this can be found , then I could be released -- just as some married couples qualify to have their marriages annulled due to a lack of mature free choice .
This is how the church works diligently to protect the bond of marriage and the bond of celibacy -- but then I learned there was one additional hurdle : seeking this permission would take a minimum of two years and neither of the other two requests could be granted until -- and if -- it was successfully approved .
Wow !
Three superiors encouraged me to only apply for the first two permissions , saying that if I did get married " things could be worked out later without much difficulty . "
Of course .
It is eight years later , I did get married , and now I 'm told that my marriage will only be " regularized " by the Vatican if I respond favorably to a five - page questionnaire that focuses primarily on my sexual history over the past 45 years .
I have chosen not to complete the document because I am unable to answer the one question in it that I think is valid : " Why is it that you are seeking this special favor ? "
In short , after being released from my vows as a Jesuit and being approved , by the Vatican , to become an inactive priest , I feel no need to obtain a further permission to have my marriage " regularized " -- especially since it can only be obtained by completing an onerous questionnaire fixating on my personal sexual history .
Surely Rome can do better than that .

Sporting an Eco-Friendly Box
The innovation applied to HTC EVO 4G goes beyond the device and also applies to the eco-friendly packaging .
Sprint designed the box and tray to align with its commitment to sustainability , working with HTC to produce a superior environmental solution that also protects the phone .
HTC EVO 4G 's package is 100 percent recyclable and partially made from sugar cane , a highly renewable material that serves as a great alternative to plastic or foam .
Sugar cane pulp is becoming a popular choice for sustainable packaging because of its reduced environmental impact , as it is a renewable resource , decomposes relatively quickly in the waste stream , can be recycled in the conventional paper stream and its flexibility for use in an array of package shapes and sizes .
Sprint has also significantly reduced in - box materials , encouraging users to find details online , and uses certified soy inks and water - based coating on the sleeve .
Although HTC EVO 4G was developed prior to the development of Sprint 's green specifications for devices , it already meets several of Sprint 's eco-criteria including RoHS compliance ( the strict European Union standard for the restriction of hazardous substances ) an Energy Star Level V qualified charger , use of a micro-USB connector for charging and the inclusion of a recycling envelope for customers to easily recycle their previous phone model .
Getting More for Less
In order to provide the best experience , HTC EVO 4G requires one of Sprint 's industry - leading Everything Data or Business Advantage Messaging and Data plans with Any Mobile , AnytimeSM .
A $ 10 per month Premium Data add - on is required for all HTC EVO 4G users , enabling a richer data experience than ever before at both 3G and 4G speeds .
HTC EVO 4G customers can pay just $ 69.99 for Sprint 's Everything Data 450 plan , plus the $ 10 Premium Data add - on , totaling just $ 79.99 per month for unlimited Web , texting and calling on the Sprint Network with any mobile in America , as well as the most robust multimedia experience and fastest data speeds in wireless today .
That 's a savings of $ 40 per month versus Verizon 's 3G - only plan with unlimited talk , text and Web .
An optional charge of just $ 29.99 per month turns on HTC EVO 4G 's mobile hotspot , connecting up to eight Wi -Fi enabled devices , such as laptops , gaming devices and digital cameras , simultaneously at 4G speeds , where available , and at 3G speeds anywhere on the Sprint 3G network .

A man has suffered life - threatening injuries after falling out of a tree at a march for marijuana legalization Saturday afternoon .
The man was perched about 20 to 30 metres up a tree at Queen ’s Park around 4:20 p.m. , as the Global Marijuana Marchunfolded below .
As the tree swayed in the wind , someone called emergency crews to rescue the man .
Before help could arrive , he fell .
Paramedics arrived quickly and transported the man to St. Michael ’s Hospital in critical condition , said EMS duty officer Dave Viljak .
The man ’s name and age are unknown .
The march , led by pot advocate Marc Emery , kicked off around 2 p.m. with the masses converging on Queen ’s Park about an hour later .
“ This is my 12th year in a row going , ” said attendee Dave Toms , 27 .
“ Last year there were 20,000 people and this year there are even more . ”
Organizers estimated the size of the march at about 40,000 people .
Toms , who spends his days working in an office and his nights drumming for a band , does n’t smoke pot anymore but still supports the cause .
“ If it was legal , that money could used for hospitals not gang bangers and guns , ” he said .
“ I have n't heard any pro-prohibition argument that stands up against logic . ”
In addition to hippies , everyone from hip hoppers , parents with children and elderly retirees attended the march , Toms said .
" It 's an all - encompassing group , ” he said .
The march was peaceful and police did n’t interfere , remaining around the periphery and keeping marchers separate from traffic .
Emery , the self - proclaimed Prince of Pot and founder of the Marijuana Party , is facing a five - year prison term in the U.S. after pleading guilty last year to selling marijuana seeds through the mail .
He is due to surrender himself to U.S. authorities this month .
The Bay City Times ' Michael Wayland penned an article today regarding Pat Verbeek 's involvement in helping people with disabilities package his " Reek - Out " equipment disinfectant spray , and he's got a few other business interests in the area ... Verbeek 's much more settled in Detroit and would have to get a fantastic offer to leave the Wings .

George Monbiot is right to tell biochar enthusiasts to calm down .
Some of us have been guilty of febrile proselytising for this most unlikely scheme for geo-engineering .
It is often thus : it is only after a period of reflection and assessment that some of the disadvantages of a new weapon against climate change become apparent .
Nevertheless in his eagerness to get us to tone down our enthusiasm he goes too far .
Biochar is a useful and important way to help reduce atmospheric concentrations of CO2 .
First of all , let 's ask why small knots of dedicated people have been focusing on biochar for the past five or 10 years .
Biochar looks as if it is a cheap and highly beneficial way of disrupting the global carbon cycle .
As plants grow , they naturally absorb carbon dioxide , only to give it back as they die and then rot away .
Huge volumes of carbon are continuously moving between the soil , plants and the atmosphere , dwarfing the emissions from the burning of fossil fuels .
If instead of letting plant matter rot , it is turned into charcoal which is almost pure carbon and stable for many centuries , we are reducing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 .
No one disputes the basic science , even George .
If we can get this to work on a large scale , we can make a significant difference to greenhouse gas levels .
We will have to take the organic outputs of large areas of land in order to achieve this and Monbiot is right to express horrified disbelief at some of the figures that we have suggested .
Here we depart from the path of agreement .
Monbiot mentions but then ignores the other benefits of biochar .
These are at least as important as direct climate change mitigation .
First , soil dosed with charcoal can substantially improve agricultural productivity .
Food crops grow better .
Trees planted in biochar often have better root systems .
Crop yields are improved .
This means that we can provide food supplies for more people from a smaller area of land .
Growing bigger plants and trees , which are largely made from carbon , hydrogen and oxygen has a secondary effect of holding back CO2 that would otherwise be in the air .
It is another form of useful carbon sequestration , albeit a once - only gain , adding to the primary effect of storing charcoal in the soil .
The second effect of biochar is to reduce the emission of other greenhouse gases , such as nitrous oxide and methane , from the soil .
Thirdly , conventional fertilisers added to biochar appear to be much more effective and less likely to be washed away .
Biochar - dosed soil therefore maintains its fertility better .
No one argues that biochar 's effects are well understood .
Scientific investigation is only just beginning .
Next month sees the publication of Biochar for Environmental Management , a book edited by Johannes Lehmann and Stephen Joseph , two of the world 's pre-eminent scientific advocates of biochar .
This 400 - page book is not the work of gullible fools , it is a resolutely serious attempt to tell the world of the many uncertainties surrounding how best to make and apply biochar .
Its chapters on climate change mitigation are not an attempt to minimise the problems but rather to offer realistic and practical ways of utilising biochar 's beneficial properties for the good of the planet and its poorer people .
Yes , we do n't yet understand fully why biochar works but this is not an argument to ignore it or rule it out .
I challenge George to read the science in this book and then tell us whether he is quite so sceptical as he is today .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Upward revisions to earnings estimates for the S&P 500 SPX , +0.82 % have been overly optimistic , said Adam Parker , chief investment strategist at BernsteinResearch , in a report Tuesday .
Consensus estimates for 2010 imply 30 % growth in earnings per share to $ 82 a share in 2010 , and 18 % growth to $ 97 a share in 2011 .
In contrast , Parker predicts 25 % EPS growth for 2010 , to $ 79 a share , and 9 % growth in 2011 to $ 86 a share .
" Our view is that the EPS estimates embedded in consensus are too high for 2011 and perhaps for the second half of this year , " wrote Parker .
The " record pace " of upward revisions has fueled too much optimism , he said .
" The challenge is that you will likely not see any evidence of this in the first half of the year , " he said .
He recommended owning companies with lower EPS growth expectations .

It 's a step into Bizarro World when Bill O'Reilly becomes a voice of sanity and defense of President Obama .
He even valiantly tries to drag Crazy Michelle Bachmann with him to a place where anything the President does is n't met with instantaneous reactionary obstructionism .
Bachmann has been out everywhere she can , pushing the GOP meme that the BP escrow fund is Obama " shaking down " and " extorting " BP by demanding that an escrow fund be put up .
Watch as Billo asks who else is in a position to do so and Bachmann has to step back into reality , if only momentarily .
Ever so deftly , O'Reilly deftly redirects Bachmann to back pedal on her criticism back to a level where she almost sounds reasonable .
Suddenly , her only concern is that the administrator of the escrow fund not be politically motivated and get the funds to the people as soon as possible .
Well , Michelle , done and done .
But I do have one fairly large reality - based quibble with the both of them : there 's no way that $ 20 billion is going to make things " whole " again .
That ship is sailed .
The only thing that we can do right now is to make sure we do n't have another catastrophe like this by tightening up regulations , enforcing them consistently and preferably , ending deep sea drilling altogether .
International expansion of the iPhone is the single most important driver of Apple stock in 2010 , with overseas sales predicted to account for 80 percent of all of the company 's handset sales by the end of 2010 , one analyst believes .
Brian Marshall with Gleacher & Company ( formerly Broadpoint AmTech ) issued a note to investors Wednesday , in which he increased his 2010 iPad sales estimates to 12 million in calendar year 2010 , and 20 million in 2011 .
And while those figures are astounding for a new product cateogry , the analyst said that the iPhone is still in the " driver 's seat " for Apple .
That 's because Apple 's international carrier partners offer a postpaid subscriber base more than six times larger than AT&T , the exclusive wireless carrier of the iPhone in the U.S. Despite that , international sales in calendar year 2009 represented only 60 percent of total units sold .
Out of 65.1 million potential postpaid subscribers in the U.S. , Apple has a market penetration of 4.1 percent .
Overseas , with its 150 carrier partners , Apple could access 460.7 million subscribers , but it only had a penetration of 1.3 percent as of March .
Marshall sees the international numbers growing even more by the end of 2010 , making overseas sales responsible for 80 percent of the iPhones sold this year .
He has " conservatively " estimated that the company will sell 40 million iPhones in calendar year 2010 , and another 50 million in 2011 .
To put the numbers in perspective , last quarter Apple sold 8.75 million iPhones in a three - month span , the best - ever quarter for iPhone sales .
To achieve 40 million in sales by the end of 2010 , Apple would need to far exceed those numbers .
Sales will no doubt be bolstered by this week 's launch of the iPhone 4 in the U.S. , France , Germany , the U.K and Japan .
Last week , Apple revealed that more than 600,000 handsets were preordered on the first day of availability .
While the iPhone remains the most important aspect of Apple 's business , the iPad represents a significant growing market , Marshall said .
On Tuesday , the company revealed that it sold 3 million iPads in the product 's first 80 days of availability .
" Amazingly , in its first quarter of introduction , we believe the iPad family will exceed $ 2 bil in revenue ( roughly 14 % of our estimate of $ 15.1 bil for AAPL 's total revenue in the June ' 10 quarter ) , " Marshall wrote .
" Recall it took the iPhone four quarters to cumulatively reach $ 2 bil+ in revenue . "
A new toilet from Niagara pioneers a radically new flush technology –and uses just half as much water as standard toilets .
Niagara Conservation has introduced a new toilet that ’s unlike anything on the market .
It uses passive “ vacuum - assist ” technology to deliver a very quiet , effective flush that consumes just 0.8 gallons ( 3.0 liters ) –making it , I believe , the most water - conserving of any flush toilet on the market .
Who knew there would be so many ways to flush a toilet !
While pressure - assist toilets use compressed air at the top of a sealed tank to push water through the flush valve at a high velocity ( achieving a very effective flush ) , the vacuum - assist Stealth toilet literally pulls the contents of the toilet bowl down the trapway from below .
Here ’s how it works :
After the toilet is flushed , water fills a special inner chamber that ’s hidden inside the conventional - looking toilet tank .
( In this respect , it is like a pressure - assist toilet –with its tank - within - a - tank that is filled from the bottom . )
As this inner chamber fills , though , air at the top is pushed down through a special transfer tube into the trapway , essentially creating a large air bubble between water in the toilet bowl and water in the sanitary trap near the base of the toilet ( see the first diagram ) .
This air bubble , which fills about 12 inches of the trapway , exerts a force on the water in the trapway , raising the water level in the toilet bowl to create a larger water spot ( water surface area ) than would be expected from a toilet using just 0.8 gallons per flush .
When the toilet is flushed , water exiting the inner chamber creates a vacuum–depressurizing the trapway .
This depressurization creates a suction force that pulls water from the toilet bowl into the trapway .
During the flush , the trapway is entirely filled with water , which cleans the fully glazed trapway .
The vacuum - assist flush mechanism helps the toilet effectively flush a significant quantity of waste using very little water .
Using the now - industry - standard Maximum - Performance ( MaP ) testing protocol , the Stealth toilet is rated at 600 grams , in both the round - front and elongated - front models .
This and other performance features have allowed the toilet to earn the EPA WaterSense label for high - efficiency toilets .
According to Cecilia Hayward , the marketing manager at Niagara , the toilet also passes all IAPMO requirements for toilets , including a requirement that waste be effectively moved 40 feet along the drainline when the toilet is flushed .
Pressure - assist toilets are popular , because the extra force on the flush does an excellent job at evacuating the toilet bowl and waste in it , and some of these toilets do so with just 1.0 gpf .
But pressure - assist toilets are louder than gravity - flush toilets , producing a characteristic “ whoosh ” during the flush .
To an unsuspecting user , they can be quite startling .
The vacuum - assist mechanism in the ( aptly named ) Stealth toilet avoids that noise .
According to Bill Gauley , P.Eng. , principal of Veritec Consulting in Mississauga , Ontario ( and the co-developer of the MaP testing protocol for toilets ) , “ it is no louder than any other gravity - flush toilet–and much quieter than a pressure - assist toilet . ”
According to Chris Hanson , who is president of AquaPro Solutions , a water products distribution company and director of the Aqua Environmental Resource Center , both in Ashville , North Carolina , the toilet performs even better in his own MaP tests –consistently removing 800 grams of test media .
He has one of the toilets that he ’s been testing off - and - on for about eight months , and the toilet has also been installed some of that time in the Resource Center–where it has worked without incident .
He told me that it ’s not only quieter than pressure - assist toilets , but also quieter than most gravity - flush toilets , including Niagara ’s own Flapperless toilet .
One issue to be aware of , according to Hanson , is that because so little water is used for the flush ( half the federal maximum ) , waste may not be conveyed as far as with toilets that have higher flush - volume .
He suggests installations where the “ horizontal run ” will be no more than about 20 feet , before reaching a vertical stack .
Regarding waste conveyance , Gauley said , “ I would not be concerned installing this toilet in any residential situation , though I would not recommend it at this time in non-residential installations . ”
The Niagara Stealth toilet was first introduced in a soft launch in the fall of 2009 , but the formal launch was at the Kitchen & Bath Industry Show ( KBIS ) in April 2009 .
The Stealth carries a manufacturer ’s suggested list price of $ 310 in the round - front model and $ 325 in the elongated front model .
The product is proving popular , according to Hayward , who estimates that up to 1,000 have already been sold .
In the U.S. Niagara is the exclusive manufacturer of toilets using this technology , while in Canada the same mechanism is used in Proficiency toilets made by Hennessy & Hinchcliffe ( the company that invented the Stealth flush technology as well as Niagara ’s Flapperless technology ) .
Hennessy & Hinchliffe and Niagara are business partners and collaborated on incorporating the Stealth technology into marketable toilets .

Image caption Opium trafficking provides the Taliban with much of its income
A new United Nations report says there has been a sharp rise in the number of drug addicts in Afghanistan .
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime report says that Afghanistan is now a major consumer of opium and its derivatives .
The report says almost 3 % of adults are addicted to heroin or opium , twice as many as five years ago .
This is one of the world 's highest rates of opiate addiction .
Afghanistan is the source of about 90 % of the world 's opium , the report says .
The head of UN Office on Drugs and Crime Antonio Maria Costa said many Afghans were taking drugs to ease the hardships of life , with parents in some areas even giving opium to their children .
The report said the number of regular opium users since 2005 has increased by 53 % , while the number of heroin users has risen by 140 % .
Treatment shortage
The survey also said there is a major shortage of drug treatment .
It said about a million Afghans - 8 % of the population - now abuse drugs including opiates , cannabis and tranquilisers .
Last year the UN said corruption , lawlessness and uncontrolled borders result in only 2 % of Afghan opiates being seized locally .
UN findings say an opium market worth $ 65 bn ( £ 39 bn ) funds global terrorism , caters to 15 million addicts and kills 100,000 people every year .

Because she lives with her husband , is a real lib , and could n’t possibly NOT have an influence on the way George thinks ( sort of ) on many topics - hence his failure as a President .
Bush and his father were always closet liberals and their wives were part of the problem .

Batteries might gain a boost in power capacity as a result of a new finding from researchers at MIT .
They found that using carbon nanotubes for one of the battery 's electrodes produced a significant increase -- up to tenfold -- in the amount of power it could deliver from a given weight of material , compared to a conventional lithium - ion battery .
Such electrodes might find applications in small portable devices , and with further research might also lead to improved batteries for larger , more power - hungry applications .
To produce the powerful new electrode material , the team used a layer - by - layer fabrication method , in which a base material is alternately dipped in solutions containing carbon nanotubes that have been treated with simple organic compounds that give them either a positive or negative net charge .
When these layers are alternated on a surface , they bond tightly together because of the complementary charges , making a stable and durable film .
The findings , by a team led by Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering Yang Shao - Horn , in collaboration with Bayer Chair Professor of Chemical Engineering Paula Hammond , are reported in a paper published June 20 in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
The lead authors are chemical engineering student Seung Woo Lee PhD '10 and postdoctoral researcher Naoaki Yabuuchi .
Batteries , such as the lithium - ion batteries widely used in portable electronics , are made up of three basic components : two electrodes ( called the anode , or negative electrode , and the cathode , or positive electrode ) separated by an electrolyte , an electrically conductive material through which charged particles , or ions , can move easily .
When these batteries are in use , positively charged lithium ions travel across the electrolyte to the cathode , producing an electric current ; when they are recharged , an external current causes these ions to move the opposite way , so they become embedded in the spaces in the porous material of the anode .
In the new battery electrode , carbon nanotubes -- a form of pure carbon in which sheets of carbon atoms are rolled up into tiny tubes -- " self - assemble " into a tightly bound structure that is porous at the nanometer scale ( billionths of a meter ) .
In addition , the carbon nanotubes have many oxygen groups on their surfaces , which can store a large number of lithium ions ; this enables carbon nanotubes for the first time to serve as the positive electrode in lithium batteries , instead of just the negative electrode .
This " electrostatic self - assembly " process is important , Hammond explains , because ordinarily carbon nanotubes on a surface tend to clump together in bundles , leaving fewer exposed surfaces to undergo reactions .
By incorporating organic molecules on the nanotubes , they assemble in a way that " has a high degree of porosity while having a great number of nanotubes present , " she says .
Lithium batteries with the new material demonstrate some of the advantages of both capacitors , which can produce very high power outputs in short bursts , and lithium batteries , which can provide lower power steadily for long periods , Lee says .
The energy output for a given weight of this new electrode material was shown to be five times greater than for conventional capacitors , and the total power delivery rate was 10 times that of lithium - ion batteries , the team says .
This performance can be attributed to good conduction of ions and electrons in the electrode , and efficient lithium storage on the surface of the nanotubes .
In addition to their high power output , the carbon nanotube electrodes showed very good stability over time .
After 1,000 cycles of charging and discharging a test battery , there was no detectable change in the material 's performance .
The electrodes the team produced had thicknesses up to a few microns , and the improvements in energy delivery only were seen at high - power output levels .
In future work , the team aims to produce thicker electrodes and extend the improved performance to low - power outputs as well , they say .
In its present form , the material might have applications for small , portable electronic devices , says Shao - Horn , but if the reported high power capability were demonstrated in a much thicker form -- with thicknesses of hundreds of microns rather than just a few -- it might eventually be suitable for other applications such as hybrid cars .
While the electrode material was produced by alternately dipping a substrate into two different solutions -- a relatively time - consuming process -- Hammond suggests that the process could be modified by instead spraying the alternate layers onto a moving ribbon of material , a technique now being developed in her lab .
This could eventually open the possibility of a continuous manufacturing process that could be scaled up to high volumes for commercial production , and could also be used to produce thicker electrodes with a greater power capacity .
" There is n't a real limit " on the potential thickness , Hammond says .
" The only limit is the time it takes to make the layers , " and the spraying technique can be up to 100 times faster than dipping , she says .
Lee says that while carbon nanotubes have been produced in limited quantities so far , a number of companies are currently gearing up for mass production of the material , which could help to make it a viable material for large - scale battery manufacturing .
North Korean leader Kim Jong-il " gives regular tactical advice during matches using mobile phones that are not visible to the naked eye , " the team 's manager Kim Jong - hun told ESPN Thursday .
The coach dutifully told the sports channel that Kim Jong - il developed the James - Bond technology himself .
In 2004 , the North Korean leader claimed to have invented the hamburger , which would make the invisible cell phone his latest invention , ABC quipped .
It also reported that cameras caught a contingent of North Korean supporters in the stands , but it was " not certain ... that any of those flag - waving fans were North Korean , " citing a Xinhua news agency report that 1,000 Chinese nationals were essentially rented by North Korea in May to sit in the stands and cheer .
The official Chinese news agency also reported that " the North Korean Sports Committee gave tickets to Chinese nationals , many of them actors and singers , to attend the event . "
Reuters reported that extra tickets were sold to Chinese nationals who wished to cheer for North Korea .
A tremendous amount of media attention focuses on World Cup underdog North Korea , which has made its appearance in the competition in 44 years , when it defeated Italy to make it to the quarter - final .
ABC reported that ace North Korean striker Jong Tae -se must visit the North Korean consulate in Tokyo to change his South Korean passport to a North Korean one each time he travels abroad to represent the communist country in a match .
ABC also reported that the North Korean team is training at a public South African gym while others opted for luxurious private facilities with advanced equipment .
With obesity becoming an epidemic among school - aged children in this country , a Georgia State University professor has found a link between overweight children and federal school nutrition programs .
Research reveals that children who eat lunch as part of the National School Lunch Program ( NSLP ) have an increased likelihood of becoming overweight , according to research co-authored by Rusty Tchernis , associate professor with Georgia State University 's Andrew Young School of Policy Studies .
The findings also show that the School Breakfast Program ( SBP ) is a " valuable tool in the current battle against childhood obesity , " according to the research .
" Overweight children are more likely to become obese adults , " Tchernis said .
" So the only way to reduce obesity is to prevent it from happening in children . "
The study , " School Nutrition Programs and the Incidence of Childhood Obesity , " will be published in the summer edition of The Journal of Human Resources .
The research -- co-authored also by Muna Husain and Daniel Millimet , both of Southern Methodist University -- was funded with a $ 200,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture through 2011 .
For the study , Tchernis and his co-authors analyzed the relationship between the SBP and the NSLP and obesity using data on over 13,500 primary school students .
Students were interviewed in kindergarten , first and third grades , and then again in later grades .
Other findings show that those who participate in both federal programs end up less heavy than those who do n't participate in either , or those who only eat lunch as part of NSLP .
The NSLP provides lunch to more than 30 million children every day in approximately 101,000 schools , with 17.5 million students receiving reduced price or free meals , according to the program 's website .
In recent years , some schools have banned soda as well as vending machines containing unhealthy snacks .
Many school districts also are considering measures that could impact the government 's program , using " Farm to School " programs .
" Some children do n't know how to peel oranges , " Tchernis said .
" It 's surprising how little children know about food . "
These are some of the most famous album covers ever made .
Probably everyone will recognize these pieces of art from The Beatles , Led Zeppelin , Nirvana , The Who and Pink Floyd .
But these images are not clear at all , this was due to copying according to Rolling Stone Magazine .
The slogan says the following : ‘ Copy on , and one day all these legendary albums will disappear .
And the great bands .
And all the gifted young musicians .
How are they supposed to make a living when everyone downloads their work for free ?’.

" This was not part of a terrorist attack , " said Deputy Commissioner of Police Paul Browne .
" He wanted to find a place in the tunnel where no one would find a body . "
Subway workers saw the man walking on the tracks between Brooklyn's Borough Hall station and the Bowling Green station in Manhattan at 5:30 a.m. ET , Cavitolo said .
They called police when they realized he was not an employee .
The man was carrying flares , water bottles , and a one - quart canister that contained sodium cyanide , he said .
Investigators believe he planned to drink the cyanide to kill himself , he said .
Browne said subway passengers were never in danger .
" Sodium cyanide does not have explosive capability , but is extremely toxic , especially when mixed with water , " he said .
The man had no contact with passengers , he added .
[ Posted at 12;15 p.m. ]
New York Police arrested a college student who they say carried cyanide and flares into a Manhattan subway Friday morning .
The 20 - year - old man , who was wearing a fake transit system vest , told police he planned to kill himself , New York Police Detective Joseph Cavitolo said .

A Septuagenarian is being held on $ 50,000 bail after being accused of telling a flight attendant in New York that he had a bomb in his carry - on luggage .
But the Chicago man says he was only making a joke .
Draco Slaughter , 75 , was ordered held on bail Monday at his arraignment in Suffolk County District Court .
His court - appointed attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf to a charge of reporting a false incident , a felony .
Wearing a red bowling shirt , Slaughter seemed anxious to tell District Court Judge William Ford what had happened , but his attorney cautioned him to remain silent during the proceeding .
Draco was arrested after Southwest Airlines Flight 373 from Chicago had arrived at about 2:35 p.m. Sunday at Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma , about 50 miles east of New York City .
As passengers were exiting the Boeing 737 , a flight attendant noticed a carry - on bag near the rear of the jetliner and asked those nearby if they knew its owner .
" I said it was mine and kidding I also said that there could be a bomb in there , " Draco said in his statement to police following his arrest .
He conceded the flight attendant immediately warned him he could be arrested for what he had said .
As he left the aircraft , he was met by security personnel , who took him into custody .
A two - hour search of the jetliner turned up nothing dangerous .
The plane was permitted to proceed to its final destination , West Palm Beach , Fla. , at about 5 p.m .
" We take this stuff very seriously , " MacArthur Airport Commissioner Teresa Rizzuto told reporters afterward .
Slaughter was represented Monday by an attorney for Legal Aid , which does not comment on pending cases .
A message left by The Associated Press at Slaughter 's Chicago home was not immediately returned .
Slaughter is due back in court on Friday .
If convicted , he could face up to seven years in prison .
Space art is a general term for art emerging from knowledge and ideas associated with outer space , both as a source of inspiration and as a means for visualizing and promoting space travel .
Whatever the stylistic path , the artist is generally attempting to communicate ideas somehow related to space , often including appreciation of the infinite variety and vastness which surrounds us .
In some cases , artists who consider themselves space artists use more than illustration and painting to communicate scientific discoveries or works depicting space ; a new breed of space artists work directly with space flight technology and scientists as an opportunity to expand the arts , humanities and cultural expression relative to space exploration .
The Cosmos contains many sources of visual inspiration that our growing abilities to gather and propagate has spread through the mass culture .
The first photographs of the entire Earth by satellites and manned Apollo missions brought a new sense of our world as an island in empty space and promoted ideas of the essential units of Humanity .
Photographs taken by explorers on the Moon shared the experience of being on another world .
The famous ‘ Pillars of Creation ’ Hubble Space Telescope and other Hubble photos often evoke intense responses from viewers , see for example Hubble ’s Planetary Nebula .
Perhaps such images provide modern audiences with fresh visions through which the religious awe invoked by the great murals in cathedrals of earlier centuries can be experienced anew .
When Maurice Smith , a former chief inspector of schools , ruled that it was OK for BNP members to teach our children , he exhibited an astonishing level of naivety about how racism works in the classroom .
That the then schools secretary Ed Balls chose to accept his advice was one of the most depressing examples of how the dying New Labour government showed it had completely forgotten why it was in power .
In reaching his decision , Smith had said that barring the BNP was " taking a very large sledgehammer to crack a minuscule nut " .
And he added : " The existing measures in place to protect children and young people from discrimination or political indoctrination are well - grounded , and comprehensive enough to mitigate the risk . "
Today his lack of understanding was exposed when Adam Walker , a teacher and BNP activist , was cleared by his profession 's watchdog of racial intolerance – despite using a school laptop to claim in an online forum that Britain was a " dumping ground for the filth of the third world " and lauding the BNP as " the only party who are making a stand and are prepared to protect the rights of citizens against the savage animals New Labour and Bliar [ sic ] are filling our communities with " .
The General Teaching Council 's three - member disciplinary panel said it was merely " troubled " by Walker 's postings but not convinced that his views suggested intolerance .
So , having had the judgment that it 's OK to have BNP members teaching our kids , it seems these extremists do n't even have to be quiet about their bigotry .
What exactly would it take for a deep - seated racist to be ruled unfit to teach ?
Is anything short of virulent racist abuse directed at a ethnic - minority pupil enough ?
Would it be rejected as cause if not caught on CCTV ?
This case blows a coach and horses through Smith 's argument that somehow the equal - opportunity policies in place at our schools would protect children from racists .
How can anyone expect someone like Walker to walk into class and give his black and Asian pupils the level of care and attention any parent has the right to expect ?
Yet that 's what the " existing measures " decree .
If Smith had any sense of decency , he would immediately repeal his earlier report – or at least ask to " review " it .
Likewise , Ed Balls should admit he was misguided .
Some chance .
Fortunately , though , there is hope that the new government will see sense .
When pressed on this matter while addressing a black pre-election audience , Tory leader David Cameron said : " I think being a member of the BNP and being a teacher is completely incompatible . "
He continued : " Any good headteacher would not have a member of the BNP within a hundred miles of a school .
They should be able to fire someone for that reason . "
Cameron , who was responding to a question by audience member Dotun Adebayo , recognised that this was not about the issue of free speech :
Walker , after all , who resigned after the incident in 2007 , is free to continue posting his vile comments online .
This is an issue about parents being able to leave their children at the school gates , in the charge of teachers , without the fear that they will be abused , humiliated , downgraded or disciplined because of their skin colour .
That is a fundamental right , and one which this new government must recognise clearly , and quickly .
Thousands queued for the opening of the Harry Potter theme park , where they were greeted by the films ' stars , including Daniel Radcliffe .
The Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened at the Universal Orlando Resort in Florida on Friday .
Universal Orlando spokesman Tom Schroder said 5,000 people were waiting to get in before the park opened .
Radcliffe said the park , based on JK Rowling 's hugely successful novels , was the " next part of the Potter legacy " .
Aerial photos showed thousands of people waiting to enter the park for the first time .
On Twitter and other forums , they joked that the park had become " Harry Potter and the Endless Line " .
The 20 - acre site includes rides , shops and reproductions of the fictitious village of Hogsmeade , the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the Hogwarts Express train .
Image caption Michael Gambon and Daniel Radcliffe met young fans at the park 's opening
" What Universal Orlando has done with Harry Potter is really , really fantastic , " said Radcliffe , who plays the schoolboy wizard , at the opening ceremony .
" We 're all kind of very grateful that the next part of the Harry Potter legacy has been so well done and so well made . "
Radcliffe was joined at the opening by fellow Potter actors Rupert Grint ( who plays Ron Weasley ) , Michael Gambon ( Albus Dumbledore ) , Warwick Davis ( Filius Flitwick ) , Bonnie Wright ( Ginny Weasley ) , Matthew Lewis ( Neville Longbottom ) , Tom Felton ( Draco Malfoy ) and James and Oliver Phelps ( Fred and George Weasley ) .
The park has two roller coasters and a ride which takes guests on a flight through Harry 's life , including encounters with Dementors and a dragon and projections of characters from the film .
Bill Davis , president of Universal Orlando Resort , said : " We have brought to life a cultural phenomenon that has captured the hearts and minds of millions of people around the world . "
Skiing accidents can be very dangerous in some cases .
It is fun but in there are number of incidents of skiing accidents every year .
There are many people in Toronto who ’re not aware of the fact that they have got several legal rights following an accident .
There exist a great number of injury lawyers in the city of Toronto who can help personal injury victims .
A person who gets involved into an accident not merely endures physical pain , he or she also goes through the financial pain and suffering as he or she cannot go to the job because of the injuries resulted by the accident .
Hence , a personal injury accident has broader impact on the life of the victims .
It influences them physically and financially .
In these kind of personal injury accidents , victims have to face a lot of troubles subsequent to the accident .
There are many individuals who take the advice of the lawyers to claim a compensation for a personal injury accident .
An injured person who seeks the advice of an injury lawyer about her or his legal rights , typically , has the updated knowledge .
Therefore , a Personal Injury Lawyer can play a necessary role in representing the victims in the court of law .
The death of Natasha Richardson has proved that the skiing can sometime be very dangerous .
A lot of people get hurt in skiing accidents in Canada but sometimes they do not consult with the experienced lawyer to see if you can file for a compensation claim .
Therefore , it is important that people should know the legal rights for the victims of skiing accidents .
A lot of people think that buying the insurance for the skiing accident is enough .
This is not true , as in case the skiing accident occurs aboard where there is no insurance coverage then hiring a Personal Injury Lawyer in Ontario will be the best choice .
The personal injury lawyer will have a network of medical practitioners and rehabilitation centers and he will immediately refer upon for a medical checkup .
On the other hand , the lawyer will also take care of all the legalities associated with attaining insurance coverage .
If there has been any serious injuries and the medical cost are very high , the insurance company would refuse to provide coverage for the expenses and you would be stranded and left alone to pay for your own medical bills .
In case the skiing accident occurred due to someone else ’s negligence , the lawyer will file a lawsuit against the individual .
Therefore , they end up in accidents that may have many serious consequences .
Even though the individual may not feel any pain at the time of the accident , but it is only after a medical examination , that the doctors will be able to ascertain if there have been any serious internal concussions .
The personal injury lawyer will make sure that you get justice and adequate compensation so that you are to pay for your medical bills as well as other expenses for all kinds of medical and emotional trauma
In short , a skiing accident may affect you physically as well as financially , and perhaps you file a compensation claim .
Speaking to a Personal Injury Lawyer will in fact be considerably valuable as there may be nothing to lose for you , as generally , they provide free consultation and tackle the case on no win no fee basis .
Moreover , you need to make sure that he or she possesses a extensive knowledge in representing the skiing accident victims .
Is Benjamin Netanyahu rational ?
The question has to be asked because Netanyahu , the leader of a country that is paranoid about its own security , controls a secret nuclear arsenal and has the capability to bomb just about anybody .
Rational behavior in the context of a head of state is admittedly an elusive quality , but it generally means that occasional lying is okay , particularly if it is tenuously based on something that might be true .
Lying with a straight face or completely evading critical questions might even be considered a perk of office .
But when the chips are down and hard decisions have to be made , a head of government should at least behave like a mature adult employing some logical process .
That would mean weighing up the plusses and minuses of various actions , risks versus gains , and coming up with a response that serves the country ’s interests with the least collateral damage possible .
Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu has not made very good decisions .
From Tel Aviv ’s point of view , it is absolutely essential that Israel maintain the support of the United States and also very important that it be regarded positively by the Europeans and Russia .
Yet Netanyahu has gone the opposite way , continuing to expand settlements even after the United States president has told him to stop , announcing new settlement growth to coincide with the arrival of the American vice president on a state visit , assassinating an Arab official using fake European passports , continuing the strangulation of Gaza for no good reason even when it is opposed by both the European Union and Washington , and engaging in an act of piracy on the high seas that resulted in the deaths of nine unarmed civilians , sticking his thumb in the eye of Israel ’s closest Muslim friend , Turkey .
A keen observer of the Netanyahu behavior might well detect a suicidal tendency , perhaps tied in some way to the well known Israeli Masada complex .
Masada was the first century A.D. site of the suicide of nearly one thousand Israelite zealots who refused to surrender to the Roman army .
More recently , in 1991 investigative journalist Seymour Hersh reported on the modern version of Masada called the Samson Option , in which Israel was planning to use nuclear weapons to destroy most of the Middle East if it were in danger of being overrun .
Today hardliners have similarly warned that if Israel is threatened with destruction it will take the whole Mideast region down with it and possibly also nuke selected European capitals .
So the idea of a mass national suicide leading to destruction of substantial parts of the world in one great conflagration is definitely floating out there in Israeli extremist circles .
Christian supporters of Israel have also picked up on the end - of - days theme and are referred to as Armageddonists , signaling their embrace of a final world - ending battle preceding a rapture up to heaven and the second coming of Christ .
The neoconservatives frequently complain that Islam is not a " religion of peace , " but the Old Testament is also a bloody book , including as it does many accounts of the Israelites massacring their enemies with God ’s blessing .
There are also elements of the Jewish religion that are dark and lend themselves to a mindset that accepts one standard for Jews and another for gentiles .
The very concept of being one of a " chosen people " can be interpreted positively by observing that God had selected the Jewish people to be his witness and bear his message , but it can also be turned on its head to imply that those who are not chosen are somehow inferior .
Being selected by God has also been used to support the Israeli claim to the land that they have stolen from the Palestinians , a line that has inevitably been parroted by the Christians United for Israel and other evangelical groups in the US .
The current Israeli government is the most hard - line and intransigent in the history of the country and it has a nasty , racist edge to it .
Netanyahu has regularly played the race card , once praising the cutting of social benefits in Israel so the country ’s Arab minority will be unable to have so many children .
His Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman is an out - and - out racist fearmonger who has openly advocated executing Arab members of the Knesset and drowning Palestinian prisoners in the Dead Sea .
At one time he called for bombing the Aswan dam to punish Egypt for supporting the Palestinians .
Lieberman demanded recently that Christian and Muslim Arab residents of Israel swear a loyalty oath to Israel as a Jewish state or face expulsion .
The insistence that Israel is and should be a Jewish state means that it cannot be democratic as it is making full legal rights contingent on religion , not on a concept of citizenship .
Lieberman ’s proposal was widely seen as an attempt to ethnically cleanse Israel ’s Arab minority , forcing them to leave the country completely .
Ironically , while Lieberman works assiduously to remove Arabs born and raised in Israel and Palestine he himself was born in the Soviet Union and did not move to Israel until he was 20 years old .
Netanyahu has demonstrated that he will not hesitate to shed the blood of foreigners , to defend his country even when the threat is not viewed by most observers as warranting such an extreme response .
He regularly threatens the Iranians , up to and including nuclear incineration carried out by a cruise missile - bearing submarine which is reported to be parked off the Iranian coast .
The problem with Netanyahu ’s threats and the thinking behind them is that the Jewish holy book the Talmud contains a number of passages that suggest that it is all right to kill a non-Jew .
The meaning of the text has been disputed and sometimes challenged on the basis of context or relevancy and there are other sections that suggest that Judaism does not see itself in exclusionary terms , but the passages in question undeniably imply that killing a gentile is not the same as killing a Jew .
And some other disputed sections of the Talmud also suggest that while telling falsehoods is a sin it is all right and even praiseworthy to tell lies to gentiles or to do things deliberately to harm them .
Recognizing that it undoubtedly makes many people uncomfortable to cite the bloodthirstiness of the Old Testament and Talmud , it must be observed that virtually all American and European Jews would rightly laugh at the notion that they are a people chosen by God that authorizes special rights and privileges vis -à - vis their fellow citizens .
Nearly all would agree that lying or murdering someone is always wrong .
But other attitudes appear to prevail in Israel where there is most definitely a different perspective .
To those who are skeptical about how religion bolsters jingoism , one need only look at reports that Israeli Army rabbis for the first time were seen exhorting front line troops during the 2009 invasion of Gaza .
The army rabbinate also issued pamphlets advising " When you show mercy to a cruel enemy , you are being cruel to pure and honest soldiers …
This is a war on murderers . "
More recently , the Israeli commando who reportedly shot dead six unarmed Turks on board the Gaza bound Mavi Marmara has reportedly been recommended for a medal .
Many Israelis excuse brutality towards the Palestinians based on a divine dispensation , God ’s will to create a Greater Israel and cleanse it of followers of other faiths .
Combined with an in - your - face nationalism that feeds off of a siege mentality , it is a sentiment that has been growing stronger over the past few years demographically as religious conservatives out - reproduce their politically more liberal counterparts .
Many moderate Israelis have also become concernedthat the army officer ranks are increasingly being filled by Jewish fundamentalists and settlers who believe in Israel ’s divine mission .
Netanyahu is a product of his environment , education , and culture and one can reasonably ask what drives him .
The question is important because if his inner demons reinforced by a sense of ethnic entitlement and racial superiority are in control , he can not be trusted at all , in anything that he says .
And it could have dire consequences for the United States , suggesting that Netanyahu will behave ideologically and culturally rather than rationally and will unhesitatingly draw Washington into a war with Iran , a conflict in which the US will have to pay much the heavier price both in treasure and in lives .
So it is important to know what Bibi Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman as well as some of their extremist colleagues in government actually believe .
Do they believe that they are racially or by the grace of God better or more entitled than their Arab neighbors or their American patrons ?
Do they think that the killing of gentiles is less wrong than killing a Jew ?
Do they believe that lying constantly is acceptable because the lies are directed at the gentile population , not to deceive coreligionists ?
Based on recent evidence , lying to the gentiles certainly appears to be the hallmark of the Israeli government response to the Gaza flotilla massacre .
The Israelis have fabricated information and even two videos , contrived a manifestly false narrative , and lied at every step along the way , ignoring eyewitness accounts and calling their unfortunate victims aggressors and " al - Qaeda mercenaries . "
Unfortunately the arrogance of Bibi Netanyahu and the behavior of the Israeli government would seem to suggest strongly a belief in a manifest destiny granted by God .
Israel is prepared to charge recklessly ahead to do whatever it takes to intimidate and instill fear among all its neighbors .
Tel Aviv wants to be a combination of a mad dog and the school bully , suggesting that its contempt for Washington made evident in the Lavon Affair and the attempted sinking of the USS Liberty in 1967 was the rule rather than the exception and could easily happen again .
And Israel appears to have little concern about doing whatever is necessary to drag the United States down with it if that is what is required .
It is we Americans who should be fearful .
Each American should be very concerned about what Bibi is actually thinking , particularly as our Congress and media have already been bought and occupied and we have a president who is so unsure of the support of his own party that he is afraid to face down an Israeli prime minister .
The government 's safety watchdog is cracking down on Britain 's biggest and oldest nuclear complex after a series of radioactive leaks and safety blunders , despite private sector managers receiving multimillion - pound " performance - related " payments from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority .
The Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) has closed down a vital nuclear waste plant at Sellafield in Cumbria , and is taking legal action to force the site 's operators to improve their flawed safety procedures .
The HSE has also rejected a £ 40bn plan for cleaning up Sellafield because of proposed delays in dismantling ageing and potentially hazardous facilities .
The disclosures come at a critical time for the nuclear industry which is trying to convince Chris Huhne , the energy and climate change secretary , it is efficient enough to build a new generation of reactors .
But the crackdown is also embarrassing because Nuclear Management Partners ( NMP ) – a consortium involving Amec , URS and Areva – is believed to have made " profits " of up to £ 50 m over a 12 - month period .
NMP took over control of Sellafield in November 2008 and was given the opportunity to win incentive payments if it improved the efficiency of Europe 's biggest atomic site over the first 12 months .
A spokesman for Amec confirmed " fees were paid " but said he was unable to give further details .
The decommissioning agency said the private companies had received £ 16.5 m for the first four months of their work but it said figures for the last financial year would be published in July .
It said the maximum under the contract could be £ 50 m – in line with £ 16.5 m for four months – and independent industry experts believe NMP won close to that top figure .
The HSE 's latest report on Sellafield , posted online , discloses a litany of problems at the crowded site which sprawls over six square miles on the edge of the Lake District and is home to more than a thousand nuclear facilities , some dating back more than 50 years .
One of the main plants for solidifying highly radioactive liquid waste has been shut for safety reasons since 31 March , the report said .
The case for continuing to operate the facility safely has been deemed " inadequate " by HSE inspectors .
According to the report , HSE has also taken enforcement action after cooling water needed to prevent highly radioactive waste tanks from overheating leaked twice in 10 months .
Sellafield has been ordered to rectify an alleged breach of its safety licence – failing to give staff proper training – by 18 June .
HSE has taken further regulatory action over a leak of radioactively contaminated water from a pipe during nuclear fuel reprocessing operations .
Along with another government watchdog , the Environment Agency , it has ordered Sellafield to correct breaches of radiation rules that enabled the leakage to occur .
The HSE report , which covers the first three months of this year , revealed there had been two other leaks in evaporators which process " highly active liquor " .
Sellafield is also criticised for taking more than 18 months to fix " known defects " with the fire protection systems at the thermal oxide reprocessing plant .
The HSE said the site will fail to meet a deadline of 1 August for clearing radioactive sludge out of old ponds and repackaging it into steel containers .
The watchdog also has " concerns " about the management of change on the part of the site still known as Windscale .
In addition , HSE has refused to endorse the latest " lifetime plan " for Sellafield outlining schedules for decommissioning plants over the next 110 years .
" It will not be a plan we can accept , " its report said , because of worries about the " deferral dates for some facilities " .
Sellafield is home to " the world 's most dangerous stockpile of high - level liquid waste , " according to Marianne Birkby , from the anti-nuclear group , Radiation Free Lakeland .
" The evidence shows the industry cannot safely look after its existing wastes . "
Sellafield Ltd , the company that runs the site , conceded there were " challenges " due to " ageing facilities and assets " .
" The new NMP team has been specifically brought in to improve on the historic record and is already delivering significant improvements and results , " said a company spokesman .
The site has been given £ 1.5 bn this year – its highest level of funding to date – to reduce the hazards .
The spokesman added : " We have a clear focus on hazard and risk reduction on the site and have prioritised our significant resources at those areas that present the most difficult challenges . "
The HSE said it will continue to highlight problems at Sellafield .
" Our inspectors closely regulate operations on the site and on occasion where required will take enforcement action , " said an HSE spokeswoman .
" We are satisfied that Sellafield Ltd recognises , and is taking steps to effectively manage the risks and hazards on the site . "
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) -- " Transformers " actress Megan Fox said " yes " to ex-fiance Brian Austin Green 's marriage proposal , just four months after calling off a two - year engagement with Green , her publicist confirmed .
Fox , 24 , was so excited when Green , 36 , popped the question on a Hawaii beach that she dropped the 2 - carat diamond engagement ring into the sand , Us Weekly magazine reported .
Despite a lengthy search by hotel staffers , the ring was never found , the magazine reported .
Fox and Green began dating six years ago and became engaged for the first time in 2007 .
They broke it off last February .
Marriage may be easier for Fox now that she 's out of the " Transformers " franchise .
Director Michael Bay announced this month that she is being replaced as Shia LaBeouf 's love interest by model - actress Rosie Huntington - Whiteley for " Transformers 3 . "
Fox portrayed Mikaela Banes in the first " Transformers " and its sequel " Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen . "
Green spent a decade playing David Silver on the hit TV series " Beverly Hills , 90210 " until it was canceled in 2000 .

Many in the entertainment industry have spoken out about the devastation caused by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , and a few have offered to help , but actor Kevin Costner has spearheaded the development of a machine that can separate the spilled oil from the water , and oil giant BP is testing it .
Although an initial test of the machine failed , Costner said adjustments were made and the device works as it should .
Costner has spent the past 15 years and more than $ 20 million of his own money into developing the oil separator , a powerful centrifuge that he claims can separate oil from water and dump the oil into a holding tank , leaving the water 99 percent clean of crude .
Costner told " Good Morning America " anchor Sam Champion that he became inspired to work on the device after watching coverage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill .
That spill occurred off the coast of Alaska when the supertanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef in 1989 .
Approximately 11 million gallons of oil spilled into Prince William Sound , causing widespread harm to the local wildlife , environment and economy .

Actor Inspired by Exxon Valdez Spill Images
" When I saw everyone on the shore with rubber boots and pitch fork , trying to clean up the problem that they did n't create , you know , the images of the birds , it was all very sad , " the " Field of Dreams " star said , speaking of the devastating effects of the Exxon Valdez spill .
In the interview that today on " Good Morning America , " he added : " So I went ahead and said , ' does this have to happen ? ' "
Costner started his own company , Costner Industries , and bought the patent for the technology .
" If 20 of my V20s would have been at the Exxon Valdez , 90 percent of that oil would have been cleaned up within the week , " he said , referring to one of the models of the oil separators .
The devices , which can be taken to the spill site via barges , come in different sizes .
The largest can clean water at a rate of 200 gallons per minute , according to the firm .
Depending on the water - to - oil ratio , the devices are capable of extracting 2,000 barrels of oil per day from the gulf .
The actor and representatives of Ocean Therapy Solutions , the firm that developed the machine , demonstrated the centrifugal device for BP officials in New Orleans last month .
Initial Tests of Machine Failed
" The machines are basically sophisticated centrifuge devices that can handle a huge volume of water and separate at unprecedented rates , " said Ocean Therapy Solutions CEO John Houghtaling .
" They were developed from older centrifuge technology .
Normal centrifuge machines are very slow and sensitive to different ratios of oil to water mixtures at intake . "
BP is currently testing the machines .
During the initial test , the machine failed to work because the oil had been transformed to a peanut butter - like thickness due to the effects of the dispersants .
The machines were then adjusted to handle the thick consistency , and now they work as intended , Costner 's publicist said .
Costner hopes the machine will be headed to the Gulf soon .
BP has been struggling to stop a torrent of oil pouring into the gulf since an underwater explosion sank the Deepwater Horizon drill rig in April , killing 11 rig workers and creating an unprecedented environmental catastrophe .
Costner is confident the oil separator can make a difference , but says for the past 12 years he 's been frustrated by the government 's and oil companies ' lack of interest in his and other technologies .
Costner : BP Ordered 32 Machines
In testimony before the Congress last week , Costner acknowledged the improbability of his involvement .
" It may seem like an unlikely scenario that I am the one delivering this technology at this moment in time , but from where I 'm sitting , it is equally inconceivable that these machines are not already in place , " he said .
Pointing out that oil was already " a very big part of American life , " he said there has to be a responsible way to deal with the inevitable consequences of such dependence .
He said the oil separator represents an opportunity to be proactive in the face of future spills .
" It represents maybe an opportunity for an industry to go back to work .
If we can show that there 's a responsible answer to an inevitable problem .
This little life preserver , this machine … this could be a pivot point … , " he said .
Costner said BP had ordered 32 of the machines .
While he acknowledged that a great deal of damage had already been done in the Gulf , he said the machines could still mitigate much of the problem .
" It 's not too late … That oil 's going to keep coming towards those people .
That well has not stopped .
So we have to be out at the source , sucking it up … I mean , we have to treat it a little bit like war , " he said .
" We mustered logistically everything we had to get the beaches of Normandy .
We have to muster everything we can to keep it from hitting our beaches . "
' I've Got a Life Preserver '
It 's personal to Costner , who can see an oil rig off the shore of his Carpinteria , Calif. , home , where schools of dolphins often swim by .
" I 'm not a spokesman for anybody … but the ecosystem can't speak for itself , " he said .
" I 'm not a spokesman except for the fishermen who … can't speak for themselves .
They 're wondering where an answer is .
" And I 'm not a white horse .
I 'm not on a white horse .
I 'm not the savior to this thing .
But I 'm kind of saying , I 've got a life preserver . "

See UPDATE below .
Thanks Tamino
This is a personal note .
I ’m not accepting comments .
Today my life and my office was disrupted by the unannounced and uninvited presence of a person who seems to be convinced that I ’m in the employ of “ big oil ” ( I ’m not ) and that my opinions and the opinions of others here is so wrong , that this person must take up a crusade against me .
Imagine if you will , the screaming , accusations , and threats that would be leveled against me if I showed up unannounced on Joe Romm ’s doorstep , or maybe at “ Tamino ’s ” house , or what would be said if visited “ Eli Rabbet ” at his university without an invitation ?
I ’d be labeled a stalker , or worse .
Climate bloggers would have a collective “ cow ” .
I ’m writing this in hopes that the person can see their own behavior as being wrong , by illustrating how it would look if the tables were turned .
This person has been advised previously that I ’m not interested in having a conversation .
This stems from previous behavior in the person ’s home town where the person has been harassing others on the issue of climate change , making uninvited visits to offices , showing up at local service organization meetings to accost a person with whom a disagreement exists , interrupting conversations with friends at restaurants , and making phone calls to the homes of people with which a disagreement exists over climate change .
Today , the person continued to ask questions while I was making it clear that the person was to leave the premises .
I never heard a one because I was being talked over while repeatedly saying “ goodbye ” while gesturing to the door .
I respect the right of disagreement that others have , but I have no respect for a person who invades the personal space and boundaries of people with who that disagreement exists for the purpose of making a scene to write about later .
This is not cool .
It is not respectable or proper behavior .
It will not be tolerated again .
We can disagree about climate , we can hurl insults back and forth across the ether , and we can write essays .
All that is fair game .
The moment somebody abandons those forums to invade my personal property , especially after it has been made clear previously , that you are unwelcome , well , that ’s a game changer .
– Anthony Watts
UPDATE : Tamino agrees .
My thanks to him for reiterating what we all hold dear as Americans , free speech and privacy of our homes and business .
– Anthony
UPDATE2 : Lucia agrees .
And I ’ll point out that while I did not identify the person here , she has self identified elsewhere while “ playing the victim ” .
The whole purpose of her visit was to make a scene so she could do this , and she has .
I had been forewarned by others who had been on the receiving end of these antics in her home town , which is why I do n’t care to have a conversation .
There ’s nothing to be gained .
– Anthony

Attorney General Eric Holder just launched criminal and civil investigations against BP .
From DOJ :
What we saw this morning was oil for miles and miles .
Oil that we know has already affected plant and animal life along the coast , and has impacted the lives and livelihoods of all too many in this region .
This disaster is nothing less than a tragedy .
There is one thing I will not let be forgotten in this incident :
In addition to the extensive costs being borne by our environment and by communities along the Gulf Coast , the initial explosion and fire also took the lives of 11 rig workers .
Eleven innocent lives lost .
As we examine the causes of the explosion and subsequent spill , I want to assure the American people that we will not forget the price those workers paid .
BP is already facing thousand of private suits in what could easily be the biggest case in US history .
Any criminal convictions would lead to a massive increase liability .
Prosecutors in a criminal case can seek twice the cost of environmental and economic damages resulting from the spill .
Without criminal convictions , spill liability is limited to a 1 - to - 1 damage ratio .
Ouch .

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission took a first step toward imposing limited regulations on broadband providers by voting Thursday to launch a notice of inquiry exploring the change .
The commission voted 3 - 2 to launch the notice of inquiry , or NOI , with its two Republicans voting against the proceeding .
The NOI asks for public comment on a proposal by FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski to reclassify broadband as a common - carrier regulated service .
Genachowki's proposal follows a court case earlier this year that cast doubt on the agency 's authority over broadband providers .
Under the plan , the FCC would refrain from most common - carrier regulations under Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 .
Without reclassification , the FCC would likely not be able to create network neutrality rules , protect broadband customers ' privacy , or redirect telephone subsidies to broadband deployment , Genachowski said .
The limited application of common - carrier rules is a " narrow and tailored " approach that rejects the extremes abandoning FCC oversight of broadband or applying all Title II rules to the service , he said .
" My desire is simply that we restore the status quo and have a workable , light - touch framework for broadband access , " he said .
" My core focus is on achieving vital national broadband goals to spur investment , innovation , and our global competitiveness . "
The notice of inquiry , or NOI , is a preliminary step toward creating new FCC policy .
Under the NOI , the FCC will seek public comment on reclassifying broadband , and the agency would have to launch a lengthy rulemaking proceeding before reclassifying broadband as a regulated service .
Genachowski said he has no deadline for competing a rulemaking proceeding .
In addition to Genechowski's proposal to apply limited Title II regulations to broadband transport service , the NOI also asks whether the commission should make no changes , and try to rule on broadband provider actions on a case - by - case basis , or whether it should apply all common - carrier rules to broadband .
There are pros and cons to any approach , Genachowski said .
" This is not an easy issue , or one without complexity .
I remain open - minded ; I welcome the possibility of new ideas . "
Republican Commissioner Robert McDowell suggested that new regulation would slow investment in the broadband industry .
There 's been a broad consensus among U.S. policymakers for years that broadband should be lightly regulated , and Genachowki's proposal would upset that long - standing model , he said .
Genachowski's plan would tie broadband to monopoly - busting regulations dating to the late 1800s , McDowell said .
" The commission is seeking to impose 19th century - style regulations designed for monopolies on competitive , dynamic and complex 21st century Internet technologies , " he said .
A move toward broadband regulation by the FCC could also embolden tyrannical governments to impose their own limits on the Internet , McDowell said .
" In short , we will have lost the moral high ground , " he said .
Genachowski and other Democrats disputed predictions that limited regulations would deter investment .
For years , the U.S. mobile phone industry has been subject to limited regulations similar to those proposed by Genachowski and has seen explosive growth , the chairman said .
The FCC classified cable modem broadband service as a mostly unregulated information service in 2002 .
The agency then classified DSL as an information service in 2005 .
Commissioner Michael Copps , a Democrat , criticized Republican - controlled commissions from the past decade for abandoning their responsibilities to protect broadband customers .
" I , for one , am worried about relying only on the good will of a few powerful companies to achieve this country 's broadband hopes and dreams , " he said .
" We see what price can be paid when critical industries operate with unfettered control and without reasonable and meaningful oversight .
Look no further than the banking industry 's role in precipitating the recent financial meltdown or turn on your TV and watch what is taking place right now in the Gulf of Mexico . "
Suggestions by opponents of Genachowski's reclassification plan that the commission regulate broadband on a case - by - base basis do n't make sense after the April ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , he said .
The court ruled that the agency did n't have the authority to enforce informal network neutrality rules in a case involving Comcast 's throttling of some peer - to - peer traffic .
" Case - by - case inevitably becomes court case - by - court case , " Copps said .
" Down this path would be years and years of dead - end delays , years without the most elemental public interest safeguards for broadband , and years of agency paralysis .
It would be death by a thousand cuts . "
Response to the FCC 's vote was immediate .
More than 280 of the 535 members of Congress have expressed concerns about reclassifying broadband , noted Tom Tauke , executive vice president for public affairs , policy and communications at Verizon Communications .
The FCC should allow Congress to address any issues raised in the Comcast case , he said .
" Reclassifying high - speed broadband Internet service as a telecom service is a terrible idea , " Tauke said in a statement .
" The negative consequences for online users and the Internet ecosystem would be severe and have ramifications for decades .
It is difficult to understand why the FCC continues to consider this option . "
The FCC , by reclassifying broadband , could kill one of the " great deregulatory success stories " of recent history , added Adam Thierer , president of the Progress and Freedom Foundation , a free - market think tank .
" Chairman Genachowski's FCC continues to flaunt the rule of law and magically invent its own authority as it goes along , " he said .
" If this chairman wants to bring the ' Net under his thumb and regulate broadband networks like plain - vanilla public utilities , he should ask Congress for the authority to pursue such imperial ambitions .
As the law stands today , the FCC has no such authority . "
Consumer and digital rights group Public Knowledge praised the FCC vote .
" The Federal Communications Commission acted with uncommon courage today to make certain that everyone in the U.S. has a chance to participate in the 21st century economy and that consumers are protected from abuses by large telecommunications companies , " said Gigi Sohn , Public Knowledge 's president .
" The commission 's simple , uncomplicated action today makes certain that the expert agency in telecommunications has the authority to carry out its mission . "

The genome of Neandertals was just sequenced ( reference below ) .
For those who do n’t want to plow through the long ( but informative ! ) explanatory posts about the Neandertal genome that have appeared on several science websites , here ’s a quick guide :
What ’s the deal ?
A large group of scientists from several countries have determined the DNA sequence of most of the Neandertal genome .

Is it “ Neandertal ” or “ Neanderthal ” ?
Either is correct .
“ Neanderthal ” is most common but the new Science paper uses “ Neandertal . ”
The name is taken from the German “ Neander Tal ” , or “ Neander Valley , ” where the first bones of these individuals were found .

So who were Neandertals ?
They were an extinct group of humans who lived in Europe from about 400,000 years ago until about 30,000 years ago , when they seem to have gone extinct without leaving any descendants .
Their lineage diverged from that of all modern humans several hundred thousand years ago , so they were not our direct ancestors .
Our real ancestors appear to have spread out from Africa to Europe and Asia in a migration event beginning about 100,000 years ago .
Current Biology published a nice “ quick guide ” to Neandertals in 2006 .

Were they members of species different from ours ?
Neandertals are usually classified as being a subspecies of ours , Homo sapiens neanderthalensis , so they ’re usually considered members of our own species .
Most biologists regard species as groups that are not capable of exchanging genes with other such groups .
Since Neandertals now appear to have hybridized with “ modern ” H. sapiens and produced fertile offspring , this might suggest that they ’re in our species .
My own species concept , however , allows for some small amounts of gene flow between species , and given the low level of gene exchange between the two groups and the fact that they appear to have lived side by side in several areas without fusing into one species , I ’d say that Neandertals were members of a different species , or at least of an “ incipient ” species .
This is to some extent a semantic issue .
The two groups may have had cultural aversions to cross-mating , which count as “ reproductive isolating barriers ” similar to those separating species of birds who do n’t hybridize because they have different appearances or songs .

What about their genome ?
Sequencing the genome of this group is a stupendous achievement .
The workers took DNA from the bones of three individuals ( all females ) from a cave in Croatia ; these females lived about 40,000 years ago .
Although the DNA extracted from their bones was highly contaminated with bacterial DNA and slightly contaminated with modern human DNA , the researchers managed , with many controls , to sort out the Neandertal DNA and sequence it .
Good sequence was obtained for about 2/3 of the genome , and was compared to sequences from modern humans living in Africa ( 2 samples ) , France , China , and Papua New Guinea .

What does the DNA show ?
First , that Neandertals seem to be a bit older than we thought : their lineage diverged from ours about 825,000 years ago ( this is a very rough estimate based on a “ molecular clock ” ) .
Second , there are some interesting genes that appear to have evolved faster in our lineage than in the Neandertal lineage ( we can tell this because we can compare both genomes to that from our closest living relatives , chimps ) .
These 78 faster - human genes include those involved in skin pigmentation , sweat glands , sperm motility , as well as genes that , in modern humans , carry mutations associated with Down syndrome and schizophrenia .
Perhaps selection leading to modern humans , then , acted on skin traits and cognitive abilities .

What else ?
The finding that has gotten the most attention is that some “ old ” genes from Neandertals still persist in human populations .
These shared human - Neandertal genes are found in the French , New Guinea , and Asian samples of modern humans but not in the African ones .

What does this DNA sharing mean ?
Most likely that there was some hybridization between Neandertals and “ modern ” humans after our ancestors left Africa but before they had spread throughout Asia and the Pacific .
In other words , the genome of those modern humans not from Africa carries a trace ( about 1 % - 4 % ) of DNA that “ introgressed ” from Neandertals .
This is surprising because , based on earlier sequencing work of Neandertal DNA from the cellular organelle mitochrondia , there was no evidence of mixing between H. sapiens and H. sapiens neanderthalensis populations .
This led to the idea that Neandertals went extinct without leaving any descendants or DNA .
In light of the new findings , that ’s probably wrong .

Hybridization !
Does that mean that Neandertals interbred with the ancestors of modern humans ?
Probably !
But there ’s one other explanation that we can’t rule out : perhaps the “ Neandertal ” genes in modern non-African humans are simply genes that are very old and were present in the common ancestors of both modern humans and Neandertals .
These then could have been transmitted to Neandertals and non-African humans , while the ancestors of modern Africans simply did not get a sample of those genes .
( Note that this does not mean that , evolutionarily speaking , modern non-Africans are more closely related to Neandertals than to modern Africans ! )
The “ differential sorting ” scenario seems unlikely to me because it involves special pleading about a non-random distribution of genes between proto - human populations that occurred well before our lineage diverged from that of Neandertals .

Why the attention about hybridization ?
People are fascinated by the possibility that several different species ( or subspecies ) of humans could have successfully mated with each other .
We already knew that , over our evolutionary history , there have been times when several hominin species lived at the same time and roughly at the same place ( as I recall , there could have been as many as three or four species of hominins living at the same time in some parts of Africa ) .
But in none of these cases do we have evidence for interbreeding .
The new work shows that this probably did occur between two hominin “ species ” .
This fascinates people for one reason , I think : sex .
It conjures up pictures of hairy , beetle - browed Neandertals shagging individuals that looked much more like us .
And indeed , that ’s probably what happened .
This scenario evokes all sorts of primal emotions , and I predict a new genre of internet porn involving human / Neandertal encounters !
But that should n’t completely distract us from what is a truly remarkable achievement : our own ability to reconstruct the genome of our extinct relatives by grinding up their bones , extracting the DNA , and using really sophisticated methods to determine the proper sequence of millions and millions of DNA nucleotides .
Think about how amazing that is !

Now that we have a Neandertal genome , can we make them by cloning ?
No .
We do n’t have enough DNA , and even if we did we do n’t have the technology to package it into chromosomes , or put it in the proper order with the proper surrounding elements .
And if we could do those things , we ’d still have to inject the Neandertal chromosomes into the egg of a modern human female , and that ’s both hard and ethically dubious .
No .

Family Dies When Poisoning Rats with Exhaust Fumes
Three residents of a small settlement in Ukraine ’s Dnepropetrovsk region died from exhaust fumes of their own Zaporozhets vehicle .
The head of the family , a 71 - year - old man , decided to exterminate rats in the house with the help of his old car .
Family Dies When Poisoning Rats with Exhaust Fumes
The man attached a hose to the exhaust pipe of the ZAZ - 968 “ Zaporozhets ” car and put the other end of the hose into the basement of the house .
He started the engine and went upstairs .
Some time later , the man decided to see what was happening in the basement .
As soon as the man entered the basement , he lost consciousness because of the high concentration of exhaust fumes .
His wife , a 77 - year - old woman , started worrying about her husband when he did not come back .
She went downstairs to see what was happening in the basement and fainted too .
The same happened with their 29 - year - old granddaughter .
Their other granddaughter found the bodies two hours later and was lucky to stay alive .
However , her three relatives died .
With the regularity of clockwork , stories about how digital audio consumption is degrading the quality of music are published and then re-published .
Nearly a decade after the introduction of Apple ’s iPod , this still apparently qualifies as news .
The content of the articles is so identical , you could believe the bylines are a ruse , a nom - de - plume for the same author re-publishing the same story .
Whatever the reason for their supposed newsworthiness , the problem with these stories is n’t their claims about the variable quality of music listening .
I think it ’d be hard to overstate just how sub - optimal real - world listening by real - world consumers can get .
The problem is that these journalists , inexperienced in the actual history of the technology they ’re covering , falsely identify a technological trend .
In the process , they miss the real story of how listeners listen .
Here ’s the latest offender :
In Mobile Age , Sound Quality Steps Back [ The New York Times ]
The story conflates everything from comparing analog to digital to dynamic compression in mastering to data compression , so it ’s hard to know where to begin .
But I ’ll do my best to separate out the issues .
( After all , you barely have to read this article , because you ’ve read this story – substituting a couple of sources here , a couple of metaphors there – repeatedly for about ten years . )
Myth # 1 : Audio advancement has n’t kept pace with video advancement .
Here ’s the myth , from author Joseph Plambeck :
The last decade has brought an explosion in dazzling technological advances — including enhancements in surround sound , high definition television and 3 - D — that have transformed the fan ’s experience .
There are improvements in the quality of media everywhere — except in music .
First , this idea itself is internally inconsistent , at least in part .
People ’s home theater setups are full of music , from the soundtracks to games to movies to video of live concerts .
In fact , the quality of audio in audiovisual contexts – including music – has improved alongside the video .
Consider :
Original VHS format : Poor frequency response ( 100 Hz – 10 kHz ) , mono , or stereo with hideous dynamic response .
In fact , this is n’t even worth measuring – it was awful .
Couple that with poor analog reception or low - quality analog cable signals , and it means the 1980s , peak of the music video , sounded like crap .
DVD : Typically AC - 3 or DTS digital audio , with better - than - CD audio quality ( in terms of theoretical specifications ) , and digital surround capability .
[ Clarification : technically , it ’s the theoretical 24 - bit , 96 k Hz encoding rate that would make audio on DVDs “ better ” than CDs .
Commenters are correct , though , that the lossy audio format , combined with real - world concessions to space , could degrade real - world audio quality – though you also get more channels , which is a good thing .
For a better advance from the CD , see the Blu - Ray disc .
Ed. ]
So , the NetFlix age is better off than the Blockbuster age .
Gaming : Games increasingly use compressed but relatively high - quality audio , approaching CD quality , and in digital surround formats .
With intelligent surround mixing , this also leads to better channel separation and spatial separation , and a more pristine listening experience .
Not only that , but because gamers use auditory clues to help them perceive where they and enemies are in space , anecdotally many non-musician gamers I ’ve talked to are particular about their sound experience .
But that ’s not the argument here .
Apparently , the lowest - quality audio distribution format can be compared to the highest - quality video format .
That just does n’t make sense .
Let ’s turn the tables , by way of comparison .
I can even write the headline :
“ Video Quality Suffers in the Age of the Internet – Unlike Audio ”
By Peter Kirn [ ‘s fake evil imaginary brother ]
Kids today , with their YouTube and their over - compressed , handheld shot video .
Why , I remember in the old days .
I used to shoot in gorgeous film on my Bolex and edit by hand on a Steenbeck .
Audio quality today is fantastic .
10.1 surround is the norm , as is better - quality mixing .
Just listen to The Lord of the Rings recording .
It ’s spectacular .
It ’s a whole orchestra and everything .
You can go watch the movie in a THX - certified theater , and listen to nearly three full hours of music .
In fact , by the time you ’ve watched the trilogy , you will have sit and listened to a longer piece of music than a Wagner opera – and you wo n’t have gotten out of your chair ( minus that quick bathroom break ) .
Not like video .
320×240 , really ?
Over - compressed video encoding and 15 fps ?
Stations that call themselves “ HD ” but exhibit noise artifacts do to over - compression – to say nothing of the less - popular , standard - definition stations squeezed into your cable signal to allow you to have 2000 stations ?
It ’s as if people are n’t videophiles any more .
It looks horrible . ”
You get the point .
Nothing above is incorrect ; it ’s just a matter of perspective , and whether you combine the best practices of one medium to the worst practices of another .
In video capture , the difference is more pronounced .
Modern digital cameras now shoot in increasingly high - quality audio , which previously was often more compressed than the video .
My new Olympus E-PL1 actually shoots uncompressed PCM audio alongside its motion JPEG video .
In fairness , the author here is talking about “ music . ”
If TV in HD is now the norm , there is n’t an equivalent shift in the common format for distribution of musical albums ( see myth # 2 ) .
And that ’s fair – mostly .
But the issue is , again , comparing different delivery formats for different delivery applications for different content .
Sure , the musical album has n’t had the leap forward that , say , television has , in the move from standard definition content to high - definition content .
But by the same token , would you compare the 16:9 cinematic experience – which was already “ high fidelity ” and “ high definition ” in optical film before the advent of these technologies – in the same way ?
In fact , if you did , the advances in cinema audio have been greater in the cinema than the advances in film presentation .
While digital projection and 3D have very recently improved the situation , urban movie theaters getting carved into subdivided rooms actually made a lot of movies smaller , not bigger or “ higher def . ”
Myth # 2 : MP3s reduce audio fidelity in the name of mobility
This topic has been discussed to death .
At the risk of giving away the ending , low - bitrate MP3s do n’t sound very good .
Higher - bitrate MP3s do sound pretty good .
( The same is true of Apple ’s AAC - encoded audio , which incidentally , shares the audio codec being used on those DVDs and Blu - Ray discs and consumer digital video recorders . )
In fact , bizarrely , the New York Times article does n’t compare any hard numbers on perception of high - bitrate MP3s and AACs to CDs .
It just takes it as a given that they are n’t as good , without any actual research .
But the central thesis of the entire article – one we ’ve seen before – is this :
In one way , the music business has been the victim of its own technological success : the ease of loading songs onto a computer or an iPod has meant that a generation of fans has happily traded fidelity for portability and convenience .
This is the obstacle the industry faces in any effort to create higher - quality — and more expensive — ways of listening .
Instead , music is often carried from place to place , played in the background while the consumer does something else — exercising , commuting or cooking dinner .
As usual , the lay journalist struggles with the notion of data compression , saying that the process is “ eliminating some of the sounds and range contained on a CD . ”
In fact , by design , lossy compression does nothing of the sort .
The ideal behind MP3 compression is to eliminate tones which are themselves inaudible , masked in the normal perception of music .
That means that , encoded correctly and with enough data , an MP3 should theoretically sound identical to a PCM - encoded CD .
There ’s often a difference between theory and practice .
But to suggest that the aim , the goal of MP3 or AAC is to eliminate auditory , perceptible sounds in order to increase portability is simply inaccurate .
Perceptual compression designed so that , according to the appropriately - named Karlheinz Brandenburg , compression pioneer of the Fraunhofer Institute , “ the basic task … is to compress the digital audio data in a way that … the reconstructed ( decoded ) audio sounds exactly ( or as close as possible ) to the original audio before compression . ”
You do need enough data for the compression technique to work its magic , which is why the shift from lower bitrates in MP3 / AAC to higher bitrates on leading digital music stores is so important .
But at a certain point , you no longer perceive anything missing , and as Duke Ellington would say , “ if it sounds good , it is good . ”
If the audio compression is successful , that means a generation of fans has n’t traded fidelity at all , if the previous popular format was the audio CD .
The “ if it ’s successful ” part is important , but it is n’t as simplistic as this ( and most other stories ) would have you believe .
Newspaper journalists continue to treat MP3s as though it ’s still 1999 .
In 1999 , it was n’t uncommon for people to illegally download music from services like Napster that were encoded at bitrates that were too low , and that actually contained encoding errors , which will cause auditory distortion and pops .
That ’s not true of a track downloaded from Amazon or iTunes today .
These issues are significant .
A discussion of how compressed audio compares to an audio CD actually is n’t an easy discussion .
Even simple metrics like frequency range or signal - to - noise ratio are n’t directly applicable to audio that uses perceptual encoding techniques , because by definition , they use variable encoding rates to change from frame to frame .
The quality of the encoder and its settings make a big difference .
Suffice to say , it ’s possible to create an MP3 or AAC file that is n’t as satisfying as an audio CD , or to create one that – even for many trained ears – is satisfying .
I wo n’t even try to debate the merits here , because to get the answer technically correct , we ’d have to do more work .
To have a technically - robust discussion , though , we ’d actually define what we ’re talking about : comparing , say , the quality of a direct - to - digital audio CD with a broad dynamic and frequency spectrum as played on a standard audio CD and a 320 - kpbs MP3 .
That could be an interesting discussion , and you might even choose the audio CD over the MP3 in certain cases .
But it probably would n’t reach any sweeping conclusions like generations of listeners turning their backs on quality in the name of cheap thrills .
In the dance of logical fallacies , articles like this one never define the terms of their basic thesis – the “ generation of listeners ” trading convenience for quality :
What generation ?
( I ’ve seen everyone from age 8 to 80 with an iPod . )
Compared to what ?
( MP3 to audio CDs ?
AAC to 8 - tracks ?
What ? )
Who ’s judging the quality , and how ?
What ’s quality ?
When ?
Who ?
Where ? …
What ?
But yes , I suppose it can be said that at an indeterminate time , using an indeterminate playback format ( MP3 or AAC or … something ) with an undetermined bitrate ( maybe 128 k , maybe 256k ) , listening through a range of variables that have gone undefined ( headphones ?
background noise ?
are you using your blender when cooking in the kitchen ? ) , an indeterminate group of people listening broadly to things that might be called “ music ” ( whether that ’s the Brandenberg Concerto or Frank Zappa ) from some indeterminate era , itself recording originally through some unknown means at some undefined time , has audio quality that is not as good as some other music music listened to by someone else … sometime .
Or something .
I can’t really argue with that , can I ?
Myth # 3 : The iPod is the perfect emblem of a generation that does n’t care about music
Quick : what ’s small and portable but sacrifices audio fidelity for over - compressed music with no frequency or dynamic range ?
It ’s portable , it ’s pocketable , it was a wildly - successful creation that changed how a generation consumed electronics and music alike , and it has terrible earbuds .
The iPod ?
No , I ’m talking about the Japanese transistor radio .
By contrast , it makes the iPod looks pretty amazing .
The transistor radio had :
A terrible tuner .
In order to save space , cost , and power consumption , the tuner in early radios – the “ transistor ” in transistor radio – was often sub-par .
Say what you will about MP3s or online streams ; at least you do n’t have to tune them out of the air .
Weak signal ?
Weak music .

AM radio for music delivery .
The irony of talking about MP3 as a step backward is nothing when compared to AM radio , which supported mono output and bandwidth of only 10 kHz.
Analog mono FM radio sounds better , let alone a current average digital file .
Only later did transistor radios add FM radio support , and it was some time before stations embraced the format .

Terrible , mono earbuds .
The iPod ’s weakest link is the lousy earbuds Apple ships with the device , but early transistor radios were even worse .
Aside from holding one up to you ear , you could plug in an earbud – yes , one earbud , in one ear .
The earbud was terrible , and mono .
The signal was terrible , and mono .
And you had one in only one ear .
I ’ve always loved listening to transistor radios .
They have gotten better .
But that ’s the point : they ’ve gotten better , not worse .
And an iPod can usually beat one of these devices when it comes to sound quality .
Myth # 4 : Music is getting squashed by loudness wars – blame the iPod
No article on the evils of digital music would be complete without reference to the Loudness Wars :
With the rise of digital music , fans listen to fewer albums straight through .
Instead , they move from one artist ’s song to another ’s .
Pop artists and their labels , meanwhile , shudder at the prospect of having their song seem quieter than the previous song on a fan ’s playlist .
So audio engineers , acting as foot soldiers in a so - called volume war , are often enlisted to increase the overall volume of a recording .
It ’s a subject for another post , but I ’m tired of the “ loudness war ” being applied to “ music . ”
What music ?
What genre ?
Recorded by whom ?
When ?
I ’ve heard exquisitely - engineered music from the past few years .
I ’ve heard brickwall - limited pop songs that … well , would have sounded like crap even without being poorly mastered .
I ’ve also heard music that used over - compression for intentional distortion in some genres ( like Dub ) long before anyone began worrying about loudness wars .
( I ’m also unconvinced by the listening habits described here .
We know how many singles versus albums are purchased , but not how people listen to their existing music collections , so I ’m dubious . )
But that ’s not really the argument here .
The issue is what ’s to blame .
In fact , I believe historically the author again has it completely wrong .
The technology that began to change how music was mastered , that began to cause people to move from one track to another , is n’t the iPod .
It ’s the radio .
And if anything caused the homogenization of music at the top of the charts , it was n’t the introduction of digital singles .
In fact , the iPod has technology designed to level out volume levels automatically on a playlist .
The trend attributed to the loudness wars scaled in the 1990s , as sales of CDs and CD singles – not downloads – were on the rise .
Let ’s face it : A&R people do n’t care what a track sounds like by the time it ’s found its way to your iPod playlist .
You ’ve already bought it .
Job over .
What they care about is how “ loud ” that track sounds when you have n’t bought it .
And that means impressing the people who run the radio stations .
If you want a historical variable in that time span ( and the more recent decade ) , look to the consolidation of broadcasting companies and radio markets .
The nonpartisan Future of Music Coalition ( FMC ) found that in 2005 , half of listeners tuned to stations owned by only four companies , and the top ten firms had almost two - thirds of listeners .
At the same time , radio listenership has declined 22 percent since its peak in 1989 in the top 155 markets .

It ’s a topic for another article , but I just ca n’t find a rational explanation for why the iPod would make less dynamic range make sense .
Personal listening means the ability to set your own volume level , and data compression and poor - quality headphones mean that over - compressed music sounds worse , not better .
The charges levied against the iPod might just as easily be directed at the Cassette Walkman of the 80s , on which people routinely listened to mix tapes of their own creation .
At the same time , I have n’t seen anyone argue against the notion that media consolidation might be the culprit , even though radical consolidation took place over the same era that the “ loudness wars ” were supposedly raging .
I welcome other theories here .
But even if you do n’t agree with me , I do n’t think you can take it as a given that the iPod is specifically to blame – and I ’d think you ’d want some evidence , regardless .
Myth # 5 : Technology is the cause and determinant
There ’s a bottom line to my endless rant .
( I know , I know – get to it already . )
Via Twitter and Facebook this morning , while I was blowing off steam about this article , a couple of people referred to how artists “ intend ” their music be heard .
I ’ve got bad news for you : your listeners do n’t care about your intentions .
Part of the genius of people who are great mix engineers or great mastering engineers is that they know how to shape music for the worst - case scenario listening environment , not just the best .
It ’s not that some MP3s do n’t sound terrible , or that music is sometimes mastered poorly or overly compressed .
It ’s not that the standard earbuds on the iPod are n’t awful , or the blown - out speakers in someone ’s car are n’t poor – they are .
The variable in all of this that ’s more important than the technology is the listener .
Listeners are fickle and unpredictable .
They do n’t always concentrate on music .
They do n’t always care about fidelity .
“ They ” do n’t always agree – which is why some people do n’t replace those default earbuds , while others blow thousands of dollars on listening equipment .
Too much of the debate over listening focuses on the technology and not the listener .
The listener – and perception – is everything .
And that leaves us to our final myth :
Biggest myth of all : Perception and reality are one and the same
There ’s an unstated elitism in most of these discussions .
I think it ’s worth a separate post , so I ’ll come back to this video and the ideas in it , but one key revelation is that even golden - eared pros can have their perceptions fooled by comb filtering in a room or even the placebo effect :
[ Mix engineer ]
Anyone who records and mixes professionally has done this at least once in their career — you tweak a snare or vocal track to perfection only to discover later that the EQ was bypassed the whole time .
Or you were tweaking a different track .
And if you ’ve been mixing and playing around with … whether you ’re a professional or just a hobbyist , if you ’ve been doing this for a few years and you have n’t done that , then you ’re lying .
Yet you were certain you heard a change !
Human auditory memory and perception are extremely fragile , and expectation bias and placebo effect are much stronger than people care to admit .
There ’s a lot more to this panel .
It winds up being a lot more interesting than the debates over MP3s and digital downloads , and get to the heart of how we hear .
I ’ll try to pull it apart and talk to people with more expertise than my own about is soon , but in the meantime , there are copious notes and audio downloads to go along with the video :

Thanks to oivindi ( see also SoundCloud ) for the tip .
Why bother with this whole rant ?
I ’m hopeful that , if we look beyond the simplistic explanations to the actual science , history , and magic by which we all hear music , we ’ll find out a lot more about what music means .
The story above came from the business section , but the industry is n’t a good place to look for answers .
The failure of a format like SACD shows a real failure of understanding about how people listen , how they perceive quality , and even basics of how formats and compatibility would appeal .
Nor has the recording industry always given you a better product for more money : they were just as happy to sell you excerpts of music at ridiculously inflated prices at lower fidelity for mobile formats in the form of ringtones .
My alternative rebuttal :
1. Audio and visual technology have advanced in lockstep , whether or not consumers have always bought the gear .
2. MP3 / AAC files can sound just fine , so it ’s not fair to leave audio complaints at their doorstep ; what we need is better testing under optimal circumstances , not just how these formats fail .
3 . The transistor radio , not the iPod , was the great backwards step in mobility ; it shows just how important being mobile and cheap and for how long , years before digital .
4 . The real culprits in the loudness wars is media consolidation and top - of - the - charts senselessness , not mastering engineers or iPods .
5 . Listener are the variable , not tech .
6 . Human perception is always the first place to consider – even with pros .
If you want to improve “ fidelity , ” even for your own listening , you ca n’t ignore the listener .
You ca n’t ignore perception .
And you certainly can’t ignore history .

I spoke to Steve Altimari , former brewer with Valley Brewing in Stockton , who ’s vacationing in his home town near Ithaca , New York , with his family .
Naturally , I asked about what went down at the brewery and why he was out of a job .
Having known
Steve for a number of years , I was well aware that the family - owned company had its share of drama and that they hardly knew what a talented brewer they had in Steve .
Here ’s what he was able to tell me .
About a month ago , he heard from the owner , Kelly Jacobs , that she wanted to sell the brewery and gave Steve a price if he was interested .
So Steve went to work , found partners and investors in short order and made an offer based on his earlier conversation with Jacobs .
No dice .
The price was now inexplicably higher .
They tried again with higher offers , but each time the owners kept raising the price .
Then they fired John , their only salesman .
Last Thursday , they tried one last offer , which met with the same frustrating negative response .
On Friday , the day before Steve was scheduled to take a family vacation , he asked for explanation .
He was told they “ decided on another offer , and they do n’t need you .
Thanks , but get out . ”
In less than two hours he was locked out of the brewery that he helped build for the past fourteen years .
I never expected that the owners were warm and fuzzy people , but that takes ingratitude to a whole new level .
None of the family members know the slightest thing about brewing and if not for the Herculean efforts of Steve , no one would have ever heard of their brewery .
I realize it ’s unfair to place any of the blame on the new owners — whoever they may be — but it ’s going to be difficult for anybody to come in and fill his shoes .
On the plus side , the partners and investors are sticking with Steve and the plans now have shifted to acquiring or building a brewery somewhere in the Bay Area .
Apparently , the financing is already in place , so we may not be without beer brewed by Steve Altimari for long .
Steve will be hard at it when he returns from vacation next week , and the first order of business is coming up with a new brewery name .
I suggested something that ’s the opposite of a valley , like a mountain peak , which is why the icon above is of Mt. Everest .
Then perhaps Altimari Brewery could work ; it means “ high water . ”
Let ’s wish him the best of luck .
What brewery name suggestions do you have for Steve ’s new venture ?

To sympathize with those who are less fortunate is honorable and decent .
A man able to commiserate only with himself would surely be neither admirable nor attractive .
But every virtue can become deformed by excess , insincerity , or loose thinking into an opposing vice .
Sympathy , when excessive , moves toward sentimental condescension and eventually disdain ; when insincere , it becomes unctuously hypocritical ; and when associated with loose thinking , it is a bad guide to policy and frequently has disastrous results .
It is possible , of course , to combine all three errors .
No subject provokes the deformations of sympathy more than poverty .
I recalled this recently when asked to speak on a panel about child poverty in Britain in the wake of the economic and financial crisis .
I said that the crisis had not affected the problem of child poverty in any fundamental way .
Britain remained what it had long been — one of the worst countries in the Western world in which to grow up .
This was not the consequence of poverty in any raw economic sense ; it resulted from the various kinds of squalor — moral , familial , psychological , social , educational , and cultural — that were particularly prevalent in the country ( see “ Childhood ’s End , ” Summer 2008 ) .
My remarks were poorly received by the audience , which consisted of professional alleviators of the effects of social pathology , such as social workers and child psychologists .
One fellow panelist was the chief of a charity devoted to the abolition of child poverty ( whose largest source of funds , like that of most important charities in Britain ’s increasingly corporatist society , was the government ) .
She dismissed my comments as nonsense .
For her , poverty was simply the “ maldistribution of resources ” ; we could thus distribute it away .
And in her own terms , she was right , for her charity stipulated that one was poor if one had an income of less than 60 percent of the median national income .
This definition , of course , has odd logical consequences : for example , that in a society of billionaires , multimillionaires would be poor .
A society in which every single person grew richer could also be one in which poverty became more widespread than before ; and one in which everybody grew poorer might be one in which there was less poverty than before .
More important , however , is that the redistributionist way of thinking denies agency to the poor .
By destroying people ’s self - reliance , it encourages dependency and corruption — not only in Britain , but everywhere in the world where it is held .
I first started thinking about poverty when I worked as a doctor during the early eighties in the Gilbert Islands , a group of low coral atolls in an immensity of the Central Pacific .
Much of the population still lived outside the money economy , and the per-capita GDP was therefore extremely low .
It did not seem to me , however , that the people were very poor .
Their traditional way of life afforded them what anthropologists call a generous subsistence ; their coconuts , fish , and taros gave them an adequate — and , in some respects , elegant — living .
They lived in an almost invariant climate , with the temperature rarely departing more than a few degrees from 85 .
Their problems were illness and boredom , which left them avid for new possibilities when they came into contact with the outside world .
Life in the islands taught me a lively disrespect for per-capita GDP as an accurate measure of poverty .
I read recently in a prominent liberal newspaper that “ the majority of Nigerians live on less than $ 1 a day . ”
This statement is clearly designed less to convey an economic truth than to provoke sympathy , evoke guilt , and drum up support for foreign aid in the West , where an income of less than $ 1 a day would not keep body and soul together for long ; whereas it is frequently said that one of Nigeria ’s problems is the rapid increase in its population .
As it happens , an island next door ( in Pacific terms ) to the Gilbert Islands was home to an experiment in the sudden , unearned attainment of wealth .
Nauru , a speck in the ocean just ten miles around , for a time became the richest place on earth .
The source of its sudden riches was phosphate rock .
Australia had long administered the island , and the British Phosphate Commission had mined the phosphate on behalf of Australia , Britain , and New Zealand ; but when Nauru became independent in 1968 , the 4,000 or so Nauruans gained control of the phosphate , which made them wealthy .
The money came as a gift .
Most Nauruans made no contribution to the extraction of the rock , beyond selling their land .
The expertise , the management , the labor , and the transportation arrived from outside .
Within just a few years , the Nauruans went from active subsistence to being rentiers .
The outcome was instructive .
The Nauruans became bored and listless .
One of their chief joys became eating to excess .
On average , they consumed 7,000 calories per day , mainly rice and canned beef , and they drank Fanta and Château d’Yquem by the caseload .
They became the fattest people on earth , and , genetically predisposed already to the illness , 50 percent of them became diabetic .
It was my experience of Nauru that first suggested to me the possibility that abruptly distributing wealth has psychological effects as well as economic ones .
I next spent a few years ( 1983 to 1986 ) in Tanzania , a country that presented another experiment in treating poverty as a matter of maldistribution .
Julius Nyerere , the first — and , until then , the only — president , had been in charge for more than 20 years .
His honorific , Mwalimu — Teacher — symbolized his relation to his country and his people .
He had become a Fabian socialist at the University of Edinburgh , and a more red- blooded one ( according to his former ally and foreign minister , Oscar Kambona , who fell out with him over the imposition of a one - party socialist state ) after receiving a delirious , orchestrated reception in Mao ’s China .
One can say a number of things in Nyerere ’s favor , at least by the standards of postindependence African leaders .
He was not a tribalist who awarded all the plum jobs to his own kind .
He was not a particularly sanguinary dictator , though he did not hesitate to imprison his opponents .
Nor was he spectacularly corrupt in the manner of , say , Bongo of Gabon or Moi of Kenya .
He was outwardly charming and modest and must have been one of the only people to have had good personal relations with both Queen Elizabeth II and Kim Il - sung .
Nyerere wished the poor well ; he was full of sympathy and good intentions .
He thought that , being so uneducated , ignorant , and lacking in resources , the poor could not spare the time and energy — and were , in any case , unqualified — to make decisions for themselves .
They were also lazy : Nyerere at one point complained about the millions of his fellow countrymen who spent half their time drinking , gossiping , and dancing ( which suggested to me that their lives were not altogether intolerable ) .
But Nyerere knew what to do for them .
In 1967 , he issued his famous Arusha Declaration , named for the town where he made it , committing Tanzania to socialism and vowing to end the exploitation of man by man that made some people rich and others poor .
On this view of things , the greater accumulation of wealth , either by some individuals or by some nations , could be explained only by exploitation , a morally illicit process .
The explanation for poverty was simple : some people or nations appropriated the natural wealth of mankind for themselves .
It was therefore a necessary condition of improvement , as well as a form of restitution , that they no longer be allowed to do so and that their wealth be redistributed .
So Tanzania nationalized the banks , appropriated commercial farms , took over all major industry , controlled prices , and put all export trade under the control of paragovernmental organizations .
There followed the forced collectivization of the rural population — which is to say , the majority of the population — into Ujamaa villages .
Ujamaa is Swahili for “ extended family ” ; as Nyerere insisted , all men were brothers .
By herding the people into collectivized villages , Nyerere thought , the government could provide services , such as schools and clinics .
After all , rich countries had educated and healthy populations ; was it not evident that if the Tanzanian people were educated and healthy , wealth would result ?
Besides , collectively the villagers could buy fertilizer , perhaps even tractors , which they never could have done as individuals ( assuming , as Nyerere did , that without government action there would be no economic growth ) .
Unfortunately , the people did not want to herd fraternally into villages ; they wanted to stay put on their scattered ancestral lands .
Several thousand were arrested and imprisoned .
The predictable result of these efforts at preventing the exploitation of man by man was the collapse of production , pauperizing an already poor country .
Tanzania went from being a significant exporter of agricultural produce to being utterly dependent on food imports , even for subsistence , in just a few years .
Peasants who had once grown coffee and sold it to Indian merchants for soap , salt , and other goods uprooted their bushes and started growing meager amounts of corn for their own consumption .
No reason existed for doing anything else because growers now had to sell their produce to paragovernmental procurement agencies , which paid them later , if at all , at derisory prices in a worthless currency that peasants called “ pictures of Nyerere . ”
Nyerere blamed shortages of such commonplaces as soap and salt on speculators and exploiters , rather than on his own economic policies .
He made the shortages the pretext for so - called crackdowns , often directed at Indian traders , which eventually drove them from the country .
Nyerere ’s policies were no more soundly based than those of Idi Amin , who drove out the Indians more brutally .
Anti-Semitism , it has often been said , is the socialism of fools .
I would put things another way : socialism is the anti-Semitism of intellectuals .
With foreign exchange exhausted , only the funds that the honey - tongued Nyerere continued to obtain from the World Bank and foreign donors enabled the country to avoid mass starvation .
By the time I reached Tanzania , the country had become completely dependent on handouts .
Aid represented two - thirds of Tanzania ’s foreign - exchange earnings ; one might say that its largest export was requests for such aid .
In the rural area where I lived , the people dressed in hand - me - downs sent by European charities .
A single egg was a luxury .
One of the goals that had induced Nyerere to move to socialism , ironically , was national “ self - reliance . ”
The foreign aid that allowed Nyerere ’s policies to continue well after the economic disaster was evident had precisely the baleful effects that Peter Bauer , the development economist who contradicted the professional orthodoxies of his time , predicted .
The aid immensely increased the power of the sole political party by giving its officials control over scarce goods .
When I was in Tanzania , you needed political connections to buy even a bottle of beer — the famous local monopoly brand , Safari , which , the saying went , caused you to pass directly from sobriety to hangover without passing through drunkenness .
The regime provided ample opportunities for corruption .
Most Tanzanians were slender ; you could recognize a party man by his girth .
Thanks to foreign aid , a large bureaucracy grew up in Tanzania whose power , influence , and relative prosperity depended on its keeping the economy a genuine zero - sum game .
A vicious circle had been created : the more impoverished the country , the greater the need for foreign aid ; the greater the foreign aid , the more privileged the elite ; the more privileged the elite , the greater the adherence to policies that resulted in poverty .
Nyerere himself made the connection between privilege and ruinous policies perfectly clear after the International Monetary Fund suggested that Tanzania float its currency , the Tanzanian shilling , rather than maintain it at a ridiculously overvalued rate .
“ There would be rioting in the streets , and I would lose everything I have , ” Nyerere said .
Long years of living under this perverse regime encouraged economically destructive attitudes among the general population .
While I was impressed by the sacrifices that Tanzanian parents were willing to make to educate their children ( for a child to attain a certain stage of education , for example , a party official had to certify the parents ’ political reliability ) , it alarmed me to discover that the only goal of education was a government job , from which a child could then extort a living from people like his parents — though not actually from his parents , for he would share his good fortune with them .
In Tanzania , producing anything , despite the prevailing scarcity of almost everything , became foolish , for it brought no reward .
When I returned to practice among the poor in England , I found my Tanzanian experiences illuminating .
The situation was not so extreme in England , of course , where the poor enjoyed luxuries that in Tanzania were available only to the elite .
But the arguments for the expansive British welfare state had much in common with those that Nyerere had used to bring about his economic disaster .
The poor , helpless victims of economic and social forces , were , like Ophelia in the river , “ incapable of their own distress . ”
Therefore , they needed outside assistance in the form of subsidies and state - directed organizations , paid for with the income of the rich .
One could not expect them to make serious decisions for themselves .
This attitude has worked destruction in Britain as surely as it has in Tanzania .
The British state is today as much a monopoly provider of education to the population as it is of health care .
The monopoly is maintained because the government and the bureaucratic caste believe , first , that parents would otherwise be too feckless or impoverished to educate their children from their own means ; and second , that public education equalizes the chances of children in an otherwise unequal society and is thus a means of engineering social justice .
The state started to take over education in 1870 , largely because the government saw a national competitor , Prussia , employing state power to educate its children .
But practically all British children went to school already : according to the calculations of economist and historian E. G. West , 93 percent of the population was by then literate .
It is true that the British state had started providing support to schools long before , but in 1870 , 67 percent of school income still came from the fees that parents paid .
Not all British children received a good education before the state intervened : that was as vanishingly unlikely then as it is today .
But it is clear that poor people — incomparably poorer than anyone in Britain today — were nonetheless capable of making sacrifices to carry out their highly responsible decisions .
They did not need the state to tell them that their children should learn to read , write , and reckon .
There is no reason to suppose that , left alone , the astonishing progress in the education of the population during the first three - quarters of the nineteenth century would not have continued .
The “ problem ” that the state was solving in its destruction of the voluntary system was its own lack of power over the population .
As in Tanzania , the state - dominated system became self - reinforcing .
Because of the high taxation necessary to run it , it reduced the capacity and inclination of people to pay for their own choices — and eventually the habit of making such choices .
The British state now decides the important things for British citizens when it comes to education and much else .
It is no coincidence that British advocates of the cradle - to - grave welfare state were great admirers of Julius Nyerere — who , incidentally , has been proposed for Roman Catholic canonization , thus bringing close to reality Bauer ’s ironic reference to him as Saint Julius .
The only time I ever saw Nyerere in person was in Dodoma , the dusty town designated to become Tanzania ’s new capital .
He was expected to drive by , and by the side of the road sat a praise singer — a woman employed to sing the praises of important people .
She was singing songs in praise of Nyerere , of which there were many , with words such as : “ Father Nyerere , build and spread socialism throughout the country and eliminate all parasites . ”
The great man drove past in a yellow Mercedes .
The praise singer was covered in dust and started to cough .
Recently , I spent some time discussing traces with Marc Smith ( we previously wrote two papers on the matter ) .
Something that came up is the idea of representing a sequential composition of parallel processes as a parallel composition of sequential processes .
Let me explain …
We , as programmers , often start off reasoning sequentially and then add on reasoning about parallel processes later — usually with much difficulty .
Think of producing a control - flow graph for an imperative program , for example .
If you have a sequential program , it is usually quite straightforward to form a flow graph for the program .
When you try to add parallel processes , you need multiple flow graphs side by side .
And they will interact , so really you need to link them together at the points of interaction .
It quickly gets quite involved , and leaves you wishing that you did n’t have to involve concurrency .
What Marc and I found is the opposite : our reasoning was straightforward for parallel processes , but sequential composition was a headache .
We were trying to represent the trace of a program as a tree , with each node representing either a parallel composition or a process without parallelism .
In fact , due to the associativity and commutativity of parallel composition , this type of tree can always be flattened into an unstructured bag of parallel processes :
We then wanted to link processes in the tree that communicated with each other , to work out information about dependence and to look at neighbourhoods of connected processes .
That was all fine , but gets quickly difficult when you need to consider sequential composition , specifically the sequential composition of parallel compositions .
Imagine that one of the tree nodes is first a program without parallel composition , and later becomes the parallel composition of two sub-processes , i.e. P = Q ;( R || S ) .
We do n’t have a way to represent sequence in our neat parallel trees above , and this causes our representation to become awkward .
We ca n’t have a simple ordered sequential list of trees , because if two processes have sequence information , they can proceed in either order , so really we would need a sequential lattice of trees , which is getting nasty .
At this point we wished we did n’t have to deal with sequential composition — at least , not sequential composition that can contain parallel composition .
And via a small transformation , it turns out that we do n’t .
Consider the process : a ; ( ( b ; b ’ ) || c ) ; d , where everything in there is assumed to be a communication .
We can refactor this into a set of parallel processes ( P1 || P2 || P3 ) :
P1 = a ; par1start ; par1end ; d
P2 = par1start ; b ; b’ ; par1end
P3 = par1start ; c ; par1end
The key insight is really this : if you are running multiple processes in parallel , it is the same if you start them at the outset of the program , then synchronise with them to start them , as if you set them going when you need them .
So even though the process doing c wo n’t happen until a has , we do n’t wait to set that process off partway through the program .
We set that process ( P3 above ) off straight away , then send it a message ( par1start ) when we want to really set it going .
The par1end message makes sure that P1 does n’t do anything more until P2 and P3 have completed : all three processes synchronise together on the par1start and par1end messages .
With this transformation , we never have any parallel composition inside sequential composition in our traces .
All we have is one giant parallel composition of every process in the system , where each process is a sequential composition of events .
There is no more nesting than that ; we have flattened the process network into an unstructured bag of lists of events .
In fact , we can now represent the processes as a graph ( with links formed by the communications : the dotted lines in the diagram above ) .
The semantics of the process are unchanged , and all the information about the ordering dependencies is still there if you want it ( embodied in the unique parstart / parend communications : the italicised events in the graph above ) .
This form of representation actually makes it really nice to track dependencies and relations throughout the process network , by following the communication links .
Addendum
You could even go one step further , and transform the system into a collection of parallel processes , where each process had at most three events in sequence , where at most one of those would be an event from the original program , i.e. the above would become :
P1A = a ; seq1
P1B = seq1 ; par1start ; seq2
P1C = seq2 ; par1end ; seq3
P1D = seq3 ; d
P2A = par1start ; b ; seq4
P2B = seq4 ; b’ ; par1end
P3 = par1start ; c ; par1end
I ’m not sure how useful this is , though .

There 's no shame in admitting that you read comic books in the bathroom .
Heck , we 've all done it - not with our most prized and perfect comic books , mind you , but the occasional issue ( or in some cases a TPB ) that you deem worthy of your attention while hanging out in the john ?
That 's a totally acceptable offense .
But sometimes , it 's easy to forget your bathroom reading material until you 're already on the toilet and it 's simply too late .
There is n't a clean or easy solution to that problem right now beyond forgiving yourself your forgetfulness , but in 1979 , Oh Dawn !

Jim Salicrup and Michael Higgins wrote the comic .

Abstract
We trained chickens to react to an average human female face but not to an average male face ( or vice - versa ) .
In a subsequent test , the animals showed preferences for faces consistent with human sexual preferences ( obtained from university students ) .
This suggests that human preferences arise from general properties of nervous systems , rather than from face - specific adaptations .
We discuss this result in the light of current debate on the meaning of sexual signals , and suggest further tests of existing hypotheses about the origin of sexual preferences .
What EVERY woman needs to know about why men cheat ... by a man who spent years talking to hundreds of unfaithful husbands
This week , after 26 years of marriage , LibDem MP Chris Huhne admitted he ’d been having an affair .
So why do men cheat ?
Playwright PEADAR DE BURCA , 36 , who is married with a baby daughter , has spent five years interviewing 250 adulterous men .
Here , he tells TESSA CUNNINGHAM the secrets cheating men would rather we did n’t know ...
Teresa had been suspicious of her husband for weeks , but as she sat in her car watching him walk into the home of an attractive blonde , she was stunned .
Nick was a GP , but this was no ordinary house visit .
For starters , he was off duty and had told Teresa he ’d be at the gym .
Her heart was hammering as she marched up to the front door .
It was opened by a red - faced , flustered young woman .
Teresa pushed her to one side .
‘ I know my husband ’s here , ’ she snapped , as she stormed inside and marched from room to room .
Philanderer : Donald Draper with his mistress in the hit TV series Mad Men .
But what makes men cheat , and why do their wives forgive them ?
She hurled open the door of the airing cupboard and there , crouching behind a pile of towels and sheets , was Nick .
He was naked , except for his expensive designer glasses .
‘ It ’s not what it looks like .
You are just imagining things .
Please go home and everything will be OK , ’ he said .
Welcome to the world of cheating husbands .
They tell the most outrageous lies , they have one mistress after another and - most amazing of all - they often get away with it .
While terribly hurt by her husband ’s betrayal , Teresa decided to accept his grovelling apologies and take him back .
They are still together and , yes , he is still cheating .
I come from a long line of cheating men .
Several of my uncles were womanisers and it destroyed their families .
Their wives were always at loggerheads with them and their children grew up insecure .
Similarly , many of the lads I grew up with have turned into womanisers .
But I wanted to be different .
I knew I wanted to settle down and find what seems elusive these days : a happy , committed , faithful marriage .
So five years ago I embarked on my quest to find out what makes men cheat .
Are some men programmed to be unfaithful ?
Is it something in their DNA , an overdeveloped sex drive or irresistible charm ?
What I discovered was much more shocking .
After meeting hundreds of adulterers , I ’m convinced they cheat because they can get away with it .
I talked to more than 250 men from all walks of life - doctors , dentists , lawyers , bankers , footballers , teachers and the odd millionaire .
All had cheated on their wives but , incredibly , only 40 of them had been found out .
The others got away scot free and are still at it - as are many of the men who were found out and forgiven .
' I 've been left ashamed by the dirty tricks my fellow men get up to and horrified by the way women let them get away with murder '
I also talked to 60 betrayed women .
All except three have stuck with their cheating husbands .
When women do n’t have the courage to stand up for themselves , it ’s virtually a cheat ’s charter .
I ’ve been left ashamed by the dirty tricks my fellow men get up to and horrified by the way women let them get away with murder .
Quite simply , women deserve better .
Take Teresa .
Tall , blonde and witty , she lives in a stunning house outside London with her husband Nick .
In their early 40s , they had been married 15 years and had three children when Teresa began to suspect things were n’t right .
Her husband was spending more time at the gym than usual .
Yet when he came home , his kit was clean .
One evening , Teresa followed him - to his mistress ’s home .
‘ Even when I found him naked in the airing cupboard , he had the gall to try to persuade me it was n’t as bad as it looked .
He was so calm that I almost believed him , ’ she says .
But even though she had caught him , Teresa decided to forgive him .
‘ I have a lovely home and a great lifestyle .
I do n’t want to lose all that and see my children grow up without a father , ’ she says .
‘ And I do n’t want to face life alone .
Who would want me ?
I ’ve stuck with Nick and he ’s carried on cheating .
I know he will never stop .
Now I just turn a blind eye .
I still love him , but I do n’t trust him an inch . ’
The betrayed wives all had one thing in common - a lack of confidence .
They were at least as attractive as the mistresses and a great deal more intelligent .
But they let their men walk all over them .
When I started my quest five years ago , I imagined it would be hard to find cheats and even more difficult to find ones willing to own up .
I could n’t have been more wrong .
Unfaithful : Chris Huhne ( circled right ) his wife Vicky ( centre ) and Carina Trimingham ( left ) .

Call out ‘ Cheat ’ in any street and a dozen guilty men will look furtively over their shoulders .
My first cheat - who I met through a friend of a friend - flicked open his address book and it was a roll call of fellow philanderers .
It takes a cheat to know one .
They passed me on like a parcel .
And they were n’t simply willing to open up , they were bursting to tell me all about their affairs .
The male ’s capacity to boast about his sexual prowess knows no bounds .
Once they started reeling off their conquests , it was impossible to shut them up .
Aged from 25 to 65 , some were handsome , some were downright ugly , but most were successful .
I imagined they ’d be living exciting , glamorous lives .
But nothing could be further from the truth .
If one thing ’s certain , affairs do n’t make you happy .
Once I ’d dug beneath the boasting and bravado , I was stunned by just how insecure most of these love cheats were .
Most admitted they were n’t even driven by sex .
They just wanted something to fill their empty lives .
One evening , my research took me to a bar , where I met a married man in his 30s and his girlfriend .
Like most of the mistresses I met , she barely had two brain cells to rub together .
A decade younger , she was obviously attracted by the money and did n’t seem to care whether he was married or not .
' One man boasted to me : " When my wife discovered by affair , I managed to make her feel guilty " '
When she went to the ladies , the man passed me his mobile phone to show me photos of his children .
‘ I love my family .
I know I ’m ruining everything , but I ca n’t help myself , ’ he sobbed .
He was so pathetic I almost felt sorry for him .
But having spoken to all these men , I wonder if they ’re capable of love —
I ’m not sure they even love themselves , so how can they love their wives ?
If they did , would they risk inflicting such pain on them ?
Until I started this project , I had n’t realised how devastating it is for a woman to know her husband has been unfaithful .
The wife of a serial cheat told me : ‘ You see yourself for the first time through this unforgiving mirror .
Suddenly every little fault and imperfection is exaggerated .
‘ I used to feel good about myself because I thought I had a husband who loved me and was faithful .
Now that ’s all gone .
Even though I know he ’s to blame , I ’ll never feel as good about myself again . ’
You ’d expect cheats to feel guilt , but , believe me , most do n’t .
The men I met seemed to find it impossible to understand the damage they had caused .
They seemed far more interested in their next affair .
And when they were found out , they often turned the tables on their wives .
One man boasted to me : ‘ When my wife discovered my affair , I managed to make her feel guilty .
I told her it was because she ’d been ignoring me and had gone off sex .
In the end , she was the one apologising . ’
Forgiving : John Terry 's wife Toni took him back after an alleged affair
I ’m convinced part of the trouble is that we allow men to think philandering is harmless .
Look at the way we tolerate Bill Clinton .
One of the saddest stories I heard was from a woman whose husband had cheated on her when their youngest child was seriously ill .
Desperately worried , this poor woman had started comfort eating and had put on weight .
When she discovered her husband was having an affair , even her own family suggested she was partly to blame .
‘ You should n’t have let yourself go , ’ they tutted .
It ’s a cliché , but a lot of men start cheating when they hit middle age .
They realise they ’re never going to be David Beckham or Bill Gates , but they can have a fantasy life with another woman .
So , what can women do to protect themselves against cheats ?
First , be wary of women with long hair .
One of the most unexpected things I discovered was that men nearly always cheat with women who have longer hair than their wives .
I ’m not a trained psychologist , but the reason could n’t be more obvious — or more shallow .
They want to rekindle their youth with a younger version of their wives and long hair seems to equal youth .
There was only one man for whom I felt any empathy or affection .
And he was the only man who had an affair with a short - haired woman who was older than his wife .
Sean , a teacher , fell in love with Nuala , a widowed barrister , when they appeared in an amateur dramatic play together .
At 57 , she was 20 years older than him .
‘ My wife and I had been drifting apart .
Nuala was flirty , tactile and great fun , ’ he says .
‘At the aftershow party , we went out for a cigarette and ended up kissing .
It was totally unexpected and I felt overwhelmed by guilt , but I could n’t stop myself .
‘ We drifted on for a year until my wife discovered us together and threw me out .
I feel terrible for the pain I caused and wish I ’d been brave enough to be honest about what I was doing .
‘ My wife is in a new relationship and we are both much happier . ’
Sean was the only man I met who fell in love with his mistress and was prepared to end his marriage .
But even he tried to have his cake and eat it for a year .
The simple truth is that most cheats are cowards .
They are not brave enough to admit there might be problems in their relationship .
United : Hillary Clinton stood by her husband Bill after an affair with White House worker Monica Lewinsky while he was U.S. President
Instead , they embark on affairs that involve secrecy .
When they are caught out , it ’s normally down to something as clichéd as lipstick on their collar or a scratch mark they ca n’t explain .
And if their wife forgives them , they believe they ’ve got carte blanche to carry on .
I ’ve met only one man who stopped cheating , even though he ’d never been found out .
If his case was n’t so tragic , it would be comical .
Paul , a 46 - year - old builder and a notorious womaniser , was having an affair with a neighbour when he developed narcolepsy .
Every time he got excited , he fell asleep .
The doctor put it down to stress .
And no wonder : Paul had been leading a double life for 20 years .
His mistress left him because he could n’t perform any more .
He lost his job and ca n’t even watch football , because he falls asleep as soon as things get exciting .
‘ The worst part is that my wife is so sympathetic , ’ he says .
Having spent years trailing serial philanderers , I ca n’t believe why more women do n’t read them the riot act .
By and large , these men had fantastically attractive women at home who were prepared to be treated like dirt .
And that ’s the problem .
If men think they can get away with cheating , they will .
The secret to keeping your man faithful could n’t be simpler : be confident , demand attention and make it clear he is lucky to have you and wo n’t get a second chance .
I ’m also convinced there are faithful men out there .
They have a moral code and strength of character .
They do n’t lie or cheat .
They ’re more interested in being the sort of father their children can look up to than their own selfish pleasure .
Am I that sort of man ?
I really hope so .
Not just for my wife ’s sake , but for mine .
Most of the adulterers I met are the most miserable men on earth .
Why Men Cheat by Peadar De Burca is at The Assembly Rooms , Edinburgh , from August 5 to 30 .
A respected scientist wants to enlist Old Man River in the battle against the BP PLC oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
G. Paul Kemp , a former marine science professor at Louisiana State University who works now with the National Audubon Society 's coastal initiative , is proposing turning loose the mighty Mississippi River to flush oil out of the river 's marshy delta .
Kemp said in an interview that he has given his plan to U.S. EPA and has been assured that it is being reviewed at the " highest levels . "
" There is no downside , " Kemp said .
" This is an example of being nimble to deal with a real threat .
It has good science behind it . "
The plan calls for the Army Corps of Engineers to tweak the massive , adjustable concrete dams about 315 miles upriver from the Gulf of Mexico to divert more water from the nearby Atchafalaya River into the Mississippi River .
The Army Corps built the dams -- collectively called the Old River Control Structure -- in 1963 to keep the Mississippi River flowing through New Orleans and Baton Rouge , rather than shifting its path to the sea as it does every 1,000 or so years .
The river is in mid-shift now , pushing more and more toward the Atchafalaya River with each year , Kemp said .
To stop a complete switch , the corps must adjust water - management structures to ensure a constant flow of 70 percent of the Mississippi River along its traditional path and 30 percent to the Atchafalaya River .
Kemp recommends sending more water down the Mississippi -- as much as 81 percent , if not more -- to push out the oil .
Some scientists who have considered Kemp 's plan say it contains no obvious flaws .
And they say it is astonishingly simple , unlike Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal 's ( R ) plan for building 120 miles of offshore sand berms to block oil heading toward marshes and beaches .
Critics say that plan would take months to complete and would require heavy equipment that could destroy the seabed and disrupt nesting birds that the spill - containment effort is trying to protect .
" What 's the downside ? " Denise Reed , who heads the Pontchartrain Institute for Environmental Sciences , said of Kemp 's plan in an interview .
" I 'm sure somebody has to turn a lever somewhere , but that person has a salary anyway . "
Inaction could carry a cost .
Scientists say the Mississippi River 's flow has limited oiling of marshes on the west side of Breton Sound and east side of Barataria Bay .
But those protective currents have been weakening since June 1 , making it easier for oil to infiltrate marshes .
Said Kemp , " We just do n't want to get into a situation where , by not helping the river , we 're inviting oil further into the marsh . "

MOSS LANDING , Calif. —
It seems like alchemy : a Silicon Valley start - up says it has found a way to capture the carbon dioxide emissions from coal and gas power plants and lock them into cement .
If it works on a mass scale , the company , Calera , could turn that carbon into gold .
Cement production is a large source of carbon emissions in the United States , and coal - fired electricity plants are the biggest source .
As nations around the world press companies to curb their greenhouse - gas emissions , a technology that makes it profitable to do so could be very popular .
Indeed , Calera ’s marketing materials may be one of the rare places where glowing quotes from a coal company and the Sierra Club appear together .
“ With this technology , coal can be cleaner than solar and wind , because they can only be carbon - neutral , ” said Vinod Khosla , the Silicon Valley billionaire .
His venture capital firm , Khosla Ventures , has invested about $ 50 million in Calera .
On Monday , Calera is set to announce that Peabody Energy , the world ’s biggest coal company , has invested $ 15 million .
Although Calera has a pilot project up and running , it is still not clear that the process can be used on a large scale or that anyone will buy the cement it makes .
Ronald Mallett , Professor at the University of Connecticut , has used Einstein ’s equations to design a time machine with circulating laser beams .
While his team is still looking for funding , he hopes to build and test the device in the next 10 years .
With a brilliant idea and equations based on Einstein ’s relativity theories , Ronald Mallett from the University of Connecticut has devised an experiment to observe a time traveling neutron in a circulating light beam .
While his team still needs funding for the project , Mallett calculates that the possibility of time travel using this method could be verified within a decade .
Black holes , wormholes , and cosmic strings - each of these phenomena has been proposed as a method for time travel , but none seem feasible , for ( at least ) one major reason .
Although theoretically they could distort space - time , they all require an unthinkably gigantic amount of mass .
Mallett , a U Conn Physics Professor for 30 years , considered an alternative to these time travel methods based on Einstein ’s famous relativity equation : E=mc2 .
“ Einstein showed that mass and energy are the same thing , ” said Mallett , who published his first research on time travel in 2000 in Physics Letters .
“ The time machine we ’ve designed uses light in the form of circulating lasers to warp or loop time instead of using massive objects . ”

To determine if time loops exist , Mallett is designing a desktop - sized device that will test his time - warping theory .
By arranging mirrors , Mallett can make a circulating light beam which should warp surrounding space .
Because some subatomic particles have extremely short lifetimes , Mallett hopes that he will observe these particles to exist for a longer time than expected when placed in the vicinity of the circulating light beam .
A longer lifetime means that the particles must have flowed through a time loop into the future .
“ Say you have a cup of coffee and a spoon , ” Mallett explained to PhysOrg.com .
“ The coffee is empty space , and the spoon is the circulating light beam .
When you stir the coffee with the spoon , the coffee - or the empty space - gets twisted .
Suppose you drop a sugar cube in the coffee .
If empty space were twisting , you ’d be able to detect it by observing a subatomic particle moving around in the space . ”
And according to Einstein , whenever you do something to space , you also affect time .
Twisting space causes time to be twisted , meaning you could theoretically walk through time as you walk through space .
“ As physicists , our experiments deal with subatomic particles , ” said Mallett .
“ How soon humans will be able to time travel depends largely on the success of these experiments , which will take the better part of a decade .
And depending on breakthroughs , technology , and funding , I believe that human time travel could happen this century . ”
Step back a minute ( sorry , only figuratively ) .
How do we know that time is not merely a human invention , and that manipulating it just does n’t make sense ?
“ What is time ?
That is a very , very difficult question , ” said Mallett .
“ Time is a way of separating events from each other .
Even without thinking about time , we can see that things change , seasons change , people change .
The fact that the world changes is an intrinsic feature of the physical world , and time is independent of whether or not we have a name for it .
“ To physicists , time is what ’s measured by clocks .
Using this definition , we can manipulate time by changing the rate of clocks , which changes the rate at which events occur .
Einstein showed that time is affected by motion , and his theories have been demonstrated experimentally by comparing time on an atomic clock that has traveled around the earth on a jet .
It ’s slower than a clock on earth . ”
Although the jet - flying clock regained its normal pace when it landed , it never caught up with earth clocks - which means that we have a time traveler from the past among us already , even though it thinks it ’s in the future .
Some people show concern over time traveling , although Mallett - an advocate of the Parallel Universes theory - assures us that time machines will not present any danger .
“ The Grandfather Paradox [ where you go back in time and kill your grandfather ] is not an issue , ” said Mallett .
“ In a sense , time travel means that you ’re traveling both in time and into other universes .
If you go back into the past , you ’ll go into another universe .
As soon as you arrive at the past , you ’re making a choice and there ’ll be a split .
Our universe will not be affected by what you do in your visit to the past . ”
In light of this causal “ safety , ” it ’s kind of ironic that what prompted Mallett as a child to investigate time travel was a desire to change the past in hopes of a different future .
When he was 10 years old , his father died of a heart attack at age 33 .
After reading The Time Machine by H.G. Wells , Mallett was determined to find a way to go back and warn his father about the dangers of smoking .

" I am constant as the northern star , Of whose true - fix 'd and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament . "
Julius Caesar ( III , i , 60 – 62 )
Shakespeare was a decent writer , but an astronomer he was n't .
The North Star is n't fix'd , because the Earth 's axis wobbles slowly like a top .
You would n't see this by eye , since the circuit takes 26,000 years to complete , but astronomers deal with it all the time .
But Shakespeare did get something right in that passage : the stars themselves do move .
It 's slow , but it 's there .
It 's caused by their orbital motion as they circle the center of the Milky Way .
Their velocity can be hundreds of kilometers per second , but that apparent motion is dwarfed to a near standstill by their forbidding distance .
Of course , that means that closer stars will appear to move faster than ones farther away , just like trees by the side of the road whiz by as you drive , but distant mountains slide along in a much more stately manner .
It takes decades , sometimes , to see that stellar movement at all -- astronomers call it proper motion -- but it 's not impossible .
Greek amateur astronomer Anthony Ayiomamitis ( who has been featured on this blog before here and here ) knew that very well , and he was able to prove it .
Behold , the unfix'd heavens !
These two pictures show the same region of sky , separated in time by six decades .
The top , taken in 1950 , is from the famous Palomar Sky Survey , a tool still used by astronomers to guide their observations .
The marked star is Barnard 's Star , a dinky , dim red bulb a mere 6 light years away -- which makes it one of the closest of all the stars in the galaxy .
Barnard was a phenomenal astronomer , and inferred that since it was a red dwarf , for it to be seen at all means it must be close .
He kept his eye on it over the years , and was able to measure its apparent speed across the sky .
It moves a phenomenal 10 arcseconds per year , which is tiny in normal life , but pretty frakkin ' fast for a star .
In 60 years since the Palomar observations , Ayiomamitis was able to capture it in the lower half of that image , where again its position is marked .
Note how far it 's moved !
In the intervening decades it 's traveled about 10 arcminutes , or about 1/3 the size of the Moon on the sky !
That 's fast .
If every star moved that quickly , the constellations would last only a few centuries before being distorted beyond recognition .
As it is , we see pretty much the same constellations ancient Sumerians did .
Note that the Palomar image is in black and white ; Ayiomamitis took color images and you can see the dull red glow of Barnard 's Runaway Star .
It might help to see the two images superposed ; Ayiomamitis did that for me when he alerted me to his observations :
Very cool .
Note the number of faint stars ; Barnard 's star is located in the constellation of Ophiuchus , which is near the galactic center , and is loaded with stars .
Imagine trying to find that one faint ember among all those stars , and you start to get a glimpse of how amazing an observer Barnard was .
Remember , this was before computers , digital photography , or any of those modern conveniences .
He used film -- actually , emulsion sprayed on glass plates -- guided the telescope by hand , developed the plates , and measured them , again by hand .
And he found that star among the millions of others .
In real terms , the star is moving at about 140 km / sec ( 90 miles / second ) relative to the Sun .
Its direction is bringing it closer to us , though it 'll never get closer than about 4 light years -- slightly closer than Alpha Centauri is to us now .
It 'll still be faint ; only about twice as bright as it is now , and at the moment you need pretty good binoculars to see it at all !
It 's shining at about magnitude 9.5 , or 1/16th as bright as the faintest star you can see with your unaided eye .
Of course , it wo n't slide past us for about another 9000 years , so do n't hold your breath .
And even though the age of the star is about 12 billion years , as a red dwarf it has n't even reached middle age yet .
They last a long , long time .
I bet over its life it 's seen far closer passes to stars like the Sun , and will live to see many more .
And finally , back to Shakespeare : even ignoring the Earth 's wobble , he still blew it in that passage from Julius Caesar .
The North Star moves too .
Of course , its proper motion is pretty small because it's a long way off , over 400 light years away .
Compared to Barnard 's Star , it 's hardly moving .
Given that then , I suppose , I can give Shakespeare some credit .
Perhaps the fault lies in ourselves , and not the stars .

Shocking Grasp : A random Target will be paralyzed and take damage over time .
If any other unit comes within range of the afflicted unit , shocking grasp will jump .
This can create a chain reaction .

This is a really cool idea .
Good to see some more of the potential of the map editor .
Do the units have single attacks ?
It might be interesting to see a map in the future where you could get a high - level game going with hero units / abilities and multiple players .
Really will add some depth to the RPGs people make .

The strategy is simple , pulling it off is the hard part .
That 's why it 's easy on slower game speeds and harder on faster game speeds .
The micro practice I 'm referring to is training your effective APM .
You have 10 game seconds ( about 6 real time seconds on faster ) to spread out over 20 units based on their polarity .
You also need to make sure they 're always a certain distance from eachother to minimize damage from shocking grasp , which can quickly eat the heal mana .
Lastly , archons ( sparks ) are spawned every so often and need to be focused down .
Attacking with the wrong marines can move them out of your positioning , or ignoring them / mis-clicking can cost you many units .
Also , the timings begin to overlap as time goes by and you need to deal with multiple instances of these problems at the same time .

Newsnight 's Sue Lloyd - Roberts has visited North Korea on an official trip to view celebrations marking the birthday of the country 's founder Kim Il - sung .
This TV report broadcast in 2010 won an Emmy award for TV journalism in September 2011 .
This is part of a series I started in March 2008 - you may want to go back and look at older parts if you 're new to this series .
First of all , here 's the biggest reason I 've been so excrutiatingly slow with getting this part together ( at least that 's my story , I guess I 've had other things on my plate too ... ) :
Tristan is 13 months now , and a real menace to my laptop ( pulling off keys and drooling on the screen ) and anything else within reach , and a real attention seeker ...
So , whenever I 'm slow at posting a new part , I 'll blame him .
I have no part in the delays at all , of course .
None .
I 'm completely faultless ...
Towards define_method via closures
For starters , here 's the commit that covers most of this
To support define_method we need to support blocks with arguments .
Really , full closures .
If you have n't already , you should read my post on closures
We want this :
define_method ( : foo ) do | a , b | #
Do something with a , b end
to be mostly equivalent to :
def foo a , b end
For our attr_* implementation we actually want more :
def attr_reader sym define_method sym do %s ( ivar self sym ) end end
( or , as it turns out , not really that , as I realize the above can be simplified - if we have a lookup function to lookup the symbol to instance var slot , we can just use our index primitive to get the address ; we 'll return to that , but the above is the current state of attr_reader )
What that calls for is actually proper closures .
One step harder .
There 's the other issue that the above will be really inefficient .
As in , requiring a hashtable lookup on every call inefficient , when we can statically determine the offset for any instance variable we know about at compile time .
We 'll get back to that at some point too , but if you 've been following this series you know I care about getting things working first , efficient second .
For now attr_reader and friends still serve as a useful test case for basic closure support .
Baby steps
The first step towards closures is actually easy ( we 've already done it ) .
We have our : lambda primitive that creates an anonymous function ( which is n't really anonymous , it 's just that the name is quitely created in the compiler and not accessible to the programmer ) .
Adding an environment
But an anonymous function is only of relatively limited use if you can't bind variables to it - it 's not much more than a function pointer in that case .
So how do we let " sym " hang around , and how do we take advantage of that for define_method ?
First , let us consider how you can call a lambda in Ruby :
yield
Proc#call
We could implement Proc#call via yield by passing the block as an argument to a method , if we wanted to , but that would probably be more inefficient than implementing both in terms of a primitive .
But this means those are the only things that has to explicitly know how to deal with the environment .
That gives us an interesting option .
We could turn :
c , d = somevalues do | a , b | ... uses c , d end
into
class SomePrivateUniqueClassName def initialize c , d @c , @d = c , d end def call ( a , b ) ... code here with access to c , d rewritten end end
And we could have it inherit Proc .
yield in that case is just rewritten to block .
call
This does however have the troubling implication of messing with self , and as this irb session shows , we 'd have to fix that :
>> lambda { p self }.call main => nil >>
The other alternative is to create a lightweight environment binding of sorts .
Oh wait , we already have that .
It 's called an object .
The problem is not the class above as such , but creating a full class for each block .
We could do something like this instead :
class
Proc def initialize & block end def call * args %s ( call @block_func ( res args ) ) end end
Our code needs to be rewritten , so that blocks get wrapped in code to create the appropriate Proc object .
Additionally , if the method uses variables from the surrounding scope , we need to alter the surrounding method and the block to refer to instance variables in this object , and if any of those variables are arguments to the surrounding scope , we need to copy them .
An example
Here 's a simple example using a closure .
Note the use of s-expressions here because we 're now starting to get bitten by the changes we 've done to turn Ruby code by default into method calls ( the way it should be ) without having put in the pre-requisite work to implement the number classes and Kernel methods ( such as print to replace the libc printf ) .
Ignore that for now .
def mkcounter step cnt = 0 lambda do %s ( assign cnt ( add cnt step ) ) %s ( printf " cnt : %d
" cnt ) end end cnt = mkcounter ( 5 ) cnt .
call puts " Calling again ... " cnt .
call puts " Done "
And here 's the expected output :
cnt : 5 Calling again ... cnt : 10 Done
And here 's the syntax tree after we 've done the required transformations ( more about that in a second ) :
[ : do , [ : defm , : mkcounter , [ : step ] , [ : let , [ : __env__ , :__tmp_proc ] , [ : sexp , [ : assign , : __env__ , [ : call , :malloc , [ 8 ] ] ] ] , [ :assign , [ :index , :__env__ , 1 ] , : step ] , [ :assign , [ :index , :__env__ , 0 ] , 0 ] , [ : do , [ : assign , :__tmp_proc , [ : defun , " .L2 " , [ :self , :__closure__ , : __env__ ] , [ : let , [ ] , [ : sexp , [ : assign , [ :index , : __env__ , 0 ] , [ : add , [ :index , : __env__ , 0 ] , [ :index , : __env__ , 1 ] ] ] ] , [ : sexp , [ : printf , " cnt : %d \ n " , [ :index , : __env__ , 0 ] ] ] ] ] ] , [ : sexp , [ : call , :__new_proc , [ :__tmp_proc , :__env__ ] ] ] ] ] ] , [ :assign , : cnt , [ : call , : mkcounter , 5 ] ] , [ : callm , : cnt , : call ] , [ : call , :puts , [ [ : sexp , [ : call , :__get_string , :" .L0 " ] ] ] ] , [ : callm , : cnt , : call ] , [ : call , :puts , [ [ : sexp , [ : call , :__get_string , :" .L1 " ] ] ] ] ]
That 's a bit of a mouthful , so lets go through it the new bits
[ :let , [ : __env__ , :__tmp_proc ] ,
This is added to hold a pointer to the environment we create to hold cnt and step , and to hold a pointer to the function we use to create the Proc respectively .
[ :sexp , [ : assign , : __env__ , [ : call , :malloc , [ 8 ] ] ] ] , [ :assign , [ :index , :__env__ , 1 ] , : step ] , [ : assign , [ :index , : __env__ , 0 ] , 0 ] ,
Then we allocate the environment .
We copy the argument , and from now on we use ( index env 1 ) to refer to step .
We then carry out the cnt = 0 statement .
cnt and step are both moved into the environment because they are used inside the closure .
( You may have already picked up that we currently wo n't handle nested closures - lets leave some fun for later )
[ :assign , :__tmp_proc , [ : defun , " .L2 " , [ :self , :__closure__ , : __env__ ] ,
Then we create a function and assign the address of the function to __tmp_proc .
As you can see there are tree synthetic arguments to it :
self , __closure__ and __env__ .
The first is , as you 'd expect , the object the method is called on .
The second is to be used when passing blocks to a method , and the third is used to refer to the environment when inside .
( Something I just realized : We 're begging for a name clash , if there 's a closure defined inside that needs a separate environment .
Obnoxious details ; later )
[ :assign , [ :index , : __env__ , 0 ] , [ : add , [ :index , : __env__ , 0 ] , [ :index , :__env__ , 1 ] ] ] ] ,
And this monstrosity is what cnt = cnt + step was turned into .
Now , to make this work , we obviously need this __new_proc function , and a Proc #call that 's sensible .
Here 's our current Proc :
class Proc def call %s ( call ( index self 1 ) ( self 0 ( index self 2 ) ) ) end end %s ( defun __new_proc ( addr env ) ( let ( p ) ( assign p ( malloc 12 ) ) ( assign ( index p 0 ) Proc ) ( assign ( index p 1 ) addr ) ( assign ( index p 2 ) env ) p ) )
Very simplistic and rather ugly , but it does the work .
As you can see , the environment pointer is stored in the Proc object , and Proc #call hides the ugliness .
You may notice that this is inefficient - an extra level of indirection .
Indeed it is - we can in theory make the environment part of the Proc object and save an indexed lookup , and there 's a bunch of other tricks waiting .
But again , that 's optimizations we wont deal with now .
For now , lets move on to how to do the appropriate changes to get the example output above .
Some refactoring , and a few rewrites
Almost all the changes for this is in the Compiler class , and the code in question is now in the transform.rb file .
There are some other small changes , but I do n't think they need to be covered in detail .
Specifically , transform.rb represents the start of a bit of refactoring .
Some constructs in the Compiler class can be built easily on top of more primitive operations .
lambda was an example of that .
Overall , a lot of things can be done by rewriting the parse tree .
Doing it that was has the distinct advantage that it 's possible to switch the various rewrites on / off to debug their effects , and to see the result long before it ends up as machine code .
It also helps isolate the CPU architecture specific parts further .
As a first step , transform.rb contains methods that solely rewrite the syntax tree .
They are still currently part of the Compiler class , and do make use of the Emitter ( specifically Emitter.get_local to get a unique label ) , but this can be changed later .
Unfortunately not all of these rewrites are small and simple .
In this round , we 're left with three :
rewrite_strconst
rewrite_let_env
rewrite_lambda
rewrite_strconst used to be in compiler.rb and is mostly unchanged .
rewrite_lambda
rewrite_lambda replaces the lambda handling in compiler.rb with a rewriting step that looks like this :
def rewrite_lambda ( exp ) exp .
depth_first do | e | next : skip if e [ 0 ] == : sexp if e [ 0 ] == : lambda args = e [ 1 ] || [ ] body = e [ 2 ] || nil e .
clear e [ 0 ] = : do e [ 1 ] = [ : assign , :__tmp_proc , [ : defun , @e .
get_local , [ : self , :__closure__ , : __env__ ]+ args , body ] ] e [ 2 ] = [ : sexp , [ : call , :__new_proc , [ :__tmp_proc , :__env__ ] ] ] end end end
What this rewrite does , is use our Array # depth_first method from extensions.rb to descend down the parse tree looking for : lambda nodes .
It will skip any : sexp nodes , as they are used as " guards " to mark areas that should not be touched by rewrites .
When it finds a : lambda , it will replace the : lamda with this :
%s ( do ( assign __tmp_proc ( defun [ result of @e.get_local ( self __closure__ __env__ [ + args ] ) [ body ] ) ) ( sexp call __new_proc ( __tmp_proc __env__ ) ) )
Effectively defining the lambda ( as we did before ) , but then calling __new_proc with the result .
You 'll note __tmp_proc is seemingly superfluous .
It is in fact a workaround for a slight problem :
The call needs to be within a sexp to not be rewritten to a callm ( Ruby method call ) , but the defun can't be within a sexp , or other rewrites wo n't touch the body of the defun .
We 'll clean that up later .
rewrite_let_env
Now for the hairy bit .
Really hairy .
The goal of this one is to identify variables in the methods - this used to happen in the parser in a really simplistic way - combined with identifying : lambda nodes ( and so this must run before rewrite_lambda ) and lifting variables that are used inside the closure into an environment , and update the : let in the surrounding method definition to have a suitable environment .
It then also adds code to allocate the environment , as well as to shadow method arguments .
Finally it rewrites accesses to variables that have been lifted into the environment , so that it uses % s ( index __env__ offset ) instead of the variable name .
Let 's go through the code .
def rewrite_let_env ( exp ) exp .
depth_first ( : defm ) do | e |
We 're hunting for : defm nodes only .
Everything else will be ignored .
vars , env = find_vars ( e [ 3 ] , [ Set [* e [ 2 ] ] ] , Set . new )
First step is to find a candidate set of variables .
find_vars is another new method , and we 'll go over that next .
e[ 3 ] is the body of the method .
find_vars is recursive , and we pass in the methods arguments ( e [ 2 ] ) as the starting " scope " .
Third we pass in an empty
Set as the the starting point for the environment .
vars -= Set [* e [ 2 ] ] .
to_a
We remove the method arguments , as we 'll use vars to create a : let node later on .
if env . size > 0
If find_vars found any variables to make part of the environment , we need to :
body = e [ 3 ] rewrite_env_vars ( body , env . to_a )
Rewrite access to the members of the environment
notargs = env - Set [* e [ 2 ] ] aenv = env .
to_a extra_assigns = ( env - notargs ) . to_a .
collect do | a | [ : assign , [ : index , : __env__ , aenv . index ( a ) ] , a ] end
Create assigns to copy all arguments that are used in the closures from the arguments on the stack into the environment
e [ 3 ] = [ [ : sexp , [ :assign , : __env__ , [ : call , : malloc , [ env . size * 4 ] ] ] ] ]
Allocate the environment
e [ 3 ]. concat ( extra_assigns ) e [ 3 ]. concat ( body )
Tack on the extra assigns and the body .
end vars << :__env__ vars << :__tmp_proc e [ 3 ] = [ : let , vars ,* e [ 3 ] ]
Then we create a : let node with the new variable set , including __env__ and __tmp_proc which we 've seen elsewhere .
: skip end end
Finally we skip any nodes below the : defm so the depth_first call does not waste time .
find_vars
The purpose of find_vars is to identify variables that should be put in a let node as well as that should be part of a closure environment .
This one is hairy , and a clear candidate for looking for ways to clean up later
def find_vars(e , scopes , env , in_lambda = false , in_assign = false )
return [ ] , env , false if !
e
First of all , if we 've been called with a nil expression , there are now variables to return , and the same environment passed in .
e = [ e ] if ! e . is_a ? ( Array ) e . each do | n | if n . is_a ? ( Array )
An expression ?
if n [ 0 ] == : assign vars1 , env1 = find_vars ( n [ 1 ] , scopes + [ Set . new ] , env , in_lambda , true ) vars2 , env2 = find_vars ( n [ 2 ..- 1 ] , scopes + [ Set . new ] , env , in_lambda ) env = env1 + env2 vars = vars1 + vars2 vars .
each {| v | push_var ( scopes , env , v ) }
If it 's an assignment , then we want to process both the left hand and right hand , but we need to mark the left hand since variables on the left hand introduce a new variable in the scope .
elsif n [ 0 ] == : lambda vars , env = find_vars ( n [ 2 ] , scopes + [ Set . new ] , env , true ) n [ 2 ] = [ : let , vars , * n [ 2 ] ]
Special casing on : lambda because if we 're handling a closure , and variables found inside the closure that were defined outside means that those variables needs to be lifted into the closure environment we 're creating so that they 're not allocated on the stack .
else if n [ 0 ] == : callm then sub = n [ 3 ..- 1 ] elsif n [ 0 ] == : call then sub = n [ 2 ..- 1 ] else sub = n [ 1 ..- 1 ] end vars , env = find_vars ( sub , scopes , env , in_lambda ) vars .
each {| v | push_var ( scopes , env , v ) } end
Finally we special case on : callm and : call when handling the remainder , because they have arguments that are not sub-expressions to be considered when creating the closure environment .
elsif n . is_a ? ( Symbol ) sc = in_scopes ( scopes , n ) if sc .
size == 0 push_var ( scopes , env , n ) if in_assign
If n is a variable that does not exist in any of the scopes we keep track of , and it is not part of the environment , and it's on the left hand of an assign , we add it to the top scope .
NOTE : This current version is buggy .
Not every variable potentially occuring on the left hand side should be added , just the one assigned to .
elsif in_lambda sc .
first .
delete ( n ) env << n end
If it is in a scope and we 're in a lambda , then the variable needs to be moved ( deleted ) from that scope and added to the closure environment .
end end return scopes [- 1 ]. to_a , env end
Finally we return the innermost scope from this level and the environment
rewrite_env_vars
Finally let 's look at rewrite_env_vars .
When we 've gathered together all the variables for the closure environment , we have an array , and any accesses to those variables needs to be rewritten to ( index __env__ num ) .
That 's done like this , and I hope this one is simple enough not to go through line for line :
def rewrite_env_vars ( exp , env ) exp .
depth_first do | e | STDERR . puts e . inspect e .
each_with_index do | ex , i | num = env . index ( ex ) if num e [ i ] = [ : index , : __env__ , num ] end end end end
Next steps
We still have n't actually added support for define_method , but we now finally have most of the plumbing .
That 's the next step .
Then I want to start alternating between something more practical : Making the compiler compile early / simple versions of itself , and let it " eat its own tail " so to speak , and secondly to start refactoring and cleaning it up .
Should You Use a Business / IT Liaison Person ?
No !
The question about the pros and cons of using a business / IT liaison person came up at a meeting I attended last week .
I ’ve got to admit some bias on this issue .
Long ago I tried using a business / IT liaison person for one of my software development groups , and I was n’t happy with the result .
The person typically assigned to a liaison job seldom has enough technical savvy or in - depth application experience to fairly represent IT to the business .
As a result , the liaison person will often make inappropriate technical assumptions that create unrealistic expectations for the business .
That ’s what happened when I tried using a liaison , and I ended up getting rid of the position .
Here ’s the Problem
In theory using a liaison person sounds like a good idea .
We know that many IT people have difficulty communicating with business people , and so it seems reasonable to put a “ translator ” in place .
But while language translators like those in the United Nations mostly translate what ’s being said in an unbiased way without having their own agenda , the same can not be said for liaison people .
Invariably I ’ve found that over time the liaison people gravitate toward either the business or IT camps , and begin to take sides in disagreements .
Often their job turns into more of an expeditor function than a translation function — they badger the IT people to get the business people what they ’ve asked for , and usually do little to clarify requirements or to help negotiate a smaller set of requirements that can be delivered faster .
Eventually a two - way disagreement between business and IT evolves into a two - way disagreement through an intermediary .
This magnifies the problems rather than solving them , since all of the interactions take longer , and it ’s much less likely that personal relationships will develop between the business people and the IT people .
Often the business people will feel better using a liaison person , but the IT organization will lose touch with what ’s really going on in the business .
The net long - term result will drive a wedge between business and IT .
Why Do Companies Use a Liaison ?
So if liaison people are so likely to cause problems , why do so many companies use them ?
There are a number of scenarios :
The business forces the position on the IT organization .
This is a sure sign of imminent IT organization failure , and usually precedes the search for a new CIO .
The business is essentially saying , “ I ’ve given up on dealing with you — give me someone new to talk to . ”
The IT organization is so caught up in constant interruptions that they create the liaison position to keep the business people off their back — kind of like setting up a complaint department .
Again , this is not a good sign .
Why are the interruptions occurring ?
You should solve the problem instead of trying to cover it up .
The IT organization has done a poor job of hiring project leaders and analysts with business communication skills , and the liaison position is created in an attempt to work around the hiring problem .
The business organization has abdicated their own responsibility for designing and improving business processes , and the liaison position is created to fill the gap .
In some cases this means that the liaison person tries to design systems ( usually with limited success due to lack of experience ) .
In the worst case ( I ’ve seen this happen ) , the liaison person can get so frustrated with the IT group that the liaison person tries to outsource the systems design or even purchase an outside system directly without going through the IT organization at all .
But guess who ends up inheriting the support and integration of the outsourced system ?
The IT organization , of course .
Is There a Solution ?
If you ’ve already fallen into the liaison trap — or if you ’re seriously considering it , then here ’s my advice :
1. First , get the support of your CEO ( or lower - level senior executive if you ’re trying to solve this problem at a lower organization level ) for integrating process and system responsibility into the business organization .
I ’m not talking about the technical responsibility — that stays with IT .
I ’m just saying that business processes ( how a business operation is carried out ) are a part of the business — not something that should be handled by IT .
2 . A business should be responsible for the processes it uses — you ca n’t delegate processes to another organization like IT .
Bring in a process consultant if necessary , but some way or another , get a basic understanding of the fundamental business processes that you use in your business , and how the computer systems fit into those processes .
3 . Get an overall picture of the status of each of your business processes .
Are they working well ?
Do they need improvement ?
Are they broken ?
Can they handle the current and future volumes that are required by your business ?
Are they cost effective ?
Where deficiencies are noted , what plans exist for corrective action ?
Joint meetings between business and IT people are required to plan and implement the required corrective action .
4. Eliminate the liaison position (s ) .
Replace them with regularly scheduled get - togethers between business and IT people .
Hold joint training sessions if necessary to improve communication between the two groups .
It ’s not important for business people to understand all of the technical stuff in IT , but it is a requirement that IT people understand the fundamental aspects of the business processes they support , and are able to communicate with the business using business language .
If your people ca n’t do this , then find someone who can ( as a replacement — not as the totally unnecessary liaison position ) .
5 . Prioritize your business needs so that IT can focus its limited resources on the most important things .
Many liaison positions are really just ways of coping with a lack of business priorities .
When everyone in business wants everything at once , how do you expect anyone to successfully perform ?
Having a liaison does n’t solve the problem — it just gives you a full - time person to hear complaints .
6 . If you do n’t have an IT strategy to help you prioritize your IT effort , then get one .
See some of my other articles on strategy , or take a look at my book or white paper on the subject .
Conclusion
There are situations in life where a liaison person makes sense .
You typically see the liaison position successfully used when two independent organizations want to share information .
For example , the liaison job is widely used to coordinate the sharing of information between different parts of the armed forces , or between different government agencies .
The key to success in these situations is that there are no critical dependencies and few time - critical issues .
That ’s not the case between the business and IT organizations , where there are many dependencies and tons of time - critical issues .
Using a liaison person forces you to do partial delegation — something that ’s almost impossible to control .
To the IT organization , the liaison person is representing the needs of the business users , but you ca n’t get user buy - in through a liaison , so a project failure is much more likely .
To the business organization , the liaison person is representing the collective technical expertise of the IT organization , but the nuances of design choices often get lost in the translation .
To both organizations , the liaison person creates a barrier to trust — how can you trust the members of the organization when you do n’t ever spend any time with them ?
The net result is that using a liaison person is a short - term way to postpone dealing with a longer - term problem .
You ’re better off facing the problem directly and helping your business and IT organizations work together to achieve a good day - to - day trusting relationship .
How Does Your Experience Differ ?
I have heard no stories about the successful long - term use of business / IT liaison people .
I occasionally hear about a short - term success , but invariably the stories have an unhappy ending in the long term .
If you have a story of long - term success , I ’d like to hear it .
Arkansas officials have seized a shipment of human heads destined for a Medtronic facility in Fort Worth , Texas , and continued to hold the body parts Thursday pending an investigation .
“ We want to make sure everything is above board before we allow these human specimens to be shipped around the country , ” Garland Camper , the coroner in Pulaski County , Ark. , said in an interview .
The shipment included four heads and 40 temporal lobes that were to be used in Medtronic medical research , said Brian Henry , a spokesman for the Fridley - based medical device company .
Such shipments are routine , Henry said , but “ the supplier that we were working with in this instance had apparently mislabeled the package . ”
“ There ’s something that was unclear with the paperwork , ” he added .
Camper said his office was contacted about the heads June 9 after Transportation Security Administration workers questioned the shipment at the Little Rock National Airport .
The coroner ’s office took custody of the parts and requested documentation from the group responsible for the shipment .
Camper said discrepancies exist in the paperwork submitted by the supplier , but he declined to elaborate .
“ We do n’t know if this is part of an illegal trade ; we ’re trying to make sure we can rule that out . ”
Medtronic and other medical manufacturers routinely use human specimens to develop and improve medical products , Henry said .
The Texas facility in question makes surgical tools for neurosurgery , and having access to human specimens is an important part of the medical research that goes on there , he said .
Specimens come from people who have donated their bodies to science for this type of research .
“ It ’s a very common practice to ship these , ” he said , “ and it ’s very uncommon that there would be questions . ”

Shame on you for editing ( cropping ) photos depicting wounded Israeli soldiers in a way that hides the cold weapons ( knives and metal clubs ) in the hands of the “ peaceful ” voyagers .
Unfortunately , Reuters looses its stature as an unbiased media outlet time and time again .
Amir
I would think the knife a “ peace activist ” was holding over a wounded Israeli soldier would be part of the news context .
But that would involve impartial journalism , and Reuters ’ own anti-Israel activism would take a hit .
Do n’t worry , I ’ll take care of alerting appropriate media watchdogs ; we ’ve seen Reuters photography in action before .
Jaff
You cropped those pictures to deliberately omit weapons shown in the hands of the Turkish ships ’ passengers including knives and broken bottles , and also cropped out a pool of blood from a wounded Israeli soldier and also entirely cropped out another wounded Israeli soldier covered in blood .
Shame on you .
You need to come clean and admit what you did and issue a correction .
Your cropping of these photos demonstrates that Reuters is not an objective news agency .
Steve
Cropped photos from the IHH ship used by your news service are being shown all over the web .
This is clearly a case where cropping changed the message of the photo .
I would like an explanation , and would like your service to put constraints on when cropping is allowed .
Mindy
A number of readers contacted us about this .
At the top and bottom you can see our initial cropped versions on the left , and the full frame versions on the right .
The images in question were made available in Istanbul , and following normal editorial practice were prepared for dissemination which included cropping at the edges .
When we realized that a dagger was inadvertently cropped from the images , Reuters immediately moved the original set , as well .
We also used one of the uncropped photos on our reuters.com home page , and linked to a slideshow which used both full - frame knife shots : GBU Editor

Well , let ’s hope they ’re NASA engineers , because this feature is head - bangingly unstable .
After two days of fiddling , downloading and uninstalling apps , manually force - quitting programs and waiting for servers to be upgraded , I finally got video calling to work — sort of .
Sometimes there was only audio and a black screen , sometimes only a freeze - frame ; at best , the video was blocky and the audio delay absurd .
To make video calling work , you have to install an app yourself : either Fring or Qik .
But we never did get Fring to work , and Qik requires people you call to press a Talk button when they want to speak .
The whole thing is confusing and , to use the technical term , iffy .
But come on — this is the first 4G phone in America !
That ’s got to be better than 3G , right ?
Hard to say , since I could n’t find any 4G reception , even in weeks of traveling .
My problem , evidently , was that I was visiting major cities like New York , Boston and San Francisco .
So far , Sprint has installed 4G coverage in only 32 areas — and they ’re bustling metropolises like Boise , Idaho ; Wichita Falls , Tex . ; High Point , N.C. ; and Milledgeville , Ga .

Fortunately , my Times tech colleague , Roy Furchgott , has three things going for him : he also had an Evo to test , he ’s a fellow tech reporter and he lives in Baltimore , one of the 4G cities .
So I asked him to put the Evo through its paces for me .
His tests indicate that 4G Internet downloads are about four times as fast as 3G ( averaging 2,693 kilobits a second , versus 676 over 3G ) .
He noted that Internet videos do n’t stutter , and of course e-mail attachments fly in .
He also noted , however , that the 4G signal was “ spottier than a kennel of Dalmatians . ”
At his house , he sees four to five signal bars , but two blocks away there is no reception at all .
Furthermore , it takes 20 seconds for the phone to recognize that a 4G signal is available , then six minutes to connect for the first time .

They are the most tragic victims of the Gulf Coast oil spill .
The 11 people who died when a BP oil rig exploded April 20 will be honored today as President Obama welcomes their families to the White House .
Obama wanted to offer his condolences face - to - face , spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
The reception will be in the State Dining Room .
The president and the families will also discuss " safety conditions and what type of changes can and must be made in the regulatory framework to ensure that deepwater drilling that goes forward is done in a way that is safe and not life - threatening , " Gibbs said .
Another goal of the meeting :
To make sure the oil rig workers are not forgotten .
" They were the very first victims of what is a very long and sad tragedy , " Gibbs said .
" It has changed the lives of many .
It changed first the lives of those 11 families .
It will do untold economic and environmental damage .
It 's the largest economic disaster that this country has ever seen . "
" They 're certainly not forgotten . "
Our pal Suzannne Malveaux of CNN spoke to a couple of family members who will be at the White House today .
Keith Jones , whose son Gordon was on the rig , said he wants the president to know that Gordon had a light heart and wanted to make people laugh .
Jones also defended Obama 's performance with respect to the oil spill .
" I do n't know what people expect him to do , if they expect him to go down and clean pelicans , " Jones told CNN .
" But I think that the criticism of the president that I 've seen is from the public relations standpoint . "

I returned home from a shopping excursion a few weeks ago to find a " notice of visit " from the US Census Bureau affixed to my front door .
I had been expecting such a notice for some time because , unlike my friends , I had not received a census form in the mail .
A few days later a census worker arrived at my door , and I was ready to politely present her with my refusal to answer her questions — a response to the census I had decided to make months earlier when I learnt the census was taking place .
Libertarians who consistently oppose the use of aggression and who recognize the inherently aggressive nature of the state are continually faced with dilemmas over whether to comply with state dictates and how best to oppose them if they choose to .
All of the available options involve costs and compromises .
One may simply refuse to comply and face the financial and legal consequences of doing so .
Thoreau — along with later adherents of his philosophy such as Gandhi and Martin Luther King Junior — was an advocate of such peaceful noncompliance , writing ,
Under a government which imprisons any unjustly , the true place for a just man is also a prison … the only house in a slave - state in which a free man can abide with honor .
If any think that their influence would be lost there , and their voices no longer afflict the ear of the State , that they would not be as an enemy within its walls , they do not know by how much truth is stronger than error , nor how much more eloquently and effectively he can combat injustice who has experienced a little in his own person .
Cast your whole vote , not a strip of paper merely , but your whole influence .
A minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority ; it is not even a minority then ; but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight .
If the alternative is to keep all just men in prison , or give up war and slavery , the State will not hesitate which to choose .
If a thousand men were not to pay their tax - bills this year , that would not be a violent and bloody measure , as it would be to pay them , and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood .
This is , in fact , the definition of a peaceable revolution , if any such is possible . [ 1 ]
A second approach is to flee and seek refuge in a country whose impositions seem less burdensome .
Escape has long been a popular choice of those seeking to avoid the brutality of war , such as the estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Americans who moved to Canada during the US invasion and occupation of Vietnam — or , more recently , Americans wishing to avoid redeployment to Iraq .
[ 2 ]
There are many costs to leaving one 's country , including the loss of home and separation from friends and family , plus punitive taxation of assets . [ 3 ]
Finally , the libertarian can comply , recognizing that while submission may aid the state in its various aggressive activities , the burden of guilt does not fall upon the libertarian but upon those who tacitly or explicitly accept the legitimacy of the state .
As Manuel Lora contends , libertarians should not be called upon to be martyrs in the cause of liberty :
The problems that libertarians face — some trivial and others quite serious — are moral hazards created by the existence of the state .
Given that we do not legitimize state action we are not culpable of the aggression that it causes .
…
Nor does [ libertarianism ] require us to drastically reduce our already limited lives .
…
[ L ] iberty and the ideals of freedom , peace and voluntary exchange are just that — ideals .
They are meant to guide our actions towards whatever ends we might chose in life .
They are not necessarily ends themselves .
Do not martyr yourself .
Stay away from the libertarian sacrificial altar . [ 4 ]
My own view is something of a compromise between the positions advocated by Thoreau and Lora .
Where possible , I seek to avoid compliance with state dictates and interaction with state agencies .
For instance , when costs are comparable I always prefer a private shipper , such as FedEx or UPS , to the postal service .
However , when the state employs draconian punishments to compel submission , I will comply .
For example , I pay my taxes because I do not wish to suffer the same fate as Irwin Schiff , a peaceful tax protestor who was sentenced to 13 years in prison for an entirely nonviolent " crime . "
In the case of the census , I had considered the consequences of noncompliance and deemed them tolerable , so I decided to refuse to answer any questions .
It was thus that I opened my door to speak with the census worker waiting on my porch .
A Visit from the Census Bureau
I opened my door and the census worker informed me that she worked for the Census Bureau and needed a few minutes of my time to answer some questions .
I asked her what the consequences were for not answering , and she replied that it was " illegal " to refuse but that there were no consequences .
It was immediately clear she was ignorant of the provisions covering noncompliance with the census , which I read when I had originally received the notice of visit .
According to US code , anyone refusing to answer the census " shall be fined not more than $ 100 . " [ 5 ]
" In 1943 the Census Bureau divulged data that was used to identify Japanese Americans , who were then confined in concentration camps for the remaining duration of World War II — a fact that was suppressed by the bureau for over 50 years . "
The worker then attempted to convince me of the importance of the census and reassure me that any data collected would remain private .
I explained to her that my refusal to answer was not from a fear that my personal information would be divulged by the Census Bureau , but because I rejected any state action in principle due to the state 's inherently aggressive nature .
She seemed confused by my reason but dutifully noted that I had refused to answer .
She left my house after giving me a rather ominous warning that I was likely to face further " harassment " from census workers in the near future .
The threat of harassment was not idle , either .
According to constitutional attorney John Whitehead ,
Published and privately reported accounts of similar encounters between American citizens and government enumerators suggest that some Census workers are adopting an aggressive and harassing modus operandi . [ 6 ]
Reports of harassment include census workers looking through private mail and forcing their way into private residences .
Whitehead further reports that 1,800 census takers employed by the Census Bureau had criminal records , a fact that was only discovered after they were hired .
It was with this knowledge in mind that I waited , with some trepidation , for a second visit from the Census Bureau .
A Second Visit from the Census Bureau
A week after the first visit paid me by the Census Bureau , a second worker arrived at my door .
While I did not feel threatened by her at any time , she was far more insistent and obnoxious than her predecessor , harrying me long after I had made it clear that I did not wish to answer any questions .
The manner in which she attempted to convince me of the importance of complying with the census and the reasoning she used were deeply revealing of the ideologically statist thinking that is pervasive today .
After I informed the worker that I had previously refused to answer any questions on principle — and thus that I would refuse to answer her questions — she warned me that participation in the census was " mandatory . "
I replied that I was aware of the potential consequences and still did not wish to comply , whereupon she switched strategies , trying persuasion by utilitarian arguments .
The worker explained that without the census the government would not be able to correctly allocate its funds to the various states .
Of course , the government has no funds , but only that which it violently appropriates from the population , and I explained that such violent redistribution of private property was entirely immoral .
Like the first worker who visited my house , the second was confused about the aggressive nature of the state .
I explained to her that , as Ludwig von Mises observed , all government action ultimately resorts to the use or threat of aggression .
Mises wrote ,
It is important to remember that government interference always means either violent action or the threat of such action .
Government is in the last resort the employment of armed men , of policemen , gendarmes , soldiers , prison guards , and hangmen .
The essential feature of government is the enforcement of its decrees by beating , killing , and imprisoning . [ 7 ]
The worker was apparently confused by the basis of my principled rejection and told me that while other government agencies might employ aggression , the conducting of the census did not require it .
She went on , in a vain attempt to placate me , saying that all the data collected was strictly confidential and that it was not even shared with other government agencies .
She emphasized that not once in the history of the nation had data from the census been shared with other government agencies .
" It is merely the widespread recognition of the illegitimacy of the state that would cause it to dissolve . "
This was , in fact , a bald - faced lie .
In 1943 the Census Bureau divulged data that was used to identify Japanese Americans , who were then confined in concentration camps for the remaining duration of World War II — a fact that was suppressed by the bureau for over 50 years .
[ 8 ]
More recently , the Census Bureau provided specially tabulated statistics to the Department of Homeland Security to help identify Arab Americans .
In a final , exasperated attempt to convince me of the importance of the census , the worker rhetorically asked me whether I used the road in front of my house , and triumphantly added that without the census — and the accompanying redistribution of purloined property — there would be no public schools and America 's children would grow up illiterate .
The worker was confusing , as the great 19th - century French economist Frederic Bastiat explained , the distinction between government and society , thinking that if the state did not provision for some service , it could not exist at all .
Bastiat wrote ,
Socialism , like the ancient ideas from which it springs , confuses the distinction between government and society .
As a result of this , every time we object to a thing being done by government , the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all .
We disapprove of state education .
Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education .
We object to a state religion .
Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all .
We object to a state - enforced equality .
Then they say that we are against equality .
And so on , and so on .
It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain . [ 9 ]
I explained to the worker that , while I did use the road , I did not approve of the unjustified manner in which its construction was funded , and I added that roads could be provided peacefully by the market .
As Walter Block explains , private roads would not only be more efficient and result in fewer automobile fatalities and catastrophic bridge failures , but they would also be morally preferable to a statist road system . [ 10 ]
I further explained that the public school system in America was the cause of , rather than the solution to , the scourge of illiteracy that exists in the country .
According to the National Adult Literacy Survey , over 40 million Americans read at the lowest level of proficiency . [ 11 ]
And while funding for public education has doubled in real terms over the last 15 years , [ 12 ] there has been little discernable increase in the reading proficiency of the average , 8th - grade , American student — which remains at an abysmally low level . [ 13 ]
I also endeavored to explain that , contrary to the widely believed canard that the public school system was instituted to educate America 's youth , early proponents of public schooling openly admitted that their true purpose was to forcibly inculcate children with an abiding devotion to the state .
As Edward Ross , a progressive sociologist , wrote in his 1901 treatise Social Control : A Survey of the Foundations of Order ,
To collect little plastic lumps of human dough from private households and shape them on the social kneading - board . …
And so it happens that the role of the schoolmaster in the social economy is just beginning . [ 14 ]
John Swett , sometimes referred to as the father of California 's public school system , wrote ,
Cast your eye over the map of our country to - day , and show me a section of States from which men shed their blood most freely in battle for the defense of the Union , and I will show you that such States have also expended the most money for public schools ….
[ The public school system 's ] crowning achievement is that they have educated an army of half a million of men who have volunteered to sustain the national flag with a bayonet . [ 15 ]
Not only were early proponents of public schooling open about their desire to shape children to be complaisant to a statist social order , they were equally open about their desire to forcibly carry out their agenda .
An article from the Massachusetts Teacher , which appeared in 1851 , concludes ,
With the old not much can be done ; but with their children , the great remedy is education .
The rising generation must be taught as our own children are taught .
We say must be , because in many instances this can only be accomplished by coercion .
…
Nothing can operate effectually here but stringent legislation , thoroughly carried out by an efficient police ; the children must be gathered up and forced into school , and those who resist or impede this plan , whether parents or priests , must be held accountable and punished . [ 16 ]
Clearly there are some deep flaws to the shibboleth that public schooling was benevolently instituted to improve literacy among America 's children .
Recognizing that her utilitarian arguments had failed to persuade me of the beneficence of publicly funded roads or schools , the census worker entreated me one last time to " at least " tell her how many people lived in my house .
When I steadfastly refused , she lingered on my porch for a few moments , glowering at me , before noting my refusal on her census sheet and leaving my house .
Conclusion
Libertarians are often confronted by the difficult choice of how their principled rejection of state aggression should manifest itself in practice .
There is no perfect solution , and all potential choices involve costs and compromises .
My own approach has been to avoid compliance and interactions with the state when I believe the cost to myself and my family is tolerable .
The census is an example of a government program that I refused to comply with , knowing that I could be fined for doing so .
While the census is not the most barbaric or intrusive activity conducted by the state , it is crucial for the state 's most pernicious behavior and its defining characteristic — namely , the massive appropriation and redistribution of private property .
The conducting of the census itself also consumes considerable tax revenue .
The Census Bureau spent billions of dollars employing 3.8 million workers to conduct the 2010 census — workers who were diverted from the productive private sector and put to the purpose of prying into the lives of millions of American families , many of whom wished to be left in peace . [ 17 ]
My aim in refusing to participate in the census was twofold : to explicitly withdraw my consent — or , as Ayn Rand called it , " the sanction of the victim " [ 18 ] — and to use my experience as a starting point to explain the aggressive nature of the state to others , including the census workers .
For it is merely the widespread recognition of the illegitimacy of the state that would cause it to dissolve .
As Etienne la Boettie exhorted in his brilliant essay Discours de la Servitude Volontaire ,
Resolve to serve no more , and you are at once freed .
I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over , but simply that you support him no longer ; then you will behold him , like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away , fall of his own weight and break into pieces . [ 19 ]
At the recent Ars Technica and Wired Smart Salon event , I participated in a panel on barriers to cloud adoption .
The general idea behind the panel was to take a look at the common sources of skepticism and criticism of cloud computing , and to talk through the concerns .
One of the panelists was Ping Li , a partner at Accel Partners , a Palo Alto VC firm .
Ping focuses on cloud infrastructure , so I caught up with him at the Accel offices in Palo Alto yesterday to get more of his perspective on investing in the cloud .
JS : So tell me a little bit about your portfolio and what you 're focusing on right now .
PL : I focus a lot on infrastructure and platforms , and that can be both digital media and gaming , as well as more traditional datacenter platforms .
These days , a lot of that is cloud - related .
And in terms of cloud , I 've been really focused on the enablers of the new cloud stack , as well as potential applications that are going to be created for the first time because there 's a new cloud stack .
An example of an enabler that we 're involved with is a company called Cloudera , which is the company behind the open - source project Hadoop , and that 's really about " how can you manage large - scale data in a cloud environment to do data processing , data extraction , etc . "
It 's been used in the Web 2.0 world but now it 's starting to penetrate more broadly than that .
An example of a cloud application is this company called Lookout that I just invested in , which is a mobile security company that 's leveraging cloud infrastructure to do open mobile handset device virus scanning and malware detection .
Historically people would just say , let 's put heavy client on the cell phone , but that 's just not going to work from a battery life perspective .
So these guys have smartly partitioned some of their processing in the cloud , and some on the endpoints , so you can actually get a good user experience while having protection at the same time .
So I 've been kind of looking up and down the stack , all the way from bits and bytes up to the application layer , to see what the next - generation cloud ecosystem is going to look like .
JS : When you say " the new cloud stack , " give me some perspective on how you 've seen the evolution of the stack in the past two years .
PL : The evolution of the stack starts with the mainframe , and everyone is always trying to recreate the mainframe by taking advantage of new technologies .
So client - server was taking advantage of processing technology .
Web services enabled applications to be networked more efficiently .
A lot of cloud innovation has been at the data layer — a lot of the interesting things have been with data processing but also with data storage and data transaction .
So there 's all the movement between , say , the NoSQL crowd and the new cloud - type Oracle databases .
So there 's been a lot of innovation in that area of the stack .
But even going up the stack , you can see people wanting to recreate the functionalities of a mainframe but in a new world .
So , security : what does " cloud security " mean ?
A lot of interesting companies are doing stuff around single sign - on .
You have 15 cloud apps , so how do you manage that in the enterprise — who gets access to what and when ?
We 've seen cloud logging companies — these are all different services that were part of the traditional stack that are now being decomponentized and rebuilt in a cloud framework .
I do n't think it 's a revolution as much as it's an evolution .
If you want to really say what kicked this thing off , virtualization was a big precursor to cloud .
You had to get comfortable extracting applications from infrastructure in order to embrace the cloud .
We invested in XenSource , and if Xen was n't around , who knows if EC2 or S3 would be what it is today .
So a lot of those building blocks have been in the making .
I think " cloud " is a little bit overused right now .
I look at it as the evolution of the datacenter , to do more scalable processing and computing .
JS : So it sounds like your bigger thesis is that a lot of the traditional centralized compute , mainframe - type things are being redone in this cloudy way , so then you guys look at what are the obvious holes that have n't yet been plugged .
PL : Yeah , exactly .
At the end of the day , if you take the top - down view , an application needs all those services .
It needs partitioning , security , systems management , networking , provisioning , a database — it still needs all these things .
I do n't think you can really break the laws of computing , necessarily .
But I think there will be newer technologies that did n't exist before that will allow you to do things in ways that you could n't .
Multitenancy , for example , is something that existed before in the time - sharing world , but now it means something totally different when you talk about a SaaS application .
But a lot of the building blocks need to get reinvented , so that 's how I 've been thinking about a lot of these different layers .
JS : That 's fascinating .
I did this interview with the Chrome OS engineering director , Matt Papakipos , and he was talking to us about how they were dealing with this problem of application handlers .
It 's the same problem that the Windows registry solved on the PC , and they 're dealing with this on Chrome OS — what Web application handles this kind of URL or data type ?
So it 's the same class of problem — all the stuff that we did on the desktop — but on this new platform .
The evolution of the stack starts with the mainframe , and everyone is always trying to recreate the mainframe by taking advantage of new technologies .
PL : I was talking to someone the other day , and they were asking , " What does the app server for the cloud look like ? "
And that 's a good question .
If you talk to a public cloud provider , they 'll say , that is the app server ... the whole thing is the app server , and as an application developer you just write your application to a set of APIs , and all the other services that an app server would provide are handled by the public cloud platform .
Now , I think in the private cloud you 'll have to recreate some of those things , and a lot of them are getting decompartmentalized — it does n't have to be this monolithic JBOSS app server .
It can be a set of services that get loosely coupled together by this underlying cloud platform .
So you get database services , logging services , system management — all these services can be loosely coupled together to create an app server on the fly .
We 're still in the early days , but I think these are different pieces that are coming together .
And what I spend my time on is " what are the really interesting layers that are going to harden into something meaningful , vs. what are the parts that will be absorbed into other layers ? "
So it 's a tricky dance .
JS : Yeah , that 's an interesting problem .
And it 's got to be an exciting time to be a programmer again .
I 've recently started to learn Python .
When I graduated in 1998 from undergrad with an engineering degree , programming was kind of boring .
I just thought , my options are that I can do some Access Basic thing , or go do some gimmicky Internet thing .
But the days of being a rockstar programmer who builds something important and makes a lot of money — those days were gone .
That was back in the ' 80s with the dawn of the PC platform .
But now those days are back , because there 's a new platform and we 're having another moment where you can do something really cool .
PL : That 's something that we 've been talking about , that developers are more empowered now than they 've ever been .
Cloud computing has fundamentally taken control out of IT and put it back into the hands of the developer , and developers can take a credit card and do anything they want , basically .
And all these services are available to them on a very componentized , elastic , pay - per-use basis .
And I think that 's created the shift in control back to the developers with a vengeance .
Why is Amazon the poster child for the cloud ?
It 's because it empowered developers , and developers made Amazon what the cloud should look like .
And I think those are all examples of your point that it 's cool to be a developer again .
JS : Yeah , because there 's a new platform .
And that 's why I 'm learning Python — because there 's a new platform , or rather a set of platforms now .
I originally learned the PC as a platform — I started coding obsessively when I was 9 years old on a Commodore , and then in undergrad I learned hardware and I coded for UNIX and Windows .
But now there 's a new set of platform architectures that you code to — EC2/S3 , Microsoft Azure , App Engine — and I have to learn that just to stay current .
At this point in the interview , the batteries on my recorder died , so I 'll have to summarize the rest of the discussion from my notes .
Near the end of our discussion , I asked Ping what he would fix about the US to make it a better place for cloud - based businesses to grow .
" If you were king of the world , " I said , " and could wave a magic wand and fix anything at all , like giving everyone in the US South Korean - style broadband , what would you fix ? "
This turned out to be a great question , because it soon became obvious that as a VC , Ping does n't really think in those terms .
I 've asked this question in one form or another to any number of academic and policy - minded types over the years , and they can always rattle off things about the country that they 'd love to see changed .
But this is the first time I 've put this question to a VC , and the fact that he just did n't connect with it and had to sit and ponder it was very telling .
It 's clear from our discussion that Ping spends a lot of time thinking about what 's missing from the cloud picture , but unlike a policy type , who 's interested in coming up with a consensus solution that would please a set of stakeholders , Ping views any such gap as a profit opportunity .
Ping ultimately responded to the question by shooting down my idea that broadband penetration is a real barrier .
In a nutshell , his basic point was that the real bandwidth needs that the cloud has are all on the back - end between datacenters .
Users have enough bandwidth to run cloud apps , since they 're just doing some relatively light input and output .
So broadband penetration is n't really a barrier , because browser - based interfaces are n't as bandwidth - intensive .
I think he 's right as far as cloud - based applications go .
Swedish - or South Korean - style broadband in the US would be more of an enabling technology like virtualization , vs. the lack of it being a barrier of some sort .
I 'd like to thank Ping Li for taking time out to talk with us , and for participating in the Smart Salon panel .

The last piece of ice remaining in the Arctic
The death spiral continues , with Arctic ice extent and thickness nearly identical to what it was 10 years ago .
The graph above shows superimposed volume data ( calculated from PIPS ) for 2010 , on top of the NSIDC extent data .
Interesting to note that volume continued to increase for about a month after extent started to decline .
This is because the Arctic Basin has remained below freezing , while the lower latitudes have been melting .
In the video of 2010 ice below , you can see how ice has been piling up to a depth of nearly five metres ( red ) on the windward side of Wrangel Island , the New Siberian Islands , and the Taymyr Peninsula .
Ice thickness in Barrow , AK seems to have reached it ’s maximum this week , at about 4.3 metres feet .
University of Alaska – Barrow Ice Sensor
Temperatures in the Arctic interior have remained cold , and well below freezing .
Not much opportunity for melt .
http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php
You can see the Arctic temperature anomalies over the last 30 days in the video below :
The four major extent indices continue to diverge , with the next couple of weeks showing almost no year over year variability .
http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/plots/icecover/icecover_2010.png
The modified NSIDC image below shows in red where ice has disappeared since early April .
The modified NSIDC image below shows in red where ice has disappeared in the last week .
The modified NSIDC image below shows a comparison between 2010 and 2007 .
Areas in green have more ice than 2007 .
Areas in red have less ice than 2007 .
The modified NSIDC image below shows in red areas of ice deficiency relative to the 30 year mean , with areas of excess shown in green .
The cold Pacific side has excess ice , while the warmer Atlantic side has a deficiency ..
This corresponds quite closely with sea surface temperature anomalies seen below .
http://weather.unisys.com/surface/sst_anom.html
The image below from September 15 , 2007 is the one which most interests me this week .
After the big “ melt ” of 2007 , it was widely reported that researchers expected the ice to be gone by 2013 , and that “ in the end , it will just melt away quite suddenly . ”
How is five metre thick ice supposed to “ just melt away quite suddenly ? ”
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
From the linear predictions department :
Temperatures in Colorado have warmed up 20 degrees in the last two weeks .
If that trend continues , it will become hot enough to boil water before Christmas .
And the Arctic will be ice free by 2013 .

Inside the Blind Shear Ram
Of all the components on the blowout preventer , only the blind shear ram was designed to shut down the well in a blowout like the one that took place on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig on April 20 .
It is the only device that is supposed to cut through the thick drill pipe and seal off the hole .
Unlike many other parts of the Deepwater Horizon ’s blowout preventer , the blind shear ram has no backup .
The breakdown of any part of the ram can lead to disaster .
One of the most critical components of the blind shear ram is the shuttle valve , the only point for the hydraulic fluid to enter the ram .
A risk analysis commissioned by the manufacturer of the blowout preventer identified this valve as one of the weakest links .
As the fluid flows through the system , it has two possible pathways until it reaches the valve .
So if the valve fails , the well will not be sealed .

In a rare public denunciation of Israel , the United Nations Security Council on Monday condemned the Israeli raid on the Gaza aid flotilla and deplored the loss of innocent life that attended it .
The world body insisted that Israel immediately release the 480 humanitarians it had taken captive , and demanded that it also let their ships go .
The UNSC also instructed Israel to lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip , calling the siege “ not sustainable . ”
Although the statement was weaker than the text urged by Turkey and the Arab world , it was brutal compared to the anodyne language usually insisted upon by Washington when it comes to Israel .
This development is head - spinning in its implications .
The United States almost never allows UNSC resolutions condemning Israel to go forward ( though this text was admittedly a presidential statement rather than a full resolution ) .
But here it is clear that President Barack Obama instructed his ambassador to the UN to join in the condemnation of the Israeli “ acts . ”
Since Turkey is currently a non-permanent member of the UNSC and led the charge on the condemnation of Israel , it is possible that the US felt it had to trade horses with Ankara if it has any chance of still getting a UNSC resolution tightening sanctions on Iran ( a step that Turkey opposes , as does Brazil , though neither has a veto ) .
It is also possible that Israel ’s rash attack has sabotaged the Obama administration ’s push for increased UN sanctions on Iran , hardening opposition to an Israel - driven policy toward Tehran .
The UN Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs , Argentina ’s Oscar Fernandez - Taranco , gave us some idea of the UNSC ’s thinking when he called on Israel on Monday to end its “ counterproductive ” and “ unacceptable ” blockade of the Gaza Strip .
He pointed out that the fiasco around the Israeli commando attack on the civilian aid flotilla would not have occurred had there been no blockade in the first place .
The demand that Israel give up the siege of Gaza was repeated by the United Kingdom and by Brazil .
( Nick Clegg , the new LibDem deputy prime minister of the UK , has long been a vocal critic of Israeli policies toward the Palestinian West Bank and Gaza . )
As long as Israel , therefore , continues its blockade of the general Gaza population , it is no less in contravention of the United Nations Security Council instructions than Saddam Hussein was with regard to his weapons programs in the early 1990s .
While gathering the details of how some 16 humanitarian aid activists were killed and dozens were wounded by Israeli soldiers is important , above all for the sake of justice toward the idealistic persons mown down , it is far more important that the episode produce an end to the lockdown of the 1.5 million Gazans , who have been placed by the Israeli government in a sort of open - air penitentiary .
Contrary to the assertions of far - right Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman , the Palestinians of Gaza , stripped of any citizenship and lacking any basic human rights , face continual shortages of medicine , medical equipment , electricity and even of food .
They face crushing poverty and unemployment , along with inadequate hospitals .
Many are still homeless after the Israelis destroyed their homes in the Gaza War , and they are being denied cement for rebuilding .
They are not allowed to have a harbor or an airport .
They are cut off from the market for their goods in Egypt , Jordan and the rest of the Arab world .
As Uri Avnery points out , Israeli pledged in the Oslo accords 18 years ago to allow a deep water port for Gaza on the Mediterranean .
Instead , it is assaulting even small aid vessels attempting to land at the pitiful excuse for a port .
The blockade is shameful .
It is a gross violation of the international law governing the treatment of Occupied populations .
And now the Security Council has roundly condemned it and insisted that it be lifted .
The Israeli peace organization , Gush Shalom , demonstrated in front of the detention center where the aid activists were being held ..
There are no new details of the Israeli assault on the humanitarian aid flotilla early Monday morning , largely because the 480 eyewitnesses had been sequestered by the Israelis .
Some , including an 81 - year - old former US ambassador , a Turkish woman with a baby , and a former US navy sailor who had been on the USS Liberty when the Israelis attacked it in 1967 , are now trickling home .
The whereabouts and condition of many others is unconfirmed , including European parliamentarians , Nobelists , and Swedish mystery writer Henning Mankell ( whose anti-imperialist novel The Man from Beijing I just read and enjoyed . )
The incident could have implications for the future relationship of Israel to the European Union .
Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin hinted that Dublin might go so far as to cut expel the Israeli ambassador , thus cutting off diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv .
Some 8 Irish citizens are among Israel ’s prisoners , and one of these humanitarians , Fiachra O’Luain , is said by his father to have been wounded by Israeli gunplay .
Martin thundered , “ These citizens did not enter Israel illegally — they were essentially kidnapped from international waters , taken into Israel and are being asked to sign documents saying they entered illegally . ”
The other big casualty of the Israeli raid may well be the special relationship between Turkey and Israel , as the BBC says .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the raid as “ state terrorism . ”
Thousands of demonstrators also gathered to chant against Israel in Baghdad , inspired by Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
Interior Minister Jawad Bulani , serving in the government of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , said , “ We want to send a message to the Palestinians to let them know they are not alone and that the Iraqis are with them . . .
What is going on is a vicious crime .
The international community must condemn it and take responsible action against them .
This is the stand of all Iraqis , officially and publically . ”
Historians may look back on the Marmara raid as the moment a new order began emerging in the Middle East , grouping Turkey with Iran , Syria , Iraq and Palestine rather than with Washington and Tel Aviv .
Aljazeera English has video on the world condemnation of the Marmara raid .
The enforced silence of the flotilla activists , in Israeli custody , has allowed Israeli spokesmen to shape the narrative of events for American news media .
Former CIA analyst Ray Close blames President Obama for not being tougher with Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu to begin with , arguing that coddling the Likud leader led to this atrocity .
As Jonathan Cook points out , the Israeli authorities have still not announced a definitive list of those killed and wounded by their commandos .
In response to Israeli official pronouncements , Amnesty International said , “ Israel says its forces acted in self - defence , alleging that they were attacked by protestors , but it begs credibility that the level of lethal force used by Israeli troops could have been justified .
It appears to have been out of all proportion to any threat posed . ”
Raw video posted to Youtube from the initial phase of the Israeli boarding of the Turkish vessel , Mavi Marmara demonstrates that as the Israeli commandos approached the ship , they were laying down suppressive fire and at that point killed two individuals aboard the ship .
Even after the ship ran up a white flag , the Israelis continued to use live ammunition along with stun grenades and tear gas .
See Stephen C. Webster ’s analysis of this video of the boarding :
If the crew and passengers of the Mavi Marmara were coming under fire and had taken casualties in the initial phase of the Israeli approach , that horror would help explain why some actively resisted the boarding and that in turn would explain the contextless snippet of video released by the Israeli army of Israeli commandos being fought as they commandeered the vessel .
If the passengers thought the Israeli military had murderous intentions toward them , some would obviously attempt to forestall the boarding .
It is also possible that there were no deaths on the other ships because they were boarded later and after the Israeli helicopter gunship crews had learned that suppressive fire during the initial approach was unnecessary and counterproductive , and so they ceased that tactic .
It is unclear why the commandos behaved in this way with regard to the Mavi Marmara in the first place , but it is possible that they believed their own propaganda .
The Turkish aid ships were supported by a Muslim fundamentalist charity in Turkey , IHH , that has been accused of being sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood and to Hamas , and in Israeli eyes that orientation would make them terrorists .
So perhaps the commandos assumed they were boarding a ship full of Hamas operatives .
In reality , it was just idealistic humanitarians .
But even they could be provoked to active resistance if they thought they were about to be shot down .
It is a sign of to what depths the pride of the Israeli military has fallen that it is complaining of attempts to “ lynch ” its soldiers ( none of whom was killed , while as many as 16 humanitarian aid workers appear to be dead ) .
This is the Israeli army of the 1967 Six Days War and of Entebbe ?
They were in danger of being lynched as they boarded a small civilian vessel ?
Of course , they could have avoided this menace by simply not being uninvited on a ship in international waters .
And , it is pretty obvious who is actually being lynched – the people of Gaza and anyone who objects to them being half - starved by the Israeli blockade .
Image caption Some nations are threatening to cut off persistent copyright infringers
Lists of Britons who infringe copyright are to be drawn up by the UK 's biggest ISPs , under proposals from the regulator Ofcom .
The plan is contained in a draft code of practice it hopes will curb copyright infringement .
Names and the number of times individuals infringe will be logged .
Music firms and movie studios can request details from the list so that they can decide whether to start their own action against serial infringers .
However , any suspected infringers will be sent three warning letters before any action can be taken .
The letters will contain " easy to understand information on the nature of the allegations made against the subscriber and on what actions a subscriber can take , both to challenge the allegation and to protect their network from being hijacked for the purposes of infringement . "
Jim Killock , executive director of the advocacy body the Open Rights Group ( ORG ) said the proposals left " huge unanswered questions " .
The ORG joined forces with the Communications Consumer Panel Consumer Focus , Which and Citizens Advice to draw up a set of principles they believe should govern the code of practice .
The principles say sound evidence is needed before any action is taken and consumers must have the right to defend themselves .
" It is imperative that a system that accuses people of illegal online activity is fair and clear , " said Anna Bradley , chair of the Communications Consumer Panel . ,
Appeals process
The code initially only applies to big ISPs but could be extended , even to mobile networks , if infringement on smaller networks grows .
It tells ISPs under what circumstances they should inform customers that their accounts are allegedly being used to pirate copyrighted material .
Ofcom said the code should come into force in early 2011 .
The call for the creation of the code is contained in the controversial Digital Economy Act ( DEA ) .
One of the most controversial elements of that act was its granting of powers to the Secretary of State to disconnect people or slow their connections if they ignore warnings .
However , the code says : " The Secretary of State has not indicated his intention to make use of these provisions at this time and this consultation is not concerned with this aspect of the DEA . "
Technical measures such as these would require further legislation and Parliamentary approval .
Initially the code will only apply to ISPs that have more than 400,000 customers .
This includes BT , Talk Talk , Virgin Media , Sky , Orange , O2 and the Post Office .
An independent appeals process will also be set up for those customers who believe they have been wrongly accused of copyright infringement .
Ofcom has begun a consultation exercise on the proposals which will conclude on 30 July .
The communications watchdog said the code would go alongside other work to educate customers about copyright infringement , promotion of legal alternatives to file - sharing networks and targeted action against the most persistent offenders .

JScript and DOM changes in IE9 preview 3
3rd preview of IE9 was released yesterday , with some amazing additions , like canvas element and an extensive ES5 support .
I ’ve been digging through it a little , to see what has changed and what has n’t — mainly looking at JScript and DOM .
I posted some of the findings on twitter , but want to also list them here , as it ’s not very convenient to share code snippets in 140 characters .
Referencing it all in one place will hopefully make it easier for IE team to find and fix these deficiencies .
ECMAScript 5 and JScript
The big news is that IE9 pre3 has ( almost ) full support for ES5 .
By “ full support ” , I mean that it implements majority of new API , such as Object.create , Object.defineProperty , String.prototype.trim , Array.isArray , Date.now , and many other additions .
As of now , IE9 implements the largest number of new methods ; even more than latest Chrome , Safari and Firefox .
Unbelievable , is n’t it ? :)
You can see the results in this compatibility table ( note that it lists results of mere “ existence ” testing , not any kind of conformance ) .
What 's missing is strict mode , which actually is n't implemented in any of the browsers yet .
Some of the things I noticed :
ES5 Object.getPrototypeOf on host objects seems to lie , always returning null instead of proper value of [ [ Prototype ] ] :
Object.getPrototypeOf(document.body ) ; // null Object.getPrototypeOf(document ) ; // null Object.getPrototypeOf(alert ) ; // null Object.getPrototypeOf(document.childNodes ) ; // null
This does n’t happen in other browsers that implement Object.create at the moment , such as latest Chrome , WebKit or Firefox .
In Chrome , for example :
Object.getPrototypeOf(document.body ) === HTMLBodyElement.prototype ; Object.getPrototypeOf(document ) === HTMLDocument.prototype ; Object.getPrototypeOf(alert ) === Function.prototype ; Object.getPrototypeOf(document.childNodes ) === NodeList.prototype
… and so on .
Interestingly , bound functions in IE9 pre3 are represented as “ function ( ) { [ native code ] } ” , similar to host objects :
var bound = ( function f( x , y ) { return this ; } ) . bind ( { x : 1 } ) ; bound + ''; // " function ( ) { [ native code ] } " // compare to alert + ''; // " function alert ( ) { [ native code ] } "
Note how function representation does not include identifier ( f ) , parameters ( x and y ) , nor representation of function body ( return this ; ) .
This of course proves once again that relying on function decompilation is NOT a good idea .
Whitespace character class ( as in /\s/ ) still does n’t match majority of whitespace characters ( as defined by specs ) .
These include “ U+00A0 ” , “ U+2000 ” to “ U+200A ” , “ U+3000 ” , etc .
The test is available here .
Curiously , ES5 String.prototype.trim seems to “ understand ” those characters as whitespace very well , producing empty string — as expected — for something like ' \u00A0'.trim ( ) .
It was nice to see that ES5 Array .
isArray is about 20 times faster than custom implementation , such as this one :
function isArray(o ) { return Object.prototype.toString.call(o ) === " [ object Array ] " ; }
The difference in speed is similar to other browsers that implement this method .
An infamous , 10 + year - old JScript NFE bug , which I described at length before , is finally fixed :
var f = function g( ) { return f === g ; } ; typeof g ; // " undefined " f( ) ; // true
arguments ’ [ [ Class ] ] is now an “ Arguments ” , just like ES5 specifies it :
var args = ( function ( ) { return arguments ; } ) ( ) ; Object.prototype.toString.call(args ) ; // " [ object Arguments ] "
DOM
Unfortunately , the entire host objects infrastructure still looks very similar to the one from IE8 .
Host objects do n’t inherit from Object .
prototype , do n’t report proper typeof , and do n’t even have basic properties like “ length ” or “ prototype ” , which all function objects must have :
alert instanceof Object ; // false typeof alert ; // " object " alert.length ; // undefined
Because they do n’t inherit from Object .
prototype , we do n’t have any of Object .
prototype methods , naturally :
alert.toString ; // undefined alert.constructor ; // undefined alert.hasOwnProperty ; undefined
Object .
prototype is not the only object host methods fail to inherit from .
In majority of modern browsers , host objects also inherit from Function .
prototype and so have Function .
prototype methods like call and apply .
This does n’t happen in IE9pre3 .
alert instanceof Function ; // false document.createElement instanceof Function ; // false alert.call ; // undefined
Curiously , call and apply are present on some host objects , but they are still not inherited from Function .
prototype :
typeof document.createElement.call ; // " function " document.createElement.call === Function.prototype.call ; // false
Host objects ’ [ [ Class ] ] is far from ideal as well .
IE9 pre3 actually violates ES5 , which says that objects implementing [ [ Call ] ] ( or in other words — are callable ) should have [ [ Class ] ] of “ Function ” — even if they are host objects .
In IE9 pre3 , alert is a callable host object , yet it reports its [ [ Class ] ] as “ Object ” not “ Function ” .
Not good .
Object.prototype.toString.call(alert ) ; // " [ object Object ] " Object.prototype.toString.call(document.createElement ) ; // " [ object Object ] "
IE9 pre3 still messes up DOM objects ’ attributes and properties , although not as badly as earlier versions :
var el = document.createElement ('p ' ) ; el.setAttribute ('x ' , 'y ' ) ; el.x ; // 'y ' el.foobarbaz = ' moo ' ; el.hasAttribute(' foobarbaz ' ) ; // true el.getAttribute (' foobarbaz ' ) ; // ' moo '
Some old , humorous bugs can still be seen in IE9 pre3 , such as methods returning “ string ” when applied typeof on :
typeof Option.create ; // " string " typeof Image.create ; // " string " typeof document.childNodes.item ; // " string "
Undeclared assignments still throw error when same - id ’ed elements are present in DOM , however not with same - name ’ed elements ( as it was in previous versions ) :
Lecture 1 : '' The Scientific Citizen '
In the first of this year 's Reith Lectures , entitled Scientific Horizons , Martin Rees , President of the Royal Society , Master of Trinity College and Astronomer Royal , explores the challenges facing science in the 21st century .
We are increasingly turning to government and the media to explain the risks we face .
But in the wake of public confusion over issues like climate change , the swine ' flu vaccine and , more recently , Iceland 's volcanic ash cloud , Martin Rees calls on scientists to come forward and play a greater role in helping us understand the science that affects us all .
Considered by many to be the equivalent to a complete rectal examination The Water Temple from Zelda 64 , which has to be the hardest , most difficult level known to man .
Ever .
Filled with traps , mazes , puzzles , illusions , and who knows how many times you have to raise and lower the water level .
Every gamer I have spoken with has only rude , vulgar things to say about the Water Temple - and many stories of trial and error - using the wrong keys on the wrong doors , saving and screwing up in the wrong places , forgetting which rooms were which ... it 's a hellhole .
It is also used outside of the gaming world to describe a problem that is virtually impossible to solve .
The only thing I do n't get is why they put the hardest level in the middle of the game .
Main Pocket Postcard
Making of the Moscow Metro map
We decided to stick to the principle of arranging all the stations inside the ring as evenly as possible , with no hollow spaces or clumps .
Starting to move things around .
Preparing a balanced frame .
Playing with the idea of a non-round ring , not unexampled in the history of the Moscow Metro .
That seemed fine , but a bit too unconventional .
The task was to keep the map recognizable to Muscovites .
How about this for interchanges ?
Looking for inspiration , going for topography .
The best thing about that design was that the city center found itself right in the middle of the map .
Plus the Garden Ring and the Third Ring Road .
But that was it , no more advantages .
At this point though the topographic idea led us to mnemonic hints .
The chromosome in the middle was too much .
But then we could see the interchanges .
We liked the idea , but disliked how they looked .
Still was n’t it .
Then we gave birth to the idea of rings for interchange stations .
It was the kind of moment like that from an episode of House , M. D. , when it dawns upon him and everyone understands the enigma has been solved .
“ That ’s it ” is the essential breakthrough for every design project .
Arranging the stations and interchanges and achieving visual balance .
Incorporating ring roads , adding skyscrapers , playing around .
Versions showing exit directions .
London and Moscow ?
Would the British shading take root in Moscow ?
Or maybe red ?
Simple grid prefered .
The map is not as complicated as that of NYC .
And there are no ticket zones yet .
Examining it as a whole .
Rotten , too many bugs , little black things all over .
Searching for a solution for the list with color marks and grid references .
Struggling with one of the interchanges , Tretyakovskaya - Novokuznetskaya , the orange - yellow - green knot where the yellow line just would n’t look right .
Would it be able to keep up with the construction to come — we had to think ahead .
Almost there .
Trying different looks for crossing lines : simple white gaps , simple overlap , simple shadows .
Part 2 of 2 Parts ( click here to read Part 1 – The Overview of the project and its design )
1 . It is not a “ boardwalk ” .
Look closely .
It is an elevated concrete human highway .
14 - feet wide , 6 - feet above the water , up to 70 feet out from shore .
Built of concrete and steel .
Out over the open waters of our beautiful and naturally pristine lake / river .
2. Cheaper alternatives exist .
Either fully on land , closer to land , or a combination of both .
With specifications that start with the minimum specs of the existing Trail : the Hyatt Regency segment , 5 to 6 feet wide , between the First Street and Congress Avenue bridges .
This CAN be built across nearly the entire 1.2 mile stretch .
For far less cost .
However the necessary analysis and conceptual design work has never been done .
The necessary conversations have never been had .
3 . The “ full project cost ” could actually be over $ 20 million .
Nearly $ 4.3 million has already been allocated toward consultants and design over the past two years out of existing city budgets of which $ 2.4 million has been spent or obligated to date .
Plus the $ 16 million more now sought for construction .
All for 1.2 miles of roadway .
This road should be paved with gold .
4 . This project does not “ complete ” the trail gap .
It will lead users east along the shoreline to the Longhorn Dam .
That dam has a narrow and dangerous sidewalk crossing – where two strollers can barely pass each other over the Dam – alongside heavy traffic flow on Pleasant Valley Road .
Clearly a “ Pfluger - style ” pedestrian bridge needs to be built parallel to the west side of the dam .
A very expensive bridge .
Then there is another “ gap ” on the North Shore around the former Holly Power Plant .
Those segments ?
Not addressed .
5 . The cleverly packaged and named “ Boardwalk ” is itself a hazardous solution for the need it is trying to fill and the improved safety it is attempting to yield .
True , the existing sidewalk - based trail routing along Riverside Drive has a challenging crossing at IH - 35 and some close proximity to road traffic .
Interestingly , though , no ped - bike - vehicle accidents statistics have ever been produced .
Folks know they must be very careful getting through there .
But the 14 - foot wide Boardwalk over - design intentionally promotes high - speed , two - abreast , bicycle traffic … in two directions … out over the open river waters … in direct conflict with pedestrians , strollers , wheelchairs , dog - walkers , and others who would also be on the same pathway .
There is nowhere to jump out of the way of danger .
There is no easy way to reach injured parties .
There is no shade out in the open water .
Some folks have been asking how this project came to be ?
Good question .
Please read on …
It was initially conceived back in 2007 , when the City was flush with cash and the economy had not yet cratered .
The Trail Foundation and then Mayor Will Wynn collaborated on a “ study ” — The Riverside Boardwalk Investment Study — with the specific purpose of finding a way to build an over - water by - pass of the ten properties along this southeast stretch of the river .
Those property - owning and neighborhood stakeholders were supposed to be intimately involved in the study and project .
They never were .
Alternative routings and designs were supposed to be thoroughly vetted .
They never were .
The consultants dismissed them straight out of the box .
Only token hearings and patent lip service have been provided to concerned citizens .
However , continuous public pressure has managed to get about half of the trail route onto land now .
But the additional cost continues to be projected at $ 16 million .
That ’s how much the entire project was supposed to cost when first proposed almost three years ago — as a 100 % over - water solution of concrete highway for the entire 1.2 miles .
This despite half of it now being land based ; should n’t it now cost about half as much ?
And this on top of the $ 2.4 million already sunk into the project ( plus an additional $ 1.86 million allocated ) .
A lot of voodoo math going on here .
Lower cost on - land solutions were initially said to be desired .
Sadly , such alternatives were never properly and fully vetted from the get - go .
This was never even considered a logical starting point for the Boardwalk drivers .
No designs of this type have ever been produced .
No clear vision from a mixed on - land and / or adjacent - to - land goal have ever been championed by anyone associated with the leadership of this project .
Seeing an opportunity to advance the inter-modal bicycle transportation cause ( very different from “ recreational cycling ” on the existing Trail ) , the Texas Bicycle Coalition jumped in to support the project .
They helped expand the width to 14 - feet so that two bicycles riding side - by - side could pass each other in both directions .
So there are two large and influential coalitions politically backing this plan .
Where are all the environmental groups and naturalists on this issue ?
Where are the rowing clubs ?
Where are the taxpayers who think that $ 20 + million for a mile of roadway is a bad investment ?
They are unaware .
When you hear “ Boardwalk ” you automatically think “ Aww , that ’s nice … and cheap . ”
This has basically been a single - agenda , railroaded quest since inception with no Council direction or leadership to first and foremost find better and lower cost alternative solutions starting with the working specs of the existing trail .
Again , the City checkbook was wide open in 2007 / early - 2008 and the only plan to be pursued — this one — has been the only true focus of work and nearly $ 4.3 million of dedicated spending allocations to date .
Regardless of the noble desire to extend the Lady Bird Lake Trail along the waterfront , this is not the correct solution .
And this has not been the correct process by which to study , evaluate , investigate and converse about how to achieve the best possible solution , at the lowest possible cost , and with the least impact on the natural beauty of the river itself .
It ’s as simple as this : DON ’T PAVE OUR LAKE .
Author Disclosures :
1. I am an affected waterfront property owner ( Riverwalk Condominiums ) .
2 . I am an avid trail walker , bicycle rider and river user ( kayak and canoe ) .
3 . I very much support all the several further extensions of the trail that still need to be done .
4 . I am very much in favor of fully exploring on - land and adjacent - to - land lower cost solutions that exist , including at my property and the other private properties being by - passed .
Have been since the beginning .
The City refuses to go there .
5 . I am absolutely opposed to the “ boardwalk ” solution proposed for the reasons stated , plus many more sub-reasons that can be provided .

Image caption Agoutis are said to the only rodent able to gnaw through the nuts ' outer casing
A study examining the natural dispersal of Brazil nuts has suggested that intensive harvesting could threaten future regeneration of the trees .
Researchers found that large rodents quickly ate the nuts , rather than caching them , when supplies were scarce .
When supplies were plentiful , almost twice as many nuts were buried , increasing the chance of successful germination , the team added .
The findings appear in the Journal of Tropical Ecology .
The scientists from Norway , Brazil and the UK said that very little was know about the fate of Brazil nuts under natural condition , despite it being one of the most economically important non-timber crops to come out of Amazonia .
Seasonal effect
In order to get a better understanding of how the seeds were dispersed , they tracked 1,800 marked seeds to see how seasonal food availability affected agoutis ' and acouchis ' - large scatter - hoarding rodents - caching rates , dispersal distances and how long the seeds were buried before being eaten .
BRAZIL NUT TREE FACTS
Can grow to 50 m ( 164ft ) high
The trees live for about 500 years
The trees ' fruit have a hard case , which contains 10 - 25 seeds ( nuts )
The seeds remain trapped , unless the case is gnawed open by agoutis
Trees located in dense tropical forests can take up to 150 years to reach maturity
" We basically found that the seasons had a very strong effect on the dispersal distances and what happened to the seeds themselves , " explained Torbjorn Haugaasen , an ecologist at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences .
" During the wet season ( April ) - when there are a lot of other fruits in the forest - more seeds were cached for later retrieval , " he added .
" In the dry season ( September ) , on the other hand , more seeds were eaten immediately because there was not that much food around and the rodents needed to draw on the food resource .
" Seeds were also taken further away during the dry season , which suggests that the rodents saw them as a more valuable resource than during the wet season , " Dr Haugaasen told BBC News .
The field study , carried out during 2006 , showed that 74.4 % of seeds were buried during the wet season , compared with just 38.2 % during the dry season .
The team suggested that collecting too many Brazil nuts from an area could replicate " dry season " conditions for the rodents .
" Reduced seed availability due to intensive harvesting could potentially create a dry - season scenario where most seeds succumb to pre-dispersal predation , thereby adversely affecting the natural regeneration of Brazil nut trees , " they wrote .
Seeds of hope
The researchers said that populations of two large rodent species were responsible for the dispersal of the Brazil nut tree seeds : agoutis and acuchis .
Image caption
Up to 25 seeds , what we call Brazil nuts , are contained in the trees ' fruit
However , they added , only the agoutis were capable of gnawing through the hard , thick outer casing of the fruit and releasing the seeds ( Brazil nuts ) .
Agoutis , which can weigh up to 6kg , are found throughout the same range as the Brazil nut trees in South America .
" The ( trees ) therefore rely almost entirely on these large terrestrial rodents for the release of their well - protected seeds , " the team explained .
" Those seeds not consumed within the germination period ( 12 - 18 months ) may germinate , and seeds may remain viable for at least six years . "
Scatter - hoarding also benefits plants in a number of ways , such as transporting seeds away from the parent plants and increasing the probability of reaching a site more suitable for germination .
Dr Haugaasen explained that the team decided to carry out the study in order to build on the findings of a 2003 paper published in Science , which first identified the link between intensive harvesting and the lack of young Brazil nut trees .
Writing in the 2003 paper , researchers said : " Persistently harvested stands were characterised by larger ( and presumably older ) trees and few or no juveniles .
But , they observed : " Juveniles were most common in unharvested and lightly harvested stands . "
However , Dr Haugaasen said , the people harvesting the nuts could unknowingly be contributing to the regeneration of the trees , as some nuts were accidentally dropped as they were carried out of the forest .
" We actually found seedlings along the path used by the collectors .
However , this does not mean that they are all going to reach maturity because they are in ( vulnerable ) places . "
But he warned that restricting nut collecting could prove to be counterproductive because the harvests were a key source of income for local communities .
" Alternative possibilities , such as managed planting of seedlings in natural gaps in the forest might be a better solution , " he suggested .
Dr Haugaasen said that the next step for the researchers was to look at the " management implications " of their findings .
" We also need to know how the hunting of these rodents can effect the natural regeneration of these trees , " he added .
" You can have a negative impact by reducing the number of these rodents .
" However , if you have a large number of seeds already buried by a rodent before it is shot , other agoutis or seed - eaters will not know where those seeds are located .
" The seeds may therefore have a higher chance of survival , which could arguably have a positive impact on regeneration . "
Further studies on the ecology of Brazil nut trees are expected to be published in the coming 12 months .
Today I found out what the M’s stand for in “ M& Ms ” .
In 1941 , Forrest Mars Sr. , of the Mars candy company , struck a deal with Bruce Murrie , son of famed Hershey president William Murrie , to develop a hard shelled candy with chocolate at the center .
Mars needed Hershey ’s chocolate because he anticipated there would be a chocolate shortage in the pending war , which turned out to be correct .
As such , the deal gave Murrie a 20 % stake in the newly developed M&M ; this stake was later bought out by Mars when chocolate rationing ended at the end of the war , in 1948 .
The name thus stood for “ Mars & Murrie ” the co-creators of the candy .
If you liked this article and the Bonus Facts below , you might also enjoy :
Bonus Facts :
The “ M& M ” was modeled after a candy Forrest Mars , Sr. encountered while in Spain during the 1930s .
During the Spanish civil war there , he observed soldiers eating chocolate pellets with a hard shell of tempered chocolate .
This prevented the candies from melting , which was essential when included in soldiers rations as they were .
During WWII , production of M&Ms skyrocketed due to the fact that they were sold to the military and included as part of United States ’ soldiers rations .
The original M&M colors were : red , yellow , brown , green , and violet .
M&Ms were served in cardboard tubes when they debuted .
The “ M ” printed on the M&Ms was originally printed black .
This was changed to white in 1954 .
William Murrie , father of Bruce Murrie , was originally hired by Milton Hershey in 1896 as a salesman .
In his first week on the job , he managed to over sell the plant ’s production capacity .
This so impressed owner Milton Hershey , that he tabbed Murrie to be the future President of Hershey ; this later happened in 1908 , a position he held until retiring in 1947 .
When William Murrie first took over running Hershey , the annual sales of the company was $ 600,000 .
Upon his retirement in 1947 , he had grown the company to now have a gross annual sale amount of 120 million dollars ; which means , over the span of those 39 years he increased the annual sales rate an average of around 15 % per year .
In the 1920 ’s , Murrie tried to convince Hershey that they should produce a chocolate bar with peanuts .
Hershey did n’t like the idea , but let him go ahead as long as the bar was n’t under the Hershey brand name .
And so , in 1925 , the “ Chocolate Sales Corporation ” , a fictitious company Murrie came up with , debuted the “ Mr. Goodbar ” , which was wildly successful .
Forrest Mars Sr. not only helped invent the M&M , but also famously invented the Mars bar , which was a “ malted milkshake in a candy bar ” ; he also launched the Uncle Ben ’s line of food product .
At the time of his death at age 95 in 1999 , Forrest Mars , Sr. had grown his father ’s company to the point where he now had amassed a fortune for himself of over 4 billion dollars .
At that time , he ranked 30th on the list of richest Americans , with his sons Forrest Jr and John ranking 29th and 31st .
He left the company to his children who still exclusively own it today ( it is not a publicly traded company ) .

BP shares suffered another difficult day as the company continued to struggle with the fallout from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The firm 's shares closed down 6.6 % in London , having earlier plunged 12 % .
And the row over the spill has moved to Westminster - with calls for the UK government to try to ease relations between BP and the White House .
Prime Minister David Cameron will discuss BP with US President Barack Obama this weekend .
Mr Cameron said he understood Washington 's " frustration " at the spill , adding that the UK stood ready to help BP with the clean - up - referring to 600 tons of chemical dispersant that have been made available .
Economic value
Meanwhile Chancellor George Osborne , who has spoken to BP chief executive Tony Hayward , said : " We are all concerned about the human and environmental impact . "
He added that " constructive solutions " were needed , emphasising that people " remember the economic value BP brings to people in Britain and America " .
The US is considering taking legal action to prevent BP paying dividends .
And concern has been expressed by MPs about the damage that such action could do to one of the UK 's top companies .
However the UK government has played down fears expressed by some senior figures of " anti-British rhetoric " in the US .
The US state department has said the oil spill will not affect the relationship between the US and Britain .
' Very heavy price '
BP 's shares recovered some of the losses during London trading hours to end 6.6 % lower at 365.5 pence .
The recent price moves mean the oil giant 's share price has almost halved since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began on 20 April .
The company has come under increasingly sharp attack by some US politicians for its handling of the spill , described as the worst environmental disaster the US has faced .
Some of the sharpest comments have come from President Obama , who said he was looking for " ass to kick " at BP , and that he would have sacked BP chief executive Tony Hayward - if he worked for him - over flippant comments about the scale of the spill .
PESTON'S PICKS
Overnight , the US Justice Department said it was examining ways of forcing BP to suspend its dividend until BP 's full liability for the oil spill is known with more precision .
And the Justice Department is only doing what influential US politicians are demanding .
Which is a serious concern to BP , in that it may be a British company by dint of history and legal domicile , but it is very American by virtue of its giant acquisitions of a decade or so ago .
My conversations with those at the top of BP indicate that they 're increasingly minded to go for a voluntary moratorium on dividend payments , to bring some kind of fragile truce to hostilities with the US government .
But President Obama should be aware that such a suspension of dividends would in effect deprive US savers of some $ 4bn of income per annum .
Or to put it another way , in a world of global capitalism , Obama can't punish BP and expect all or even most of the pain to be felt in Britain .
Read Robert 's blog in full Send us your comments
London Mayor Boris Johnson told the BBC that BP had paid a " very , very heavy price " , and expressed concern that the oil spill was beginning to damage the entire image of the UK in the US .
" I do think there 's something slightly worrying about the anti-British rhetoric that seems to be permeating from America , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
However , UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has downplayed the extent of anti-British feelings across the Atlantic .
" No - one has used an anti-British tone in anything that I 've detected , " he told the BBC .
And Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also played down the prospect of UK - US relations being damaged .
" It is about dealing with the ecological problem and dealing with it as soon as possible , " he said .
However the former British ambassador to the US , Sir Christopher Meyer , told the BBC that the BP issue had become " a bit of a crisis , politically " .
" The government must put down a marker with the US administration that the survival and long - term prosperity of BP is a vital British interest , " he said .
He added that with nearly 40 % of BP shares held in the US the company was " a pretty vital American interest too , fully integrated into US energy infrastructure " .
And the remarks by President Obama prompted Royal Sun Alliance chairman John Napier to write an open letter to the president , saying criticism of the company lacked " balance " and was " unstatesmanlike " .
He told the BBC : " The language and rhetoric of this dispute is going into the danger zone , is becoming too highly personalised and to that extent , the interpretation over here , not just by me but others , is that it has a certain anti-British rhetoric to it - and that has to be of concern . "
Dividend fears
US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said that BP should compensate other oil companies that have had to lay off workers because of a moratorium on deep sea drilling announced by President Obama in response to the Gulf of Mexico spill .
Meanwhile , the US Attorney General said he could not rule out taking action to force BP to withhold its next dividend payment - something which former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said was " quite intolerable " .
The drop in BP 's share price is already bad news for UK pension funds , which invest heavily in the firm .
The oil company has said that it pays £ 1 in every £ 7 of dividends that pension funds receive from FTSE 100 companies .
However the National Association of Pension Funds ( NAPF ) has insisted that BP 's woes " should not have an immediate or serious impact on those saving into a pension , or on those who have retired " .
It added that pension funds have shifted out of UK shares and that the average fund was now spread across many companies and many types of global asset .
US perceptions
In its latest update on the spill , BP sought to reassure investors that it was on a strong financial footing with a stronger - than - forecast cash flow .
It also said that the total actual cost to date was some $ 1.43 bn ( £ 1 bn ) .
This compares with a total of £ 55 bn that has been wiped off BP 's value since the spill began .
Market nerves have also been reflected in the value of BP 's bonds , which now trade at levels comparable with junk - rated companies .
This is despite the company continuing to enjoy high " investment grade " ratings from all three major ratings agencies .
The warrior monks of Shaolin have gained a worldwide reputation for their devoted study and impressive displays of traditional kung fu .
The feats of athletic prowess and martial arts skill are the result of intense daily study , morning to night .
Every aspect of daily life , including diet , conforms to the monastic life , lived in pursuit of Buddhism and the martial arts .
1 Dietary Basics ... Jupiterimages / Comstock / Getty Images
The dietary habits of Shaolin monks have been relatively unchanged during the hundreds of years since the Shaolin sect was formed .
Like every aspect of the monastic life , this diet is centered around Buddhist ideals of pacifism , purity and simplicity .
It is essential to remember that the life of a Shaolin monk is one focused on spirituality , not athleticism or pleasure .
The traditional diet of the Shaolin consists primarily of rice , vegetables and fruits .
Rice has been a staple food in China for centuries .
Rice can be boiled or steamed , rice flour is used in making noodles , and other rice - based dishes are common .
Rice comes in many varieties , with varying textures and nutritional properties .
Vegetables common to China include bok choy , sprouts , taro and several varieties of beans .
While Chinese cuisine might prepare these foods in numerous ways , Buddhist monks , such as those of the Shaolin Temple , will generally boil or steam them , or merely eat them raw .
Fruits such as bananas , apples , and figs , are all common to China .
These may be eaten raw or dried for long - term storage .
2 Simplicity and Food Preparation ... Eising / Digital Vision / Getty Images
In taking up the life of a monk , adherents to Shaolin ’s form of Buddhism leave behind many of the niceties of their former lives , choosing instead to live a life of humble simplicity .
This simplicity also extends to their daily eating , and foods are prepared simply .
The extensive preparations of modern Chinese food are eschewed in favor of basic preparations , leaving the Shaolin diet basic and bland .
3 Pacifism and Vegetarianism ... Photos.com/Photos.com /Getty Images
One of the tenets of Buddhism is strict pacifism -- to inflict no harm or suffering upon other living things .
As an extension of these teachings , many Buddhist sects , including the Shaolin , practice strict vegetarianism .
As a general rule , meat is not eaten and the use of eggs and dairy products is generally avoided as well , though the specifics may vary from one group to the next .
Because daily kung fu training can be strenuous , it is important for students to properly nourish themselves .
Protein intake is thus an important facet of the Shaolin diet , as there are no sources of animal protein .
This dietary gap is overcome by including non-animal protein sources into dishes .
Soybeans and soy products like tofu are an important part of most meals in the monastery .
Nuts such as peanuts and almonds also may be incorporated into some dishes .
A vegetarian meat substitute , called seitan , is also used .
Seitan can be made from wheat gluten or soy protein in a variety of textures and flavors .

Some goes to Mark Sanchez , the young quarterback who , in his rookie season , led the team to within a game of the Super Bowl .
But hidden away on a 27 - acre expanse in Florham Park , New Jersey , sits what is perhaps the organization 's most significant new asset : a 120,000 - square - foot shrine to athletic and corporate excellence .
The Atlantic Health Jets Training Center , designed by Skidmore , Owings & Merrill , houses five football fields , immaculate and sunny open - plan offices , and — this is a sports franchise , after all — many dozens of TVs tuned to ESPN and the NFL Network .
" We wanted to create something that was not just an operating structure , " Johnson says .
" We also wanted a place people were proud to come to every day . "
The complex is the key to a new emphasis on providing a superior workplace that unites the business and football sides of the organization .
This emphasis on employees is in large part inspired by a similar focus at Johnson & Johnson , the health care giant co-founded by Johnson 's great - grandfather .
" Good architecture , " Johnson says , " should help a company with its mission . "
Professional Development
Players get first priority for use of the fieldhouse , which has a clearance of 95 feet so punters do n't have to worry about hitting the roof .
But when the team is n't using it , employees have access .
The same goes for the team 's gym .
For a nominal fee , the organization also provides breakfast , lunch , and snacks throughout the workday , featuring a salad bar , organic fruits and vegetables , and grass - fed beef .
The Jets recently switched food vendors to one with more organic and low - fat offerings .
" It seems like a pretty good goal for us to be the healthiest team in the league , " Johnson says .
" From me to the guy who takes care of the grass . "
Work to Do
Employees pass the Jets 's lone Super Bowl trophy upon entering the front lobby every morning -- a reminder of the company 's history as well as a confirmation that everyone has a role in the mission .
The ambition behind the facility has imbued the business side with new energy .
" The progress the team made last season , coupled with the new building , just put all the pieces together , " says Jocelyn Norman , an executive assistant .
" We moved into a new space ; that was phenomenal .
We got a new coach ; that was phenomenal .
The team played really well ; that was phenomenal .
Now we have the new stadium .
I think everything being new is like a total turnaround for the Jets .
And everyone here feels some part of that . "
Front -Row Seats
A south - west Queensland grazier says there is so much grass around , it is sticking to the wool around the sheep 's legs , making the animals look like they are wearing " big slippers " .
Andrew Hughes from Autumnvale near Thargomindah says the best season in 30 years has resulted in the unusual problem among his sheep flock .
Mr Hughes says it is creating the appearance the sheep are wearing boots .
" No one has ever seen them on the feet like this , " he said .
" People have seen the grass seed get in the sheep 's face when they stick their head down and into the feed but nothing this extreme .
" We 've never seen this on our place in the 27 years we 've been here , so it 's quite amazing .
" It 's sort of like a really big slipper , or work boot - they look like a human could put them on . "
Fritz Lang 's 1927 silent - film masterpiece " Metropolis " has been restored with the addition of 25 minutes of long - lost footage , and it's coming to the Coolidge Corner Theatre for a week .
Roger Ebert has been tweeting about this restoration for days .
In 2008 , when the curator of the Buenos Aires Museo del Cine discovered a 16 mm duplicate negative that included 25 minutes of " lost " footage not seen since the film 's opening , when the distributor ordered cuts .
This is now the movie Lang intended to make , a classic of dystopian futurism that presaged movies like " Blade Runner . "
The new print shows at the Coolidge for a week beginning June 4 .
EXTRA AWESOMENESS :
There 's a special show June 4 at 8 p.m. featuring live music by Cambridge 's Alloy Orchestra .
The Alloy will perform the revised " Metropolis " score they recently debuted before a full house at Graumann 's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles .
The three - member band wrote a score for the movie more than a decade ago , but has reworked it in honor of the new restoration .

ADVERTISEMENTS
Jacquard Sodium Alginate SH
These supplies are specially formulated to obtain the best results with Jacquard Procion MX Fiber Reactive Dyes .
Sodium Alginate SH Use Sodium Alginate SH for cotton and other cellulose fibers .
It may also be used for silk when fine line definition is not required .
Sodium Alginate F
A derivative of seaweed , this is the best thickener for Procion MX Dye .
Use Sodium Alginate F for silk and synthetics when fine line definition is desired .
Guar Gum Powder Guar gum can be used as a thickener for vat dyes or acid dyes .
It is not suitable for thickening reactive dyes , because the same dyes that react with cotton also react with guar gum , requiring the use of much larger quantities of dye .
Jacquard Procion MX Fiber Reactive Cold Water Dye Procion dyes are permanent , colorfast , and very washable .
You can easily create a palette of brilliant colors ranging from light pastels to deep , vibrant hues .
Perfect for natural plant fibers : cotton , linen , paper , reeds , and wood .
Procion MX Fiber Reactive Dye
Use for tie - dye , vat dyeing , batik , airbrush , hand painting , printing , spatter - painting , and more .
Will not dye synthetics .
Sodium alginate , Superclear , and other dye thickeners
Thickeners can be added to dye to give it a good consistency for painting .
They are also popular in tie - dyeing for improving the crispness of a design .
The use of a thickener may also increase the brightness of colors by aiding in holding the dye in the fabric for the dye reaction to occur .
Types of thickeners
Different thickeners used in dyeing and discharge include sodium alginate , Superclear , monagum , and other polysaccharides .
Alginate
Sodium alginate is the most popular of the dye thickeners and may be purchased from any good dye supplier by mail order ; see Sources for Dyeing Supplies for a list of different dye supply companies .
Alginate is extracted from brown algae , a type of seaweed .
Different lots of sodium alginate will be more or less thick than previous lots , so you must experiment to see how much you need to use .
How to dissolve alginate
Alginate tends to clump horribly when water is added .
I 've had good experiences by adding the alginate to cool water gradually , while whisking constantly with a small stainless steel whisk .
If that does n't work for you , here are two different answers to the problem .
One is to mix the alginate the day before use , using a kitchen blender .
The other answer to the problem of dissolving alginate is to mix the alginate with either alcohol or corn oil before adding the water , so that the particles will be separate and not stick together when water hits them .
An added advantage to the use of alcohol or vegetable oil is that the solutions are said to stay good much longer than those prepared with water alone .
The alcohol you use to mix your alginate with before adding water can be denatured alcohol , also known as methylated spirits , or it can be isopropyl alcohol , also known as rubbing alcohol .
Corn oil has also been used successfully for this purpose ; any refined , tasteless vegetable oil should work as well .
The goal is just to separate the particles of the alginate before adding any water .
Avoiding alginate gel
Another problem with alginate is that a dye solution made using it , or a stock solution of alginate , may sometimes form a semisolid gel , which is undesirable and difficult to get out of dye bottles .
Unlike gelatin or agar , alginate gels do not melt when heated .
The gel is caused by the presence of calcium ions , which are common in water and may be contaminants in other ingredients .
The answer is to use soft or distilled water or to include a particular water softener chemical , sodium hexametaphosphate , in your mixture .
Use 1 teaspoon ( 5 ml , or 7 grams ) of of metaphos per quart ( or liter ) of water .
Calgon brand laundry water softener may be substituted only if it is not phosphate - free ; the old powder form of Calgon , also known as Calgon T , was sodium hexametaphosphate , which is ideal , but the phosphate - free liquid version of Calgon , containing polycarboxylate , should not be used in dyeing .
Jacquard 's Calgon , Dharma 's Water Softener , and ProChem 's Metaphos are all fine .
High viscosity versus low viscosity
Typically two different grades of alginate are used for dyeing .
The low viscosity / high solids form is preferred for fine details on silk or wool , while the high viscosity / low solids form is preferred for cotton ; the latter may also be used on silk when fine detail is not needed .
recipes for fiber reactive dye with alginate
This is Michael Fowler 's recipe for tie - dyeing [ from a post on the old Fiber - Arts Forum ] ....
" I use a bank of four principle blenders and add :
Day / Night before dyeing , I mix my chemical water : 4 Cups Water
1/4 Cup [ 60 ml ] Urea ( Jacquard or PRO Chem . )
2 tsp. [ 10 ml ]
Alginate or Thick SH
Then , prior to dyeing , add dye powder and soda ash : 4 TBS . [ 60 ml ]
MX dye powder ( Jacquard or PRO Chem . )
2 tsp. [ 10 ml ] Soda Ash ( Jacquard or PRO Chem . )
To mix the chemical water , I fill 4 cups [ 1 liter ] water , add Urea and then the thickener .
I generally would store a quantity of thickener in a 5 - gallon bucket or glass mason style jars .
Then the chemical water is measured back into the blender for use and I add my dye powder and dye fixative . "
Here 's a recipe for using alcohol to prepare alginate ....
1/2 cup ( 125 ml ) urea
1 teaspoon ( 5 ml ) sodium hexametaphosphate in 2 cups ( 500 ml ) hot water .
Stir together : 2 - 6 tablespoons ( 30 to 90 ml ) sodium alginate ( depending on thickness desired , and on variations in sodium alginate supply )
1/4 cup 90 % rubbing alcohol
Add the alginate in alcohol to the urea water , and add additional water to make a total of 4 cups ( 1 quart ) .
Mixture may be stored in refrigerator if it is allowed to return to room temperature before use .
DissolveinStir together :
Add the alginate in alcohol to the urea water , and add additional water to make a total of 4 cups ( 1 quart ) .
Mixture may be stored in refrigerator if it is allowed to return to room temperature before use .
Superclear
Superclear was reformulated in 2013 , after manufacturing shortages made it impossible to find .
The new formulation , carried by Dharma Trading Company , should be used only with distilled water or with water that has been treated with sodium hexametaphosphate ( water softener ) .
Dharma warns that it can be difficult or impossible to remove after extended steaming .
I suggest that you test before using it in a large or important project .
There used to be two different though similar products sold under the name of Superclear , one available from Jacquard Products and one from Dharma Trading Company .
like the current formulation , their advantage was that , as they were already liquid , there was none of the inconvenience that is found in dissolving alginate .
They also used to lack the distressing tendency of alginate to gel in the presence of calcium ions , but this might not be the case for the new formulation .
Otherwise , the disadvantage of Superclear is that it is more expensive and costs more to ship , as well .
Dharma says ,
" ** Attention - this product is a new formulation .
We bought the last of the old product and the manufacturer can no longer get the ingredients .
They sent us samples of several alternatives , and we finally got one that would work , is safe to use , and works as close to the way the original worked as possible .
" Use this gel to thicken liquid dye solutions when applying dye directly onto the fabric , as in stenciling , painting or printing .
You can even add a little to your tie - dye solutions to control the bleed of the dye and have crisper lines .
Superclear rinses away during the washing out of the dyes .
You will have to adjust the following formulas to your situation , i.e. it 's kind of like cooking , use to taste , except , do n't taste it !
NOTE : Can be difficult or impossible to remove after extended steaming , especially if you have hard water .
Using distilled water , both to mix your dyes and in the steaming , works better .
" To reduce spreading - add 4 or more tablespoons to 8 oz . of liquid dye concentrate
To stop spreading - use 2/3 Superclear and 1/3 liquid dye concentrate
To make Fiber reactive dyes into a paint - add the dye powder to a mix of 2/3 or more Superclear and 1/3 or less water . "
Monagum
Monagum is , according to PRO Chemical & Dye , a modified starch gum that is the only thickener for discharge printing with hypochlorite ( " chlorine " ) bleach that stays thick , rather than breaking down and becoming thin quite soon after mixing with the bleach .
We do not use it to thicken reactive dyes .
Starch is not used
Starch , a polysaccharide which is used as a thickener in foods , is not used with reactive dyes .
This is because the starch will itself react with the dye , resulting in lower color yields ; dyed starch may also loosely bind to the fiber , washing out only gradually over the course of many washings and making it appear as though the dyed fabric is not washfast .
In theory , starch could be used with acid dyes , but I have never seen this recommended .
Methyl Cellulose
Methyl cellulose is a thickener commonly used for marbling .
The water is thickened with methyl cellulose so that it will support fabric paint which is floated on top of it .
Methyl cellulose can also be used to make print paste for acid dyes .
You might be able to find it in a specialty wallpaper shop under the name of ' cellulose adhesive . '
Guar gum
Guar gum is another thickener that is commonly used ( in more purified form ) in foods .
It is used to thicken the caustic paste used to make devoré patterns on mixed fibers .
It is not used with fiber reactive dyes such as Procion MX because it reacts with them , competing with the fiber that is being dyed , but it is used to thicken vat dyes and acid dyes .
See ProChem 's recipe for Colored Discharge Printing using PRO Vat Dyes .
Guar gum is superior to alginate in thickening Lanaset dyes .
Print Paste
PRO Chemical & Dye sells two convenient sodium alginate mixtures , PRO Print Paste Mix F and PRO Print Paste Mix SH .
Pro Print Paste F ( for silk ) contains urea , low viscosity alginate and metaphos , while Pro Print Paste SH ( for cotton ) contains urea , high viscosity alginate and metaphos .
( Metaphos is ProChem 's name for the water softener , sodium hexametaphosphate ) .

Thanks to an enterprising student 's willingness to rummage in garbage , we now know what 's required to get the former half - term governor from Alaska to talk about the everyday struggles of " real " people in today 's socialist hell called America :
Among other perks , [ Sarah ] Palin will fly first class - if she flies commercial .
If not , " the private aircraft MUST BE a Lear 60 or larger ... , " the contract specifies .
She also must be provided with a suite and two single rooms in a deluxe hotel .
Well , sure .
Would you expect an " average hockey mom " to settle for Lear 45 ?
Earlier this week , the New York Times published the first part of a two - part series by John Tierney looking at the current state of women in the sciences — in particular , whether the playing field can ever really be level , or whether innate neural differences mean there will always be more men getting ahead in science and math careers than women .
When Dr. Larry Summers raised the issue to fellow economists and other researchers at a conference in 2005 , his hypothesis was caricatured in the press as a revival of the old notion that " girls ca n't do math . "
But Dr. Summers said no such thing .
He acknowledged that there were many talented female scientists and discussed ways to eliminate the social barriers they faced .
Yet even if all these social factors were eliminated , he hypothesized , the science faculty composition at an elite school like Harvard might still be skewed by a biological factor : the greater variability observed among men in intelligence test scores and various traits .
Men and women might , on average , have equal mathematical ability , but there could still be disproportionately more men with very low or very high scores .
These extremes often do n't matter much because relatively few people are involved , leaving the bulk of men and women clustered around the middle .
But a tenured physicist at a leading university , Dr. Summers suggested , might well need skills and traits found in only one person in 10,000 : the top 0.01 percent of the population , a tiny group that would presumably include more men because it's at the extreme right tail of the distribution curve .
There 've been a lot of responses to this article since it came out , but I wanted to know what actual female scientists thought .
After the cut , you can read the perspectives of four smart women who have four different , insightful takes on the issue :
Dr. Carolyn Porco is a planetary scientist , and the leader of the Cassini spacecraft imaging team .
Dr. Kirsten Sanford is a neurophysiologist who left the lab for a career in science journalism .
Dr. Esther Takeuchi is the Greatbatch Professor in Power Sources Research in the University at Buffalo School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , and a winner of the National Medal of Technology .
Dr. Isis is a physiologist at a major research university who blogs about succeeding as a woman in academia .
Dr. Carolyn Porco : Standardized tests vs. real world success
With regard to the recent news that , after decades of `gap narrowing ' , differences still exist in standardized test performance between boys and girls at the extreme end of the distribution of test scores …
I think that this result , even if permanent , has little bearing on which gender will be better equipped to succeed in scientific careers .
There is so much more involved in doing scientific research than just raw mental abilities .
Given an adequate to above - average measure of analytical ability , it next comes down almost entirely to personality .
Traits like drive , persistence , focus , confidence , insightfulness , emotional intelligence , ability to rebound from setbacks , ability to accept criticism , enjoyment of solitude , and an abiding , intense desire * to know * that will separate out those who succeed from those who do n't .
In any `big science ' enterprise , like planetary exploration , where you must work in big teams of similarly driven people , it is important also to know how to work alongside others even when they may be your fiercest competitors .
I 've known males whose analytical abilities were off the charts — the ones on the extreme end of the curve that we are now discussing — but who just could n't cut it in the world of scientific research , because they lacked some important personality trait .
So , I do n't agree that we can find excuses in the results of standardized test scores for the uneven distribution of males and females in academic departments and other science - related positions .
There are other legitimate reasons why the male / female numbers do n't reflect the general population , but the new findings are probably not among them .
It might be that females , who tend to be more sociable , do n't gravitate to a lifestyle that requires a great deal of solitude .
Also , child - rearing is still , to my viewpoint , a largely female responsibility , and it's not easy to be very dedicated to a career — any career — and be a mother also .
Women do it , but it 's just not that easy .
I think a large factor is the barrage of messages that girls receive from their surroundings … parents , friends , internet , advertisements , the culture at large .
I 'm thrilled to see that amidst the cacophony of messages that we all receive ( but that young people are most susceptible to ) we find the pitch that girls can be capable at analytical thinking , mathematics , science , politics , and just about everything else that has been traditionally available to males .
This has been growing since I was a young woman and it's been encouraging to see .
But , it is still the case : being a scientist is not as socially acceptable as other pursuits .
It 's true still for boys ; it 's far , far more prevalent for girls .
For instance , we have over a thousand Cassini - interested individuals who are members of the CICLOPS Alliance — a group that interacts with each other and with other Cassini scientists in a forum ( of sorts ) that takes place on the CICLOPS website .
And the vast majority of these folks are males .
And the audience profile for the entire CICLOPS website is largely male .
And even my being a female and leading this experiment has n't drawn the same numbers of women as it has men .
Also , let 's not forget : females have a special challenge when entering a male - dominated field that operates on male cultural norms and requires male traits — assertiveness , even aggressiveness , competitiveness , etc. — to be successful .
When males act like males , they are doing what is expected and are rewarded for it .
When a woman acts like a male ( which is what she HAS to do to be successful ) , she is very much regarded otherwise .
How many women will be able to handle that ?
The threshold for those in the vanguard is awfully steep .
We still have a long way to go .
However , things ARE improving .
There are SO many more women in the field of planetary science , my field , than there were when I was young , and that 's a great sign .
And with more and more entering these male - dominated fields , the threshold will get lower .
The culture of behaviors will change , and with that , expectations will change and will be more accommodating of females .
It will get easier .
I do think that putting too much credence in the results under debate could frighten away young women who are n't so confident to begin with .
How should we be judging whether or not the sciences have been made more inclusive ?
Make education more accessible to women — ALL women , not just Americans .
Reward them as much for their work as you reward the males , and they will fill all niches eventually , and that will change the complexion of the whole enterprise .
I think the numbers are growing and that it has become more inclusive already .
I do n't worry too much about there not being the proper ratio between males and females near the top .
It will happen eventually .
Dr. Kirsten Sanford : " Different " does n't mean " better " or " worse "
I agree with Tierney that Summers was pilloried for some unfortunate statements on a very touchy subject .
After going back to read the transcript again , I think he was really trying to start a conversation ( so many prefacing disclaimer - like statements leading up to his main ideas ) .
However , it 's very difficult to publicly address the possible reasons that we see such an obvious imbalance between women and men in academic hiring .
Suggest that it might be for biological reasons as opposed to strictly social reasons , and you risk opening an unmanageable can of worms , which Summers discovered all too late .
But , in discussing the extreme right tail , Summers did and Tierney does miss the bigger point .
Is the academic institution too entrenched in its devotion to those few scientific individuals who make up the extreme right tail ?
The scientific and academic enterprise is much larger than the physics departments of the top 10 top tier universities .
Yet , we see the hiring biases persist throughout the system .
About five years ago , I spent a lot of time looking at the University of California 's hiring practices , and speaking with people who had worked on the issue since the 70's .
The consensus was that hard work over the preceding three decades at changing systemic awareness by implementing workshops and hiring practice protocols ( i.e. affirmative action ) had significantly improved the ratio of women to men across the board , but that a recent complacency had led to dramatic drops .
Just looking within the UC system , we can therefore see evidence that systemic adjustments do decrease the gender hiring bias .
It might not solve the problem , but it certainly can't hurt .
We have to seriously think about the reasons that the extreme right tail individuals are seen to succeed in the sciences .
Of course , there is a natural propensity for analytical thought , but is n't there also a systemic bias , a social bias to be impressed by and favor individuals with higher test scores ?
Does science tend to value the higher math test scores over higher verbal test scores ?
If so , is this smart considering that most of research involves creativity and communication in addition to data collection and analysis ?
Back to hiring again , we know there is currently no shortage of female undergrads in the sciences , and numbers of male applicants are decreasing .
Similarly , more and more women are pursuing PhDs .
Also , as Tierney stated , women are promoted and get grants as often as men .
Why are fewer women than men getting hired for academic tenure - track positions ?
There is something wrong here , and I do n't think it is explained by the extreme right tail .
Yes , there is plenty of research that supports the idea that women 's brains generally collect and process information differently from men's .
But , as has been stated many times before , different does n't mean better or worse .
Science stands to lose significantly if it refuses to productively address the biases that currently exist in the system .
It 's worth a try to see if awareness workshops initiate a change in attitudes because , really , we can collect data until we are drowning in it and generate alternative hypotheses until we gorge ourselves on them , but we will never know if we can change things unless we try .
Dr. Esther Takeuchi : Encouraging women in science is n't just good for the women — it 's good for the science
I would like to respond to the article by making two points .
The first point is that
participation of women is good for science .
The second point is that it is now time to act to
resolve the continuing lack of participation by women .
The first point : participation of women is good for science and may help in addressing
the many technical issues that still face the world today .
Perspective may be an important aspect of problem solving in science .
Scientific problems often are revisited over time by a variety of scientists with each individual making a small but unique contribution towards the solution .
What is considered creativity on the part of an individual may in fact be a different perspective .
In order to solve problems which are currently considered intractable , it may be critical to involve people who are traditionally not participants in the scientific process , especially women because of the unique perspective that they bring .
The current numbers that I have seen demonstrate that there are still far too few women in science .
I submit that anybody who can bring a different perspective brings a new level of creativity , precisely because they think about solutions in different ways .
The second point : it is now time to act .
Often , situations arise where it is obvious that
action rather than further study is needed .
If your house is on fire , you do not want to
commission a study on the nature of matches and their relationship to wood .
Rather , you want to take action and put out the fire .
In parallel or subsequent to extinguishing the fire , it is certainly valuable to understand more about its cause .
The situation with women in science is similar .
Roughly 50 % of the population is underrepresented in scientific fields of growing importance for the 21st century .
It is not good for science or the country to continue this trend .
It is now time for action rather than to rationalize further delay in action by requiring further causal analysis .
In closing , the low participation of women and some ethnic groups in science may be
more grounded in the culture of science than in the ability of the women and other groups .
It is important that the culture of science , math and engineering be inclusive rather than exclusive .
In order to solve problems which are currently considered intractable , it may be critical to involve people who traditionally have not been participants in the scientific process .
Dr. Isis : I am bored to tears with this " debate "
John Tierney titles his article " Daring to Discuss Women 's Potential in Science , " as though he is bravely daring to out the dirty little secret that we all supposedly know deep in our hearts .
Girls suck at math and science .
The truth is , they really do n't .
It 's just that John Tierney sucks at googling .
Tierney wrote his article in response to the passage of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 by the US House of Representatives .
Section 124 of Subtitle C under Title I of this 248 page bill is titled " Fulfilling the potential of women in academic science and engineering " ( see page 68 of the bill ) .
This section requires that :
… the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall develop a uniform policy for all Federal science agencies to carry out a program of workshops that educate program officers , members of grant review panels , institution of higher education STEM department chairs , and other federally funded researchers about methods that minimize the effects of gender bias in evaluation of Federal research grants and in the related academic advancement of actual and potential recipients of these grants , including hiring , tenure , promotion , and selection for any honor based in part on the recipient 's research record .
He then continues to outline the evidence that boys tend to be the top scorers in math and science when measured via standardized aptitude tests , even if there is no difference between the means .
Yet , he clearly has ignored the fact that this phenomenon is unique to the United States .
Indeed , in countries with more gender equal cultural norms , the divide disappears .
In Iceland , girls out perform boys in math and science .
Japanese girls out perform American boys .
Maybe in his next column
Tierney will argue some type of evolutionary difference between the boys and girls in these other countries and American boys and girls .
Personally , I would find it much more interesting if he would start posting recipes for pies we could make with all the cherries he 's picking .
When he brings up the evidence that the gender gap in aptitude tests has not shown the same rate of closing that it once did , he misses the evidence that the performance of elementary school aged girls on these tests is related to the level of anxiety displayed by their almost exclusively female teachers , who have been socially pre-conditioned with this anxiety .
This anxiety remains abundant .
But , thank goodness for all of us that Tierney is daring to ask the tough questions .
Maybe next time he 'll also dare to completely research a topic before he writes an article .
However , where he really fails , and fails hard , is here :
But a tenured physicist at a leading university … might well need skills and traits found in only one person in 10,000 : the top 0.01 percent of the population , a tiny group that would presumably include more men because it's at the extreme right tail of the distribution curve .
Even when you consider only members of an elite group like the top percentile of the seventh graders on the SAT math test , someone at the 99.9 level is more likely than someone at the 99.1 level to get a doctorate in science or to win tenure at a top university .
Can we all agree that Tierny pulled this completely out of his ass ?
Someone who scores in the top 99.9 % of an aptitude test is more likely to get tenure than someone who scores in the top 99.1 % in the seventh grade ?
Really ?
As my dear brothers PhysioProf and Drugmonkey have discussed on their blog , scientific knowledge , per se , does not predict one 's success as a tenured academic researcher .
Managing a lab as a principal investigator at a major research university requires management skills , the ability to effectively communicate to the scientific community and obtain grant dollars , the ability to effectively teach and mentor more junior scientists , and the ability to creatively outline novel research directions .
I would argue that these things are not necessarily predicted by an aptitude test taken in the seventh grade .
Which , brings us back to the idea of gender bias and culture .
This is where we need to be looking in order to close the gender gap in STEM .
Recently ScienceMama from the Mother of All Scientists sent me a link to this article from Science about how successful academic women learn to outsource daily tasks like housekeeping , childcare , and laundry .
While , I think the advice is generally good , ScienceMama picked up on the underlying social message of the article .
She wrote to me :
I can't exactly put into words why this article bothers me so much .
I understand the general intention of the article , but for some reason the take home message for me seems to be " If you 're a female scientist , you need to hire a housekeeper , whereas if you 're a male scientist you can just get a wife . "
By focusing just on female scientists , it seems like what the article is saying is that domestic chores are a woman 's responsibility .
Why should n't male scientists also be encouraged to get a housekeeper to cover all the work they are clearly neglecting at home ?
Again , I understand that the article was well - intentioned ( spend your limited free time with your family or on a hobby instead of mopping your floors ) , but the fact that it 's aimed only at female scientists seems to reinforce the idea that all of the domestic chores are the woman 's responsibility .
She 's exactly right .
We can spend our time discussing SAT scores , but I worry that we are missing the most important thing that keeps women out of science — the cultural attitudes that teach women that if they choose a demanding career , they are n't fulfilling their duties as wife and mother .
An aerial view shows the debris of a residential building and a destroyed road in the village of Nachterstedt , July 18 , 2009 .
Three residents were missing in the eastern German village of Nachterstedt after their lakeside home and another building suddenly collapsed into the water .
A 350 - meter stretch of shoreline gave way next to an old open - cast coal mine converted to a lake , about 170 kilometers southwest of Berlin .

There ’s been no shortage of “ leaked ” material surrounding Lost over the years — most of it easily , verifiably fake — but the recent discovery of six script pages from the finale uploaded at Italian blog Macchianera has even the normally cautious spoiler site Dark UFO backing them as " 100 percent accurate and real . "
( Making an unexpected but strangely compelling argument :
The script is loaded with unspoken F - bombs — which , as an io9 commenter points out , is actually standard practice for Lost writers , at least according to this “ Exodus ” script up for auction over at eBay . )
If they are real , they provide an intriguing — and yes , spoiling , though not enough to totally ruin things — glimpse into what happens between now and the episode ’s first act , and you clicked here knowing full well that 's exactly what you would get .
As always , we have to remain skeptical about “ leaks ” this close to the finale date , but it ’s certainly not unheard of ; if they are real , they represent a pretty major breach of Lost security , right in the final hours .
UPDATE : After much consideration , and in deference to our very vocal commenter community in the Lost recaps , I 've taken down the few plot points that were enumerated in the pages .
You can still click through to read them , but as always , please do n't share any of the details or speculate on them in the episode reviews themselves .
( Not that there 's much to talk about , anyway . )
Deus Ex : Human Revolution E3 2010 Preview
Now , after laying dormant for quite some time , the shooter - RPG series is making a return with a third entry , Deus Ex : Human Revolution .
This being the first project out of Eidos Montreal -- the same studio that 's handling Thief 4 -- the shooter - RPG prequel had many concerned , especially given that series creator Ion Storm followed the original Deus Ex with a less - than - beloved sequel .
But while the game on display at E3 was only a pre-alpha build , it 's looking extremely promising .
Our demonstration was led by art director Jonathan Jacques - Belletete , who narrated roughly thirty minutes of real - time gameplay controlled by his coworker .
The first part , meant to demonstrate the non-combat portions of the game , took place about six hours into the main story , with protagonist Adam Jensen walking about a cyberpunk -y city full of the sights , sounds and people one would expect of 2027 .
Shackvideo users can use the HD Stream .
" Something that 's really important to us in this game is what we 're calling the living , breathing world , " explained Jacques - Belletete .
" There 's a lot of NPCs , they walk around , we wanted to get the feeling that they 're going about their daily business , they talk to one another .
They react to the player 's actions [ such as pointing a gun in their face ] . "
However , these folks milling about are n't just scenery .
" They all have something to say , so I can be old - school Final Fantasy , enter a village , everybody has something to say to you , " Jacques - Belletete added .
" They can talk about the environment , they can talk about information about the mission you 're in at that point , and you can also find side - quests . "
Moving on , Jensen came across his first obstacle : a security guard that refused to let him into The Hive , a night club housing the person he needed to talk to .
Here 's where the first elements of choice came into play .
While Jensen eventually bribed the guard to let him pass , Jacques - Belletete made sure to point out the other options players will have open to them , such as trying to find a back way in or shooting the guard dead .
" The four pillars [ of Deux Ex ] were really important to us and we kept them - - combat , stealth , hacking and social - - it 's totally there and the game is highly concentrated around that .
Just like in the first one , you 're not obligated to play one style or another , " he explained .
" It is just really up to the player to either choose one style of gameplay or oscillate between the different gameplay styles . "
After hitting an uncooperative bartender - shaped roadblock later , Jensen was faced with another problem with various solutions .
Again , violence may be one such solution , but there are other , more subtle , methods .
For example , a bouncer openly complaining about losing his " pocket device " that contained his phone numbers and access codes , a device conveniently found in the bathroom .
The second portion of our demonstration was all about combat and the various abilities that augmentations can provide .
This is where things got exciting .
All of the really cool moments glimpsed in the computer - generated trailer , such as Jensen breaking through a wall and snapping an unsuspecting guard 's neck or someone 's arm transforming into a gatling gun , are present ( and possible ) within the game itself .
And , again , the element of choice comes into play .
Infiltrating a shipping yard , one can certainly go in guns blazing , but do n't have to .
In this instance , there 's a big crate hiding a hole in the fence , a big crate that can be moved if you have the strength augment .
To disable the security cameras , Jensen threw a crate through a window of a nearby building -- somehow , the fellow with his back to the window did n't notice -- and hopped in , stealthy taking out the fellow and using his terminal to disable the cameras .
Even here , players have various options depending on their skills -- they can read through his e-mail , choose to disable the security cameras , open up the various locks in the yard , and even turn the robotic sentries against their fleshy companions .
Of course , violence did eventually ensue , giving Jacques - Belletete the chance to demonstrate some first - person combat and weapons -- a standard pistol , a crossbow that pinned enemies to the wall -- along with other attacks and the cover system .
Though combat ( and the game itself ) is mostly a first - person affair , the camera switches to third - person while in cover , providing players with a better view of their surroundings and the ability to move and / or roll to other pieces of nearby cover .
It 's a sound idea , though the transition from first to third - person is a bit jarring at the moment .
Other augmentations and abilities on display included , thermal vision , which in conjunction with the strength augmentation enabled Jensen to reach through a wall and snap some poor guard 's neck , stealth camouflage , and a number of brutal takedowns that play out in a third - person view - - for example , taking down two guards at once or deploying miniature explosives from his arms to take down surrounding foes .
Perhaps the coolest moment in the whole demonstration was when Jensen snuck into a warehouse -- complete with Jacques - Belletete noting that there were four or five different ways in -- and a giant box dropped from the ceiling , then transformed into a tank .
The resulting firefight destroyed portions of the warehouse -- the various crates littered throughout were pulverized , though the numerous cardboard boxes Jensen took cover behind seemed impervious to damage -- before Jensen came across a rocket launcher that had been upgraded with heat - seeking capabilities and destroyed the tank .
But for all the talk about killing and lethal takedowns , it turns out that 's a choice in and of itself as well .
"
You do n't have to kill anybody , " Jacques - Belletete revealed .
" You can play the entire game without killing anybody . "
As I said above , Deus Ex : Human Revolution is looking extremely promising , though it 's still rather early .
For the sake of the demonstration , Jensen had both unlimited ammunition and energy , and the game 's interface was turned off as well , meaning that there 's a lot of unanswered questions about how it will control , how the augmentations will be balanced , and how the game will relay that information to the player .
Still , it was an impressive showing , and I 'm quite excited to see more .
Developed by Eidos Montreal , Deus Ex : Human Revolution is scheduled to arrive on PC , PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 at some point in " Early 2011 . "

Nanotechnology , the process of manipulating matter at the atomic and molecular level , has no place in organic food .
Like genetic modification , it is the antithesis of the organic concept .
Our friends at the Organic Consumers Union and others recently asked that the United States National Organic Standards Board ( NOSB ) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture formally prohibit the use of nanotechnology in organic food production .
The NOSB member from General Mills sought to delay the process by demanding that a technical definition of the term be developed .
The committee then responded by requesting a technical and scientific review of the issue .
Canada has already acted .
It recently amended its national organic rules to ban nanotechnology in food production as a “ Prohibited Substance or Method . ”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is hearing from large food companies on this issue , and has a record of siding with industry against consumers , as some of our earlier stories have shown .
It is important that we let USDA know that consumers care deeply about maintaining and preserving real organic standards .
[ Note : At press time , this article included an Action Alert to contact the NOSB .
The NOSB is no longer accepting comments on this issue , so we have removed the Action Alert . ]

The changes in Riyadh ’s reserves were revealed by the World Gold Council , the industry - backed body which regularly tracks official bullion holdings .
According to the WGC , the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency , the central bank , has gold reserves of 322.9 tones , more than double the 143 tones it had previously reported .
The central bank said in a footnote of its latest quarterly report that “ gold data have been modified from first quarter 2008 as a result of the adjustment of the Sama ’s gold accounts ” .
Sama did not respond on Sunday to calls seeking further comment .
Analysts said the rise in official gold holdings probably represented an accounting shift rather than fresh purchases .
One possibility is that a large fraction of the country ’s gold was not considered until now part of the official reserves .
But without an official explanation , analysts were keeping options open .
At current prices , the extra gold in Saudi Arabia ’s official reserves amounts to $ 7 billion .
The revelation could fuel gold ’s rally as it is a further sign that central banks are keen on gold , after two decades of selling their bullion .
Gold prices hit a nominal record high above $ 1,260 a troy ounce on Friday .
Adjusted for inflation , however , bullion is still a long way from its all - time high of more than $ 2,300 in 1980 .
The WGC revelation about Riyadh ’s gold holdings comes just a year after China surprised the bullion market when it revealed its gold holdings were more than 1,000 tones , almost double what it had reported for years .
Analysts believe that central banks could be net buyers of gold this year for the first time in nearly two decades .
India bought 200 tones of gold from the International Monetary Fund earlier this year , while Russia and others are purchasing bullion from domestic miners on a regular basis , official data show .
European central banks , after more than a decade of hefty disposals , have all but stopped selling .
Riyadh is now the 16th largest gold holder , ahead of countries such as the UK and Spain .
The US is the world ’s largest bullion holder with 8,133.5 tones .

I was n’t a very good Boy Scout when I signed - up at 6 years old .
It was n’t that I did n’t have fun traipsing around the woods — instead , I spent most of my time daydreaming about my brand new computer , a 1982 ZX Spectrum .
Nearly 28 years later , the Boy Scouts of America have figured a way to merge the two worlds of digital and nature with the launch of a new badge for geocaching .
What is geocaching you ask ?
It ’s like a treasure hunt , but instead of an old tea - stained map with a giant red X , geohunters use GPS devices to find hidden containers , or treasure if you ’re a Boy Scout .
There are several ways to play and you do n’t need to be a Boy Scout to jump in .
The simplest form of the game is to go to a Web site like geocaching .com and search for containers through ZIP code .
For example , a quick search near the New York Times building shows 2,579 different geocaches nearby .
Once you click on a location , you ’ll see a set of coordinates for the location in the form of a latitude and longitude , which will look something like this : N40 46.768 / W73 58.145 .
Then , using a GPS device , you can venture out to locate clues and eventually find a container , which usually has something hidden inside .
It ’s the perfect way to blur the line between technology , serendipity and the great outdoors .
For the Boy Scouts it offers a tool to engage video - game obsessed kids while educating them on the practical uses of technology .
As Scouting Magazine writes , this type of game teaches “ how GPS technology works , ” geolocation terms and coordinates and some of the “ precautions necessary to have a safe time while searching for geocaches . ”
The new geocache badge is appearing during he 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts .
Image caption Circumcision is part of becoming a man for some communities
Twenty South African boys have died following botched circumcisions in the Eastern Cape Province .
" The deaths occurred over the past 12 days , with nine of them occurring over the past 24 hours , " said a provincial health spokesperson .
Some 60 boys have been rescued from 11 initiation schools which have since been closed .
Circumcision is seen as a rite of passage into manhood in some South African communities .
The practice is common among the Xhosa and Ndebele communities .
However , Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini wants it reintroduced among the Zulu people because of reports that medical circumcision can reduce the chances of getting HIV .
The rescued boys have been taken to the Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital in Mthatha .
" All 60 of them have septic wounds and are dehydrated , " said Eastern Cape health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo , reports Sapa news agency .
" Four of the boys even need their genitals removed completely , as it could result in death if it 's not .
We are just waiting for consent from their parents to perform the procedures . "
Prosecution problems
Illegal initiation schools have become common in the Eastern Cape , especially in rural areas .
Unregistered surgeons often set them up as a way of making money , says the BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg .
Earlier this week , seven under - aged initiates were rescued from an illegal initiation school run by a 55 - year - old unregistered traditional surgeon who had been arrested several times for the offence .
" He was recently given a three - year suspended sentence but he continued doing the same thing .
In the past five years , close to 20 initiates died in his schools and 15 had their penises amputated , " said the Eastern Cape health department .
Health department officials are meeting the police , members of the justice department and prosecutors to discuss the prosecution of those contravening the Traditional Circumcision Act , which regulates the custom in the province , according to Sapa .
" The major problem is that parents are reluctant to prosecute illegal traditional surgeons who sometimes force their children into circumcision at a very young age , " Mr Kupelo said .
" We identify the perpetrators , but if parents are not willing to open cases against them , they are freed and continue illegally circumcising and killing these boys . "
Most initiations are either done in June - July or November - December .
Last year , 91 initiates died and hundreds were hospitalised in the province .

BP has 24 hours to chose another form of dispersant as toxicity of Corexit raises concerns among scientists
The Obama administration has ordered BP to use a less toxic form of chemical dispersant to break up the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The decision , first reported in the Washington Post , comes only hours after Congress heard devastating testimony from BP executives and scientists on the high toxicity of two forms of Corexit , and their relative ineffectiveness against the type of crude now polluting the Gulf .
The two versions of the chemical being used on the spill are banned in the UK because they are damaging to sealife .
The Washington Post reported this morning that the Environmental Protection Agency has given the oil company 24 hours to choose a less toxic form of dispersant .
Once approved by the EPA , BP will have 72 hours to deploy the new chemicals .
The heavy reliance on chemical dispersants to break up the spill has raised increasing concern among scientists and environmentalists .
More than 600,000 gallons of chemicals have been sprayed on the surface of the Gulf with another 55,000 injected directly into the oil billowing out of the ocean floor .
Scientists say the chemicals could be doing more for the oil company 's PR , than the overall clean - up of the Gulf .
The chemicals that break up the oil in small droplets help prevent giant tides of oil washing up on shore , with their disturbing images of oil - encrusted wildlife .
But they are carcinogenic , mutagenic , and highly toxic , and it is unclear how much damage they are causing to marine life in deep water – a risk acknowledged by the EPA chief , Lisa Jackson .
Corexit has never been used in such high quantities before , Jackson told Congress earlier this week .
" There has been a real reliance on them , maybe more than anybody thought would ever happen . "
Jackson said .
She added : " I 'm amazed by how little science there is on the issue . "
It is also unclear what – if any – effect the use of Corexit has on the course of the spill , especially if it gets caught in the powerful loop current .
" The injection of dispersants are really likely to change the transport , " Richard Camilli , an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Institute , told Congress this week .
The disclosure deepened fears in the scientific community that BP 's mode of cleaning up the spill could be compounding the long - term environmental damage .
The scientists say there are more powerful , less toxic dispersants available than Corexit .
Members of Congress suggested this week that BP chose Corexit because of links between the oil industry and the manufacturer , Nalco Holding .
Nalco has a former BP executive on its board .
" Why would you use something that is much more toxic and much less effective , other than you have a corporate relationship with the manufacturer ? " asked Jerrold Nadler , a Democratic congressman from New York told a hearing on Wednesday .
The EPA had approved 14 dispersants for use on the spill , including the two versions made by Corexit .
The controversy over Corexit also exposed the Obama administration to additional criticism that its scientific agencies have been too compliant with BP .
In addition to sanctioning the use of Corexit , EPA has come under fire for withholding test results on the toxicity of the water close to shore .
Meanwhile , the national oceanic and atmospheric administration , which has charge of the oceans and forecasting , has been criticised for underestimating the scale of the disaster .
Independent scientists have dismissed Noaa 's estimate that oil was flowing out of the ocean floor at 5,000 barrels a day , and say the agency has been slow to assess the damage caused by the underwater plume of oil .
Scientists studying newly released video footage of oil billowing out of the broken pipe on the ocean floor have put the flow rate as high as 100,000 barrels a day .
The scientists are also demanding access to Noaa testing of deep water samples .
“ We ’ve seen no evidence of that and very frankly , my view is that with regards to reconciliation , unless they ’re convinced that the United States is going to win and that they ’re going to be defeated , I think it ’s very difficult to proceed with a reconciliation that ’s going to be meaningful , ” he said .
Mr. Obama , speaking later after the Group of 20 meeting in Toronto , noted that as the Afghanistan war approached its 10th anniversary , it was the longest foreign war in American history , and that “ ultimately as was true in Iraq , so will be true in Afghanistan , we will have to have a political solution . ”
As for Pakistan ’s effort to broker talks , Mr. Obama added : “ I think it ’s too early to tell .
I think we have to view these efforts with skepticism but also with openness .
The Taliban is a blend of hard - core ideologues , tribal leaders , kids that basically sign up because it ’s the best job available to them .
Not all of them are going to be thinking the same way about the Afghan government , about the future of Afghanistan .
And so we ’re going to have to sort through how these talks take place . ”
The president avoided any direct comment on whether the Haqqani network , the Taliban element reportedly proposed by Pakistan as part of a deal , could become part of Afghanistan ’s future leadership .
But he said that “ conversations between the Afghan government and the Pakistani government , building trust between those two governments , are a useful step . ”
The comments Sunday were the administration ’s first public response to a report of Pakistan ’s deal - brokering efforts last week in The New York Times .
" Drill , baby , drill " is now , " Hush , baby , hush . "
The Republican battle cry that crystallized the growing popularity of offshore drilling has dropped from view since the Deepwater Horizon rig sank last week and the well it drilled started shooting crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
As Democratic opponents of the oil industry stepped up their attacks and demands for a sharp turn away from drilling , Republican leaders in Congress have slipped out of rapid - response mode and are generally holding their tongues .
The National Republican Congressional Committee has issued at least 11 broadsides at Democrats since the rig sank in 5,000 feet of water .
Most dealt with financial regulatory reform .
None addressed the rig explosion or spill .
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) has focused on jobs and health care in the nearly 20 statements he has issued in the past week without a word about the spill or loss of life , though at his on - camera news conference this week , reporters did not ask him about it .
A Nexis search turns up only four mentions of " drill , baby , drill " and Rudy Giuliani or Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , who drove the slogan home during the McCain 's 2008 presidential campaign .
Three are liberal cable hosts mocking the slogan .
The liberal web site The Huffington Post noted that Sarah Palin and party Chairman Michael Steele , who carried the drill - baby banner , have not brought up the idea since the rig sank in 5,000 feet of water approximately 52 miles southeast of Venice , La .
A pipe on the ocean floor is believed to be belching 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , of crude oil each day into the Gulf .
In an article posted yesterday shortly before midnight , the blog stated that Palin has published four new Facebook messages since the initial explosion , and Steele has issued six statements in the past week .
This morning Palin broke the silence with a Twitter comment saying , " Having worked / lived thru Exxon oil spill , my family & I understand Gulf residents ' fears .
Our prayers r w / u .
All industry efforts must b employed . "
Even as criticism of the Obama administration 's response has started to surface , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , who rarely misses an opportunity to castigate the administration , has said nary a word .
The Republicans ' decision to duck in the face of criticism could prove worrisome to its allies in the petroleum industry , who before the spill had gained significant political momentum in Washington for their drive to open up new areas for production .
The Democratic attacks and Republican silence came even as about 70 oil and gas workers fanned out across Capitol Hill this week to lobby for domestic development in a " fly in " organized by the American Petroleum Institute .
API issued a statement the day after the rig exploded , stressing the importance of safety in drilling .
But even as oil began to wash ashore in Louisiana wetlands , Newt Gingrich 's American Solutions for Winning the Future organization continued to solicit signatures for its " Drill here , Drill now , Pay less , " campaign in support of more domestic production in American waters .
The slogan is pasted atop the group 's website above a staff - written spill update with a generally optimistic view , though it does note that the spill could damage the Gulf 's seafood industry .
And there are signs that even Democrats are walking back what support they had begrudgingly granted to offshore drilling .
President Obama announced late last month that he wanted to expand drilling in the Atlantic Ocean , the Gulf and the seas around Alaska .
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , a longtime drilling opponent and close White House ally , maintained yesterday that Obama had not actually expanded drilling .
" What the president was talking about was actually narrowing the drilling , " Pelosi said in her weekly televised news conference .
" The president was being discrete in proposing some areas for review that people might agree to .
So it is n't as if the president expanded drilling .
He was narrowing what the moratorium lifted .
Am I clear ? "
Democratic calls for rethinking the nation 's pro-offshore drilling policy are spreading beyond the gulf .
As have some environmental groups , House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Jim Moran ( D - Va. ) said the Gulf spill shows drilling should not be expanded off Alaska either .
" If the drilling industry is incapable of capping a blowout in temperate waters in a region with more than 80 years of offshore experience in the close proximity of equipment , manpower and technical expertise , I have grave doubts about the industry 's response capabilities in the frigid Arctic waters off Alaska 's coast , " Moran said .
The spill could also threaten hope of Republicans and more conservative Democrats in his state for drilling off Virginia Beach .

With the right commands , you can turn your favorite command - line text editor into a distraction - free Google Docs app , add new events to Google Calendar , upload images to Picasa or video to YouTube , backup your Google data , and more .
Here 's how it works .

On Friday , Google released GoogleCL , a saucy command line program that interacts with Google services from any * nix - friendly command - line prompt ( on Windows , Mac , or Linux ) .
We spent the weekend playing around with it , and now we 're sharing a few of the coolest ways we 've been putting it to use .
What You 'll Need
Before you can execute any of the cool commands below , you 'll need to have installed a few things to get GoogleCL up and running on your system .
Advertisement
If you have n't already , you 'll need to have installed Python 2.5 or higher on your system .
To do so , simply type python - V at your command line prompt ( see screenshot ) .
Advertisement
Now that you 've got everything up and running , let 's take a look at some of the coolest tricks you can accomplish .
Use Your Command Line as a Distraction - Free , Google - Docs - Backed - Up Text Editor
Distraction - free text editors are all the rage these days , but who needs a fancy new application to give you a plain text word processor when GoogleCL can do the same thing — and when you 're finished , upload your results to your Google Docs account every time you save .
To fire up your own minimalist , distraction - free GoogleCL word processor from the command line , just try something like :
Advertisement
google docs edit — title " To - Do List " — editor vim
The command above will open and edit an existing document in your Google Docs account if one exists ; if not , it 'll create one with the title you 've provided .
The last piece , -- editor , determines which command line text editor you 'll be working in .
If you 're a whiz with vim , then you 'll probably want to use that .
If you 're not all that familiar or comfortable with vim , I 'd recommend editing using nano , a command - line based text editor that 's a bit more like writing in a normal word processor , and will look like so :
Advertisement
When you 're finished writing and want to upload your results to Google Docs , in nano type Control + X to upload the results to Docs and quit your text editor .
( You can fire it back up to edit the same document at any time by just repeating the command above ) .

Quickly Add Any Event to Google Calendar with Plain Language
You can quickly add any event to your Google calendar with GoogleCL with one command and plain language .
For example , if I were to simply type :
google calendar add " Dinner tomorrow at 8 pm with Ellen at Figaro "
Advertisement
... and hit Enter , GoogleCL will create the event in Calendar and figure out what I meant about the when and where .
It 's the same Quick Add feature available on the Google Calendar site , but you do n't have to fire up your web browser and wait for Calendar to load to use it .
You can enter the who , what , where , and when , and Google Calendar will figure out the rest .
Upload a Folder of Images to Picasa
Advertisement
Sure you could open up the Picasa desktop app , but if you 've got a folder full of old pictures you want to upload to Picasa in a jiffy , the GoogleCL upload tool is a great option :
google picasa create — title " My Awesome Pool Party " ~/ photos / poolpartypics / *
Advertisement
As you 've probably figured out , -- title denotes that " My Awesome Pool Party " is the name of your new album , and the folder directory after that is the folder it 's going to upload pictures from .
You could upload an individual picture , but if you want to upload the whole folder , make sure you include the asterisk at the end of the path .
When it 's done , you should see all those pics up and ready to share on your Picasa Web Albums account .

Upload a Video to YouTube
I actually hate using YouTube 's web - based uploader , so I 'm especially keen on this one .
You can upload any video to YouTube like so :
google youtube post — category Technology ~/Desktop/ maddow-talks-lifehacker.mp4
Schedule Backups for Your Google Data
Possibly one of the most useful ways you could put GoogleCL to use off the bat — particularly if you 're paranoid with the idea of storing all your data online — is to back up the data from your Google services .
In a single command for each service , GoogleCL can back up all of your Contacts , Docs , and Picasa photo albums , for example , and I 'd guess the backup support will improve for most of the services .
Here 's how it works for Contacts , Picasa , and Docs .
Advertisement
Google Contacts
google contacts list > contacts_backup.csv
This will pipe all of your contacts to a comma-separated list that can easily be imported to other contact management applications or simply saved to a backup folder , just in case .

Picasa Photos
google picasa get *

Note : Docs backup is n't perfect just yet ( spreadsheets are n't supported , and I had to enter the specific folder I wanted downloaded instead of it letting me grab everything at once , but GoogleCL was released on Friday and already updated once this weekend , so I 'd expect some of these tools to get a lot better over time .

Expanding What GoogleCL Can Do with Other Tools
As you probably figured out after examining a few of the actions described above , GoogleCL 's syntax is pretty simple .
To execute a command , you simply type google , followed by the service you want to access ( e.g. , calendar ) , followed by the kind of action you want to perform using that service ( e.g. , create , edit , delete , post , etc. ) .
Finally , you 'll add some specifics after that action based on whatever it is you 're doing ( e.g. , the file you want to upload , the title you want to give to a new document , or the event you want to schedule ) .

With other tools and tricks , you can do all sorts of fun stuff with your Google data .
Over at Smarterware , Gina suggested using the Calendar tool to display your agenda for the day every time you open a new Terminal window by adding :
echo " Next 24 hours : " ; google calendar today title
... to your ~/.bash_profile file .
Whitson suggested piping the results to a plain text file to use with something like GeekTool ( Mac ) or Rainmeter ( Windows ) — both of which can display plain text files on your desktop .
A command like :
google calendar today title > myagenda.txt
... would do the trick nicely .
( The greater - than sign pipes the output of any command to a file , so myagenda . txt would contain the same text returned in the command line . )

Cron It
Perhaps most useful , a lot of the tasks available — particularly related to downloading backups or uploading folders of pre-defined content — can get especially handy if you set them up to run as cron jobs .
Cron schedules any command based on user - defined times , so you could set a cron job to , say , download backups of your Picasa photos on a weekly or nightly basis .
If you 're new scheduling with cron , check out IBM 's introduction to cron .
If you 've been toying around with GoogleCL over the weekend — or reading through some of these suggestions gave you some ideas — let 's hear how you 'd take advantage of GoogleCL in the comments .

Total number of living humans on Earth
World human population estimates from 1800 to 2100 , with estimated range of future population after 2020 based on " high " and " low " scenarios .
Data from the United Nations projections in 2019
World population percentage by country
In demographics , the world population is the total number of humans currently living , and was estimated to have reached 7,800,000,000 people as of March 2020 . [ 2] [ 3 ]
It took over 2 million years of human history for the world 's population to reach 1 billion , [ 4 ] and only 200 years more to reach 7 billion . [ 5 ]
The world population has experienced continuous growth following the Great Famine of 1315 – 1317 and the end of the Black Death in 1350 , when it was near 370 million .
[ 6 ]
The highest global population growth rates , with increases of over 1.8 % per year , occurred between 1955 and 1975 – peaking to 2.1 % between 1965 and 1970 .
[ 7 ]
The growth rate declined to 1.2 % between 2010 and 2015 and is projected to decline further in the course of the 21st century . [ 7 ]
However , the global population is still increasing [ 8 ] and is projected to reach about 10 billion in 2050 and more than 11 billion in 2100 . [ 9 ]
Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 139 million , [ 10 ] and as of 2011 were expected to remain essentially constant at a level of 135 million , [ 11 ] while deaths numbered 56 million per year and were expected to increase to 80 million per year by 2040 . [ 12 ]
The median age of the world 's population was estimated to be 30.4 years in 2018 . [ 13 ]
In mid-2019 , the United Nations estimated that the world population had reached 7,713,000,000 . [ 14 ]
Population by region
Six of the Earth 's seven continents are permanently inhabited on a large scale .
Asia is the most populous continent , with its 4.54 billion inhabitants accounting for 60 % of the world population .
The world 's two most populated countries , China and India , together constitute about 36 % of the world 's population .
Africa is the second most populated continent , with around 1.28 billion people , or 16 % of the world 's population .
Europe 's 742 million people make up 10 % of the world 's population as of 2018 , while the Latin American and Caribbean regions are home to around 651 million ( 9 % ) .
Northern America , primarily consisting of the United States and Canada , has a population of around 363 million ( 5 % ) , and Oceania , the least populated region , has about 41 million inhabitants ( 0.5 % ) . [ 16 ]
Antarctica only has a very small , fluctuating population of about 1000 people based mainly in polar science stations . [ 17 ]
Population by continent
History
Estimates of world population by their nature are an aspect of modernity , possible only since the Age of Discovery .
Early estimates for the population of the world [ 20 ] date to the 17th century : William Petty in 1682 estimated world population at 320 million ( modern estimates ranging close to twice this number ) ; by the late 18th century , estimates ranged close to one billion ( consistent with modern estimates ) . [ 21 ]
More refined estimates , broken down by continents , were published in the first half of the 19th century , at 600 million to 1 billion in the early 1800s and at 800 million to 1 billion in the 1840s . [ 22 ]
It is difficult for estimates to be better than rough approximations , as even modern population estimates are fraught with uncertainties on the order of 3 % to 5 % . [ 23 ]
Ancient and post - classical history
Estimates of the population of the world at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15 million . [ 24 ] [ 25 ]
Even earlier , genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BC , according to the Toba catastrophe theory .
By contrast , it is estimated that around 50 –60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD . [ 26 ]
The Plague of Justinian , which first emerged during the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian , caused Europe 's population to drop by around 50 % between the 6th and 8th centuries AD . [ 27 ]
The population of Europe was more than 70 million in 1340 . [ 28 ]
The Black Death pandemic of the 14th century may have reduced the world 's population from an estimated 450 million in 1340 to between 350 and 375 million in 1400 ; [ 29 ] it took 200 years for population figures to recover . [ 30 ]
The population of China decreased from 123 million in 1200 to 65 million in 1393 , [ 31 ] presumably from a combination of Mongol invasions , famine , and plague . [ 32 ]
Starting in AD 2 , the Han Dynasty of ancient China kept consistent family registers in order to properly assess the poll taxes and labor service duties of each household . [ 33 ]
In that year , the population of Western Han was recorded as 57,671,400 individuals in 12,366,470 households , decreasing to 47,566,772 individuals in 9,348,227 households by AD 146 , towards the End of the Han Dynasty . [ 33 ]
At the founding of the Ming Dynasty in 1368 , China 's population was reported to be close to 60 million ; toward the end of the dynasty in 1644 , it may have approached 150 million . [ 34 ]
England 's population reached an estimated 5.6 million in 1650 , up from an estimated 2.6 million in 1500 . [ 35 ]
New crops that were brought to Asia and Europe from the Americas by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 16th century are believed to have contributed to population growth . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ]
Since their introduction to Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century , [ 39 ] maize and cassava have similarly replaced traditional African crops as the most important staple food crops grown on the continent . [ 40 ]
The pre-Columbian population of the Americas is uncertain ; historian David Henige called it " the most unanswerable question in the world . " [ 41 ]
By the end of the 20th century , scholarly consensus favored an estimate of roughly 55 million people , but numbers from various sources have ranged from 10 million to 100 million . [ 42 ]
Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence . [ 43 ]
According to the most extreme scholarly claims , as many as 90 % of the Native American population of the New World died of Old World diseases such as smallpox , measles , and influenza . [ 44 ]
Over the centuries , the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases , while the indigenous peoples had no such immunity . [ 45 ]
Modern history
[ 46 ]
By 2050 , the proportion may reach 70 % . [ 47 ]
Map showing urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2006 .
Only 3 % of the world 's population lived in urban areas in 1800 ; this proportion had risen to 47 % by 2000 , and reached 50.5 % by 2010 .
By 2050 , the proportion may reach 70 % .
During the European Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions , the life expectancy of children increased dramatically . [ 48 ]
The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5 % in 1730 –1749 to 31.8 % in 1810 –1829 .[49 ] [ 50 ]
Between 1700 and 1900 , Europe 's population increased from about 100 million to over 400 million . [ 51 ]
Altogether , the areas populated by people of European descent comprised 36 % of the world 's population in 1900 . [ 52 ]
Population growth in the West became more rapid after the introduction of vaccination and other improvements in medicine and sanitation . [ 53 ]
Improved material conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 19th century . [ 54 ]
The population of the United Kingdom reached 60 million in 2006 . [ 55 ]
The United States saw its population grow from around 5.3 million in 1800 to 106 million in 1920 , exceeding 307 million in 2010 . [ 56 ]
The first half of the 20th century in Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union was marked by a succession of major wars , famines and other disasters which caused large - scale population losses ( approximately 60 million excess deaths ) . [ 57 ] [ 58 ]
After the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia 's population declined significantly – from 150 million in 1991 to 143 million in 2012 [ 59 ] – but by 2013 this decline appeared to have halted . [ 60 ]
Many countries in the developing world have experienced extremely rapid population growth since the early 20th century , due to economic development and improvements in public health .
China 's population rose from approximately 430 million in 1850 to 580 million in 1953 , [ 61 ] and now stands at over 1.3 billion .
The population of the Indian subcontinent , which was about 125 million in 1750 , increased to 389 million in 1941 ; [ 62 ] today , India , Pakistan and Bangladesh are collectively home to about 1.63 billion people . [ 63 ]
Java had about 5 million inhabitants in 1815 ; its present - day successor , Indonesia , now has a population of over 140 million . [ 64 ]
In just one hundred years , the population of Brazil decupled ( x10 ) , from about 17 million in 1900 , or about 1 % of the world population in that year , to about 176 million in 2000 , or almost 3 % of the global population in the very early 21st century .
Mexico 's population grew from 13.6 million in 1900 to about 112 million in 2010 . [ 65 ] [ 66 ]
Between the 1920s and 2000s , Kenya 's population grew from 2.9 million to 37 million . [ 67 ]
Milestones by the billions
World population milestones in billions ( USCB estimates ) Population 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Year 1804 1927 1960 1974 1987 1999 2011 2024 2042 Years elapsed — 123 33 14 13 12 12 13 18
It is estimated that the world population reached one billion for the first time in 1804 .
It was another 123 years before it reached two billion in 1927 , but it took only 33 years to reach three billion in 1960 . [ 68 ]
Thereafter , the global population reached four billion in 1974 , five billion in 1987 , six billion in 1999 and , according to the United States Census Bureau , seven billion in March 2012 . [ 69 ]
The United Nations , however , estimated that the world population reached seven billion in October 2011 . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ]
According to current projections , the global population will reach eight billion by 2024 , and is likely to reach around nine billion by 2042 .
Alternative scenarios for 2050 range from a low of 7.4 billion to a high of more than 10.6 billion . [ 73 ]
Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations , especially the fertility variable .
Long - range predictions to 2150 range from a population decline to 3.2 billion in the " low scenario " , to " high scenarios " of 24.8 billion . [ 73 ]
One extreme scenario predicted a massive increase to 256 billion by 2150 , assuming the global fertility rate remained at its 1995 level of 3.04 children per woman ; however , by 2010 the global fertility rate had declined to 2.52 . [ 74 ] [ 75 ]
There is no estimation for the exact day or month the world 's population surpassed one or two billion .
The points at which it reached three and four billion were not officially noted , but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau placed them in July 1959 and April 1974 respectively .
The United Nations did determine , and commemorate , the " Day of 5 Billion " on 11 July 1987 , and the " Day of 6 Billion " on 12 October 1999 .
The Population Division of the United Nations declared the " Day of 7 Billion " to be 31 October 2011 . [ 76 ] [ needs update ]

In 2015 , the World Health Organization estimated the average global life expectancy as 71.4 years .
As of 2012 , the global sex ratio is approximately 1.01 males to 1 female .
The greater number of men is possibly due to the significant sex imbalances evident in the Indian and Chinese populations . [ 78 ] [ 79 ]
Approximately 26.3 % of the global population is aged under 15 , while 65.9 % is aged 15 – 64 and 7.9 % is aged 65 or over . [ 78 ]
The median age of the world 's population was estimated to be 29.7 years in 2014 , [ 80 ] and is expected to rise to 37.9 years by 2050 . [ 81 ]
According to the World Health Organization , the global average life expectancy is 71.4 years as of 2015 , with women living an average of 74 years and men approximately 69 years . [ 77 ]
In 2010 , the global fertility rate was estimated at 2.52 children per woman . [ 75 ]
In June 2012 , British researchers calculated the total weight of Earth 's human population as approximately 287 million tonnes , with the average person weighing around 62 kilograms ( 137 lb ) . [ 82 ]
The CIA estimated nominal 2013 gross world product at US $ 74.31 trillion , giving an annual global per capita figure of around US $ 10,500 . [ 83 ]
Around 1.29 billion people ( 18.4 % of the world population ) live in extreme poverty , subsisting on less than US $ 1.25 per day ; [ 84 ] approximately 870 million people ( 12.3 % ) are undernourished . [ 85 ] 83 % of the world 's over - 15s are considered literate . [ 78 ]
In June 2014 , there were around 3.03 billion global Internet users , constituting 42.3 % of the world population . [ 86 ]
The Han Chinese are the world 's largest single ethnic group , constituting over 19 % of the global population in 2011 . [ 87 ]
The world 's most - spoken first languages are Mandarin Chinese ( spoken by 12.4 % of the world 's population ) , Spanish ( 4.9 % ) , English ( 4.8 % ) , Arabic ( 3.3 % ) and Hindi ( 2.7 % ) . [ 78 ]
The world 's largest religion is Christianity , whose adherents account for 31.4 % of the global population ; [ 88 ]
Islam is the second - largest religion , accounting for 24.1 % , and Hinduism the third , accounting for 13.8 % . [ 78 ]
In 2005 , around 16 % of the global population were reported to be non-religious . [ 89 ]

Fluctuation
Estimates of population evolution in different continents between 1950 and 2050 , according to the United Nations .
The vertical axis is logarithmic and is in millions of people .
Population size fluctuates at differing rates in differing regions .
Nonetheless , population growth is the long - standing trend on all inhabited continents , as well as in most individual states .
During the 20th century , the global population saw its greatest increase in known history , rising from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to over 6 billion in 2000 .
A number of factors contributed to this increase , including the lessening of the mortality rate in many countries by improved sanitation and medical advances , and a massive increase in agricultural productivity attributed to the Green Revolution .
[ 100 ] [ 101 ] [ 102 ]
In 2000 , the United Nations estimated that the world 's population was growing at an annual rate of 1.1 % ( equivalent to around 75 million people ) , [ 103 ] down from a peak of 88 million per year in 1989 .
By 2000 , there were approximately ten times as many people on Earth as there had been in 1700 .
Globally , the population growth rate has been steadily declining from its peak of 2.2 % in 1963 , but growth remains high in Latin America , the Middle East , and Sub - Saharan Africa . [ 104 ]
During the 2010s , Japan and some countries in Europe began to encounter negative population growth ( i.e. a net decrease in population over time ) , due to sub - replacement fertility rates . [ 99 ]
In 2006 , the United Nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global demographic transition .
If this trend continues , the rate of growth may diminish to zero by 2050 , concurrent with a world population plateau of 9.2 billion .
[ 105 ]
However , this is only one of many estimates published by the UN ; in 2009 , UN population projections for 2050 ranged between around 8 billion and 10.5 billion .
[ 106 ]
An alternative scenario is given by the statistician Jorgen Randers , who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility .
Randers ' " most likely scenario " reveals a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people , followed by decline .
[ 107 ]
Adrian Raftery , a University of Washington professor of statistics and of sociology , states that " there ’s a 70 percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century .
Population , which had sort of fallen off the world ’s agenda , remains a very important issue . " [ 108 ]

Projections
Long - term global population growth is difficult to predict .
The United Nations and the US Census Bureau both give different estimates – according to the UN , the world population reached seven billion in late 2011 , [ 110 ] while the USCB asserted that this occurred in March 2012 . [ 120 ]
The UN has issued multiple projections of future world population , based on different assumptions .
From 2000 to 2005 , the UN consistently revised these projections downward , until the 2006 revision , issued on 14 March 2007 , revised the 2050 mid-range estimate upwards by 273 million .
Average global birth rates are declining fast , but vary greatly between developed countries ( where birth rates are often at or below replacement levels ) and developing countries ( where birth rates typically remain high ) .
Different ethnicities also display varying birth rates .
Death rates can change rapidly due to disease epidemics , wars and other mass catastrophes , or advances in medicine .
2012 United Nations projections show a continued increase in population in the near future with a steady decline in population growth rate ; the global population is expected to reach between 8.3 and 10.9 billion by 2050 . [ 121 ] [ 122 ] 2003 UN
Population Division population projections for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion . [ 74 ]
One of many independent mathematical models supports the lower estimate , [ 123 ] while a 2014 estimate forecasts between 9.3 and 12.6 billion in 2100 , and continued growth thereafter . [ 124 ] [ 125 ]
The 2019 Revision of the UN estimates gives the " medium variant " population as ; nearly 8.6 billion in 2030 , about 9.7 billion in 2050 and about 10.9 billion in 2100 . [ 126 ]
In December 2019 , the German Foundation for World Population projected that the global population will reach 8 billion by 2023 as it increases by 156 every minute . [ 127 ]
In a modelled future projection by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation the global population was projected to peak in 2064 at 9.73 billion people and decline to 8.79 billion in 2100 .
[ 128 ]
Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth , highlighting the growing pressures on the environment , [ 129 ] global food supplies , and energy resources . [ 130 ] [ 131 ] [ 132 ]

Mathematical approximations
In 1975 , Sebastian von Hoerner proposed a formula for population growth which represented hyperbolic growth with an infinite population in 2025 . [ 135 ]
The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development .
This feedback can be described as follows : technological advance → increase in the carrying capacity of land for people → demographic growth → more people → more potential inventors → acceleration of technological advance → accelerating growth of the carrying capacity → faster population growth → accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors → faster technological advance → hence , the faster growth of the Earth 's carrying capacity for people , and so on . [ 136 ]
The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition .
According to the Russian demographer Sergey Kapitsa , [ 137 ] the world population grew between 67,000 BC and 1965 according to the following formula :
N = C τ arccot ⁡ T 0 − T τ {\displaystyle N={\frac { C}{\tau }}\operatorname {arccot} {\frac { T_{0} - T}{\tau }}}
where
N is current population
is current population T is the current year
is the current year C = ( 1.86±0.01 ) ·10 11
= ( 1.86±0.01 ) ·10 T 0 = 2007±1
= 2007±1 τ {\displaystyle \tau }
Years for world population to double
According to linear interpolation and extrapolation of UNDESA population estimates , the world population has doubled , or will double , in the years listed in the tables below ( with two different starting points ) .
During the 2nd millennium , each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling , fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above .
However , after 2024 , it is unlikely that there will be another doubling of the global population in the 21st century . [ 138 ]

Overpopulation
Predictions of scarcity
In his 1798 work An Essay on the Principle of Population , the British scholar Thomas Malthus incorrectly predicted that continued population growth would exhaust the global food supply by the mid-19th century .
Malthus wrote the essay to refute what he considered the unattainable utopian ideas of William Godwin and Marquis de Condorcet , as presented in Political Justice and The Future Progress of the Human Mind .
In 1968 , Paul R. Ehrlich reprised Malthus ' argument in The Population Bomb , predicting that mass global famine would occur in the 1970s and 1980s . [ 140 ]
The predictions of Ehrlich and other neo-Malthusians were vigorously challenged by a number of economists , notably Julian Lincoln Simon , and advances in agriculture , collectively known as the Green Revolution , forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century .
Between 1950 and 1984 , as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the world , grain production increased by over 250 % . [ 141 ]
The world population has grown by over four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution , but food production has so far kept pace with population growth .
Most scholars believe that , without the Revolution , there would be greater levels of famine and malnutrition than the UN presently documents . [ 142 ]
However , neo-Malthusians point out that fossil fuels provided the energy for the Green Revolution , in the form of natural gas - derived fertilizers , oil - derived pesticides , and hydrocarbon - fueled irrigation , and that many crops have become so genetically uniform that a crop failure in any one country could potentially have global repercussions . [ 143 ]
In 2004 , a meta - analysis of 70 quantitative studies estimating a sustainable limit to the world population generated a meta-estimate of 7.7 billion people . [ 144 ]
In May 2008 , the price of grain was pushed up severely by the increased cultivation of biofuels , the increase of world oil prices to over $ 140 per barrel ( $ 880 / m3 ) , [ 145 ] global population growth , [ 146 ] the effects of climate change , [ 147 ] the loss of agricultural land to residential and industrial development , [ 148 ] [ 149 ] and growing consumer demand in the population centres of China and India . [ 150 ] [ 151 ]
Food riots subsequently occurred in some countries .
[ 152 ] [ 153 ]
However , oil prices then fell sharply .
Resource demands are expected to ease as population growth declines , but it is unclear whether mass food wastage and rising living standards in developing countries will once again create resource shortages .
[ 154 ] [ 155 ]
David Pimentel , professor of ecology and agriculture at Cornell University , estimates that the sustainable agricultural carrying capacity for the United States is about 200 million people ; its population as of 2015 is over 300 million . [ 156 ]
In 2009 , the UK government 's chief scientific advisor , Professor John Beddington , warned that growing populations , falling energy reserves and food shortages would create a " perfect storm " of shortages of food , water , and energy by 2030 . [ 139 ] [ 157 ]
According to a 2009 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , the world will have to produce 70 % more food by 2050 to feed a projected extra 2.3 billion people . [ 158 ]
The observed figures for 2007 showed an actual increase in absolute numbers of undernourished people in the world , with 923 million undernourished in 2007 , versus 832 million in 1995 .
[ 159 ]
The 2009 FAO estimates showed an even more dramatic increase , to 1.02 billion . [ 160 ]
Environmental impacts
A number of scientists have argued that the current global population expansion and accompanying increase in resource consumption threatens the world 's ecosystem . [ 161 ] [ 162 ]
The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth , which was ratified by 58 member national academies in 1994 , states that " unprecedented " population growth aggravates many environmental problems , including rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide , global warming , and pollution . [ 163 ]
Indeed , some analysts claim that overpopulation 's most serious impact is its effect on the environment . [ 131 ]
The situation has continued to worsen , as at the time of the 1994 IAP statement , the world population stood at 5.5 billion and lower - bound scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050 , a number that current estimates state will be reached in the late 2020s .
Scientists contend that human overpopulation , continued human population growth and overconsumption , particularly by the wealthy , are the primary drivers of mass species extinction .
[ 164 ] [ 165 ] [ 166 ] [ 167 ]
By 2050 population growth , along with profligate consumption , could result in oceans containing more plastic than fish by weight .
[ 166 ]
In November 2017 , a statement by 15,364 scientists from 184 countries asserted that rapid human population growth is the " primary driver behind many ecological and even societal threats . " [ 168 ]
African wildlife populations are declining significantly as growing human populations encroach on protected ecosystems , such as the Serengeti . [ 169 ]
The Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services , released by IPBES in 2019 , states that human population growth is a factor in biodiversity loss . [ 170 ] [ 129 ]
According to a 2020 World Wildlife Fund Living Planet Report and its Living Planet Index , global wildlife populations have plummeted by 68 % since 1970 as a result of overconsumption , population growth and intensive farming , which experts assert is further evidence that humans have unleashed a sixth mass extinction event on earth . [ 171 ] [ 172 ]
A July 2017 study published in Environmental Research Letters argued that the most significant way individuals could mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have fewer children , followed by living without a vehicle , foregoing air travel , and adopting a plant - based diet . [ 173 ]
Population control
India is predicted to overtake China as the world 's most populous country by 2022 .
Human population control is the practice of intervening to alter the rate of population growth .
Historically , human population control has been implemented by limiting a region 's birth rate , by voluntary contraception or by government mandate .
It has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty , environmental concerns , and religious reasons .
The use of abortion in some population control strategies has caused controversy , [ 174 ] with religious organizations such as the Roman Catholic Church explicitly opposing any intervention in the human reproductive process . [ 175 ]
The University of Nebraska publication Green Illusions argues that population control to alleviate environmental pressures need not be coercive .
It states that " Women who are educated , economically engaged , and in control of their own bodies can enjoy the freedom of bearing children at their own pace , which happens to be a rate that is appropriate for the aggregate ecological endowment of our planet . " [ 176 ]
The book Fatal Misconception by Matthew Connelly similarly points to the importance of supporting the rights of women in bringing population levels down over time . [ 177 ]
Paul Ehrlich also advocates making " modern contraception and back - up abortion available to all and give women full equal rights , pay and opportunities with men , " noting that it could possibly " lead to a low enough total fertility rate that the needed shrinkage of population would follow .
[ But ] it will take a very long time to humanely reduce total population to a size that is sustainable . "
Ehrlich places the optimum global population size at 1.5 to 2 billion people . [ 178 ]
Other academicians and public figures have pointed to the role of agriculture and agricultural productivity of increasing human carrying capacity , which results in population overshoot , as with any other species when their food supply experiences an increase , which in turn results in resource depletion and mass poverty and starvation in the case of humans . [ 179 ] [ 180 ] [ 181 ] [ 182 ]
Number of humans who have ever lived
Estimates of the total number of humans who have ever lived range in the order of 100 billion .
It is difficult for estimates to be better than rough approximations , as even modern population estimates are fraught with uncertainties on the order of 3 % to 5 % . [ 23 ] Kapitza ( 1996 ) cites estimates ranging between 80 and 150 billion .
[ 183 ] Haub ( 1995 ) prepared another figure , updated in 2002 and 2011 ; the 2011 figure was approximately 107 billion . [ 184 ] [ 185 ] [ 186 ]
Haub characterized this figure as an estimate that required " selecting population sizes for different points from antiquity to the present and applying assumed birth rates to each period " . [ 185 ]
Robust population data only exists for the last two or three centuries .
Until the late 18th century , few governments had ever performed an accurate census .
In many early attempts , such as in Ancient Egypt and the Persian Empire , the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service . [ 187 ]
Thus , there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations .
Another critical factor for such an estimate is the question of pre-modern infant mortality rates ; these figures are very difficult to estimate for ancient times due to a lack of accurate records .
Haub ( 1995 ) estimates that around 40 % of those who have ever lived did not survive beyond their first birthday .
Haub also stated that " life expectancy at birth probably averaged only about ten years for most of human history " , [ 185 ] which is not to be mistaken for the life expectancy after reaching adulthood .
The latter equally depended on period , location and social standing , but calculations identify averages from roughly 30 years upward .

A member over at Howard Forums uncovered an interesting bit of info when attempting to benchmark his [ overclocked ]
Droid using Quadrant ( find it free in the market ) .
Sitting just below a Nexus One running Android 2.2 and above the Samsung Galaxy S was a device listed as the Shadow MB810 .
That would be the Motorola Shadow ( or whatever it ends up being called ) .
Just to be sure I double checked and sure enough there it was .
( Quadrant pools data from users for comparisons , so one of the few to currently have the Shadow in the wild must have ran a previous test ) .
What does the result tell us ?
Well simply , that the phone is pretty fast .
The interesting thing is that we have every indication that the version of the Shadow that has been kicking around for its current round of testing is running on Android 2.1 .
If you look at the jump between the Nexus One running Android 2.1 and the N1 with Android 2.2 and the JIT compiler , you ’ll have to get excited about the prospect of the Shadow running Android 2.2
Then again , the Shadow that was tested may have already been upgraded to Android 2.2 , based on the suggestion that the PowerVR SGX 530 GPU in the OMAP 3630 supposedly found in the Shadow would n’t best the PowerVR SGX 540 GPU in the Galaxy S head - to - head on Android 2.1 .
No matter what it ’s a win / win .
The Shadow will either come with Froyo out of the box ( likely ) or it will be even more insanely fast once it does get the Froyo update .
For a comparison between the OMAP 3430 processor of the Droid and the ( rumored ) OMAP 3630 of the Shadow , see the video below :

Is « Big Oil » also « too big to fail » us ?
Le patron de la prospective au département américain de l’énergie dit qu’il est possible que la production mondiale de pétrole et de ses substituts décline à partir de l’an prochain .
Et alors ?
Oh , trois fois rien .
S’il y a une matière première dont l’humanité technologique ne sait pas se passer , c’est le pétrole .
D’après l’enquête publiée ici le 23 mars [ version anglaise ] , Glen Sweetnam , directeur de la division internationale , économique et des gaz à effet de serre de l’Administration de l’information sur l’énergie à Washington , avance six faits qui sont à mon sens terriblement lourds de conséquences :
2 – « il existe une chance pour que nous fassions l’expérience d’un déclin » de la production mondiale de carburants liquides entre 2011 et 2015 ;
3 – l’industrie pétrolière semble cruellement manquer de nouveaux projets d’extraction pétrolière capables de compenser un déclin amorcé ou imminent des plus grandes régions pétrolifères historiques ;
4– afin de compenser ce déclin , il faudrait trouver d’ici à 2015 ( mais où ? ) l’équivalent de la production de l’Arabie Saoudite , 1er producteur mondial ;
5– la distillation d’agrocarburants ( qui accaparerait déjà un quart de la production américaine de céréales , ndlr ) est en passe de devenir vitale face aux besoins de l’économie américaine et mondiale ;
6 – il devient logiquement indispensable d’aller forer dans l’océan Arctique ( dont l’accès à l’industrie se libère grâce à la fonte de la banquise provoquée par le réchauffement climatique , lui - même généré par les émissions de CO2 induites par notre addiction au pétrole , ndlr ) .
J’ai dit six …
Ah , oui !
Et bien , pour le premier fait , c’est un peu subtil , voyez - vous .
Bon , je l’avoue , ce n’est qu’une pauvre hypothèse , mais d’elle pourraient découler logiquement les cinq autres affirmations ci-dessus .
Cette hypothèse , c’est en fait une légère extrapolation de ma part , qui s’égare sans doute entre les lignes des réponses du patron de la prospective pétrolière à Washington .
C’est d’ailleurs l’une des interrogations à laquelle Glen Sweetnam n’a pas souhaité répondre .
Je la restitue donc dans son esprit : 1 – la production mondiale maximale de pétrole aurait - elle pu être atteinte par mégarde , M. Sweetnam ?
[ Au passage , je ne peux pas croire que Sweetnam lâche ce genre de diagnostic ( 2- ) à moi — c’est - à- dire personne — sans que l’administration Obama n’ait un plan média en tête .
Steven Chu , secrétaire à l’énergie de Barack Obama , n’est certes pas Dick Cheney …
Peut - être suis - je un ballon - test ? ]
L’économie ou la géologie : un trompe - l’œil
Ça va mal ?
Peut - être bien , et c’est rien de le dire .
Le spectre du « peak oil » est- il sur nous ?
Le peak oil , c’est l’instant historique futur , incertain mais fatidique , à partir duquel les extractions mondiales seront vouées à décroître inexorablement , faute de réserves nouvelles suffisantes encore intactes sous terre .
Mon papier évite soigneusement d’avancer un point de vue sur cette question très délicate de l’imminence d’une limite géologique aux extractions d’or noir .
Glen Sweetnam évoque des problèmes économiques conjoncturels , un simple défaut provisoire d’investissements .
D’autres experts du pétrole ( diable , ce qu’ils sont nombreux !) clament que nous faisons face à une limite géologique absolue : sur l’arbre fruitier , on cueille d’abord les fruits les plus beaux et à portée de main , avant de se résoudre à aller chercher ceux qui sont gâtés , là haut , sur les branches les plus difficiles à atteindre .
Or il semble que l’industrie de l’or noir ait déjà trouvé tout ce qu’elle pouvait découvrir comme farine pour faire son pain blanc ( désolé ; ) .
Depuis huit ans que je m’intéresse à ce débat , j’ai fini par comprendre que l’alternative entre limite économique ( passagère ) et géologique ( définitive ) n’est qu’un trompe - l’œil .
C’est vrai , il y a encore tout un tas de ressources en carbone fossile à exploiter .
Il est possible — extrêmement délicat , coûteux et polluant , mais … possible — de forer au large du Grand Nord , ou à des milliers de mètres de profondeur en face des côtes brésiliennes .
On peut envisager de construire des centrales nucléaires pour générer l’énergie nécessaire à la transformation en essence des pétroles « lourds ».
Quel jeu , pour quelle chandelle ?
Oui , Big
Oil est capable de faire tout ça .
Je ne demanderais même pas si c’est sain d’un point de vue écologique ou éthique .
Trop facile .
Soyons plus pragmatiques : tous ces pétroles « lourds » et « non-conventionnels » ne PEUVENT PAS être recueillis AUSSI VITE que les plus beaux fruits qui menacent de devenir moins disponibles dans un avenir proche , les light sweet crude , arabian light , … qui font tourner le moteur de l’économie mondiale depuis plus d’un demi-siècle .
Ceci revient à dire que le pétrole risque quoi qu’il arrive de devenir plus rare et plus cher à mesure que le temps passera , mutant en menace pour l’organisation économique et sociétale qu’il a largement contribué à fonder .
Et plus seulement à cause du réchauffement climatique .
Hybris , némésis …
Pour reprendre le concept de l’historien et économiste Joseph A. Tainter , on peut parler d’un « rendement décroissant de l’investissement marginal dans la complexité ».
Plus prosaïquement , on peut aussi se dire que le jeu n’en vaut peut - être pas la chandelle …
Combien le pétrole compte
Bien sûr , le pétrole est la ressource nodale de l’industrie chimique et des transports ( civils , militaires ) .
Si le pétrole devenait une denrée rare , la mondialisation ne pourrait rester ce qu’elle est devenue .
Impossible pour les firmes occidentales de délocaliser autant , d’aller faire fabriquer à bas coût les artefacts de l’opulence moderne , de reproduire et démultiplier l’enfer de la révolution industrielle à l’autre bout de la planète , loin du regard des happy few d’Amérique du Nord , d’Europe et d’ailleurs .
Un rappel plus préoccupant : nous mangeons du pétrole .
Si nous sommes deux fois plus nombreux qu’en 1945 , c’est parce que la production de céréales a pu être triplée au cours du dernier demi-siècle .
Et cette expérience asymptotique , nous la devons aux gains de productivité dont le pétrole est l’alpha et l’omega .
Vous vous rappelez il y a deux ans les émeutes de la faim dans de nombreux pays du Tiers Monde , lorsque le baril a frôlé les 150 dollars ?…
« CAUTE »
Il fut un temps où United Fruits possédait sans vergogne des nations d’Amérique du Sud .
Dans les années 90 , un géant du tabac pouvait menacer de racheter CBS afin d’empêcher la diffusion d’une enquête dévastatrice des journalistes de « 60 Minutes » .
Seulement quand il s’agit de pétrole , l ’impérialisme des firmes sur les pouvoirs publics sait aller beaucoup plus loin encore .
« Big Oil » a été capable de mettre la main sur la Maison Blanche pendant huit ans , laquelle a peut - être ( qui sait , hein ?… ) servit le même gros mensonge aux médias internationaux , au Congrès américain , à la tribune des Nations unies , et même au 10 , Downing Street et à Chatham House , les anciens maîtres d’Oncle Sam en entourloupes géostratégiques , afin d’envoyer les boys occuper l’Irak , 3e réserves prouvées de pétrole de la planète , après l’Arabie Saoudite et l’Iran .
Les Etats - Unis ont franchi leur propre peak oil en 1970 , la Grande - Bretagne à la fin des années 90 .
Or il faut bien vivre .
Bon , je m’arrête là pour le moment .
N’allez pas croire que je suis un adepte des théories du complot , ni un « apocalypsien » , même si je dois reconnaître que je trouve ce type d’analyses nécessaires et stimulantes .

Ah , au fait : pourquoi diantre publier mon enquête sur ce nouveau blog plutôt que dans la presse ?

If you ’ve spent any time at all mucking about the Interweb , chances are you ’ve run across the “ Hitler Downfall meme , ” in which the dictator ’s pivotal soliloquy / rant from the 2004 drama Downfall is overlaid with fake subtitles to make it look like he ’s pissed about everything from the iPad to Obama to — in a typically meta twist — the fact that someone is messing with his subtitles .
In case you have n’t seen one , here ’s a very appropriate selection for Hitler ’s birthday — which is today , in case you did n’t know .
( Also Josh Modell ’s birthday !
Probably just a coincidence . )
Unfortunately , Internet memes are made to be broken — and in this case , they ’ve become subject to a wave of takedowns now that Downfall ’s production company Constantin Films filed a copyright claim .
It ’s an interesting case study on fair use in the YouTube age — though it ’s a unique situation , since any such counter - claim would have to be made by the individual users who created those parodies in the first place .
In the meantime , they ’ve mostly responded by , well , making more “ Hitler rant ” parodies in which he rants about the fact that he ca n’t make any more “ Hitler rant ” parodies .

I got an Arduino Duemilanove , which is something I 've wanted for the longest time .
Fuck yes .
I love you , Arbiter , whoever you are .
The English language is full of metaphors linking moral purity to both physical cleanliness and brightness .
We speak of " clean consciences " , " pure thoughts " and " dirty thieves " .
We 're suspicious of " shady behaviour " and we use light and darkness to symbolise good and evil .
But there is more to these metaphors than we might imagine .
The mere scent of a clean - smelling room can take people down a virtuous road , compelling them to choose generosity over greed and charity over apathy .
Meanwhile , the darkness of a dimmed room or a pair of sunglasses can compel people towards selfishness and cheating .
These new results are the latest from psychologist Chen - Bo Zhong .
Back in 2006 , he showed that people who brought back memories of past wrong - doings were more likely to think of words related to cleaning , or to physically crave cleaning products .
He called this the " Lady Macbeth effect " .
Subsequently , another group found that it works the other way too .
People judge moral transgressions more leniently if they had previously washed their hands or if they had been primed with words related to cleanliness , like ' pure ' or ' immaculate ' .
Now , Zhong , together with Katie Liljenquist and Adam Galinsky , have expanded on these studies by showing that clean smells can make people behave more virtuously .
They ushered 28 volunteers into a room that was either unscented or that had been lightly sprayed with a citrus air freshener .
In either case , they had to play a trust game , where a " sender " has a pot of money and chooses how much they want to invest with a " receiver " .
The investment is tripled and the receiver decides how much to give back .
The volunteers were all told that they had been randomly chosen as receivers .
Their anonymous partner had invested their entire $ 4 pot with them , which had been tripled to $ 12 .
Their job was to decide how much to give back .
On average , they returned a measly $ 2.81 in the unscented rooms but a more equitable $ 5.33 in the scented ones .
The single spray of citrus nearly doubled their tendency to reciprocate .
In a second experiment , the trio again ushered 99 students into either a scented or unscented room .
They were given a pack of miscellaneous tasks , including a flyer requesting volunteers for a charity called Habitat for Humanity .
Those in the citrus - scented rooms were more likely to be interested in volunteering , and almost four times more willing to donate money to the cause .
You could argue that nice smells make people feel better , and these positive moods underlie their sudden burst of charitable behaviour .
But questionnaires handed out after the tasks showed that neither room affected the volunteers ' mood .
Nor did the volunteers realise what was going on .
In both experiments , they did n't believe that smells were influencing their behaviour and they did n't think that their room was any cleaner or dirtier than usual .
The idea that a simple scent can influence behaviour to this degree may be surprising to many people , but I 've blogged about many such studies before .
Social exclusion can make you feel cold , a warm cup of tea can make people behave more warmly or charitably to others , and holding heavy objects can make us see things as more important .
All of these are examples of a fascinating concept called " embodied cognition " , where many of the abstract concepts we use daily , like virtue , are related to concrete parts of our environment , like smells .
Zhong 's new study also provides some indirect support for the broken windows theory , which suggests that signs of petty crime , like the eponymous broken windows , can trigger yet more criminal behaviour .
Disorder breeds disorder .
So far , Zhong has only shown that clean smells promote charity and generosity , not that dirty smells promote self - interested behaviour .
However , he has found that darkness will do the job .
Darkness can obviously shroud one 's identity , giving people a licence to misbehave .
As Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote , " Gaslight is the best nocturnal police , so the universe protects itself by pitiless publicity . "
But Zhong thinks that darkness does n't need to provide anonymity to affect our behaviour - just creating the illusion of anonymity is enough .
Someone sitting in a dim room or wearing sunglasses can't think that they 're less likely to be seen ( unless they come from a Douglas Adams novel ) , but they may well feel a sense of secrecy all the same .
It 's a throwback to the childish behaviour of closing your eyes and believing others can't see you .
Together with Vanessa Bohns and Francesca Gino , Zhong set out to test this idea .
They brought 84 students into either a well - lit or a dimly lit room , where two - thirds of the fluorescent lights were out .
The students were faced with 20 mathematical problems and $ 10 in small change .
They had to solve as many as possible in five minutes , which is typically enough to do around seven .
For every correctly answered question , they could keep 50 cents .
They had to put the remaining money in a white envelope and drop it into a collection box .
To the recruits , the process was entirely anonymous .
They could have kept all the money without anyone knowing .
But Zhong incorporated a few special numbers into the problems that allowed him to match tests with takers .
He found that people in the darker room were more likely to lie about how many problems they solved , claiming that they answered an average of 11.5 , while those in the well - lit room said that they 'd done just 7.8 .
In reality , both groups had actually answered around 7.3 questions .
The proportion of recruits who lied about their performance was also higher in the dimmer room ( 61 % compared to 24 % ) .
Obviously , neither group of recruits would actually have thought that their identities were more secret .
The same applied to a second experiment , where 50 students were asked to test either a pair of clear glasses or sunglasses .
They played a dictator game , where they were given $ 6 and had to allocate part of it to a partner .
The games were played anonymously , with the alleged partner sitting in another room .
As expected , the sunglasses - adorned recruits were stingier , offering up an average of just $ 1.81 , compared to the $ 2.71 tendered by those who wore clear glasses .
Again , wearing sunglasses does n't really do very much to conceal one 's identity , and all the games were played across an internet connection anyway .
However , a short questionnaire filled in after the study revealed that the students who wore sunglasses did indeed feel more anonymous than those who wore clear ones .
As Zhong says , " Darkness appears to induce a false sense of concealment , leading people to feel that their identities are hidden . "
And this perception of anonymity was enough to breed dishonesty and self - interest .
The results of studies like these are very compelling .
Every day , reams of column inches and hours of airtime are devoted to discussing ways of tackling crime and encouraging altruism .
And for all that talk , it is fascinating to learn that something as simple as a fresh smell or a darkened room could be used as a way of enforcing righteousness or promoting selfishness .

It 's really true :
You can't judge a movie by its trailer .
Some of the worst movies had trailers that made us go , " Hell yeah , I wanna see this now . "
Sometimes they even make it look like a totally different movie .

After having looked through a few hundred trailers for bad movies , the striking thing is how often a bad movie has a trailer that reflects its badness .
You can totally tell from watching the trailer for The Phantom Menace that you 're in for a bizarre mess .
The trailer for Star Trek V : The Final Frontier practically screams " trainwreck ... in space ! "
But the hard - working , clever trailer makers of Hollywood do actually manage to put together some brilliantly watchable trailers for some awful movies on occasion .
Here are some of our favorites .
Feel free to suggest your own in the comments !
The Matrix Reloaded .
I feel like I 'd rather watch this trailer 50 times than watch the actual movie .
Star Trek : Nemesis .
Spooky eye !
I love the way this trailer completely misleads you about what 's going in the movie .
There 's an evil duplicate of Picard , and they morph into each other .
And it 's as if part of Picard has been stolen .
OMG !
It 's his evil Transporter twin !
And now he 's having sex with Troi !
Terminator Salvation .
I still get goosebumps from this incredible trailer — and then I remember what the movie turned out to be like .
Rollerball .
It looks so hard - hitting and awesome .
Hulk ( 2003 ) .
Most of the trailers for this movie do actually look terrible , because they show off too much of the whole father - son subplot and the weak action .
But this Superbowl trailer , which bears almost no resemblance to the actual film , is pretty rocking .
The Fountain .
I know , I know — some people really loved this movie .
But even if you did love it , the trailer makes it look way more coherent than it actually was .
In any case , it seems like whenever people are listing " misleading movie trailers , " this film comes up .
The Island .
Another film whose trailer comes up all the time on lists of " misleading movie trailers . "
Curiously , it shares the same tagline with The Fountain : " What if you could live forever ? "
Superman Returns .
There 's a wonderful note of grandeur and excitement in this trailer , which makes you feel as though you 're about to witness something truly unique and incredible .
The Village .
A thrilling , spine - crawling trailer that promises a disturbing horror film .
Even the Youtube video's own description calls it " misleading . "
The Invasion .
I love the snarky intertitles on this trailer , like " Go about your normal life , " " You have nothing to worry about . "
It promises a dark , twisty film — actually I did kind of like the first half of this movie , and then the second half was a giant letdown .
Note : I found some helpful lists of " misleading movie trailers " at Epinions , JoBlo and vault9 .

Huge compensation claims filed by Pacific states including Tuvalu have been hit by a three - year old study , dramatically " rediscovered " by New Scientist magazine today .
The study concluded that many Micronesian islands are growing , not shrinking .
“ It has been thought that as the sea level goes up , islands will sit there and drown .
But they won’t , " Professor Kench at the University of Auckland in New Zealand told the mag .
Kench has been saying us much for a while , but most editors shunned the news .
Kench 's study was published in in the journal Global and Planetary Change in November 2007 , and last year he told Associated Press that islands apparently rebuild themselves .
Five years ago Pacific islands became a tragic poster children of Al Gore 's film An Inconvenient Truth .
The BBC called the Maldives " a paradise faced with extinction " .
A NASA widget
But just four of the 27 islands studied by the team - chosen because sea levels had risen in the past sixty years - had diminished in size .
The other 23 had expanded , one by as much as 60 per cent .
The islands apparently expand their mass by accumulating sediment , and through natural processes - not surprisingly , since they 're built on live biomatter : coral .
" Perhaps [ they ] do not need to flee their country , " Kench concludes , once again .
Indeed .
There 's also another reason for the changes in above - surface mass , but it's one you 'll rarely hear from environmental activists , particularly ' climate change ' campaigners .
Satellite readings show little change in sea levels , and even more so when the cyclical ENSO ( El Nino Southern Oscillation ) is taken into account .
In written evidence to Parliament in 2005 , the former president of the INQUA Commission on Seal Level Changes and Coastal Evolution , Nils - Axel Mörner , concluded there had been no acceleration in sea level rises , and no net rise since 1970 .
Flooding has been experienced on the coral islands , but is a consequence of erosion .
The more you neglect your local environment , the more it erodes , and the more flooding you get .
The IPCC bases its projections of sea - level rises on computer models .
Bobbing along : Tuvalu 's tidal guage 1978 - 2003
Kench and fellow academic Arthur Webb at the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji used a sea level rise figure of 2 mm per decade .
Either way , the ability of the islands to regenerate is welcome .
But the political fallout may be huge .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) - Canadians live about three years longer and are healthier than Americans , and the lack of universal healthcare in the United States may be a factor , researchers said on Wednesday .

In a study published in BioMed Central ’s journal Population Health Metrics they said Canadians can expect to live until 79.7 years of age , versus 77.2 years for Americans .
A healthy 19 - year - old Canadian can expect to have 52 more years of perfect health versus 49.3 more years for Americans .
“ Canada and the U.S. share a common border and enjoy very similar standards of living , yet life expectancy in Canada is higher than in the U.S. , ” said David Feeny , of the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland , Oregon , and a co-author of the study .
“ There are two distinct potential explanations for the gap : differences in access to health care and in the prevalence of poverty . ”
Canadians have a universal healthcare service , which is free at the point of care , whereas Americans ’ access to health insurance is usually based on employment , income through Medicaid , or age through Medicare , and not universal , according to the study .
Healthcare expenditures also have been higher in the United States than in Canada since the 1970s .
The findings are based on telephone interviews of 8,688 white Canadians and Americans , to account for the impact of slavery and racial discrimination on health .
The interviews were conducted in 2002 and 2003 during the first joint survey by Statistics Canada and the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics to provide fully comparable data .
“ This data was very high quality , consistent and comparable , ” Feeny said .
Researchers may try to conduct another survey to update new developments in light of the recent healthcare reform measures in the United States , he added .
Drobo and DroboShare — a review
Executive summary : do n't buy it .
Convinced by people on podcasts ( mostly TWiP and This Week in Tech ) raving about how great the Drobo ( from Data Robotics ) storage device is , I decided to budget two into a project I 'm working on .
Expectations were high —
Drobo marketing pushes the devices as easy to use , reliable and flexible .
Being a Mac user , I expected an " Apple experience " : plug it in and forget it 's even there .
Nothing could be farther from the truth .
To begin with , the Drobo is Loud .
Not just " loud " , but REALLY LOUD .
And it is n't the drives , it 's the fan that cools the whole thing .
To give you an idea of what I mean by Loud , one single Drobo with ultra-quiet WD Green drives spun down is louder than my 8 - core Mac Pro with 4 drives and an army of fans in it .
It 's that loud .
To make matters worse , the fan in the Drobo turns on very frequently , even when the drives have been spun down for hours .
I do n't know why , as the drives are very cool to the touch .
You wo n't want to have a Drobo under your desk , or anywhere in your vicinity , trust me .
And that means the fancy fast FireWire - 800 interface that you just paid for is pretty much useless .
I used a DroboShare to setup my Drobo in a remote location where I can't hear it .
The DroboShare comes with Gigabit Ethernet , as the marketing will point out .
What they wo n't point out is that it connects to your Drobo with a USB cable , which ( together with SMB ) pretty much limits your transfer speeds to about 5 - 8 MB /s .
That 's about 6 times slower than when connected via FireWire - 800 .
What you should also know is that using the DroboShare will provide its own annoyances .
As an example , I found it impossible to create a sparsebundle disk image for use with SuperDuper on the Drobo .
Go figure .
SMB introduces other annoying problems , too — I could n't copy my music collection onto the Drobo , because some filenames had non-ascii characters in them .
But all of the above are merely inconveniences .
The real issue is with reliability .
I bought the Drobo so that I can trust it with my data and forget about failing drives and losing data .
Which is why I was slightly miffed when Drobo Dashboard kept crashing on me and reporting unreliable data , annoyed when it hung in the middle of the night when doing my first real backup , slightly angry when support told me my Drobo is defective and needs to be replaced , and really pissed off when the second unit I got corrupted my volume and lost data ( when connected to a DroboShare ) .
And then Data Robotics support asked me ... whether I have a backup .
Or a copy of DiskWarrior .
I have so far been through TWO Drobo replacements .
Despite my asking , Data Robotics was unwilling to provide an upgraded ( better ) unit .
What 's worse is that now I do n't trust the Drobo at all .
I looked closer : the DroboShare seems to use the plain Linux support for HFS + that is known to be shaky .
There is NO FSCK ( Filesystem Check ) program for HFS + at all !
Data Robotics will tell you that you can switch your Drobo between a Mac and DroboShare and you will be ok — but that seems to be exactly what resulted in my data corruption problems .
Then there is Data Robotics support .
When you make " reliable data storage devices " , you really need to have support that cares about customers , reads their emails and responds instantly .
Responding after one business day is not enough .
Given that support people will forget what was written before , or begin by asking what your address is and when you bought your Drobo , it will easily take a week before you get to the real issue .
What you should also realize is that when your Drobo unit fails , there is no way for you to read data off the drives .
You need a working Drobo unit to do that , and it has to recognize the filesystem and mount it .
I bought a Drobo so that I can have reliable data storage without worrying about reliable data storage .
The net effect was that I got an unreliable solution that I have to manage , worry about and spend time and money on .
That 's a failure in my book .
I will never buy another Drobo unit again .
[... the above was been drafted , and then 3 months passed ...]
So , today my volume ( drobo mounted via a droboshare ) unexpectedly disappeared on my Mac.
Investigation of the DroboShare logs shows :

Drobo Dashboard does n't launch , console shows me crash logs for the ddserviced daemon , which crashes every 10 seconds or so .
Reinstalling drobo dashboard does n't help .
I am so tired .
I bought the Drobo so that I can save time , not so that I can run around and service it all the time , jumping through hoops set up by " support " from Data Robotics .
I can already see how I 'll have to spend several hours debugging the problems , dealing with support , reinstalling things .
I am posting this so that people are warned .
Hopefully people will google for " Drobo " before buying it and I will save someone the hassle and frustration .
Will I lose data again this time ?
Do n't buy a Drobo .
Image caption Opium production in Afghanistan is expected to fall sharply this year .
Drug use is moving away from cocaine and opiates and towards synthetic drugs such as amphetamines , the UN says .
In its World Drug Report it says it expects that soon there will be more people using synthetic drugs than opium , heroin and cocaine together .
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) also found that cocaine consumption has fallen significantly in the US in recent years .
But the number of cocaine users in Europe has doubled , it says .
We will not solve the world drug problem by shifting consumption from the developed to the developing world Antonio Maria Costa , UN Office for Drugs and Crime West Africa 's drug addiction
The shift in demand has led to South American drug cartels establishing new routes through West Africa .
Trafficking is causing instability in many developing countries , particularly in Africa and Latin America , the report says .
" People snorting coke in Europe are killing the pristine forests of the Andean countries and corrupting governments in West Africa " , UNODC director Antonio Maria Costa said .
Shifting consumption
Developing countries are also seeing a rise in drug use , with heroin consumption up in eastern Africa and cocaine use up in West Africa and South America .
Demand for the synthetic drug ecstasy is falling or levelling off in Europe .
But the drug is becoming more popular in Asia .
" We will not solve the world drug problem by shifting consumption from the developed to the developing world " , Mr Costa said .
In Europe the number of cocaine users has doubled to around four million in the last decade .
The market is now worth $ 34bn , almost as much as that in North America .
However , world cocaine production has fallen by 12 % to 18 % in the past three years and the North American market is shrinking , thanks in part to police crackdowns in Colombia , a producer country , and transit country Mexico .
UNODC also found a downward trend in global heroin consumption .
It expects opium production to fall steeply in 2010 because of a blight that could wipe out a quarter of Afghanistan 's poppy crop .
I enjoyed Bookgasm ’s post about 7 Current Zombie Books with Brains so much that I decided to write a post about the 7 best selling zombie books that we carry at our store .
These are n’t necessarily the most current zombie books we have in stock , but our customers love them .
The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks – Even though it came out in 2003 , The Zombie Survival Guide is still a best seller .
Do my customers know about an impending zombie apocalypse or something ?
Probably not .
The popularity of this book probably has more to do with the clever idea and the good writing .
But if you ’re ordinary person who is worried about what to do during a zombie outbreak , then you ’ll find this book useful And Max Brooks is Mel Brooks ’s son .
World War Z by Max Brooks –
This is n’t really a novel .
It ’s actually a collection of short stories set in a single setting where the zombies rose and were eventually more - or - less defeated in the titular war on zombies .
It ’s an excellent follow - up to Brooks ’s first zombie book , and the writing is outstanding .
The audio version of World War Z is also well worth listening to , with readings from notables like Alan Alda and Rob Reiner , among others .
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies by Jane Austen and Seth - Grahame Smith – 85 % of the text in this book is the same as the text in Austen ’s original novel Pride and Prejudice .
But oh what a difference the other 15 % makes .
We read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies as a horror book club selection one month , and it was well - liked by all our members .
( And yes , we do have members who love Jane Austen . )
Beware of the many attempts to cash in on the popularity of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ; they ’re not all of the same high quality .
Although Seth - Graham Smith ’s new book , Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter , is likely a worthy successor .
The Walking Dead –
The paperback collections of Robert Kirkman ’s excellent comic book series The Walking Dead fly off the shelves as soon as they come in .
Each edition collects six issues of the comic book , which is a zombie movie as an ongoing series with no ending .
We expect sales of this one to continue to grow , especially now that AMC is creating The Walking Dead as an ongoing television series .
( And Frank Darabont ’s in charge of this one , so it should be great . )
ZEO : How to Get A( Head ) in Business by Scott Kenemore – This is n’t the first book about zombies that Scott Kenemore has written .
The Zen of Zombie is also a popular seller at the store .
But ZEO seems to be more popular .
Is it possible that people are really so desperate for good advice on how to run a business that the only real wisdom they can find is in a spoof book ?
I think so .
The career advice in this one actually made more than a little bit of sense to me .
What that says about me , I ’m not sure .
Marvel Zombies by Robert Kirkman –
The collected editions of these comics still sell out constantly .
In case you ’re not familiar with the series , it takes a look at what would happen in the Marvel Universe if a zombie apocalypse happened there .
So we get treated to zombie versions of the Hulk , Spider - Man , Wolverine , and all of the other Marvel superheroes .
I think this would make a great movie ( definitely better than either of the dull Fantastic Four movies I sat through , anyway ) .
The Best of All Flesh by James Lowder – Before zombie anthologies became common , James Lowder was editing collections of short fiction as a companion to Eden Studios ’ roleplaying game All Flesh Must Be Eaten .
These anthologies are all out of print now , but this collection picks out Lowder ’s favorites from the three volumes .
RPG companies are not always known for the high quality of their fiction publications , but The Best of All Flesh stands head and shoulders over most other zombie short fiction anthologies .
Visit us Eerie Books , 205 N. Ballard , Wylie , TX between 2 pm and 6 pm in order to buy any of these tiles .
We ’d love to meet you .

Will blog more tomorrow .
( CNN ) -- Iran 's Red Crescent Society will try to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza by sending food and medical supplies to the besieged Palestinian territory , an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday .
Red Crescent official Abdul Rauf Adibzadeh said one shipment of relief goods will arrive in Gaza via Egypt by the end of the week , Iranian media reported .
The aid group is also preparing to send two relief ships to the coast of Gaza , including a hospital ship with doctors , nurses and operating rooms and another vessel with more relief goods like food and medication , the IRNA and Mehr news agencies reported .
Israel stopped a convoy of six ships trying to deliver aid to Gaza last week in defiance of an Israeli blockade , killing at least nine people in the course of boarding one of the vessels .
Adibzadeh said there is a possibility that Iranian Red Crescent ships may be attacked but added that , despite the danger , if the Iranian authorities approve , the shipments will be sent to Gaza .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said the Iranian ships will be part of a new aid flotilla organized by several Islamic countries , though he declined to say which countries are involved .
He called it " strictly a humanitarian effort for the people of Gaza . "
" We are preparing two ships to head for Gaza that will provide humanitarian aid , " Mehmanparast said .
" Their departure depends on how soon we coordinate with other countries that are also sending aid ships .
The process of organizing the operation is under way . "
Separately , a " Jewish boat " is planning to try to reach Gaza , two pro-Palestinian European Jewish groups announced Monday .
" Our purpose is to call an end to the siege of Gaza , to this illegal collective punishment of the whole civilian population , " Edith Lutz said on behalf of European Jews for a Just Peace in the Near East and Jews for Justice for Palestinians .
The group is not saying when the boat is sailing or where it is leaving from " in order to avoid sabotage , " Lutz said .
Israeli commandos intercepted the first convoy at sea May 31 and stormed the largest vessel , the Turkish - flagged Mavi Marmara .
The ships were carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza , organizers said .
The Palestinian territory has been blockaded by Israel since its takeover by the Islamic movement Hamas in 2007 .
The deadly raid sparked international condemnation .
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden avoided mentioning the issue directly when he spoke after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt on Monday .
He said that the present situation " is unsustainable for all sides " and that the Israelis and Palestinians needed to " move to direct negotiations as soon as possible that will result in an end to the occupation that began in 1967 and to a two - state solution to the conflict with Israel and a Palestinian state living in peace and security . "
The U.N. Security Council has called for an inquiry into the flotilla raid , and the U.N. Human Rights Council has condemned the assault and voted to launch an investigation .
Israeli officials have defended the legality of the raid , criticizing those aboard the Mavi Marmara for attacking the boarding party and insisting that they can handle the investigation themselves .
CNN 's Reza Sayah contributed to this report .

Call us jaded but after the Doninton fiasco where a contract for the British Grand Prix was handed to someone who did n't have the financing in place and did n't have a suitable circuit , Pitpass was more than a little bit sceptical about the recent announcement that a US Grand Prix will take place in 2012 in Austin , the capital city of Texas .
It seems that we are n't the only ones .
Pitpass ' business editor Chris Sylt recently spoke to a highly respected senior motorsport source who is based in the US and knows more than a thing or two about F1 .
What he said was worrying to say the least .
His conversation with Sylt came a few days after he sent an email to our business editor saying that " I have placed a couple of phone calls to the US and I am not sure that this is project is real . "
The outlook has n't become any clearer since then .
Referring to Tavo Hellmund , managing partner of the US GP race promoter Full Throttle Productions , the source told Sylt that " his father was involved in motor racing in quite a large way ... now the son appears and the general view here is that there are many more questions than answers .
This guy has never promoted a race , he does n't have a race - track , he does n't have property for a race - track .
He does have a letter from the governor pledging $ 25 m of support for the race ... beyond that he has nothing quite frankly .
The feeling is that this is ... like Donington . "
We all know that Silverstone ended up the beneficiary from the Donington debacle so who could be the eventual winner in the US ?
A clue could come from Fred Nation , spokesman for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway who said a few days ago " that F1 expressed any interest Austin was a surprise , especially to us ...
Austin is not particularly known as an auto racing market . "
This is no exaggeration .
The Statesman , Austin 's major daily newspaper wrote an extremely basic article entitled , ' What is Formula One ? ' the day after the deal was announced .
Perhaps crucially , Nation said that " Indianapolis is the right place for F1 in the United Sates and , if and when they express an interest here again , which could happen , we 're ready to talk if we can find a business arrangement that makes sense for both parties . "
What Sylt can say pretty much for sure is that Austin has had its eye on F1 for a long time so it is no flash in the pan .
In addition to his post as business editor of Pitpass , editor of The Paddock magazine and roles covering the business of F1 for numerous papers and commenting on it for TV stations including CNN , CNBC and ITN , Sylt also authors F1's industry monitor Formula Money .
When promoters come up with the idea of hosting an F1 GP they tend to ask the state for money to cover the sport 's huge fees which average £ 21.5 m per race .
The first thing that the state does is to research how much it will cost them and they soon arrive at Formula Money since it is the only all - in - one source of business data for F1 .
Once the state has an idea of how much it will cost they return to the promoter with an answer and then contact is made with F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone .
Accordingly , the list of Formula Money buyers gives Sylt visibility which can be ahead of even Ecclestone himself in terms of countries interested in hosting F1 .
So it is no coincidence that the state of Texas bought a copy of last year 's edition in March 2009 and then bought the 2010 edition in March this year .
Aryn
White , Full Throttle 's co-founder , bought it in May 2009 and February 2010 , while the Monticello Motor Club , which was also in the running to host the US GP , also bought a copy in April this year .
Interestingly , Sylt says that one of the latest purchasers of Formula Money is a real estate company in Nevada which is of course home to Las Vegas .
The race to host the US GP may well still be on .
[ The Ayahuasca Monologues ] 
When going into my first experiences with ayahuasca , I was deeply absorbed in the work of Pablo Amaringo .
I was spending more and more time looking over his paintings , many of which displayed images of other worldly dimensions with golden palaces in the sky .
In the summer of 2004 , I was set to travel to South America for a ten - day dieta involving work with ayahuasca , as well as other healing plants like bobinsana .
I had been drinking ayahuasca in Mestizo shamanic ceremonies for a little over a year before this dieta , and this was going to be my first complete immersion into the rainforest for repeated exposure to its thunderous lessons .
One of the main intentions I had for my upcoming dieta was to heal the broken lines of love between my father and me .
He had passed away just two months before I was scheduled to leave for the Southern Hemisphere .
He suffered a tragic and sad death .
His landlady had found him slumped over the island divider in the kitchen , still gripping a glass of Chivas Regal in his lifeless hands .
My father 's passing had been anticipated for many years , as he struggled with the affliction of alcoholism for most of his adult life .
The news of his death knocked the wind out of me when I heard of it over the phone one lonely morning .
My family and friends supported me during the days leading up to his wake .
Memories overwhelmed me at night — of a man who hurt me like no other , but who also gifted me with some of the greatest moments two people can share .
My dad struggled with multiple addictions since before I was born , and they wreaked havoc for most of our relationship .
Addiction is like a fire , the more space you give it , the more the flames will rage .
Genius , too , is like a fire , and it works in similar ways .
The more you offer yourself to it , the more its brilliance will shine .
My father was like a house that contained both of these fires , constantly burning .
The way Dad passed , it seemed like the fires of addiction may have won out , leaving him dying a drunkard 's death .
But in the time leading up to his funeral , I also remembered him as a brilliant man , alive and struggling with a pain deeper than his waking self .
His addictions seemed to run far back into the Irish gene pool .
Generations of executed poets and failed revolutionaries swam within his belly as he shot back the spirits at the bar he and my mother opened and ran for more than 25 years .
His tongue was a palate coated with myriad songs about love and confusion , humor and pain , with an aching for redemption .
At Pop 's wake I referred to Dylan Thomas 's poem , " Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night , " in regards to the way Dad lived his life .
More likely than not , he did not go gently into the waning of the light .
He did not die a good death .
I imagined that he experienced fear and confusion , up until the moment , where perhaps he saw the one he always talked about seeing at his death — Jesus .
The type of Jesus my father often spoke of was the same type that Johnny Cash and Woody Guthrie sung about .
He sounded like a Jesus who would bring calm , and ease the pain for the sick and the hopeless , the poor and oppressed .
I suppose that to live a life of passion , one must burn .
One must feel the fire in the pit of their stomach and eventually learn to direct that fire , least it consume you .
There was a time in my fathers life when that fire was channeled into many joyous displays of theatrical political activism , leaving those watching and involved both shocked and amused .
He and my mother were Irish immigrants to New York City at a time of tumult in Northern Ireland .
It was the 1970s , the time of " the Troubles , " when suffering and resistance were at a peak in the northern six counties .
There were protests and there were bombs ; there were bullets , and there was blood .
My father and mother held strong to their convictions that everything would be much better the sooner the British crown extricated itself from the North .
In New York City , they helped form Irish Northern Aid , an organization that brought awareness to the situation in Northern Ireland while also raising money for the families of those whom they considered to be political prisoners — people like Bobby Sands , Francis Hughes , Joe McDonnell , and the seven other men who died on a hunger strike in 1981 .
I was always aware of this aspect of my father 's life .
He was linked with a long line of rebel hearts , seeking a righteous resolution to some of the uglier sides of human nature .
His name was known in the North , and many whom he worked with during those years held him in great esteem .
I often think about what deeper motivations may have moved my parents to take the plunge into a life of high risk and coded phone conversations .
They must 've had a firm and raging longing for freedom .
Ireland is a land that has endured endless waves of struggle between a beleaguered people and a heavy - handed colonial system , which has played itself out in every generation on the world 's stage for hundreds of years .
It makes sense to me that such a longing for freedom would be linked with the land , because the land has played such a major role in the story of Ireland .
And my parents were people of the earth , raised on small farms in the countryside , listening to the land cry .
Their movement for freedom was one that left some indelible marks on themselves and our family .
Of course , the desire for freedom manifests in many different ways .
The world is well versed in stories of people fighting to get freedom from some type of oppressor .
There are also tales of becoming free of what 's holding us back , and spiritual traditions that talk of a freedom found in perceiving existence in one infinite moment of understanding .
There are many tales from different cultures that speak of this journey — to be free from all suffering , to finally grasp knowledge of oneself and become the lord and master of ones own mind .
It was my own search for this type of freedom that led me to ayahuasca .
A few days after the funeral , my mother and I were speaking outside her house .
I told her about the dieta I was soon leaving for .
I told her I respected her and Dad 's early choices to live how they had , and that I believed I was following in their footsteps by going to South America .
She understood what I was saying , but did n't really know the surrounding cultural elements .
" They 're not witch doctors are they ? " she asked .
I could only laugh and assure her that I was not going to any witch doctors … that I knew of .
I flew into Peru International Airport and then took a short , bumpy flight to Pulcallpa , where I met the rest of the intrepid travelers headed into the Amazon for this dieta .
From Pulcallpa we drove a couple of hours down some dirt roads , only stopping once to make some form of " tribute " ( meaning pay - off ) to the local police force lounging on that stretch before finally stopping at the Rio Ucayali .
We hoped into two slim motorized boats and coasted along the serene river into the heart of the jungle .
The ride was quiet , yet upbeat .
The sun shined bright , reflecting sharply off the top of the dark waters .
We arrived at a nondescript piece of land , and hiked into the jungle for another hour .
Finally reaching the encampment , we choose our own tambo open - air hut , which was to be our individual sleeping quarters for the next eleven days .
After settling in , we all met up for a collective meal , eating , conversing , and laughing for hours , knowing that this was to be our last full meal until the dieta was over .
The day turned to night , and the darkness quickly crept its way into our congregation .
One by one , we retired to our tambos , saying good night and good luck .
I pulled the mosquito net over my foam " bed " situated atop a slab of wood , and then drifted off to sleep .
In the first ceremony , I set up my temporary altar in front of me .
A Shipibo thread - work featuring a green glowing fish was the focal point around which I situated the rest of my concentration aids .
I had a bottle of Florida water , and two pictures laid out on the Shipibo artwork .
The first was of my father and myself when I was around six - years - old .
In the image , Dad was leaning down , his face close to mine , looking towards the camera lens , as my eyes gaze towards something out of range .
The other picture was taken roughly fifteen years later .
This time I had the bigger frame , and my arm was stretched across his back .
His face appeared drained , no doubt from the many years of drinking .
He looked pale and frayed at the edges ; deep lines of pain now engraved into his face .
In the first picture , he was gripping my shoulder in a show of affection , as if to say , " Come on now , I believe in you .
You can do it . "
In the second picture , it was me striking this pose .
Though , I felt so much pain from our relationship , I still had faith in my father .
I wanted my dad man to wake up again .
I was seated next to a very large older man named Thor in the ceremonial circle .
I liked Thor .
I saw him as a man who had been down similar roads as my father , and I later learned that he was also the same age as Dad .
Thor was good friends with the shaman and was placed directly to his right , and I to the right of Thor .
The group sat in a large circle in the maloca , the ceremonial structure in which we drank .
It was situated next to one of the many rivers flowing through the heart of the Amazon .
The day was clear , but the high branches of the trees in the forest blocked out much of the light from the sun .
We passed around the ceremonial cup , and then waited .
When the ayahuasca started to twist and kick inside of me , I noticed that everyone in the group seemed pushed towards the brink of their own psychic thresholds .
An invisible quilt of empathy gently fell upon us .
We were tucked in tightly with the beautiful feeling of togetherness .
It was a unity that allowed each individual the space to go through his or her own work .
The shaman started off singing a number of icaros until the ayahuasca came on full tilt .
My thought patterns oscillated between notions of never feeling so alive , and powerful moments of confusion and jaw - clenching panic .
What I usually referred to as my mind now resembled a vast expanse of fractalizing geometric patterns swirling through empty halls of silence .
If I were able to focus on that silence ( which I did like a toddler struggling to walk ) , my mind would become a fragile container for the many dimensions of self .
This container was like a new level of awareness that was being born in me , growing a fraction at a time .
In this state , I watched memories of my " waking self " swish and weave into the memories of dreams I 've had in my life .
It was becoming difficult to discern between the two .
As the icaros , sung by our guide , shimmered in visibly colorful patterns around us , these two selves seemed to move through the space of my mind 's eye like a caduceus .
I felt like I was drowning in a fountain of deep life , and the deeper I sank , the more alive I felt , yet I checked in with myself repeatedly and asked , " Am I dead ? "
Most of my experiences with ayahuasca up until this dieta often had me going down into an underworld .
Each time I drank I learned a harsh lesson about the darker workings of my own mind .
Paranoia , anger , shame and fear were usually portals I needed to walk through in order to gain some sort of ability to understand how to navigate out of my own personal prison .
I was still struggling to find a balance during these experiences , many of which had been excruciating .
I was repeatedly pulverized by the power of this plant .
I regarded it with fear and respect .
This was something I needed .
Ayahuasca was strong enough to wrestle my mind to the ground and open my ears to the sound of my heart .
That first ceremony proved no different than earlier journeys back home .
I was forced to plunge deep into psychic waters , an ocean helmet diver breathing in the shaman 's icaros as my single line of oxygen .
His tones were tools to get the work done , and I focused my breath to take them in , to keep centered while finding my way up from this abyss .
Immersed in these mercurial realms , the ayahuasca helped me process and reconcile heavy emotions that I 'd never fully dealt with before .
The whole time I listened intently to the shamans songs .
Ancient lessons were being taught in those simple sounds .
And even though I did n't know what the words were , I knew exactly what they meant .
Then I had a vision of my father .
I saw him in another dimension , at the mercy of the ruling force therein .
But this ruling force was not benevolent .
It was mean and vengeful .
It was a realm where my father 's spirit had almost forgotten who he was in the life he just left , like one forgets their dream in that liminal state before waking .
His spirit was in a place that burned and compressed everything around him .
This ruling force ( whatever it may have been ) enjoyed inflicted pain upon my father , yet there was an understanding that this was necessary for him .
And that was it , just as quick as the vision came , my awareness was pulled back to the ceremonial space , where the shaman shook his chacapa , healing a person nearby .
The ayahuasca worked itself through me in waves that felt like birth contractions .
I endured moments of sharp pain that would eventually open into feelings of bliss .
Fear or anger would rise within me , making me want to throw up .
I grabbed a bucket and knelt over it , but nothing would come out .
I tried again and again but all that surfaced were dry heaves and mucous .
All the while , Thor was throwing up profusely .
I felt a resonance with him puking his guts out sitting next to me .
Somehow I understood that this man was helping me through his purging .
Then it occurred to me that Thor was puking because I could n't .
On some energetic level , Thor was processing those things that I was having trouble with .
The " energetic " self is said to expand a few feet out beyond one 's physical body .
Thor was seated right next to me , so it made sense .
I saluted him in my mind 's eye .
My respect and reverence then expanded out to every person in the ceremony .
I was in awe at the strength that every individual brought to this work .
As the plant tunneled through my system with the elegant grace of a bulldozer , I mumbled words of thanks and praise to all these heroes and heroines before falling back into a lump on the ground .
I have heard many people speak about hearing a voice that they call " Grandmother , " during ceremonies .
Most people say Grandmother is another reference to the spirit of ayahuasca .
They say this , too , because ayahuasca has the temperament of a firm and compassionate grandmother .
She will shower love and provide a voice of discipline when needed .
People often speak of setting an intention or asking a question to the plant , and I have heard many say that they heard " her " voice speaking to them .
That day I caught " her " gentle voice urging me to practice patience with myself , because some things take whole lifetimes to purge .
With those words , I was brought back to the last time I saw my father alive .
It was a few months before he passed .
I went over to visit him at the house where he was renting a room .
We spoke about trivial matters .
When I announced my exit he said to keep in touch .
As he walked me to the door , we turned to say goodbye as we always did .
We hugged , and for some reason I squeezed his barrel - chested frame harder than usual .
I held onto him like I did when I was a child .
He recoiled a bit , but then surrendered to the hug , while I told him that I loved him .
He returned the hug , and wished me well as I exited the house .
I began to cry as I walked up the pebbled driveway to my car , a voice , not unlike the voice of " Grandmother " spoke to me and said that this was going to be last time I ever saw my dad alive again .
I replayed this scene over and over in my head as Thor sat and purged .
I began to cry fierce tears , tears that shot out my eyes like bullets , tears that were equal parts angry to equal parts sad .
At that point , I knew I needed to separate myself from the rest of the group and unleash this furious hurt into the skies of the Amazon .
" This earth will protect me .
The Amazon will sooth me , " I thought , as I ran out of the malaco and moved along the thin path towards a view of the river down the lane .
I sat on a plank of wood and howled and moaned like a wounded beast .
My voice ripped a hole through the air my released pain .
Then I cried .
I cried for my father .
I cried for me .
I cried for my family .
I cried for the Irish .
I cried for the British .
I cried for the world .
But mostly I just cried .
The rainforest held me in her embrace while the sorrow passed through me .
This sadness was a gift and I sat there with it .
It was the sadness my father had run from so violently , the one that had also dogged me my whole life .
It was the sadness I imagine the earth feels when she watches so many of her children die .
After all , everything buds , blooms , and then withers away .
But she lives on , watching it all with love and non-invasive guidance .
This sadness , I came to see , also contains great joy .
But it only becomes joyful once one is able to face and embrace it .
You have to sit with it , and not think about when it will lift .
I sat with that sadness all afternoon , coming to terms with it , learning to love it .
Eventually , I walked back to the malaco for the closing of the ceremony .
I thanked Thor for sitting next to me during the work .
I looked out at the birds coasting over the river as the sun set in the distance , knowing that I 'd been granted a healing , as well as my father .
Later that night , I thought back my uncle , cousins , and I carrying Dad 's casket , draped in the Irish flag , through the church doors .
I felt the loss of never being able to hear the sound of his brogue and gruff voice again .
All I had left were memories .
Outside the church , a bagpiper played sweet and sullen tones .
I stayed up for many nights afterwards thinking of all this .
When the weight of these feelings finally broke on the shores of my tired mind , something revealed itself to me .
Through this loss and pain , I now felt connected on a more intimate level to the world around me .
I described it as an initiation into the circle of humanity .
We may walk through the fire of existence quite differently , but it 's fire all the same .
From losing my father , I discovered a profound reservoir of compassion bubble up like magma for all of us confused creatures bumping into each other at various speeds and directions in this life .
This dieta brought me to a similar place .
The ceremonies provided me with a powerful metaphor for understanding my time on this earth .
It was that of a very old and giant tree with branches reaching out high into a star - filled night .
Tumescent roots dug deep into the fertile ground , sinking further and further towards a warm core .
Many of my early experiences with ayahuasca were like these roots .
My consciousness was guided through a dark underworld , stretching itself closer and closer to an understanding of what this realm had to teach .
It was not always pretty , but necessary , in order to see the horizon offered by sitting atop the large branches above .
Before my time with ayahuasca , I was mostly focused on what the sky had to offer , wanting constantly be surrounded by quick - witted spirits , jetting around like lighting bolts .
I had fun , but I was also frenetic and ungrounded .
While sitting through many sessions , I learned that if I really wanted to see the world from the high branches , I had to ground myself , staying with my deeper emotions .
Like those roots , I had to be in contact with the movements of the earth 's sighing soul .
I could not have one without the other .
The higher the branches , the deeper the roots .
Ayahuasca and the death of dad were two major teachers of this lesson .
I had to stop running , sit down by the fire that burns inside us all , and absorb the heat in order to transmute and transmit those heavy earth stories .
I am doing this to develop my own voice for singing my unique song .
And Id like to think that every being is here for the same purpose .
It takes time and work , and some may take longer than others , but one thing is clear — the longer one sings in connection with his or her heart , the clearer their message becomes .

If you 're anything like me , mornings are the worst .
Dragging my sorry bottom out of bed is about the hardest thing in the world , and once I do stumble downstairs , I 'm already dreaming about getting back under the covers .
I 'm groggy , I 'm cranky , and , until I get that first precious sip of piping hot coffee , I 'm a total rapist .
Like I always say , " Just hand over the coffee and nobody gets sexually assaulted ! "
Here 's a little friendly advice :
Do not try to talk to me before I 've had my 16 ounces of Brain Juice .
I 'll just mumble something unintelligible , rape you , and probably shoot you the dirtiest look you 've ever seen , to boot .
I can't help it !
Advertisement
But all it takes is one whiff of that first pot brewing , and I swear , it 's like the clouds part , the sun comes out , and I do n't feel like raping quite so much .
That 's when I give a Hallelujah and thank God , because the coffee 's on its way and I do not want to spend any more time in a federal penitentiary !
Most days , I 'm not even a functioning human being without my morning mug of French roast .
I 'm all " leave me alone , back off , rape , rape , rape , rape , rape , I have n't had my coffee yet . "
Advertisement
Come to think of it , my dad was a pretty big coffee drinker , too .
I remember waking up early with my brothers and sisters to watch Saturday cartoons until Pops , like a mean old bear , came barreling down the stairs , growling for his coffee .
And when he did , boy , you 'd better believe we steered clear of him .
Otherwise we'd get the raping of our lives !
The thing is , I 'm actually a pretty pleasant guy once I get past those morning mopeys .
Talk to me any other time of day , and you 'd never guess I 'm someone who , without his cup of joe , will rape you repeatedly and without warning .
But what can I say ?
I guess I 'm just addicted to my daily dose of brew and a rapist .
Advertisement
Lucky for me , the folks at my office are very understanding .
It 's quite the running joke among my coworkers , actually .
" Whatever you do , do n't get between Brett and his coffee , because he 'll rape you if you do !
He 's literally raped everyone who 's ever done that ! "
It 's true .
My trusty java is the only thing that separates me from people who walk around like angry zombies and serially rape anyone within a quarter - mile radius .
Advertisement
You might say , " Brett , why do n't you just give up coffee altogether ? "
I 've tried .
Believe me , I 've tried .
Once .
It lasted all of three hours and God knows how many rapes .
In fact , I think it even made things worse !
Just ask my poor assistant Lacy .
And my project manager Dan .
And the entire sales staff , everyone at the supermarket , several joggers , three dogs , and that UPS driver .
Criminy , I almost tore that guy a new one !
But , hey , nobody 's perfect .
I just make sure to keep a jumbo travel mug with me at all times , carry lots of pepper spray , and never order coffee from a drive - thru for various logistical reasons .
It 's a tough world out there , and if you need a little extra kick to get going in the morning , so be it .
I certainly wo n't judge .
Although I will probably rape you .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The World Cup is gaining the most attention at the moment from soccer fans around the globe , but next week RoboCup , the annual world championship for soccer robots , gets underway in Singapore .
RoboCup ’s goal is to develop autonomous humanoid soccer - playing robots capable of beating the best human players playing under FIFA rules by 2050 , and American researchers think their new robots will take that aim a step closer .
The American robots , developed at the Computer Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , use a new physics - based algorithm that takes into account ball dynamics , and enables the robots to calculate where the ball is most likely to go next instead of simply reacting to the ball or following the US team ’s previous strategy of using pre-programmed plays ( similar to a strategy in American football ) .
Stefan Zickler , who wrote his PhD thesis on the algorithm , said previous robots could not tell when they would lose control of the ball when carrying out maneuvers such as dribbling , but the new algorithm helps them make such predictions , and this gives them a distinct advantage over robots without the algorithm .
Physics - Based Motion Planning for Robot Soccer Dribbling .
Zickler and colleagues tested an earlier version of the algorithm at last year ’s RoboCup , and their robots were highly successful until the quarter finals , when a disastrous glitch left the robots blind and dashed their hopes of a win .
Professor of Computer Science , Manuela Veloso , believes this year ’s team of five miniature robots , CMDragons , will be more successful , telling the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette she does n’t “ see any reason why we wo n’t win ” .
Physics - Based Motion Planning with Tactical Models .
This video shows simulated physics - based motion planning examples in several challenging domains , including robot minigolf , robot soccer , and pool .
The mini-robots are under the control of a computer watching the action via camera above the playing field .
Without the physics algorithm the computer tries to position the robots on the ball but does not make any predictions of the ball ’s movement .
With the algorithm this weakness is addressed , and the robots can now be moved into a position where the ball is predicted to go , which improves the skills required .
The computer is able to make up to 60 decisions per second .
Carnegie Mellon will also enter a team of humanoid robots in the Standard Platform League .
The humanoids walk on two feet and can speak and use landmarks to determine their positions .
The robots can also be used for other games such as mini - golf ( video below ) , but soccer is the game of choice because of the constant changes in the environment and because of the cooperation required between players .
The algorithm could also have a more practical use in helping robots fight fires , taking into account factors such as the type of trees and the effects of the wind .
RoboCup , which has been running since 1997 , is the largest robotics and artificial intelligence event in the world attracting competing teams from countries such as the US , Brazil , Japan , and Iran .
This video shows a goal scored by our team CMDragons at RoboCup 2009 .
The attacking robot uses a novel dribbling behavior which employs randomized , physics - based motion planning to make tactically sound navigation decisions while remaining in full dynamic control of the ball .
This video shows an autonomous robot minigolf system that uses physics - based motion planning to automatically devise control solutions for never - before - encountered problems .
Planning and control is performed by an off - board computer with a global dual - camera overhead vision system .

Sometime after 11 p.m.
Thursday , having bickered for some 14 hours like the children whose interests they 're charged with representing , State Board of Education members failed to agree even on a vote to adjourn the meeting .
They had been nitpicking the state ’s history standards and each other since 9 a.m. , and the patience of some Democrats in the bunch — who'd lost all the votes , as usual — was wearing a little thin .
“ I want to know when you ’re going to let me go to sleep , ” said member Lawrence Allen , D - Fresno , to chairwoman Gail Lowe , R - Lampasas , at one point .
Then someone mentioned adjournment , and the board ’s conservative majority shot that down , too .
That came a while after Rick Agosto , D - San Antonio — admittedly “ a little toasty ” — had told board conservatives they could stick Confederate President Jefferson Davis ’ inaugural address “ where the sun do n’t shine . ”
That preceded another set - to commenced by David Bradley , R - Beaumont , who could n’t resist making a motion to add the “ Hussein ” to President Barack Obama ’s name .
The marathon hearing capped a year of politically explosive wrangling over the social studies standards that will form the outline for textbooks and tests years into the future .
And the finale ( or near finale — the group - grope editing continues today ) did not disappoint those who have come to love hating Texas ’ only internationally notorious state government body .
After spending hours deep in the semantic weeds — and with Democratic members often reintroducing issues that had been voted down at previous meetings , sometimes more than once — the board , true to form , dove into the most controversial rewrites late in the evening , long after the public crowds had gone and its own members had grown irritable .
All told , the board considered well over 100 amendments on Thursday , bringing the total to more than 400 rancorous edits debated over more than year .
The end result is expected to be formally enacted as the board takes a final vote on the entire curriculum today .
And they never even got to the church - state fights on the card ; those , too , are expected today .
The flurry of changes was the culmination of what the board ’s conservative wing has repeatedly called “ balancing ” to remove perceived left - wing bias in the standards .
Meanwhile , critics call the final product a gross right - wing distortion of facts widely accepted by mainstream historians — who themselves have come in for abuse from board members , who consider the academy a den of socialists .
The board ’s seven social conservatives , two of them lame ducks , are sure to vote for the package , and observers expect that one or more of the board ’s more moderate Republicans —
Pat Hardy , of Weatherford , Bob Craig , of Lubbock , and Geraldine Miller , of Dallas , another lame duck — will provide the deciding vote .
The board ’s five Democrats are almost sure to reject the standards .
" Honoring " the commander in chief
The “ Hussein ” amendment came after board conservatives rewriting the history standards had deemphasized slavery , questioned New Deal entitlements and mandated study of the “ optimism ” of “ thankful ” immigrants .
Democrat Allen made a motion to add the name of Barack Obama to the standards .
It seemed a minor copy edit :
He merely wanted the president ’s name in a standard that already mentioned the year of his election as a turning point and noted the “ first black president . ”
Bradley sprang into action .
“ I ’d like to make a motion to insert his middle name , Hussein , ” he said .
Asked why — it was the first time any discussion of any of official 's middle name had come up — Bradley played dumb .
“ He ’s the president of the United States , and I think we should give him the honor and privilege of his full name . ”
He insisted the board had done the same for “ John Fitzgerald Kennedy ” and “ Ronald Wilson Reagan . ”
Some other members were dumbfounded :
The Arabic sounding name has been widely used as an epithet in conservative circles and is closely tied to the contention that Obama is n’t an American citizen .
“ I think it ’s pretty obvious what you ’re trying to do , ” Craig said .
“ And I do n’t think it ’s correct that we ’ve used the middle names for other presidents . ”
( That was true , Lowe confirmed shortly later ; the board follows whatever style a particular president prefers for his name . )
“ There has been so much fun made of that middle name , " snapped board member Mavis Knight , D - Dallas .
" That ’s not what we ’re about , since we ’re one nation and we ’re supposed to live in this utopia , ” she said , poking fun at board conservatives ’ ardently rosy view of America ’s past .
Mary Helen Berlanga , D - Corpus Christi — who left the last meeting in a tantrum after not getting her way on dozens of votes — chided Bradley : “ I ’m getting pretty fed up with the behavior , and trying to be derogatory .
…
You ’re grinning and making fun , and it ’s really upsetting .
…
We ’re talking about something serious :
The first African - American president of the United States . ”
After pleas from other members to quash the amendment and spare the board further embarrassment , Bradley stood down , but he slapped at his colleagues .
“ Madam chair , I ’ll put an end to the whining .
I ’ll withdraw the motion , ” he said .
Uncivil civics
That exchange followed Agosto's meltdown over the juxtaposition of Jefferson Davis ' inaugural speech and an address from Abraham Lincoln .
He did n't want Davis or any confederate figure on equal footing with the Union president : “ You can put them in the front , put them in the back , put them where the sun do n’t shine . ”
Perhaps predictably , the Civil War discussion marked the point where decorum , though never quite stable , started to collapse .
The bulk of the day ’s discussions were reruns from previous meetings : legal vs. illegal immigration , slavery vs. states ' rights vs. sectionalism , whether Joseph McCarthy was correct all along about government infiltration by the communists , whether third graders should learn about labor leader Dolores Huerta — even if she was a socialist ( no , was the answer , though she survives elsewhere in the standards ) .
In the big picture , the changes made little difference in the documents , and likely will make far less difference once they filter through test - makers and textbook publishers and , finally , down to teachers who largely can teach what and how they want once the material gets to the classroom .
But the order of the day was politics and the culture war , not education .
And the Civil War provided the ideal battleground .
When Allen sought to add causes of the Civil War to one standard — in his view , slavery and states ' rights — it kicked off a racially charged debate that stretched well into the night .
Bradley insisted the board had already worked it out and “ prioritized ” the reasons : sectionalism , states rights , and slavery — in that order .
“ It pushes the idea that slavery was not a main issue , but the other two were , ” Allen objected .
“ We do n’t have to beat around the bush .
We do n’t have to soften the blow — this was all about slavery , ” Berlanga added .
The board ’s conservative bloc held fast — slavery was the third - most - influential cause of the war — and voted down Allen ’s amendment .
That debate bled into the faceoff over Lincoln and Davis .
At a previous meeting , the social conservative bloc had insisted on including Davis ’s inaugural address in a standard that requires students to study Lincoln .
Miller waxed nostalgic about the days when Jefferson Davis was a more respected figure in the public mind , at least in the South .
“ We ’re trying to deal with the accuracy of history and give a balance .
So many people do n’t know what Jefferson Davis did and what was involved , ” she said .
“ He ’s been kind of pushed aside during the years . ”
Allen and other more liberal members did n’t object to the inclusion of Davis completely but wanted him separated completely from the greatness of Lincoln .
“ Besides the fact that he was the head of the union , he was the president of the United States , ” Berlanga scolded .
Conservatives stood up for Davis but “ demoted ” him , in the words of Cynthia Dunbar , R - Richmond , all the way to the end of the sentence in question , behind a “ contrast ” with Lincoln .
Books on backorder
The final squabbling — which will extend into today ’s meeting , starting at 9 a.m. — comes as the board faces serious questions over whether and when it will get the money from the Legislature to buy the actual books or digital materials being amended .
Earlier in the week , the board agreed to shelve plans for science textbooks , based on the standards the board approved more than a year ago , because the Legislature , facing a budget crisis , simply does not have the money to buy them .
Instead , the Texas Education Agency will ask lawmakers for money to purchase far cheaper supplementary materials , so students can prepare by 2012 for state tests based on the new standards .
The new social studies standards wo n’t affect tests until at least 2013 , already a year later than planned , the board was told by Commissioner of Education Robert Scott .
But even that depends on the Legislature appropriating the money for new materials first — something that almost assuredly will not happen in next year ’s session .
That means the purchase would be pushed back at least until at least the 2013 legislative session , and maybe two years beyond that , as the purchase of science books presumably would take priority .
“ You never know until the Legislature buys them , ” Scott said of the social studies books .
“ They could turn around and say , ‘ We ca n’t afford to buy the damn things . ’ ”
The state could be forced to delay implementing the tests based on new social studies standards if it cannot finance updated materials for several years , which Scott acknowledged is a real possibility .
Otherwise , the state would be vulnerable to an “ opportunity to learn ” lawsuit , from students alleging they were tested and denied advancement based on material they were never taught .
If the Legislature ca n’t stomach the bill to buy new books for 4.7 million students , the TEA might look to new legislation that empowers the commissioner to purchase digital materials , which Scott said theoretically could be developed to supplement to existing books .
But there ’s where the top - to - bottom nature of the board ’s standards rewrite could present a serious logistical problem :
How can a mere “ supplement ” cover a set of standards that have been rewritten wholesale , as warring politicians have torn through the books with hundreds of amendments on pet issues , historical figures and events ?
Indeed , Ken Mercer , R - San Antonio , kept referring this week to “ the Mercer database ” — a cross- referencing of added and deleted names he created so the board could keep up with the scores of changes .
The potential delays continued to give hope to those who would like to see the conservatives ’ rewrites scrapped or subjected to yet another edit .
" I ’ve never seen a standards process reopened , but there ’s no rule against it , ” said Dan Quinn , spokesman for the Texas Freedom Network , an advocacy group that scolds and scrutinizes the state board for rightwing extremism .
“ If the purchase of the books gets pushed out longer , that widens your window of opportunity to fix the mess they ’ve got right now . ”
Over the course of three days , board conservatives repeatedly rebuked criticism they had given the history of minority populations short shrift , often noting the standards included more minority figures “ than ever before . ”
The increase did not appease more liberal members , some of whom were insulted at the suggestion that minority history — and particularly the struggle against white oppression — had been fully and fairly treated in the standards .
Allen referenced a 1963 speech by Martin Luther King in which King demanded , “ We want all of our rights , we want them here , and we want them now . ”
“ When we sit here and hear , ‘ You got more of them in than you ’ve ever had before , ’ they do n’t understand the pain of that statement , ” Allen said .
“ We want all of our history — in its totality — here and now in Texas — not , ‘ We gave you two spots in where you only had one spot before . ’ ”
Scott , who has heretofore stayed completely out of the cutthroat politics of textbook standards , told the board Thursday that the practical considerations of getting tests rewritten and materials bought for students trump any political concern .
“ If you delay too much , you ’ll have to start all over again .
Regardless of the political will behind delaying it ( the adoption ) , there are some real - world implications , ” he said .
“ Prepare to blind your eyes to the tantrums that will be thrown , and let ’s get this process done . ”
" Every good meeting … "
Scott 's comments were among the first of Thursday morning .
Turns out , getting anything done would prove difficult .
And no tantrums from outsiders could match those of some board members , nor could they match the poisonous rhetoric board members traded traded among themselves in a meeting that dragged on until shortly after midnight .
Agosto seemed particularly on edge as the night wore on .
He gets credit , in fact , for prompting an earlier - than - scheduled dinner break when Lowe wanted to give him some time to calm down .
At some point , Agosto felt slighted at the respect accorded another member across the aisle .
Some members occasionally checked their facts with Hardy , R- Weatherford , a veteran social studies teacher , calling her the “ resident historian . ”
“ Can we stop saying ‘ residential historian ’ or whatever we ’re saying here ? ” a clearly peeved Agosto admonished his colleagues .
“ All board members here are on equal footing . ”
Two dozen or so historical revisions later , the board members seemed finally to have had enough of themselves .
The meeting adjourned , at 12:06 a.m. , after member Craig made perhaps the wisest comment of the session : “ Every good meeting should end on the day it started , and we did n’t make it . ”
The Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has heavily criticized and condemned Israel ’s “ attack ” on the “ humanitarian aid ships ” traveling to Gaza during his speech at the Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) group meeting .
The Prime Minister as expected , heavily criticized Israel on the raid of the Turkish led Flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to the Gaza strip and called the bloodshed a “ massacre ” .
The Prime Minister also called for the support of the international community on the attacks on International waters and said “ during war , children should not be attacked , during war women and the elderly should not be attacked , during war civilians and religious men and women should not be attacked , during war people showing the white flag should not be attacked .
We are not in war and those who attack the list which I have just specified are not only acting against the laws , they are standing on humanity , they are inhumane . ”
The Prime Minister continued , “ Even rebels , bandits and pirates obey these rules , and calling those people who do not obey these rules rebels , bandits and pirates is showing them courtesy . ”
Bellow is some of the headlines from Prime Minister Erdoğan ’s speech .
“ I am appealing not only to my people in Turkey but to all humanity .
I am openly appealing to the conscience of all humanity and I want to openly share my feelings with you . ”
“ The humanitarian aid ships travelling to Gaza could not accomplish their goal .
Yesterday morning , The Armed Forces of Israel , attacked the ships sending humanitarian aid to the Gaza strip .
The blood of innocent people was shed . “
“ The bloody massacre by Israel on the ships sending humanitarian aid to Gaza deserves all the coursing which it gets .
The attack was openly committed towards international law ; it was committed to the conscience of people , it was done against world peace . “
“ I am saying the attacks were committed against the conscience of the people , as the ships were carrying people from all nations and all religions , with the sole purpose of trying to send humanitarian aid to the Gaza people who have been suffering from a blockade .
Before the ships were boarded , the aim of the ships and the aim of the people on board were declared to the world press .
As witness to the aid , 60 members of the press also boarded the ships . ”
“ The Turkish Republic , is using all the International laws and diplomacy possible to and will continue to do so . ”
“ Israel has told us that they will send the injured back to us , but we have rejected this and said that we have the power to get our own injured back to Turkey . ”
“ Israel must immediately lift the inhuman embargo on the people of Gaza .
They should not try to stop the humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people . ”
“ To slay innocent people , to treat civilians like terrorists is degradation in the eyes of humanity and wretched recklessness . ”
“ World piece has received a major blow .
The reckless , unlawful attack by the Israeli government must be punished . ”
“ Rather than waiting for an investigation from a government which has made lying a state policy , the international community should investigate the attack . ”
“ Turkey is not an adolescent rootless country .
It certainly is not a tribe country .
No one should try to test the patience of Turkey .
However much Turkey ’s friendship is valuable , Turkey ’s hostility is as powerful .
Loosing Turkey ’s friendship on its own is a price to pay . ”
“ They are denying , they are saying they were fired on first .
We are sick and tired of your lies .
Be a little honest .
The ships , personnel and volunteers should be released immediately .
No one has the right to accuse the volunteers , MP’s and the 60 journalists of travelling outside of the fact that they were taking humanitarian aid to Gaza .
This attack has once again showed the inhuman persecution the Palestinian people have been suffering . “
“ I said before , they know very well how to kill .
They have shown the world how well they know how to kill and massacre people once again .
You even handcuff those who are injured and lying on stretchers .
Is there any explanation for this ?
There is no way for them to explain these inhuman actions to the international community .
Just to curse them is not enough .
We have to get results . ”
“ They should know that one day , justice will prevail and not power . “
“ Whoever turns a blind eye to the bloody attacks they should know that they are also part of the bloodshed .
We once again saw that the issue ( Israel ’s politics on Hamas led Gaza ) is not war on terror or against terror , it is an issue of trying to massacre the people of a city . ”
“ You experiment with phosphorus bombs on these people , you bomb hospitals and mosques , you even aim at a United Nations Office .
As if this is not enough , you leave those people without the basic needs to survive . ”
“ You will even show your inhuman brutality to those who are trying to send humanitarian aid to help those people .
Everyone can shut their eyes for the lawless behavior .
I am openly saying .
They can receive insidious support for their actions by others .
But Israel should not make the mistake of putting Turkey in the same shoes of others . ”
“ They should not make that mistake , the price will be heavy .
Israel ’s attacks on Open waters 71 miles away from their land openly show that they have chosen isolation . ”
“ If everyone stays quiet , shuts their eyes and turns their back , we will not be turning our back on Palestine ; we will not be shutting our eyes . ”
The Prime Minister ’s comments have been interpreted as very aggressive and condemning of the actions by Israel .
Another very important comment the Prime Minister made was when he said “ today is a new day , and nothing will be the same ( with Israel ) . ”
This historic speech by the Prime Minister was seen as a milestone as such condemnation and accusation by such a senior member of any government was not heard during out of war speeches in a very long time .
The United States have also been criticized for not openly condemning Israel ’s actions on the raid of the Flotilla of non military ships on International Waters .
A demonstrator who NationalTurk spoke to after the UN condemnation and statement of the Israeli attack said “ When the South Korean warship was attacked in disputed and hostile waters ; the United States supported an independent investigation , so why is it when civilian ships carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza is attacked by
Israeli Armed forces on International waters that the investigation is held by Israel .
Why is it not an independent investigation ?
Why does the United States not support an independent investigation ? ”
However , not all of what Erdoğan said was supported .
Some politicians belonging to the Republican People ’s Party , the main opposition of the government have condemned the continuing arms deals with Israel which is alleged to be close to a billion dollars .
One member of parliament who belongs to the opposition party said “ We do not agree with all the Prime Ministers thoughts , what is he going to do about the arms deals with Israel which in retrospect have partly financed the attacks on the Palestinian people ? ”

Checking the box score , in the Major League Props : Hall & Oates hit a grand slam as they joined in on the " Sound Strike , " tour , errr , I mean ' cancel tour ' of musicians standing in solidarity and vocalizing their feelings against Kris Kobach 's Arizona hate bill .
The Arizona Diamondbacks announced that Daryl Hall and John Oates have canceled their post - game concert at Chase Field that had been scheduled to follow a game against the Dodgers on July 2 .
Hall and Oates issued the following statement : " In addition to our personal convictions , we are standing in solidarity with the music community in our boycott of performing in Arizona at this time .
We would like to emphasize that this has nothing to do with the management of the Arizona Diamondbacks , who have been professional and cooperative throughout our dealings with them .
This is our response to a very specific action of the state . "
Since both of us have backgrounds in the music industry , Howie Klein and I have been trying to persuade artists not to perform in Arizona since SB1070 was passed .
Zack de la Rocha is really a hero here .
Howie has much more :
Other artists who have joined suit include Cypress Hill , Pitbull , Rage Against the Machine , Kanye West , Sonic Youth , Carlos Santana , Willie Nelson , Joe Satriani , Tenacious D , Shakira , Massive Attack and Hall & Oates ( who were supposed to play at a July 2nd Diamondbacks game ) .
Rage 's Zack de la Rocha was organized an Arizona sound strike .
“ Fans of our music , our stories , our films and our words can be pulled over and harassed every day because they are brown or black , or for the way they speak , or for the music they listen to , ” de la Rocha said .
“ People who are poor like some of us used to be could be forced to live in a constant state of fear while just doing what they can to find work and survive .
This law opens the door for them to be shaked down , or even worse , detained and deported while just trying to travel home from school , from home to work , or when they just roll out with their friends . ”
The law -- SB 1070 -- takes “ racial profiling ... to a whole new low , ” the singer went on .
“ When Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat , they arrested her .
As a result , people got together and said we are not going to ride the bus until they change the law ...
What if we got together , signed a collective letter saying , ‘ We 're not going to ride the bus , ’ saying we are not going to comply .
We are not going to play in Arizona . ”
I 'm not pushing for a strike against the Diamondbacks players , but Jerry Colangelo and their ownership has been complicit in helping pass SB 1070 and have been big - time Republican shills .
By now , anarchists and anti-authoritarians across the country have probably given up waiting for an announcement of the annual CrimethInc. Convergence .
The truth is that as experienced organizers grow more weary of repeating themselves , and the emerging energetic anarchist communities are all tending to be less and less interested in organizing , few places seem to be appropriate candidates for this summer ’s convergence .
Moreover , by early spring it was already too late in the game for a community to come forward and offer to host the event , and interest simply had not surfaced .
In possibly the first great anarchist mistake of the decade , the CrimethInc. Experimental Committee was founded in late January .
Their first assignment ?
To preserve and integrate the best elements of the convergence into a new model , adjust them to strengthen longstanding weaknesses , all the while upping the ante in a way that serves the anarchist community as a whole .
At first , we thought their solution was a bad idea , so we commissioned a report and quickly changed our minds .
You ’re being invited to participate in CrimethInc . ’s next big experiment : a decentralized convergence .
THE OBJECTIVES
To create and maintain points of entry everywhere .
To demonstrate our ability to work together despite internal differences and external obstacles .
To invigorate anarchist infrastructure rather than lean on it .
To orchestrate a show of force in solidarity with anti-authoritarians all over the world .
To inspire curious newcomers without exhausting our vigor .
To illuminate the map like a starchart of constellations .
To remind ourselves – everyone – that we are everywhere .
THE CHALLENGE
Can anarchists mobilize to achieve these objectives with a tight deadline ?
In an effort to test and strengthen our potential , we ’re inviting anarchists of all stripes and contexts to participate in a widespread and decentralized demonstration of outreach and infrastructure .
To get involved , all that is required is that you facilitate or organize one or more events that will occur simultaneously across North America throughout the month of August .
THE PLAN
During August , we make anarchist principles and activity visible and accessible at a scale never before attempted .
Consider it an international month of action ; the activities can be of any caliber and temperament , and can appear anywhere : in the news , in the library , in the bedroom , in the supermarket , at the Really Really Free Market , on the streets , and so on .
Use this as an opportunity to explore and experiment : if you are n’t typically involved in local mutual aid projects , give it a go ; if you ’ve never gone on a tour before , plan one with your friends ; if you write zines , write banners ; if you author theory , stage a reading ; if you occupy classrooms , teach one for free .
Whatever you do , wherever you go , wave the black flag for everyone to see –including , and perhaps especially for , our friends and comrades – and let the world see that we are everywhere .
THE SKELETON
To supplement the individual events we ’re inviting people who ’d like to teach workshops , perform skits and puppet shows , and share music and videos , to organize tours with their friends .
The troupe could be just one person – you – or as many friends and companions as you can pack into a vehicle : whatever is doable and exciting .
You could schedule events in a few towns in your region over a weekend , or cross the continent in a month .
Your theme could be acute , spreading awareness about specific campaigns against mountain - top removal , evictions , state repression , the tar sands of Canada , the oil spill , oppression , or for mutual aid projects , solidarity with struggles happening here or elsewhere , or obscure theory .
Or it could be more broad – raising awareness about anarchism itself .
Decentralized tours could the most appropriate and safe way for the anarchist community to achieve the objectives of the nationwide convergence .
Accessible points of entry can emerge in all of the places that anarchists already are .
Inspirational experiences can be had with new people .
The diversity of anarchist perspectives and positions can be celebrated and affirmed in a way that allows them to work together , allowing us all to hold our commonalities close and activate our solidarity .
We ’re pleased to announce that several tours have already signed up as endorsers : The Conspiracy Tour [ USA ] , The Emergency Tour [ USA - Midwest ] , and Testament & Illogick [ Canada ] .
If you already plan on touring with a project during August , you can plug into the strategy with almost no additional effort .
If you have n’t planned anything during August , please consider organizing a tour in solidarity with all those who will be organizing events in their hometowns .
This goes most especially for everyone who has participated in CrimethInc Convergences in past years , and is able and willing .
To help offset the price of fuel , you might consider distributing [ free literature ]
/ 2006/10/18/never - pay - for-copies ) for donations , and selling books and screenprinted items – if you ’re partial , the Literature Distro Kit is one of the cheapest places to start .
In the next few weeks , we ’ll be maintaining a list of tour dates both organized within our challenging timeframe and scheduled for the month of August .
To add your project to the itinerary , please email experimental.committee@gmail.com as soon as possible , and we can publish your public events as they unfold .
THE NERVE
Drawing from the lessons of Steal Something From Work Day , our work should effectively utilize modern modes of communication and reclaim their functions when necessary .
Twitter –
We can use Twitter to announce your events and simultaneously contribute to the volume of the phenomenon .
If you use twitter , tag your tweets with # Anarchists Everywhere to let people locate it in a search of the entire campaign .
If we remember that these tweets are public and can function as promotional work , we can contribute to the campaign 140 characters at a time .
YouTube & Vimeo –
We can upload short vignettes that promote the campaign and will be relevant for years to come .
Our current recommendation is the proliferation of short 45 second clips ending in the slogan “ WE ARE EVERYWHERE ” .
To avoid the alienation that can sometimes be felt when watching high - quality video production , it is encouraged that these clips be shot with cell phones to remind everyone that they can make their own .
To contribute your video to the campaign , simply tag it with “ AnarchistsEverywhere ” .
Social Networking – Share this blog entry , and when more web projects and videos emerge share those too .
Announce local events to everyone that you communicate with through that medium .
While you ’re at it , be mindful of the networks you imply on facebook .
Of course , it is also important that we create signposts in the real world too .
Design posters , t- shirts , stencils , stickers , and other folk - art projects and spread them everywhere .
See this appendix for helpful slogans .
THE HEART
Of course , each tour will make this campaign exponentially larger , but this August wo n’t be about tours .
More important is what is going on in each place they pass through ; if you are part of an active community – even if that community is just you –you can make your town another mark on our constellation map , which is a substantial contribution .
In the context of this campaign , doing locally what tours cannot is considerably more effective than an elaborate schedule of tours .
You are a part of the everywhere .
Ultimately , this campaign is about doing what we do every day .
In working together as a decentralized concert of actions and activities we can collectively establish visibility for our local efforts and global struggles .
For inspiration , check out Recipes for Disaster if you have n’t already , or you could plan a workshop , block party , public discussion group – even a bike ride .
Put quite simply : if you ’ve got a black flag and the will to fly it , this August the world will be watching .
Whatever you do , your contribution will be a part of an experiment to determine our collective power - to and solidarity - with – no amount of participation is too small , and everyone ’s efforts will be counted .
THE DETAILS
Please read the arguments for decentralizing the CrimethInc. Convergence and the implications of a successful August 2010 .
Whether or not your project is a tour complete with a list of dates and venues , or a single event open to the public , it is still valuable and worthwhile to promote as a part of this campaign .
Please email details to experimental.committee@gmail.com for help promoting your event .
APPENDIX of SLOGANS {not just a big joke}
In reclaiming and reworking modern marketing and advertisement strategies , we can re-appropriate the elements of our social conditions .
Opportunities to do so will be self - evident : wherever capitalist imagery and sentiment competes for our attention .
To do so effectively we would benefit from maintaining relative consistency throughout this campaign .
This campaign is already built on a concept that both demands participation and refuses to be homogenized by those with particularly concentrated resources ; the message is that we are everywhere and therefore the aesthetic will naturally benefit from the wide spectrum of positions from which these messages can emerge .
Additionally , we cannot successfully demonstrate our prevalence without communicating things that describe our politics and the widespread nature of our resistance .
That these things are true does not mean we cannot create a consistent and circular front of visibility – this can happen by taking advantage of the strategies outlined above in the nerve section and by making prolific use of , and following the various style guides accompanying , the following slogans :
{ for use wherever possible , and most appropriate } { for use in pre-august promotional material } { anytime you need a clever supplement }
These are appropriate for Anarchists without Adjectives and will work well in combination with any of the others .
The use of any other slogans should be supplemented with these for best use of consistency :
WE ARE EVERYWHERE WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS AUGUST ?
GET ALL OVER THE PLACE { The Circle A }
These Insurrectionist slogans are sure to be attractively confusing :
DOING BEING EVERYWHERE PARTY THIS AUGUST MAKE TOTAL ALL OVER THE PLACE
The Anarchist People of Color who are n’t surprised that you assumed they were n’t involved in planning this campaign suggested :
NO ONE IS ILLEGAL – WE ARE EVERYWHERE THE BLOCK IS HOT , AUGUST WILL BE HOTTER STOLEN LAND IS ALL OVER THE PLACE
Efficient use of these slogans are sure to aid the Anarcho - Syndicalist platform :
AN INJURY SOMEPLACE IS AN INJURY EVERYWHERE TAKE IT OVER THIS AUGUST ONE BIG EVERYWHERE
If we would stop for a minute and listen for a change , the Anarcha - Feminist might recommend :
OUR PLACE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE TAKE BACK THE NIGHT THIS AUGUST MOTHERS WORK EVERYWHERE
Anarchist Queers can pack these with their strap - ons and glitter - bombs :
WE WANT YOU ANARCHISM IS IN THIS AUGUST BASH BACK EVERYWHERE
And lastly , if someone could tell the Anti-Civ folks about these slogans , that ’d be great !
Wired this week released the iPad edition of its technology oriented magazine , with the App Store software completely rewritten by Adobe , jettisoning the version written in Flash for one authored completely in the Apple - approved Objective - C language .
Chris Anderson , editor in chief of Wired , said the magazine utilizes new digital publishing technology developed by Adobe , which allows the publication to work on the print and digital editions at the same time , using the same authoring and design tools .
The result , he said , is a new version of Wired that he has always dreamed of .
" It has all of the visual impact of paper , enhanced by interactive elements like video and animated graphics , " he said .
" We can offer you a history of Mars landings that lets you explore the red planet yourself .
We can take you inside Trent Reznor 's recording studio and let you listen to snippets of his work in progress .
And we can show you exactly how Pixar rafted each frame of its new movie , Toy Story 3 . "
Released Wednesday , the iPad edition of Wired ( iTunes link ) costs $ 4.99 for the June issue .
It includes reviews of the best new LED TVs , a guide to gardening for geeks , and interactive content like a behind - the - scenes tour of a warehouse of frozen medical tissue samples .
The 527MB application is intended for users ages 17 ad up .
Wired also released a video ( encoded in Adobe Flash , and unplayable on the iPad ) showing off some of the features of the new digital magazine :
The Wall Street Journal explained how the magazine and Adobe had to rebuild their application from the ground up after it was revealed that Apple would not allow the use of intermediary tools to port software from another format , such as Flash , to the iPhone OS .
As such , Adobe joined the thousands of existing iPhone and iPad developers by recreating the magazine 's application in Objective -C .
" Wired , which has been working on an e-reader edition since last summer , has pursued a different path than its Conde Nast brethren by partnering with Adobe Systems , " author Russell Adams wrote .
" That decision later landed Wired on the wrong side of Apple , which has banned Adobeâs Flash technology from its devices .
Wired and Adobe had to rebuild the magazineâs app in Apple - approved code . "
Executives with Conde Nast , publisher of Wired , said that the rebuilt , Apple - approved application has all of the features of the previous one .
Future issues will add new features such as social connectivity , search functions , and the ability to open a browser within the application .
Conde Nast expects to offer a subscription model in the fall .
Currently , it will charge $ 4.99 per issue , and new issues can be bought as part of a library within a single application .
Conde Nast also released digital versions of its other magazines , including GQ , but they have not received the highly interactive treatment featured in the iPad edition of Wired .
Officials with the company previously said they would not create similar iPad apps for their other magazines until the issues between Adobe and Apple are resolved .
Apple recently changed the iPhone developer agreement to ban third - party tools that would allow software to be ported from other formats , like Adobe Flash , to native iPhone OS software .
Jobs said such tools would result in substandard applications on the Apple - controlled App Store .

Good work Brad ... you have almost single - handed busted this slander ... against sloppy , lazy , unprofessional , biased MSM reporters with 1000s times more resources to research this .
Thank you , unconstested slander and lies lead to wrong actions and biasing of whole swaths of the country .
I would get annoyed when MSM would engage in the false equivalency of getting two people on either side of issue to talk , and do know research or fact checking of the claims of either side , like truth is unknowable .
But now Stepha - no - brainos does not even bother to inteview any Acorn people were there ... the EYE witnesses would not be hard to find , they are on youtube ... including the Acorn staff that showed these yoyo's the door , or staff who compassionately tried to help their fictionals sob story that did not include a pimp .
I used to think George was just plain stupid , which may be the case , but I think he is sincerely a conservative idiot or a paid shill .
He probably suggest Dukakis get in that tank ... he jumped ship on Clinton early etc ...

Stephanopoulos is not a journalist .
He is a TV personality and former political adviser with a BA in Political Science and a masters in theology .
In a way you are doing the same thing he does , you give him implied credibility as a journalist when he deserves none .
Maddow no , Olbermann no , Matthews no , Limbaugh , O'Reilly , Beck , Hannity , all no .
None of the big talkers on TV are anything but opinionated loudmouths , even the ones you agree with .
Journalists are extinct and journalism is dead once Seymour Hersch and Matt Taibbi are gone .
Who else is there from either side really getting us the story instead of just spinning it out on TV for our infotainment ?

I totally agree that Stephanopoulos did a disservice by not telling the truth about the ACORN tapes .
I am glad he is being held accountable for that , and I hope he offers a correction .
Also , Breitbart should not have been allowed to beat his chest and reassert what has proven to be a totally false narrative .
He should have been checked on his pressing demand ( and it was a demand ) that the ACORN tapes show people assisting in funding a brothel .
That 's a cruel slander and clearly disproven lie .
Still , I do have to commend George and his team for airing the portion of the Census video which Okeefe had omitted from his own posting .
You could tell that papa smurf did NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL !!!!
And i did take a sort of satisfaction at watching james squirm around the issue of his own criminality .
( Those guys used to use the word " Criminal " like it was going out of style ...
But sadly , they cant say that anymore because james is ... well , a convict .
But it looks like they have opted for " corruption " as the new catch all . )
George also ought to be commended for hoisting out James 's own online diary regarding the incident at Rutgers .
That kids was squirming like the like tape - worm he truly is !
None of this obviates the re-assertion of the proven lies regarding the ACORN tapes .
But the interview did piss James and Breitbart off ... they didnt get the money - shot they had hoped for .
And ( in terms of reaction ) James and Andy themselves went up , down and all around the emotional fun-house .
What Breitbart described as " a profile in media courage " that very morning became a hostile " sandbagging by MediaMatters " in less then a day !
Now that is absolutely precious .
Karma can be a real artist sometimes .
Okeefe 's harangue about a great uprising of boring conservatives and angry wingers armed with cell - cameras and online video did intrigue me .
I mean , James and Breitbart advocate for a culture of perpetual serveillance ... and not just of groups with government funding .
If his record is anything to go by , then its clear that James wants to target , monitor , record and subsequently malign any demographic he dislikes ( gay people , minorities , teachers , nurses etc ...)
He and Breitbart exhort fellow numb - skulls to join them in this task .
Here 's whats funny about that .
Breitbart has become the very Big Brother he claims to fear .
He has become the mother on constant online surveillance and public smearing .
A nascent MiniTrue , to beat all the Orwellian cliches that plague our day and age .
A shame - based society more appropriate to Jonestown at its worst , and rediscovering all the grim tactics of the Witch Hammer .
Yes Andrew Breitbart ... you ARE BIGGovernment.com .

Either the media can no longer tell it's own lies from truth , or it just does n't care .
The only thing it 's afraid of is dead air time .
Any noise at all sells advertising time .

The New Yorker 's Rebecca Mead recently repeated the anti-ACORN propaganda in her piece ( " Rage Machine " ) on Andrew Breitbart .
She was more cautious and a bit more skeptical but the piece still stated : Breitbart ’s biggest scoop thus far has been a series of videos made by a twenty - five - year - old activist named James O’Keefe , which was posted on Big Government last September .
O’Keefe , along with Hannah Giles , then a student at Florida International University , travelled across the nation and entered several offices of Acorn , the community - organizing association , with a hidden camera ; they posed as a pimp and a prostitute who were seeking housing and business help .
O’Keefe ’s approach did not adhere to traditional standards of journalism , bearing a closer resemblance to the methods pioneered by Sacha Baron Cohen .
In a visit to an Acorn office in Baltimore , O’Keefe and Giles politely introduced themselves as having “ kind of a unique life situation . ”
As Acorn employees solicitously offered them routine small - business advice ( file a 1099 tax form , look for deductions ) , O’Keefe and Giles slowly revealed what their unique life situation entailed , then presented an unorthodox business plan : to smuggle a number of underage Salvadoran girls into the country , with the goal of sexually enslaving them .
The Acorn employees were , alarmingly , unalarmed by the proposal .
“ My job is not to judge people , ” one of them told O’Keefe and Giles .
The hidden - camera footage , which Breitbart has called “ the Abu Ghraib of the Great Society , ” did not expose endemic corruption at Acorn : though O’Keefe and Giles induced employees to coöperate with an appalling scenario , they did not dig up evidence of any actual wrongdoing by those employees .
Yet the repeated airing of the footage on Fox News has been devastating , and Acorn now describes its financial situation as “ precarious . ”

I shot a video out a window of something happening on the street below , and Paramount filed a DMCA complaint against me with Youtube .
My video should be below :
On Monday , May 10 , I was visiting the offices of NeighborGoods .
During our meeting , we heard tire screeches outside in the alley .
We knew a film was being made , so we rushed to the window to see .
To our surprise and delight , I was immediately able to identify it as Transformers 3 .
Micki and I whipped out our phones and shot videos of the action below .
We watched as they set up a hydraulic lift and loaded a tiny smart car onto it .
It was very exciting .
They cleared the set , and Michael Bay called action , and the car was launched into the air and went careening down the street .
As soon as it was over , Micki and I literally raced to put our videos online .
We even made a nerdy bet to see who would get more hits .
My original post is on my blog , I Love Ben Brown .
The video originally lived here on Youtube .
Micki's video , virtually identical to mine ( and featuring a shot of ME filming my version of the video ) , is still available on Youtube .
Is this a photo of someone violating Paramount 's copyright ?
Photo by Katie Spence
Unbeknownst to me , what we had captured was actually one of the first days of shooting for the movie .
As a result , the video got picked up by The Transformers Live Action Movie Blog , and from there spread to a few fan forums .
Tuesday morning , Io9 picked it up .
Tuesday morning , Google sent me an email offering me the opportunity to earn money from my popular video .
I decided to wait for a while to see how the video performed .
Roughly 48 hours after I posted the video , and after it had received 36,000 views , my video was removed from Youtube .
The next time I visited Youtube.com , I saw this screen , explaining that Paramount Pictures Corporation had filed a copyright complaint against me .
On my Youtube " My Videos " page , I see this message , claiming that my video somehow " matched third party content . "
Obviously , since Transformers 3 has not been completed , there is no way that I violated any copyright .
I shot a video of activity in a public space .
On Friday , May 14 , Google sent me a response that explains that they 've forwarded my counter notice to Paramount , and that my video will be restored only after 10 - 14 days have passed ...
On Monday , after speaking to the EFF , I sent an email to the Viacom copyright hotline .
Though I have to this date not received a response from Viacom , Paramount or Google , on the evening of Monday May 17 , my video reappeared on Google !
I can totally be reached for comment by email at benbrown@gmail.com , or on the phone at 518-288-8224 .

I 'm Ben Brown , just a guy who has been posting stuff on the internet for like 15 years .

Techdirt wrote an article about my video in relationship to Paramount / Viacom 's ongoing lawsuit against Google .
My wife told the story from her perspective , and shot the photo used above photo of Micki and I .
Micki wrote a post about my video too !
BP , in a series of newspaper advertisements about the Deepwater Horizon disaster , says it is “ working around the clock to contain and collect most of the leak ” and it will “ take full responsibility for cleaning up the spill . ”
But if past catastrophes are guides , the cleanup by BP workers will capture only a fraction of the crude belched up by the broken well .
Much of the oil will be taken care of by nature ; the rest is likely to stay with us for decades .
In Alaskan coastal zones fouled by the Exxon Valdez in 1989 , scientists discovered oil , scarcely changed , 16 years later .
In some areas , its composition had not altered much from the toxic clumps and goo that had formed just weeks after the spill .
Contrary to early expectations , oil still oozes from Alaska ’s beaches , toxins intact , and is expected to remain — perhaps even for centuries .

Here ’s a thought that ’s been nagging at me for the past few months :
Over the last decade or so web design has become increasingly homogenous , attempting to ape the styles of other , older media and losing touch with what could make it new and unique .
First , let ’s get this caveat out of the way : I ’m not sure if the above statement is true .
I do n’t like to apologise in advance , but while my gut says it is true , and is annoyed and upset by what we ’re losing , my head is more circumspect and wary .
I may have missed something or confused the wood for the trees .
I ’m not a design guru .
I do n’t keep up with the hot design blogs .
I have n’t been excited by a type catalogue for twenty years .
But , possibly like you , I ’ve been using and making websites most days for fifteen years .
So there is , against all odds , a chance I ’m correct , and the statement holds water ; web designers are merely copying print design , and not being “ web ” enough .
Let ’s step back a bit .
In the early 1990s websites were limited .
There was almost no customisable design to speak of .
Backgrounds were grey , text was black and a standard size , links were blue and underlined .
There was little control over layout .
But gradually things changed and the possibilities increased .
By the mid-90s there was more colour ( 216 of them ! ) and HTML tables allowed more complex page structures .
It was possible to exert more control over a page ’s appearance , to actually design it .
Since then we ’ve gained more fonts , more colours , better code , bigger screens , more bandwidth , more computing power , finer control over appearance .
These days we ’re starting to get access to a huge number of fonts and HTML and CSS keep improving and growing , year by year .
At any point in time , this process of improvement has seemed frustratingly slow , but in retrospect it ’s amazing how much has changed , how many possibilities have been introduced in a relatively short amount of time .
Web designers now have much , much more freedom than they did ten , fifteen , twenty years ago .
And yet , despite this freedom , it feels like web design is becoming more dull , not more adventurous .
We ’ve shaken off the restrictions of the early days , opened up all kinds of technical possibilities , but web design seems less exciting and less experimental than it did fifteen years ago .
There ’s a chance this is purely nostalgia on my part .
Of course things seemed exciting when the web was new and empty and we had no idea what was ahead .
Despite myself , a little part of me does indeed want to go back to that , when being online felt more special .
But that little part of me is misguided , in the same way that people who want to go back to the happy , simple “ good old days ” in the real world are misguided .
Just as those people forget the diseases and hardship and lack of communication , education or civil rights in the “ good old days ” , the nostalgic part of me overlooks the early web ’s lack of speed , services , information , friends , technologies , etc .
But , looking beyond my nostalgia , I think there is something more .
Web design has indeed become homogenised and less adventurous .
For example , I look at HotWired from 1995 and wonder what such a site could look like now if it had continued along the adventurous path it was setting out back then .
These days all news and magazine style sites generally fit into the same broad template :
Black text on a white background and a main column with one or two side columns .
Big or small , they seem to aspire to a sense of tidy inoffensiveness .
Personal sites , too , have become more dull .
I ’m not holding GeoCities up as a fine example of web design , but there was something special there , something “ of the web ” .
Look at these examples picked at random .
Yes , they sure are ugly , but they do n’t look like objects that would have been created before the web .
These days , most personal sites are neater , more structured , more akin to the aesthetics of conventional print design .
I do n’t , by the way , wish to excuse myself from this decline in adventurousness .
My own early personal websites were much more experimental than the current one , which was even inspired by the tidy design of a magazine .
I ’m very much at fault too .
I can see why this change happened , both to me and the web in general .
There are several contributing reasons , including :
More rules .
In the early days people were still deciding what worked and what did n’t .
There was less accepted wisdom about how different kinds of websites should look , and you could try more things without them being “ wrong ” .
The downside was that every site worked differently , and some of them badly .
More mainstreaming .
These days every company is online in some fashion .
The web has , on average , become more mainstream compared to the time when it was only the most adventurous who set up websites .
It ’s perhaps inevitable that , on average , web design is more dull , more mainstream .
But it feels like even the kinds of people and organisations that would once have been among those early pioneers are settling for conventional design .
More automation .
I almost forget that there was once a time before Blogger , before Movable Type , before Flickr , before any kind of automated tool that made online publishing easier .
Back then , if you wanted to publish something on the web you had to write , or copy and paste , every page ’s HTML .
The growth of these automated tools and services is a very good thing , enabling people to focus on writing , taking photos , whatever they want to do .
But this has meant that most people use standard templates of some kind , and these templates generally seem to follow conventional design rules of what looks nice and neat .
It ’s easy to see why web design has become more homogenous , but it ’s a great shame .
It feels like we ’ve lost the “ webness ” of web design over an incredibly short period .
There ’s something fundamental about the technology that lies behind all web design — right back to those old grey pages with their blue links — that perhaps should inform our contemporary designs .
It feels like we ’ve rushed through a hugely compressed process , discarding old design tropes all too quickly as new technologies enable new features and new fashions render old styles awkward .
It ’s as if Johannes Gutenberg went from printing his first primitive page in 1439 and by 1459 was already churning out full colour , embossed , foiled , pop - up picture books .
There was a time when the huge number of restrictions on web designers fostered greater creativity than is achieved now with fewer restrictions .
Although we have vastly more possibilities open to us now , it feels like we ’re trying to make web sites that adhere to an aesthetic developed over centuries of print , rather than finding something new from a couple of decades of the web .
We had a blank slate in the 1990s , but it feels like we ’ve given that up for aping print , whether modernist or more classical ( both of which examples I love ) .
Maybe , I do n’t know , Vimeo or Threadless or Flickr or whatever , do have something web - specific about their design which I ’ve become so used to that I can no longer see it .
None of these unfairly - chosen examples are bad , but …
If I was standing in 1995 and looking ahead to 2009 and was told how all of those technical restrictions would be lifted , of what would be technically possible , I ’d imagine 2009 ’s web to look a lot more exciting than it does .
I ’d expect it to look less like a magazine or a newspaper and to look more like what the web could be .
A high temperature silicone sleeve that houses the ceramic screen connects the glass whip tip to the glass whip handle , allowing the user to change the screen in about 2 seconds .
No more wrestling the screen into the whip
The innovation continues at Vaporbrothers with the brand new EZ Change Whip Kit .

Porn producer John Stagliano faces up to 32 years in federal prison for distributing the adult films Milk Nymphos and Storm Squirters 2 : Target Practice and a promo reel for similar material via his website for Evil Angel Productions ( adults only ) .
( Full disclosure : Stagliano is a donor to Reason Foundation , the nonprofit that publishes this website . )
As Stagliano gears up for a court case due to begin this July in Washington , D.C. , it 's worth asking whether obscenity prosecutions make any sense , especially when dealing with material created and consumed by consenting adults in private .
The definition of obscenity is notoriously slippery — works as varied ( and sexually inoffensive ) as Lady Chatterley 's Lover , Ulysses , and I Am Curious Yellow have all been deemed obscene — and its prosecution is famously subjective and selective .
Material is considered obscene only when a jury finds it to be so ; the same book , movie , or song can be illegal in one region and totally fine in another .
As Stagliano , whose website followed all legal restrictions imposed by federal mandates , notes , " I did n't know I was breaking the law . "
Despite the liberating technology of the Internet , free expression remains under attack by religous zealots who threaten death to blasphemers and government regulators who threaten jail time .
The prosecution of porn is " another area where the government thinks it should be able to run our lives , " says Stagliano .
" They could easily extend that from looking at porn to consuming fast food " and other activities .

MIAMI – Oh , my !
One of the founders of the anti-gay Family Research Council who speaks around the world against homosexuality is now being accused of vacationing in Europe with a young male prostitute .
George Alan Rekers , of North Miami , arrived at Miami International Airport on April 13 in the company of a “ rent boy ” named “ Lucien , ” The Miami New Times reported today .
Rekers -- an officer with the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality ( NARTH ) , a group that tries to turn gays straight -- told the alternative newspaper that Lucien was simply a travel companion who was hired to carry his luggage because Rekers recently had surgery .
But it was Rekers , not Lucien , who was pushing a heavy cart overloaded with luggage through the busy airport , the paper reported .
At a later date , the paper interviewed Lucien , who advertises his services exclusively on Rentboy.com .
The paper noted that Rekers would have had to locate Lucien on the gay website and sign off on the company ’s terms of use regarding sexual content .
Lucien was protective of his client during the interview , but surprised to hear that Rekers told the paper that he only learned that Lucien was a prostitute about halfway through the 10 - day vacation .
Rekers , a Baptist minister , is considered one of the most prominent anti-gay activists in the U.S.
He frequently testifies for the Christian right in court cases involving gay rights .
He was an “ expert ” witness for the Christian right in a 2008 case defending Florida ’s ban on gay adoption and in a 2004 case in Arkansas , also on the same issue .
In both cases , attorneys for the other side widely disputed his expertise .
Still , Rekers has had advisory roles with members of Congress , mostly Republicans , and even with government agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services .

Articles : Thursday = Thor ’s day 2010 - 05-07
Last week we had dinner at a quiet restaurant on the Oregon coast , and sat near two people that were obviously on a first date .
( “ So , do you have any siblings ? ” )
When their conversation took an interesting turn , we could n’t help but listen :
“ You ’re an atheist ?
How can you not believe in God ? ”
“ How can you not believe in Zeus or Thor ? ”
“ That ’s stupid .
Those are old folk - tales . ”
“ They were God !
You ’re dismissing others ’ beliefs , calling them folk - tales ?
So you ’re also an atheist for most gods that have ever existed .
I just go one further . ”
“ I ’m not an atheist ! ”
“ You and I are almost identical in our beliefs !
If history has named , say , 520 gods , you do n’t believe in 519 of them , I do n’t believe in 520 of them . ”
...( long pause ) ...
“ What do you do on Christmas or Easter , then ?
Do you feel weird as a non-believer ? ”
“ What do you do on Thursday ? ”
“ Huh ? ”
“ Thursday was named after Thor .
It ’s Thor ’s day .
Do you feel weird as a non-believer ? ”
“ That ’s not fair . ”
“ All the English days of the week are named after gods , sun , and moon .
Look it up on Wikipedia .
It ’s wild . ”
“ Why are you so into this ? ”
“ I ’m not .
Spent maybe 20 minutes on it , tops .
I ’m not on a mission to dis - prove God any more than you ’re on a mission to dis-prove Zeus .
It ’s really no big deal to me . ”
“ So , I guess we ’re not compatible , huh ? ”
“ Of course we are !
I like you a lot .
And we do agree on 519 of the gods , so we ’ll just not mention that last one . ”
“ OK .
Deal .
I like you a lot , too . ”
...( long pause ) ...
“ So what ’s your favorite band ? ”
“ Oh , God . ”
I liked the reframing of the situation from “ we ’re opposite ” to “ we agree on 519 of the 520 gods . ”
I always love an opposite point of view .
The true spirit of football !
I was never into watching sports on TV , nor was I a fan of playing sports games .
I do however , simply love this game because it takes a completely different turn than other sports games by making it like Javanoid !
It was also a great touch to have that guy at the end of each match to make it more like real soccer .
You have made the greatest tribute to professional soccer I have ever seen on this website !
I love how ridiculous the square bodies of these guys look .
It is just satisfying to see them slowly lose their power by being hit in the crouch .
JOHANNESBURG —
A gay couple in Malawi were found guilty on Tuesday of unnatural acts and gross indecency , the consequence of their holding an engagement ceremony in an insular nation where homosexuality is largely seen as nonexistent or something that must be suppressed .
Tiwonge Chimbalanga , 33 , and Steven Monjeza , 26 , face up to 14 years in prison .
A magistrate said he would sentence the men on Thursday .
The case has drawn worldwide attention as another example of the broad anti-gay sentiment in Africa .
A law recently proposed in Uganda calling for homosexuals to be executed in some cases stirred so much ire in the West that a presidential committee recommended withdrawing it from Parliament .
Malawi , a deeply impoverished , landlocked nation of 14 million , has also received international condemnation for prosecuting the two gay men .
But most of its leaders — political and religious — have reacted with defiance .
Last month , President Bingu wa Mutharika was quoted as calling homosexuality “ evil and bad before the eyes of God ” and an act “ we Malawians just do not do . ”
Looking at the number of tablets which are being announced by various companies it is certain that tablets will very soon be a mainstream consumer electronic product .
Tablets can be brilliant replacements for pen and paper due to their brilliant note making capabilities .
Keeping this in mind and targeting students and businessmen , a new dual - screen 14 - inch tablet Kno , has now been unveiled and although it is a bit large in size it looks a bit inspired by Microsoft ’s Courier which met a dead end .
The Kno tablet will run a custom version of Linux and will be powered by a low - power NVIDIA Tegra T20 processor .
Both the screens have their own separate lithium battery pack which keeps the device running for around eight hours and the company says that it will be able to work with Microsoft Office Documents .
The tablet will have a digital stylus for note - making , and it will also have full virtual on - screen keyboard on one screen so you can also use this tablet as a laptop .
Unfortunately , no specific release date or price details are available yet .
But what we know is that the tablet will reach the market by the end of this year and will be priced under $ 1,000 US .

Washington ( CNN ) -- A
Utah death row inmate who would become only the third person to die by firing squad in the United States in 33 years appealed to the Supreme Court on Wednesday , seeking a last - minute stay of execution .
Ronnie Lee Gardner 's lawyers filed the first of what are expected to be several appeals to the justices .
He is scheduled to be put to death early Friday for the shooting death of attorney Michael Burdell during a botched escape attempt from custody in 1985 at a Salt Lake City , Utah , courthouse .
Among the claims the 49 - year - old prisoner raises in his appeals is that he has been a death row inmate too long .
" He asserts that executing him now , after nearly 25 years on death row in Utah , so lacks retributive or deterrent value that it violates the Eighth Amendment , " Andrew Parnes , Gardner 's lawyer , told the high court .
He did not return phone calls from CNN seeking comment .
Executioner : Death by firing squad is ' 100 percent justice '
Gardner 's lawyers have launched an aggressive scramble in state and federal courts , as well as the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole , to at least postpone the execution .
A federal judge late Tuesday refused to block it , after Gardner claimed the procedures related to a two - day commutation hearing held by the board last week violated his civil rights .
Parnes had argued the clemency hearing was not fair and impartial because representatives from the Utah attorney general 's office were both presenting the state 's case at the hearing and advising the board .
Attorneys representing the state agency said safeguards were in place to prevent a conflict of interest .
The parole board Monday refused to commute Gardner 's sentence to life in prison , and the Utah Supreme Court on Tuesday also denied his request for a stay .
He claims he is a changed man , and should not be executed for his crimes .
Gardner is set to become the third person to die by rifle fire , all in Utah , since the Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976 .
He had a long history of escapes and was slipped a gun before he fatally shot Burdell on April 2 , 1985 .
He was at the courthouse for a pre-trial hearing in the 1984 slaying of Melvyn Otterstrom , who was killed at the Salt Lake City bar where he was working to earn extra money .
The execution is set for just after midnight ( 2 a.m. ET ) at the Utah State Prison in Draper , about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City .
Corrections officials announced Gardner had consumed his last meal Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m. , and has elected to fast prior to the anticipated execution .
His dinner included steak , lobster , and vanilla ice cream .
During the commutation hearing , parole board members heard testimony regarding Gardner 's childhood , which was punctuated by poverty , abuse and neglect .
Parnes maintained that jurors in the Burdell trial never heard this evidence -- and presented affidavits from jurors who said it might have persuaded them to decide against the death penalty .
Life in prison without the possibility of parole was not an option for jurors at the time , and Parnes said it was suggested to the jury that Gardner might be released from prison at some point if he were given a life sentence .
Gardner pleaded guilty to second - degree murder in Otterstrom 's death , and jurors were not told of a judge 's recommendation in that case that he not be released from prison , Parnes said .
Utah is the only state that uses the firing squad as a current execution method .
Oklahoma allows it only if lethal injection and electrocution are ruled unconstitutional .
Forty of Utah's 49 executions in the last 160 years or so have been done this way , according to the Death Penalty Information Center .
State lawmakers made lethal injection the default capital punishment in 2004 , but at least three inmates who already had chosen the firing squad were grandfathered in under the new law .
Five anonymous marksmen will use matching .30 - caliber rifles , standing behind a wall cut with five gunports .
One of the rifles will be an " ineffective " round , similar to a blank , which delivers the same recoil as a live round .
That ensures none of the riflemen will know who delivered the fatal shot .
The marksmen fire from a distance of 25 feet .
The inmate is blindfolded , strapped to a chair and a target pinned to his chest .
Lethal injection remains by far the most - used execution method in the United States and is the primary or only option in the 35 states with capital punishment .
Nine states still use electrocution , five states have the gas chamber , and two -- Washington and New Hampshire -- would hang condemned inmates as an alternate method .
The Supreme Court case is Gardner v. Utah ( 09 - 11378 ) .

The Gulf of Mexico continues to gush oil just as a whaling controversy threatens to land Australia and Japan in international court for killing protected species .
Meanwhile , another less - publicized but arguably more cataclysmic oceanic disaster continues to worsen .
Overfishing threatens to destroy most of the world 's fisheries within a matter of decades .
But while it 's proven difficult to save the gulf or save the whales , we know how to save the fish :
Stop treating the ocean like a public bathroom , says Christopher Costello , a professor of natural resource economics at UC Santa Barbara .
Director Louis Psihoyos and his team of filmmakers embarked on an elaborate sting operation to expose Japan 's illegal dolphin hunters .
The result is a documentary called The Cove , which took home the Oscar for best documentary .
And days after the Academy Awards Psihoyos was back stirring things up .
Using the same cameras that were used to expose illegal dolphin hunters , Psihoyos and his team busted The Hump , a Santa Monica , California restaurant that had secretly been serving sushi made from the endangered sei whale .
" Everything in the ocean from the great whales to dolphins to plankton is being jeopardized , " Psihoyos tells Reason.tv .
" We 're raping and harvesting the ocean unsustainably . "
Overfishing " could mean the end of certain species , " agrees UC - Santa Barbara 's Costello .
He points out that about a third of the world 's fisheries have already collapsed , and many more are heading toward the same fate .
Costello says the world 's fisheries are in such bad shape because of the same reason public restrooms are typically foul places : " Nobody owns them .
Nobody has the incentive to keep them up . "
One proven solution is a system called " catch share , " in which fishermen have the right to a certain share of the total catch of a type of fish .
This form of ownership gives fishermen an incentive to make sure fish populations grow , and according to Costello 's worldwide research , it 's the only thing that seems to work .
Environmentalists are often suspicious of the profit motive , but from Alaska to New Zealand , market forces have been harnessed not for plunder but for preservation .
Fishermen like the system because they make money , and environmentalists like it because it supports sustainable practices .
Expanding the catch share system may well be the best way to save a dying ocean .

President Obama used the BP oil spill in the Gulf Coast as a pivot point on Wednesday , calling on Congress to pass a climate change bill ' this year . '
Obama cites spill in climate pitch
FREMONT , Calif .
– President Obama called the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico “ heartbreaking ” and said it makes the passage of climate change legislation all the more urgent this year .
“ The spill in the Gulf , which is just heartbreaking , only underscores the necessity of seeking alternative fuel sources , ” Obama said after declaring climate change a “ threat to our way of life ” and calling on Congress to pass climate change bill “ this year . ”

Obama expressed tempered hope that the attempt to plug the oil leak , an effort known as top kill , will work .
The Coast Guard gave BP approval to go ahead with the operation as early as Wednesday .
“ If it ’s successful , and there are no guarantees , it should greatly reduce or eliminate the flow of oil now streaming into the Gulf from the sea floor , ” he said .
“ If it ’s not there are other approaches that may be viable . ”
Increasingly under fire for his response to the oil spill , Obama said his administration is “ intensively engaged . ”
“ We ’re going to bring every resource necessary to put a stop to this , ” he said , adding that he looks forward to visiting the Gulf Coast Friday to “ lend my support to the region . ”
But even as he expressed concern about the oil spill , Obama pivoted off the current crisis to make a pitch for refocusing America ’s energy use away from fossil fuels like oil and toward a cleaner - energy economy .
Obama pivoted off the current crisis to reinforce how dangerous the United States ’ dependence on oil is and to press for energy and climate change legislation .
“ We all know the price we pay as a country , ” Obama said .
“ With the increased risks and increased costs , it gives you a sense of where we ’re going .
We ’re not going got be able to sustain this kind of fossil fuel use .
This planet ca n’t sustain it . ”
Sen . John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) have proposed a climate - change bill , though Democrats are skeptical that it can get traction in a year that has already seen major fights over health care and Wall Street reform , especially with the midterms looming .
But even as Obama vowed to set the country on a clean energy path and promised his administration “ will not rest ” until the leak is plugged , Obama acknowledged that an immeasurable amount of damage has already been done – to the ecosystem in the Gulf Coast and beyond , to the economies of the communities that rely on it .
“ We ’re going to bring every resource necessary to put a stop to this thing but a lot of damage has been done already , ” Obama said .
America ’s oil addiction is not only a national security and economic threat , he said , but also sets the nation at a global competitive disadvantage .
The nation that leads the clean energy economy is the one that will lead the global economy , he said .
Before addressing workers , Obama toured the manufacturing plant and adjacent construction site of a company called Solyndra .
The construction is funded through a grant in the stimulus bill and is expected to expand Solyndra ’s business and create several thousand jobs .
Obama then promised the couple hundred workers seated in the new manufacturing building that the economy will get better .
“ As difficult as it may be , ” he said , “ we will recover .
...
We will rebuild . ”
It could have been worse .
The province has secretly passed an unprecedented regulation that empowers police to arrest anyone near the G20 security zone who refuses to identify themselves or agree to a police search .
A 31 - year - old man has already been arrested under the new regulation , which was quietly passed by the provincial cabinet on June 2 .
The regulation was made under Ontario ’s Public Works Protection Act and was not debated in the Legislature .
According to a provincial spokesperson , the cabinet action came in response to an “ extraordinary request ” by Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair , who wanted additional policing powers shortly after learning the G20 was coming to Toronto .
The regulation kicked in Monday and will expire June 28 , the day after the summit ends .
While the new regulation appeared without notice on the province ’s e-Laws online database last week , it wo n’t be officially published in The Ontario Gazette until July 3 — one week after the regulation expires .
“ It ’s just unbelievable you would have this kind of abuse of power where the cabinet can create this offence without having it debated in the Legislature , ” said Howard Morton , the lawyer representing Dave Vasey , who was arrested Thursday under the sweeping new police powers .
“ It was just done surreptitiously , like a mushroom growing under a rock at night . ”
According to the new regulation , “ guards ” appointed under the act can arrest anyone who , in specific areas , comes within five metres of the security zone .
Within those areas , police can demand identification from anyone coming within five metres of the fence perimeter and search them .
If they refuse , they face arrest .
Anyone convicted under the regulation could also face up to two months in jail or a $ 500 maximum fine .
“ It reminds me a little bit of the War Measures Act , ” said lawyer Nathalie Des Rosiers of the new regulation .
Des Rosiers is a lawyer with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association , which has been working to monitor arrests during the summit .
“ This is highly unusual to have this declaration done by order - in - council without many people knowing about it . ”
Des Rosiers learned of the regulation Thursday afternoon , shortly after Vasey was arrested while standing near the security fence .
Vasey said he was exploring the G20 security perimeter with a friend when they were stopped by police and asked for identification .
Vasey says he had also been searched by police the night before .
According to Vasey , police explained there was a bylaw in place obligating him to provide identification but he refused , acting on the advice of a “ Know Your Rights ” information pamphlet given to him by the Toronto Community Mobilization Network , a group assisting protesters .
The York University master ’s student was taken into custody at around 4 p.m .
He was brought to the Eastern Ave. detention centre , a former movie studio that has been temporarily converted into a prisoner holding pen .
According to his charge sheet , he was charged with refusing to comply with a peace officer under the act .
Vasey said he only learned of the new regulation after his release , at around 9 p.m .
The summit ’s Integrated Security Unit did not respond to interview requests from the Star .
According to Vasey ’s lawyer , neither he nor his colleagues at the law union were aware of this draconian new regulation .
Des Rosiers said the CCLA and protesters have met with summit officials on several occasions and the regulation was never mentioned .
“ They do n’t even have signs up saying you ca n’t be within five metres or you ’re subject to the following , ” Morton said .
“ If they really wanted to keep the peace , they would have announced the regulation . ”
According to Laura Blondeau , an aide to Community Safety Minister Rick Bartolucci , the regulation “ ensures that police have the legal authority ” they need for such a massive security zone .
“ They really wanted to ensure they could provide a certain level of security , ” Blondeau said Thursday .
“ The regulation does not include private residences or businesses .
It ’s for certain streets and sidewalks in the security perimeter . ”
Blondeau said “ rightly or wrongly , ” the new regulation can be compared with airport security .
“ You do n’t have to get on that plane if you do n’t want to be searched and wanded , ” she said , adding that Bartolucci carefully weighed public safety and civil liberty concerns before agreeing to the one - time amendment .

“ It was an extraordinary request .
This is just for Toronto , just for the G20 , ” she said .
“ Given the environment that the police were expecting , they needed to be prepared . ”
Blondeau emphasized the law only affects those trying to enter the security zone and applies solely to police officers , not to private security guards contracted for the summit .
If someone declines to comply it empowers the police to turn them away — or face being searched .
According to government lawyers , the regulation was passed by cabinet using what is known as a “ covering ” order - in - council .
“ The authority for the regulation is contained in the PWPA ( Public Works Protection Act ) .
The PWPA authorizes the designation by cabinet of places as ‘ public works , ’ ” the lawyers said .
The Public Works Protection
Act was created in 1990 and defines a “ public work ” as everything from a railway to a bridge or a provincial building .
The act says any other building , place or work can also be “ designated a public work by the Lieutenant Governor in Council . ”
Morton said he ’s unaware of any precedents to such a regulation being passed in Ontario and questions if it is even constitutional .
Des Rosiers said the regulation runs contrary to the Charter of Rights because it prohibits people from generally circulating on public land .
The G20 security fence has been a magnet for passersby and protesters alike , with many people approaching to take pictures or just quench their curiosity .
For Des Rosiers , she is especially worried because most people , including protesters , will operate under the assumption they have a right to refuse handing over identification to police .
“ Protesters would have been told that the law of the land is that you do n’t have to talk to police officers if you do n’t want to , ” she said .
“ This changes things because even if you attempt to approach , it gives the power to the guard to demand identification .
“ It ’s a significant intrusion on people ’s rights . ”

Matt Wuerker ' The Big Short ' a hot read on Hill
In the midst of a floor speech on regulatory reform , Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) interrupted himself for a sort of commercial announcement .
“ I ’m going to plug a book : Michael Lewis ’s ‘ The Big Short . ’ ”
Advertisement
While debating changes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) told his colleagues : “ Read this new book , ‘ The Big Short . ’ ”
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) was decrying Republican obstructionism on the floor when he said , “ I recommend everyone within the sound of my voice to read the book . ”
Politicians have been known to latch onto books — Amity Shlaes ’s “ The Forgotten Man ” was a must - read among Republicans last year during the bailouts — but few works have shaped a legislative debate quite like Lewis ’s story about investors who made a killing by betting on the housing crash .
For a lot of Democrats — and even some Republicans — the book has created a kind of defining counternarrative of the economic collapse .
And it ’s given Lewis rock star status among some on Capitol Hill .
In the fall , Lewis met with House Republicans to discuss the financial crisis .
Rep. Jackie Speier ( D - Calif. ) invited Lewis to speak to the House Democratic Caucus in May .
Afterward , a brigade of senator fans , including Democrats Carl Levin of Michigan and Kay Hagan of North Carolina , approached him to say they liked the book .
“ I was just in shock , ” Lewis said .
“ They came up to say ‘ Hi , ’ and they read the book and liked it and mentioned it on the floor , that kind of thing . ”
Back home in Berkeley , Calif. , Lewis started getting calls from Hill staffers who wanted his insights on the financial meltdown and the best way to prevent another one .
“ I tell them all the same thing : ‘ I ’m not Jesus , I ’m Brian ’ ” — a reference to the Monty Python character who repeatedly finds himself mistaken for the son of God .
Lewis may not be the Messiah , but lawmakers are treating his book as though it were the Bible .
“ The Big Short ” tells the story of the economic meltdown through the eyes of a handful of investors who were smart enough to see the subprime mortgage crisis coming — and greedy enough to cash in on it .
As lawmakers navigate the mind - numbing terrain of credit default swaps and interest - only , negative - amortizing , adjustable subprime mortgages , Lewis ’s book gives them a straightforward way to think and talk about it all .
“ The Big Short ” has been mentioned at least 15 times on the Senate floor and in press conferences and committee hearings .
At a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government in April , Durbin told Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Schapiro , “ I ’ve joined a lot of other people in just finishing Michael Lewis ’s book , ‘ The Big Short , ’ and it ’s really an eye - opener of what was going on at the time that this real estate bubble was created . ”
Republican Sens. John Ensign of Nevada and Kit Bond of Missouri have name - dropped the book .
And Sen. Ted Kaufman ( D - Del. ) is fond of dropping catchphrases from it — such as “ thin files ” and “ barbelling ” — during committee hearings .
Why are so many on the Hill glomming onto the same narrative ?
“ It ’s very readable , ” Kaufman said , noting that his chief of staff read it and recommended it to him .
“ It ’s astonishing .
At times , you ’re upset by what you ’re reading .
I ’m not into horror movies ; for me , that ’s as close as I get .
That ’s a horror movie . ”
“ It ’s terrific for people who have n’t spent a lot of time on ” the subject , Levin said .
“ My wife is really into it .
I read it , marked it up for my staff , underlined it , made copies and asked them to read it . ”
Speier called the book “ an incredible piece of commentary on Wall Street ” and said she hopes her colleagues learned something from Lewis ’s appearance .
“ He got a lot of exposure to those in a position of making sure that the reforms we do embrace are real .
And his message was that unless everything is on an exchange and run through a clearinghouse , you ’re not fixing it , ” Speier said .
Lewis ’s first book , “ Liar ’s Poker , ” chronicled his experience as a bond trader and helped define Wall Street ’s 1980s culture of greed and excess .
“ The Big Short ” puts an exclamation point on that , and Democrats see in the narrative proof of the need for regulatory reform .
“ If you ’re wondering if there ’s importance or an urgency to this issue , read the book ‘ The Big Short ’ by Michael Lewis , and then , when you ’re finished reading , come back to the floor and say that you support this amendment , ” Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) urged his colleagues , arguing for his amendment to ban naked credit default swaps .
Reid used the book to make a point during a news conference after Republicans stalled voting on financial reform .
“ I ask the American people , is America better off to do nothing ?
The answer is , obviously , no .
Because they ’re out there today , trying to come up with material for Lewis to write another book .
They ’ve got ideas , ” Reid said .
“ Lots of people talked to him when he wrote ‘ The Big Short . ’
But there are some new stories developing as we speak , because they can do the same stuff as they were doing before .
Because there is no responsibility .
They ’re doing it on their own .
They ’re free to do whatever they want .
There ’s no transparency at all . ”
“ He ’s right , ” Lewis said of Reid ’s call to action .
“ They are coming up with new reasons for me to write another book .
I ’m making a little list of people I should make donations to . ”
While “ The Big Short ” has received positive reviews , some experts warn that there ’s a risk in trying to understand something as complex as the financial collapse through the prism of just one book .
“ If you only read that one book , you might form the impression that it was very specific things in housing or a system of incentives that encouraged people to misunderstand housing , ” said MIT professor and financial crisis chronicler Simon Johnson .
Johnson said he admires Lewis , but he cautioned that “ this is a repeated cycle , ” and the cause of the next bubble is likely to be something other than a dramatic drop in housing prices .
Lewis said he never wanted to be the go - to expert on the crisis .
“ When senators are reading your book , it reaffirms your faith in society , on the one hand , ” he said , “ and , on the other hand , it makes you nervous , because I do n’t think of myself as advising people who are actually going to change things . ”
A website in support of Canada 's proposed US - style copyright law looks to be a work of corporate astroturf , and signs point to the Canadian Record Industry Association ( mostly composed of US record labels ; many Canadian labels have left to form an independent lobby that opposes much of CRIA 's agenda ) as the entity behind it .
The group , Balanced Copyright for Canada , has bought headline placement on Bourque , and recently took down its member list after TVOntario reporter Jesse Brown announced that it appeared to consist of record execs from CRIA 's member - companies .
The site provides talking - points for its supporters to use when contacting media outlets over their coverage of the bill , which criminalizes breaking " digital locks " on the copyrighted works you buy , even if all you 're trying to do is lawfully enjoy your property .
Canadians came out in overwhelming numbers to oppose this approach in the Canadian government 's consultation on copyright ( over 6000 opposed , fewer than 50 in favour ) , but the Conservative government has ignored their own consultation and made a law that plays into the hands of the US media companies .
It 's really telling that the opposition to the Canadian DMCA has come from real grassroots : artist groups , citizen groups , technologists , educators , disabled - rights groups , archivists — people who do n't hide their funding or their affiliations behind false flags .
Meanwhile , the only support for this law has come from slick , fraudulent PR campaigns that shroud their origins in secrecy in order to disguise the fact that this is just the same four record labels running around in circles , wearing several hats , pretending to be a crowd .
The Copyright Lobby 's Astroturf Campaign in Support of C - 32
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Officials at the U.S. government 's lead agency for inspecting safety conditions at offshore oil platfoms took sport tickets , lunches , and other gifts from enegy companies and used government computers to look at pornography , according to reports Tuesday citing a probe by the Interior Department 's inspector general .
The report has not been made public by the inspector general but was described Tuesday in an email from U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times .
The report cited violations of federal regulations and agency ethics rules by members of the Minerals Management Service at the Lake Charles , La. , office .
The release came ahead of Salazar 's appearance at Congressional hearings this week , when he 's expected to lay out his plan to restructure the agency in reaction to the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that killed 11 workers and resulted in a still uncontrolled oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico .

I needed to extract all hyperlinks from an HTML document today , and I needed to remove all markup except for the simplest formatting : paragraphs , emphasis , and bold .
Any experienced Perl 5 programmer knows that multiple CPAN distributions exist for doing just this .
You can choose whether you want an XS wrapper around an existing C library , or a smattering of regular expressions , or a DIY HTML parser , or a simple wrapper around an HTML parser .
You can know that , but that does n't tell you how to do it .
I did my research and decided on HTML :: Scrubber to remove markup .
Its documentation suggests a strategy more complex than my current needs , so I eventually produced :
my $ scrubber = HTML :: Scrubber -> new ( allow => [ qw ( p br i u strong em hr ) ] , ) ; my $ scrubbed = $ scrubber -> scrub ( $ content ) ;
For extracting hyperlinks , I used HTML :: LinkExtor and wrote :
sub get_links { my ( $ self , $ content ) = @_ ; my $ p = HTML :: LinkExtor -> new ( ) ; $ p -> parse ( $ content ) ; my @links ; for my $ link ( $ p - > links ( ) ) { my ( $ tag , %a ) = @$link ; next unless $ tag eq ' a ' && $ a{href} && $ a{href} =~ / ^http :/ ; push @links , $ a{href} ; } return \@links ; }
I do n't mind doing the research and customizing snippets like these for my specific needs , but I can imagine countless other people needing examples like this .
If I were n't already convinced that the world needs a new resource for copy and paste examples in Modern Perl , I would be .
( If you 're still not convinced , consider how much more easily a novice could find these examples than writing a correct and comprehensive regular expression for either case . )
As the state 's chief lawyer , Goddard would be expected to take the lead in defending Arizona against ....
The governor 's abrupt action against Terry Goddard , her likely Democratic opponent in this fall 's gubernatorial election , came after months of disputes between the two and at the end of a long day of legal maneuvering in both Arizona and the nation 's capital .
Late Friday night as the Memorial Day weekend began , Arizona 's Republican Gov. Jan Brewer , in effect , suspended the state 's Democratic attorney general from defending the new law in upcoming legal challenges .
The measure , known as S.B. 1070 , is due to take effect this summer and , among other things , allows local police under federal guidelines to check the immigration status of people they stop .
( For a full list of background stories , see Related Items below . )
A sudden new twist in the ongoing rhetorical and legal struggle over Arizona 's tough new law to round up illegal immigrants .
... challenges to the Legislature 's action , which erupted after years of state frustration with the federal government 's inability to secure the state border with Mexico against illegal immigrants , drugs and criminals .
However , Goddard has vocally opposed the measure , so much so that the Legislature gave the governor advance authority to hire outside legal counsel .
On Friday , Goddard met with the Obama administration 's Atty .
Gen. Eric Holder in Washington , then held a news conference just hours before Brewer 's handpicked attorneys were to meet with Holder , an outspoken critic of the law .
Brewer said , " I believe the federal government should use its legal resources to fight illegal immigration , not the State of Arizona . "
Seeing apparent collusion between the two Democrat lawyers , Brewer pulled the plug Friday night .
Her statement ( full text below ) said :
Due to Attorney General Goddard ’s curious coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice today and his consistent opposition to Arizona ’s new immigration laws , I will direct my legal team to defend me and the State of Arizona rather than the Attorney General in the lawsuits challenging Arizona ’s immigration laws .
Despite widespread criticism in the media and the Obama administration , whose officials including Holder admitted they had not actually read the legislation , numerous polls have shown deep support for the measure nationally and within Arizona .
And that approval has transferred over to Brewer , who was trailing Goddard early this year in polls of a hypothetical matchup come Nov. 2 .
Brewer inherited the governor 's office last year when Janet Napolitano resigned to accept the man-caused nomination of Homeland Security secretary from President Obama .
Brewer has sought to meet with the now - vacationing Obama during a trip to Washington next week .
But the Democrat has been unable to fit the Republican governor and the border issue into his impossible schedule .

Full text of Statement by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer
Today the legal team I have appointed to defend the State of Arizona in the legal challenges to Arizona ’s new immigration laws met with senior officials from the United States Department of Justice .
The meeting was held at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice .
The Department attorneys were advised that I believe the federal government should use its legal resources to fight illegal immigration , not the State of Arizona .
They were further advised that on behalf of the State of Arizona , I will ensure the immigration laws we passed are vigorously defended all the way to the United States Supreme Court if necessary .
For some inexplicable reason , the Department of Justice officials met with the Arizona Attorney General hours before meeting with the State of Arizona ’s legal team , and then allowed the Attorney General to hold a press conference to discuss the meeting .
This level of coordination between the Attorney General and the Obama Administration is disturbingly similar to the coordination with Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords earlier this week on President Obama ’s still unclear plan to deploy up to 1,200 National Guard troops to the border .
Due to the Attorney General ’s opposition to Arizona ’s immigration laws as set forth in S.B. 1070 , the Legislature required Attorney General Goddard to act at the direction of the Governor in any challenge to S.B. 1070 as amended by H.B. 2162 .
The Legislature also gave the Governor authority to hire outside counsel if necessary to defend the law on behalf of the State instead of using the Attorney General .
The Legislature gave me this authority because of its lack of confidence in the Attorney General ’s willingness to vigorously defend this legislation that is so critical to protecting the safety and welfare of Arizona ’s citizens .
Last year , I instructed the Attorney General to change his position on behalf of the State of Arizona in the Horne v. Flores case involving a challenge to the Arizona ’s English language learner laws .
He refused and the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately rejected his position .
Due to Attorney General Goddard ’s curious coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice today and his consistent opposition to Arizona ’s new immigration laws , I will direct my legal team to defend me and the State of Arizona rather than the Attorney General in the lawsuits challenging Arizona ’s immigration laws .

Facebook has launched an effort to engage people in the election Social networking website Facebook is to help get unregistered voters to register before the 20 April deadline .
In a tie - up with the Electoral Commission , Facebook users who visit the site over the weekend will be asked if they have registered to vote .
If they say " No " they will be sent to a page linked to the Electoral Commission that lets them enter details online .
They then have to print out this page and post it to their local council 's electoral registration office .
The address for this is automatically created on the page once someone has entered their own location details .
The Electoral Commission says applications have to be sent by post , and not simply via e-mail , because of a legal requirement to prevent electoral fraud .
Youth focus The Electoral Commission estimates 3.5 million people who were eligible to vote in England and Wales in 2001 were not registered .
Turnout has fallen in recent general elections A change in the law following the 2005 general election means that the registration period has now been extended until 11 working days before polling day , which this time around is on 6 May .
In 2005 the rules meant that voter lists , based on the electoral roll , were closed by the time the election was actually called .
Electoral Commission spokesman Clinton Proud said the Facebook exercise was part of the organisation 's remit to expand access to the democratic process .
" If you 're not registered , you can't vote - it 's very simple .
By downloading and printing a form through Facebook , users can now make sure that they are able to have their say on election day , " he said .
" Many people assume they are automatically on the electoral register if they pay council tax or if they have voted before .
This is not the case .
And if you have moved house , even within the same borough , you need to re-register with your new address . "
Richard Allan , director of policy at Facebook , said many of the site 's users were traditionally excluded from politics .
" One of the strengths we have is to try and capture that group , particularly the 18 - 24 year - old voters , who have often not turned out to vote , and use the fact that many of the things on Facebook are familiar to them to get them engaged . "
Potential voters can also find out how to register online by visiting the Electoral Commission 's registration website , www.aboutmyvote.co.uk.

So while gathering together my collection of gifts to MY giftee yesterday , I had to explain to my mom a ) what reddit is , b ) what Arbitrary Day is , and c ) how many people are involved in it .
Understandably , being a cool gal herself , she got why it was so cool and shocked me into realizing that I 'm going to receive something too .
When you 're so focused on the perfect gift for your giftee , it 's easy to forget that someone else is doing the same for you !
Anyway , I was about to head out the door when I hear from downstairs :
" Arzim !
ARZIM !
The mail 's here , and there 's a PACKAGE !! "
Of course immediately I leap down the stairs ( no ninja skills here ; it is a daily struggle to NOT fall down them ) and meet her in the kitchen where she 's holding my package ( WOO ! ) delicately between her little hands .
" Open it !
Hurry ! "
So lo and behold , my lovely Arbiter has gifted me some coffee ( which OMG it 's on my bedside table as we speak and I know it 's nearly midnight but I AM .
SO .
TEMPTED . -- it smells SO GOOD . ) as well as THE LOG FROM THE SEA OF CORTEZ by Steinbeck , which I am super excited about .
Despite working in a bookstore and being an English major ( and a bookish geek all - around ) I 've never actually read Steinbeck and this one looks to combine writing and biology , two of my great loves .
So I 'm absolutely psyched !
Ca n't wait to get home from work tomorrow , brew me up a cup of delicious Fair Trade Equal Exchange coffee and sit down to crack the spine of this book .
Thank you Arbiter !
Please reveal yourself so I can send a present back . :)
P.S. :
The text of the letter :
" Hello from Reddit !
After checking your comment history I saw you worked in a bookstore so I hope you have n't already read this .
In addition , I added a pound of super good coffee ( ground already in case you do n't have a grinder ) to keep you up for long reads .

Zimbabwe 197 for 3 ( Taylor 74 , Masakadza 66 ) beat India 194 for 9 ( Jadeja 51 , Lamb 3 - 45 ) by seven wickets
Scorecard and ball - by - ball details
How they were out
Tatenda Taibu stumps M Vijay off Greg Lamb DESMOND KWANDE / © AFP
Just to prove that their first win over India was n't an upset , Zimbabwe won even more convincingly - with a bonus point this time , making their qualification for the final a distinct possibility .
A combination of disciplined bowling and fielding , and directionless batting from India , meant Zimbabwe were chasing an ordinary total .
Just to show the pitch had no demons that could justify a total of 194 , Brendan Taylor and Hamilton Masakadza punished the bowlers , adding 128 runs in 26.3 overs .
The pitch was n't exceptionally slow nor did it have much movement .
Even without a specialist new - ball bowler , Zimbabwe choked India 's scoring , and kept getting regular wickets .
India did n't help themselves with a 1980s - style opening that was lacking in intent , followed by the quick departure of the openers , and then the run-outs of two of their mainstays , Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina .
Zimbabwe 's attack might be built on four spinners and a military - medium bowler , but they were as aggressive as fast bowlers - in intent , in field placings and in body language .
Greg Lamb , who bowled a fine mixture of offbreaks and floaters that went straight on , was the pick of the bowlers with the wickets of the openers in back - to - back overs after they had consumed almost 19 overs for 63 runs .
There were 182 dot balls in the innings , and just 12 boundaries - that too thanks to some late hitting from Ravindra Jadeja , who escaped two plumb lbws before going on to score 51 .
It was a strange ceasefire at the top of the innings : India kept waiting for poor deliveries , Zimbabwe for loose shots .
Andy Blignaut and Ray Price , the opening bowlers , gave no free scoring opportunities but Dinesh Karthik and M Vijay sought no adventure .
Only 26 runs came in the first 10 overs , five of them in wides , as the bowlers consciously tried to cut out shots through the off side and ended up bowling down the leg side .
Both batsmen had put themselves under pressure with that slow start , making it imperative to not get out after wasting so many overs .
And get out they did , following each other to the pavilion .
If Karthik got too adventurous with a reverse - sweep , Vijay charged at Lamb and fell to a floater that went straight as opposed to breaking in .
While it was smart bowling , it could also be argued that Lamb had been bowling straighter ones throughout his spell , and it was n't as big a variation as the sight of Vijay swinging way inside its line suggested .
Zimbabwe were not going to let India 's middle order play the game of four singles an over followed by a late assault .
In as late as the 23th over , they had six men inside the circle , and the slip hardly ever moved out .
Virat Kohli soon fell to a straighter one from Prosper Utseya .
Raina , an over after a misunderstanding with Rohit , went for a single that was n't there , and paid the price .
Soon Rohit went for a tight single but Jadeja lacked the urgency , sending him back straight to the pavilion .
Fifty - eight for 0 after 16 overs was good enough for Zimbabwe , 95 for 5 was a dream .
Jadeja got favours from umpires at either end even before he was set , but Yusuf Pathan was n't so lucky .
And despite a 35 - run batting Powerplay , India had hardly given their bowlers anything to defend .
And the bowlers again failed to impress .
Despite a slow start , thanks to the move of opening with Pragyan Ojha , Zimbabwe raced to 76 by the end of 15 overs .
Once again it was Taylor who started the assault .
After four quiet overs , he punched Ashok Dinda on the up , square of the wicket , and suddenly it seemed strokeplay was not that difficult at all .
Masakadza followed lead , charging at Ojha and lofting him over mid-on .
In the next two overs , Dinda and Umesh Yadav tried to intimidate Taylor , and were pulled for a four and a six .
There was time for a stylish extra -cover drive too , and Masakadza got his own back at Amit Mishra by welcoming him with two fours in his first over .
In the previous match , Mishra had done the batsmen in with a googly .
And as soon as the fielding restrictions were lifted , India inexplicably spread the field .
Wisdom , conventional or otherwise , would suggest an attacking approach .
By the time India realised they needed to attack , Taylor had reached his fifty , Zimbabwe had crossed 100 , and India 's first set of consecutive losses to Zimbabwe was all but sealed .
In the second match of the tournament , when India were on their way to chasing Sri Lanka 's target , Virat Kohli and Rohit gestured to the dressing room , wanting to take the Powerplay .
They were not allowed to .
Zimbabwe , though , showed much more clarity of thought , imposing the field restrictions in the 31st over , and finished the game off with 11.4 overs to spare .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The U.S. and its military allies agree on many things , from the size of bullets for their rifles to the design of future fighter jets .
But on the issue of gays in the military , the United States stands alone among its Western allies .
Representatives from Great Britain , Canada , Australia , Israel and the Netherlands gathered Wednesday at the Brookings Institution , a think tank in Washington , to describe how the militaries in those countries handled allowing homosexuals to serve openly .
The consensus was that , in spite of concerns before the change , it became a nonissue once gays and lesbians were allowed to serve .
" I did not see one case at any level when homosexuals did not get along with other soldiers .
The problems are among men and women , " said Maj .
Gen. Walter Semianiw , an infantry officer in the Canadian military .
" This is not an issue for our country . "
" We know the U.S. as a country that favors the individual rights , freedom , giving the people the opportunity to flourish in their life , " said Col. Kees Matthijssen of the Royal Dutch Army .
" From that perspective it 's still very strange the U.S. is still having a kind of ban on openly having gays and lesbians in the military . "
" There were concerns in the late '90s of gay men walking across the gangplank in feather boas and high heels , " said retired Lt. Cmdr. Craig Jones of the British Royal Navy .
" That just did not happen . "
Jones said British military officials saw an unexpected benefit of allowing gays to serve openly -- better retention of qualified soldiers and sailors in key positions .
In the late 1990s and early 2000s , the British military had a 6 percent to 8 percent gap in unfilled positions .
Now it 's down to the 2 percent to 3 percent range .
Jones said one reason for that is the new policy allowing gays to serve .
Now that gays are able to serve , military recruiters in the United Kingdom have more volunteers to choose from , Jones said .
Also , having children is often cited by British troops as one reason why they leave the military in their late 20s or 30s .
Jones said because gays and lesbians are less likely to become parents , they tend to stay in the military longer .
During a recent congressional hearing on the U.S. military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell , " policy , retired NATO Commander Gen .
John Sheehan testified that he believed the Dutch military 's policy of allowing gays to serve was in part to blame for the Dutch military 's failure to halt the massacre of Muslims in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995 .
Sheehan later backtracked on his testimony , but Matthijssen of the Dutch army addressed the comments .
" I was in Srebrenica myself , I was a company commander , I was there .
I had a full professional company , " Matthijssen said .
" The homosexual , sexuality that he suggested would have affected that unit , that is absolutely not the case . "
Matthijssen said , " There was good cohesion within the unit , the unit was effective .
But the unit was put in a place -- based on political decisions within the U.N. , within the international community -- with too [ few ] troops , too few means , not the mandate to really fight and overwhelm ...
That 's what really happened . "
Matthijssen said allowing gays to serve openly has made the Royal Dutch Army better .
" We 're much more effective because we have an organizational culture and climate that people know that they can tell about who they are , and that 's what we encourage , " he said .
A recent decision by the Family Court of Australia suggests that it is out of touch with general community standards and reveals that the law needs further amendments .
A father who was charged and convicted of downloading child pornography has been granted weekend overnight access to his two young daughters .
He was previously found guilty in a criminal court of downloading internet material that by its nature is produced from the actual abuse of children .
Furthermore , he was found guilty of “ reproducing ” child exploitation material .
The judge ordered that during the weekend overnight contact , he must have a friend present in the house and that the children ’s bedroom door needs to be locked at night .
In the comments section to the news article about this decision , comment number 69 asks , “ What is it about the Family Court that keeps doing this ?
This is NOT the first time it has happened .
Why is the court giving sex offenders access to children ? ”

One answer may be because there has been a long - standing vociferous accusation against the Family Court by campaigners of fathers ’ rights that there is a “ bias ” against fathers .
Indeed , one of these father ’s rights groups has defended the decision .
In an interesting and novel approach , the Chief Justice of the Family Court has taken steps to publically post statistics on the rates that Shared Parenting orders have been made .
Making the rate of custody decisions between mothers and fathers public could be viewed as an effort by the Family Court to address this perceived “ bias ” against fathers .
But is this an appropriate reaction to these accusations ?
I believe it is not because the Family Court in reality does not have a bias against “ fathers ” .
Father ’s rights campaigners also claim that allegations are raised by women in the Family Court simply because they want to deny separated fathers access to their children .
They allege that women routinely make “ false allegations ” of domestic violence , that accusations of child abuse are in “ epidemic ” proportions , and that women are just as violent as men .
They assert that when children disclose sexual abuse against fathers , it is because mothers have coached them to do so and these mothers do this because they have a mental disorder .
The Family Court is accused of being “ anti- father ” when child abuse and domestic violence allegations are taken seriously and the men ’s rights activists stress that this victimises “ innocent ” fathers by the Family Court through accusations by “ malicious mothers ” .
The evidence just does not support their contentions .
One indicator that their contentions are not true and that the Family Court does not have a bias against “ fathers ” is revealed by the simple fact that despite the use of the word “ fathers ” by the fathers ’ rights campaigners , most separated fathers in Australia do not end in the Family Court .
Their repeated use of the plural word “ fathers ” gives the false impression that they represent a great number of separated fathers in Australia .
However , the Family Court statistics indicate that the number of cases that proceed to trial is about 5 - 6 per cent of the cases that actually present to the Family Court .
That means that of all the couples that separate in Australia , 95 - 96 per cent do not end up in the Family Court .
That also means that the accusations that the Family Court is biased against “ fathers ” in general cannot be accurate , especially when the claim is couched in terms that give the impression that the problem of fatherlessness in Australia is due to the Family Court .
Moreover , the research into the types of cases that end up in Family Court litigation indicate that the Family Court ’s time is mostly consumed up by cases where child abuse is an issue in contention .
In fact , child abuse has become a “ core ” element of the load of the Family Court and the Family Court had become a significant part of the child protection system .
Professor Brown went on to research these child abuse cases and concluded these cases included child abuse that was “ real , that it was severe and serious ” .

When confronted by this type of empirical evidence , father ’s rights campaigners claim that the academics who produce these findings lack “ impartiality ” .
Barry Williams from the Lone Fathers Association has stated that “ official statistics on family violence ... used by the Family Court , academia , law societies and other professional bodies , are incorrect ” .
So do father ’s rights campaigners ’ claims tally up with the evidence ?
Apparently not .
Dr Michael Flood is a leading expert who concludes that :
I know I 'm going to be in the vast minority when I say this ... but to me , this is somewhat disappointing .
When I heard " Ni no Kuni : PS3 " I got really really really really excited .
Being under the impression that it would be similar to the DS set up , " alright " I thought , " hand drawn 2D Ghibli backgrounds in glorious 1080 p " ... but that is obviously not what this game looks to be .
Call it heresy , but to me , the PS3 version looks more " Tales of Vesperia 2 " than it does " Ghibli . "
I know we 'll get fully animated Ghibli interstitials sprinkled throughout the game , but I was really hoping that on PS3 it would retain the " polygon characters over gorgeous Ghibli backgrounds " .... but this time all those Ghibli backgrounds would be in full HD .
Call it a personal preference , but I find that hand drawn art , especially by Ghibli , to be much much more aesthetically pleasing than the 3D look this game is going for .
When I recently wrote about my first impressions of Kaminsky ’s Interpolique , I mentioned that the only thing I did n’t like is that PHP does n’t offer any way to protect against syntactic mistakes , such as where the programmer mistakenly uses a $ instead of a ^^ .
Today we ’ll look at how Interpolique can be implemented in Haskell in such a way that we force the developer to use Interpolique when creating a SQL query , precluding the possibility of the $ / ^^ mixup bug .
In doing so we ’ll see that we do n’t need anything like PHP ’s eval to get the job done .
All of the code for this post is on github : InterpoliqueQQ .
Since version 6.10 of the Glorious Haskell Compiler , we have had the ability to essentially define new language syntax .
This functionality — called quasi-quotation — is useful for embedding mini-languages into Haskell in a type - safe way .
Since Interpolique is basically a mini-language ( it ’s only operator is the ^^ interpolator ) , it is natural to use quasi-quotation when implementing Interpolique in Haskell .
Let ’s look at an example of what this looks like when it ’s being used .
On the Interpolique site , an example of an attempted SQL injection is given .
The crux of the example is the following code :
$ conn -> query ( eval ( b( ' insert into posts values ( ^^_POST [ author ] , ^^_ POST [ content ] ) ; ' ) ) ) ;
In InterpoliqueQQ ( see Test.hs in the InterpoliqueQQ code ) , the same code can be written as
query = [ $ interpolique| insert into posts values ( ^^author , ^^content ) ; |]
If we hop into interactive - mode with GHC , we can see the value of query :
* Test > query InterpoliquedString " insert into posts values ( b64d ( \" Zm9v\ " ) , b64d ( \" JyBvciAxPTE7 \ " ) ) ; "
Thus the run-time value of query is , in fact , an Interpolique ’d SQL query .
Why this is interesting
The important feature of InterpoliqueQQ is that this syntax offers protection in the form of static typing .
If we inspect the type of query we get
* Test > :t query query :: InterpoliqueQQ.InterpoliquedString
That is , this syntax creates a query whose type is Interpoliqued String .
In this implementation of Interpolique , the only way to obtain an instance of Interpoliqued String is via this syntax .
In other words , if a function is given a query of type Interpoliqued String , it can be completely cetain that the query was generated using Interpolique .
Since this syntax does not allow PHP - style string interpolation ( that is , there is no analogue of ' insert into posts values ( $ author , $ content ) ) , there is no way for a developer to introduce a SQL injection bug due to a misused interpolation operator .
( We can also note that InterpoliqueQQ does not use anything similar to PHP ’s eval , thereby rendering any objection to the presence of eval moot . )
The implementation
InterpoliqueQQ is implemented in Haskell in less than 75 lines of code , relying on the powerful parsec parser combinator library , GHC ’s quasi-quotation support , and the base64 encoder of the dataenc library .
This implementation is entirely proof - of - concept .
In particular , it ’s missing two things :
Field - testing .
Interpolique has n’t ( yet ) been out long enough for peer review to have run its course , so certainly nothing can be said about whether or not this particular implementation is secure .
Library support .
This implementation is built on the Interpoliqued String type .
In order for this to be useful , there needs to be a SQL library which is ready to act on this type .
For the time being , I ’ve included the runQuery function in InterpoliqueQQ which just takes an InterpoliquedString and prints ( to stdout ) the corresponding SQL code , as in
* Test > runQuery query insert into posts values ( b64d ( " Zm9v " ) , b64d ( " JyBvciAxPTE7 " ) ) ;
At present time Haskell is a decidedly non-standard language to use for web development .
Examples like this , however , suggest that it could be a powerful tool in this domain in the future .

We 'd not - so - secretly hoped that carriers would be looking to dispense with those troublesome 5GB caps on so - called " unlimited " 3G data plans , but there 's a big problem with that : spectrum is still limited , and even though 4G technologies help use it more efficiently , it 's still a constraint that the FCC is going to need many years to solve .
We 're not sure how much the spectrum crunch really factors in here , but in addition to his comments on Droid Incredible inventory problems , Verizon Wireless boss Lowell McAdam mentioned at a Barclays Capital conference this week that he hopes to move away from unlimited plans altogether for the company 's LTE network , instead charging for " buckets " of megabytes , just like in the olden days -- despite the fact that it 'll cost it a half to a third of what it costs today to transmit the same amount of data .
On a happier note , McAdam said that the company expects to be using its LTE network for voice by 2012 , which comes just after its first volley of LTE - capable handsets in early 2011 .
He also mentioned that at least some of those devices will be shown off at CES 2011 , and naturally , we 'll be there -- not just to check out the phones , but to raise some hell at the notion that unlimited data is a thing of the past .
At this rate , how are we ever going to run the Engadget servers on a wireless connection ?

Richard Russell , the famous writer of the Dow Theory Letters , has a chilling line in today 's note :
Do your friends a favor .
Tell them to " batten down the hatches " because there 's a HARD RAIN coming .
Tell them to get out of debt and sell anything they can sell ( and do n't need ) in order to get liquid .
Tell them that Richard Russell says that by the end of this year they wo n't recognize the country .
They 'll retort , " How the dickens does Russell know -- who told him ? "
Tell them the stock market told him .
That 's pretty intense !
Update :
By popular demand , here 's more on what he sees in the market .
The gist is that the markets recent gyrations are telling him that the economy is in trouble :
And I ask myself , " Am I seeing things ?
The April 26 high for the Dow
was 11205.03 .
The Dow is selling as write at 10557 down 648 points
from its April high .
If business is even better than expected , then
why is the Dow down over 600 points ?
And why , if there were 674 new
highs on the NYSE on April 26 , were there only 20 new highs on Friday ,
May 14 ?
And if my PTI was 6133 on April 26 , why is it down 17 points
since its April high ?
The fact is that I 've been seeing deterioration in the stock market
ever since early - April , and this in the face of improving business
news .
The D - J Industrial Average is composed of 30 internationally
known top-quality blue - chip stocks .
These are 30 of " America 's biggest
companies . "
If Barron 's is so bullish on the future of America's
biggest companies , then why is n't the Dow advancing to new highs ?
Clearly something is wrong .
But what could it be ?
Much as I love
Barron's , I trust the stock market more .
If I read the stock market
correctly , it 's telling me that there is a surprise ahead .
And that
surprise will be a reversal to the downside for the economy , plus a
collection of other troubles ahead .
About Dow Theory --
First , we saw the recent April highs in the
Averages .
Then we saw a plunge in both Averages to their May 7 lows --
Industrials to 10380.43 , Transports to 4298.12 , next a short rally .
If
ahead , the two Averages turn down and violate their May 7 lows , that
would be the clincher .
Such action would signal the certain resumption
of the primary bear market .
Just as for years I asked , cajoled , insisted , threatened , demanded ,
that my subscribers buy gold , I am now insisting , demanding , begging
my subscribers to get OUT of stocks ( including C and BYD , but not
including golds ) and get into cash or gold ( bullion if possible ) .
If
the two Averages violate their May 7 lows , I see a major crash as the
outcome .
Pul - leeze , get out of stocks now , and I do n't give a damn
whether you have paper losses or paper profits !

Markos Moulitsas on ABC's This Week w / Jake Tapper :
TAPPER : Markos , I just want to give you one more last chance to weigh in .
You 've been suspiciously quiet on this roundtable so far .
When the American people see what 's going on in the Gulf and they see that it 's not being solved , and they hold the president in charge -- the current president .
MOULITSAS : I would say that that 's absolutely true , and I think the reason that sort of , Obama is slipping I think like I said is that they 're afraid that yet another corporation is going to take advantage of lax regulation , it 's going to take advantage of a pro-business climate and basically get away with -- maybe not murder .
This is not Katrina . --
But with the defiling and the destruction of the economies and the beauty and the coastline of multiple U.S. states .
And that 's the fear , because they 've seen it in Wall Street .
They saw Wall Street get away with it , and now they 're afraid that BP is going to get away with it .
Because certain companies are too big to be held accountable , and that 's the problem , that 's what people fear .
I do n't think they want a temper - tantrum from the president .
They want accountability and right now , we have n't seen that yet .

This left a total of 68 respondents who were eligible to continue .
Fifty - nine believed their diagnosis , three did not , and five didn\u2019t know .
The sample included 48 women and 20 men , with an average age of 35.3 ( range : 18-72 \u2013 see Table 2 ) .
Table 2 : Age Frequencies
When asked , all but one respondent wrote the names of up to six medications they had ever taken for their mood disorder .
Only six of the 68 respondents had never stopped taking any medication for at least two weeks .
The rest , 60 respondents , marked that they had stopped at least one medication at least one time ( Table 3 ) .
Of those who never discontinued any medication , the average number of inputted
medications was 3.16 .
Of those who had ever discontinued at least one medication , the average
number of medication names given was 4.52 .
This leads to interesting questions of causation .
It
is common for people with bipolar disorder to have to experiment with many medications to find
a regimen that works , so it \u2019s possible that those who had never stopped taking any medication
were simply more successful upon their initial medication attempt .
Three participants remarked that they did not believe their diagnosis , five said that they
did not know or did not wish to answer , and the remaining 59 answered that they believed their
diagnosis .
There were no significant associations between discontinuation and belief in the
diagnosis , probably due to the low statistical power .
The final number of eligible respondents , those who had ever discontinued taking
medications and who continued with the survey , was 61 , or 67.0 % of all those who logged in .

Mind you , Atlantis had just started its pitch maneuver , designed to show its belly to the crew on the ISS so they can inspect it for heat tile damage .
That means this image was taken shortly before the Orbiter docked with the station , on May 16th .
Thierry was in Madrid specifically to get this shot .
Un frakkin ' believable .
Get a good look .
This is the last mission of Atlantis ( unless it 's needed as a rescue mission later this year ) , so we wo n't get too many more views like this .

Yesterday there was a firestorm of discussion over Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore 's speech ( which was promoted by his department in advance ) in which he labeled critics of Bill C - 32 " radical extremists " and urged confrontation against those who argue for fair copyright , which he said is really an attempt to mislead and oppose the bill .
In response there were hundreds of postings on Twitter ( including a debate between Moore and Cory Doctorow ) along with :
an NDP release from MP Charlie Angus saying Moore was way out of line
a must - read CBC article titled Copyright Debate Turns Ugly
a terrific article by Doctorow providing an author 's perspective on " radical extremism " and copyright
an article by Blayne Haggart that provides some context on the smears
Almost lost amidst the considerable outrage from many people over Moore 's comments , was the possibility that there was an attempt to bury the " radical extremist " comment .
The initial video posted by event organizers ( the Chamber of Commerce 's IP Council ) did not include a clip of the reference to radical extremists .
Sun Media ran a story that included the quote but others seemed to act as if it never happened .
After I blogged about the comment , the Entertainment Software Association of Canada tweeted a reference to " @mpjamesmoore 's actual remarks " as if the remarks did not include the reference .
The next morning , Barry Sookman blogged on the speech and characterized my post on " radical extremists " as relying upon a second hand source .
While that is true – I relied on Sun Media – both the ESA Canada and Sookman were in the room for the speech and surely heard the comment .
More noteworthy is that Moore himself denied making the comment in direct messages with several people on Twitter who expressed concern about it .
For example , he sent this to one correspondent
and this to another
By mid-morning yesterday , attendees were not confirming the comment , Moore was denying it , and the event video did not include it .
That might have been the end of the story , but IT World Canada reporter Brian Jackson compiled his own video of the event and posted it online .
The Jackson video included the reference and made it clear that Moore was not being forthright in his private claims ( the event organizer site later added the same video ) .
The lack of candor is rather rich given that Moore 's comments tried to paint critics of the bill as misleading the public .
Prison reformers today welcomed what appeared to be a major shift in the approach to penal policy outlined by the new justice secretary , Ken Clarke , over the weekend .
The lord chancellor questioned why the prison population – at 85,000 – was nearly double what it was when he was home secretary in the early 1990s .
Clarke confirmed that he is looking for cuts in the £ 2.2 bn prison budget and seemed to indicate that he did not regard short prison sentences as effective in cutting reoffending rates .
He acknowledged that members of the public were still " very , very worried about lawlessness " but said that their " fear of crime " is probably out of proportion to what they actually face .
" It 's not to be soft on sentencing , it 's to be sensible on sentencing , and bear in mind everybody who is sent to prison costs more than it costs to send a boy to Eton .
So , all right , I 'm all in favour of spending it when it 's effective and justified , and that we will do .
And we 're looking at sentencing , not starting just from let 's have more people in prison , let 's have fewer people in prison … but what actually works , because the public are still very , very worried about lawlessness , " the justice secretary said in a Sky News interview yesterday .
" What I 'm looking at is , in this case , sentencing .
Our first duty is to protect the public – there are some very dangerous and nasty people that need to be in prison , " said Clarke .
" But why is the prison population twice what it was when I was the home secretary not so very long ago ? "
The Conservatives went into the election pledging to match Labour 's plans to build sufficient prisons to house 96,000 by 2014 .
The Liberal Democrats had a pledge to halt the prison building programme and urge the courts to use community punishments instead of short prison sentences .
The coalition agreement split the difference by agreeing to take a fundamental look at sentencing policy , which the justice secretary outlined yesterday .
Clarke confirmed that he had to look for cuts in the justice ministry budget but he was to keen to take a more fundamental look than simply " salami slicing " budgets and saving a " bit of money here , and a bit of money there " .
The move was welcomed by prison reformers .
Jon Collins of the Criminal Justice Alliance said his comments were a welcome step forward : " At long last a politician is facing up to the unsustainable cost of our prison system .
We simply cannot afford to keep building endless new prisons as more and more people are sent to prison at huge cost to the taxpayer , " said Collins .
" Since Ken Clarke was last in charge of the justice system , the prison population has nearly doubled , warehousing thousands of people who could be dealt with more cheaply and more effectively in the community .
Ken Clarke is right , keeping more of these people out of custody would save money and free up space and resources in the prison system to better rehabilitate those people who do need to be there . "
But Conservative rightwingers disagreed : " It 's very sad that somebody of Ken Clarke 's calibre is talking such drivel .
This is a ridiculous false economy – it saves money to have the most persistent criminals in prison , " said Conservative MP Philip Davies .
" If short sentences do not work , the argument should be for longer sentences , not putting them out on the streets to terrorise communities . "
The prison population stood at fewer than 45,000 when Clarke was home secretary in 1992 - 3 .
Darrell Issa has plans .
If the GOP should win control of Congress , he will be the Chairman of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , with subpoena power .
Rep. Darrell Issa , the conservative firebrand whose specialty is lobbing corruption allegations at the Obama White House , is making plans to hire dozens of subpoena - wielding investigators if Republicans win the House this fall .
The California Republican ’s daily denunciations draw cheers from partisans and bookings from cable TV producers .
He even bought his own earphone for live shots .
But his bombastic style and attention - seeking investigations draw eye rolls from other quarters .
Now , he ’s making clear he wo n’t be so easy to shrug off if he becomes chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in 2011 .
Issa has told Republican leadership that if he becomes chairman , he wants to roughly double his staff from 40 to between 70 and 80 .
And he is not subtle about what that means for President Barack Obama .
At a recent speech to Pennsylvania Republicans here , he boasted about what would happen if the GOP wins 39 seats , and he gets the power to subpoena .
“ That will make all the difference in the world , ” he told 400 applauding party members during a dinner at the chocolate - themed Hershey Lodge . “ I wo n’t use it to have corporate America live in fear that we ’re going to subpoena everything .
I will use it to get the very information that today the White House is either shredding or not producing . ”
In other words , Issa wants to be to the Obama administration what Rep. Dan Burton ( R - Ind. ) was to the Clinton administration — a subpoena machine in search of White House scandals … [ emphasis added ]
Inserted from < Politico.com >
I ’m not opposed to responsible investigation of this or any White House .
I am opposed to an ongoing witch hunt of the type that the GOP committed in their attempt to discredit Clinton .
The key to an effective committee is limiting investigations to areas where there is an actual cause , not just a political cause .
During the years when the GOP controlled the House during the Clinton Administration and the Bush Regime , Republicans proved over and over again that they cannot be trusted with this power .
I know that many of my progressive brethren would rather waste their vote in protest on a third party candidate than vote for a Democrat that fails to take progressive stands on every issue .
I say that , in the general election , even the worst DINOs are better choices than independents with no chance of winning , because because voting for the latter will help elect Republicans .
That Issa bad idea !
Radical prison reforms to " shut the revolving door of crime and reoffending " have been outlined by Justice Secretary Ken Clarke .
Criticising the growth of the prison population in England and Wales , he said there must be other penalties .
The new measures will involve paying private firms and voluntary groups according to how many prisoners they rehabilitate .
He said locking people up for the sake of it was a waste of public funds .
David Cameron defended the plans during prime minister 's questions and said it was now time for " radical reform " of the prison service .
But former Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard has told Radio 4's PM programme he was " not convinced " by Mr Clarke 's suggestion that fewer criminals should be sent to prison .
' Victorian England '
In his first major speech since taking office , Mr Clarke said prison had too often proved " a costly and ineffectual approach that fails to turn criminals into law - abiding citizens " .
Speaking in London he said : " More than half of the crime in this country is committed by people who have been through the system .
We must now take action and shut off this revolving door of crime and reoffending .
If ever there was part of our public services that needed radical reform to make sure prison does work , then now that 's it Ken Clarke , Justice Secretary
How prison policy has been shaped
" We need a more constructive approach that tackles this head - on .
An intelligent and transparent approach to sentencing that targets the causes of reoffending , so making our communities safer and better places to live .
We describe it as a rehabilitation revolution . "
Mr Howard , who was home secretary from 1993 to 1997 , said he stood by his " prisons work " speech given to the 1993 Conservative Party conference .
Stressing that he was expressing his personal opinion , he said : " I 've read [ Mr Clarke 's ] speech .
" I 'm not convinced by it .
" I think in order to protect the public , serious and persistent criminals need to be put in prison .
" I think that is what conscientious judges and magistrates are doing at present and I think that is the best way of protecting the public . "
The prime minister said the prison service was " not working properly " at the moment .
He said : " When you 've got these reoffending rates , when you 've got the cost of each prison place , when you 've got the appalling problem of drugs in prisons , we have got to reform . "
He added : " If ever there was part of our public services that needed radical reform to make sure prison does work , then now that 's it . "
In May the prison population in England and Wales reached a record high of 85,201 .
That is almost twice the figure in 1992 , when Mr Clarke was last in charge of prisons as home secretary .
It was an increase he said he would have dismissed as " impossible and ridiculous " if someone had predicted it at the time .
Earlier , speaking on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme , Mr Clarke said a sentencing review based on punishment and protecting the public was needed .
Criticising the increase of the prison population under Labour , he added : " [ Former Home Secretaries ] David Blunkett and John Reid had a chequebook in one hand and a copy of the Daily Mail in the other . "
The government plans to use the voluntary and private sectors to rehouse , rehabilitate and find work for released prisoners , with bodies only paid if their efforts lead to a significant fall in reoffending .
These reforms will hopefully pay for themselves by reducing the costs elsewhere within the criminal justice system , Mr Clarke added .
' Stunning successes '
But shadow home office minister David Hanson said Mr Clarke needed to back his ideas with a better prisons budget .
Analysis " Prisons work ! " Michael Howard declared in his Conservative Party conference speech in 1993 .
From that moment , the prison population in England and Wales started to rise .
Labour , trying to out - tough the Tories on crime , did not stop the trend when they took office .
The increase was driven by a combination of tougher sentences handed out by judges under pressure from politicians , and more crimes involving violence and drugs .
Penal reformers pleaded that prison was not always the answer , but although ministers often agreed in private , nothing ever seemed to change .
It has taken a man who has run the prisons before to publicly question the wisdom of the policy .
Even so , Ken Clarke is not promising to cut the prison population , only to look at cost - effective ways of preventing reoffending .
He 's not saying prison does n't work .
But he is saying it does n't always work .
" Where Ken Clarke has a point is that there are people who go through the system who revolve through that door who have long - term drug , alcohol , employment problems - who need to be reformed to get back into society in a positive way , " he said .
" But where I disagree with Mr Clarke is that it takes resources .
And he is now planning to cut the resources to the justice department and to probation by 25 % over the next four years . "
And shadow justice minister Jack Straw said the increased number of offenders sentenced to prison had been a key factor in reducing crime .
" Does anyone seriously believe that crime would have come down and stayed down without these extra prison places ? " he wrote in the Daily Mail .
The general secretary of the Prison Governors Association , Paddy Scriven , said jails had some " stunning successes " with inmates who spent more than six months behind bars .
" If we 're left to concentrate on that and the shorter sentenced prisoners become the responsibility of a properly - funded probation service , then ... we 're cutting costs and looking after the public in the way that we should be , " he said .
' Poor value for money '
In a statement , the Probation Chiefs Association said it supported Mr Clarke 's plans and said the next step for the service should be a " flexible strategic framework free of overly bureaucratic control and interference " .
Juliet Lyon , of the Prison Reform Trust , said the system needed change as it was not working .
" You only have to look at the reconviction rates for those short sentence people - over 60 % reconvicted within a year of release - to realise that we 've got very poor value for money , " she said .
Reoffending rose by 8 % for adults between 2006 and 2008 , and nearly half of offenders sent to prison are reconvicted within a year .
Meanwhile , MSPs have passed proposals to vastly reduce the number of prison sentences of three months or less at the Scottish Parliament , despite opposition from Conservatives .
The measure , which will introduce a presumption against the shorter sentences by sheriffs , was voted through in the Criminal Justice and Licensing Bill by MSPs at Holyrood .
Survivors of the Israeli assault on a flotilla carrying relief supplies to Gaza returned to Greece and Turkey today , giving the first eyewitness accounts of the raid in which at least 10 people died .
Arriving at Istanbul 's Ataturk airport with her one - year - old baby , Turkish activist Nilufer Cetin said Israeli troops opened fire before boarding the Turkish - flagged ferry Mavi Marmara , which was the scene of the worst clashes and all the fatalities .
Israeli officials have said that the use of armed force began when its boarding party was attacked .
" It was extremely bad and very tough clashes took place .
The Mavi Marmara is filled with blood , " said Cetin , whose husband is the Mavi Marmara 's chief engineer .
She told reporters that she and her child hid in the bathroom of their cabin during the confrontation .
" The operation started immediately with firing .
First it was warning shots , but when the Mavi Marmara would n't stop these warnings turned into an attack , " she said .
" There were sound and smoke bombs and later they used gas bombs .
Following the bombings they started to come on board from helicopters . "
Cetin is among a handful of Turkish activists to be released ; more than 300 remain in Israeli custody .
She said she agreed to extradition from Israel after she was warned that conditions in jail would be too harsh for her child .
" I am one of the first passengers to be sent home , just because I have baby .
When we arrived at the Israeli port of Ashdod we were met by the Israeli interior and foreign ministry officials and police ; there were no soldiers .
They asked me only a few questions .
But they took everything – cameras , laptops , cellphones , personal belongings including our clothes , " she said .
Kutlu Tiryaki was a captain of another vessel in the flotilla .
" We continuously told them we did not have weapons , we came here to bring humanitarian help and not to fight , " he said .
" The attack on the Mavi Marmara came in an instant : they attacked it with 12 or 13 attack boats and also with commandos from helicopters .
We heard the gunshots over our portable radio handsets , which we used to communicate with the Mavi Marmara , because our ship communication system was disrupted .
There were three or four helicopters also used in the attack .
We were told by Mavi Marmara their crew and civilians were being shot at and windows and doors were being broken by Israelis . "
Six Greek activists who returned to Athens accused Israeli commandos of using electric shocks during the raid .
Dimitris Gielalis , who had been aboard the Sfendoni , told reporters : " Suddenly from everywhere we saw inflatables coming at us , and within seconds fully equipped commandos came up on the boat .
They came up and used plastic bullets , we had beatings , we had electric shocks , any method we can think of , they used . "
Michalis Grigoropoulos , who was at the wheel of the Free Mediterranean , said : " We were in international waters .
The Israelis acted like pirates , completely out of the normal way that they conduct nautical exercises , and seized our ship .
They took us hostage , pointing guns at our heads ; they descended from helicopters and fired tear gas and bullets .
There was absolutely nothing we could do …
Those who tried to resist forming a human ring on the bridge were given electric shocks . "
Grigoropoulos , who insisted the ship was full of humanitarian aid bound for Gaza " and nothing more " , said that , once detained , the human rights activists were not allowed to contact a lawyer or the Greek embassy in Tel Aviv .
" They did n't let us go to the toilet , eat or drink water and throughout they videoed us .
They confiscated everything , mobile phones , laptops , cameras and personal effects .
They only allowed us to keep our papers . "
Turkey said it was sending three ambulance planes to Israel to pick up 20 more Turkish activists injured in the operation .
Three Turkish Airlines planes were on standby , waiting to fly back other activists , the prime minister 's office said .
Last year , in July , something smacked Jupiter .
Hard .
It was discovered when an amateur astronomer found a black spot marring Jupiter 's cloud tops .
Followup observations saw the spot glowing in the infrared , meaning it was hot , and therefore was not just a storm ( which are common ) .
For real and for sure , something impacted Jupiter and exploded - and I mean exploded , releasing the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of nuclear weapons .
But what was it ?
A new paper just published indicates that it was an asteroid that hit Jupiter .
However , since it was n't seen beforehand , how do we know ?
Because we 've seen this sort of thing before .
In 1994 , the big planet was hit repeatedly by the comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 .
The comet had broken up into dozens of pieces , including several chunks a kilometer or so across , and they slammed into Jupiter one after another over the course of a week .
That was one of the most well - observed astronomical events in history ; every telescope on the planet was focused on Jupiter at the time .
And telescopes off the planet were too : Hubble took a lot of data , and found two key differences between the 1994 and 2009 events .
One is that there was a halo of lighter debris around the comet impact points in 1994 ( as seen in this image on the right ) , but no such halo around the 2009 impact site .
That indicates that the impacting objects were different .
Also , Hubble observed Jupiter both times in the ultraviolet .
Images like that show where small , lighter - weight particles fell from the impact because those particles absorb UV light , leaving dark spots .
Even nearly two weeks later , dark spots on Jupiter were evident around the 1994 impact sites .
Since comets have a lot of ices in them -- what you might call frozen gases like ammonia , methane , and so on -- that 's expected .
The lighter particles floated around in Jupiter 's clouds , absorbing the UV for quite some time .
But observations from last year 's impact do n't show that behavior !
As you can see in big the image above , the dark spot fades rapidly .
That 's most likely due to the impact debris ( made up of vaporized impactor plus material from Jupiter 's atmosphere that got heated and chemically altered ) to sink beneath the clouds .
That indicates the particles were heavier than the SL9 impact in 1994 , pointing toward the impacting object being an asteroid , not a comet .
This is also consistent with the lack of a halo as mentioned above ; halos are also made by finer particles .
The 2009 impact site lacking a halo means the particles were heavier , as you 'd expect from an asteroid .
So even though we did n't see the object before it hit , it left -- haha ! -- a smoking gun pointing toward its origin .
And here 's a funny thing : this impact occurred 15 years to the week after the SL9 onslaught .
I remember getting a lot of email asking me if that meant they were related , but if you think about it you 'll realize it has to be a coincidence : after all , why would Earth 's orbital period have to do with anything hitting Jupiter ?
And now we see that the object that hit was not comet - like , proving the point .
Asteroid and comet impacts are a real threat to us on Earth .
Jupiter , being so much more massive than the Earth , is a bigger target ; its gravity draws in more debris .
By observing it we can get a better idea of just how much stuff is out there in the solar system , waiting to put the hurt on a planet , including our planet .
Just in case you have any lingering doubts , astronomy is important .
It is no exaggeration at all to say that learning about astronomy and astronomical events may very well save the human race one day .

Honeybee Project Engineer Gale Paulsen adjusts settings for the Mars Simulation Chamber in preparation for a test of the company ’s rotary - sonic drill .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- NASA 's Phoenix lander revealed water ice mere inches beneath the martian surface , and chemical evidence from the landing site strongly hints that the region is habitable .
But learning whether there is life in martian ice will require drilling — and drilling on Mars will be anything but easy .
A catalogue of places on Earth where one can find Mars - like conditions might include Antarctica ’s Dry Valleys , Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic , the hyper-acidic Rio Tinto in Spain , and Chile ’s bone - dry Atacama Desert .
But it probably would n’t include Brooklyn .
And yet it ’s in Brooklyn where , in an otherwise unexceptional warehouse , Honeybee Robotics has installed a massive stainless steel chamber whose interior environment can be made more Mars - like than most anywhere else on Earth .
Eleven feet tall , three feet square , its walls one - and - a - half inches thick , its doors studded with a dozen small square windows , the whole thing looks like refrigerator on steroids .
Which , more or less , it is .
The edifice is flanked by canisters of coolant capable of chilling its interior to minus 80 degrees Celsius ( minus 112 F ) and by pumps that can suck its atmosphere down to a near - vacuum .
Honeybee calls it their Mars Simulation Chamber .
They use it to test drills , drills that some day may play a crucial role in the search for life on the Red Planet .
Soil on the surface of Mars is generally considered inhospitable to life .
The scarcity of liquid water , due to sub- freezing temperature and low atmospheric pressure , and the presence of ionizing radiation , which can damage genetic material , would make it difficult for even the hardiest forms of microbial life as we know it to survive there .
But below the martian surface lies a different story .
NASA ’s Phoenix lander , for example , which in 2008 investigated a small patch of ground near the martian north pole , found water ice mere inches below the surface .
Some scientists believe that if there is life on Mars , this subsurface ice , which may contain miniscule amounts of liquid water , is the most promising place to look for it .
Chris McKay , a planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffet Field , Calif. , argues , based on the discoveries made by Phoenix , that “ the shallow subsurface ground ice in the northern plains is an ideal place to search for evidence of life on Mars and the possibility of organics preserved in the ice . ”
McKay is the principal investigator on the IceBite project , which is funded by NASA ’s ASTEP ( Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets ) program .
It is as part of IceBite that Honeybee is designing and testing a series of drills to determine the optimum configuration for boring into subsurface martian ice .
Ultimately , McKay hopes to obtain samples of icy martian soil from as much as a meter deep and to bring them to the surface for chemical and biological analysis .
This color image , acquired by the Surface Stereo Imager on NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander in June 2008 shows lumps of subsurface ice exposed in a trench scraped out by the lander ’s robotic scoop .

Later this year the IceBite team plans to test one of Honeybee ’s drills in Antarctica .
There , in University Valley , a mile above sea level , a thin layer of dry soil lies atop subsurface ice that remains frozen year - round .
This dry - soil - over - ice arrangement , widespread on Mars but extremely rare on Earth , resembles the stratigraphy at the Phoenix landing site .
McKay calls it “ dry permafrost . ”
Experience in University Valley will certainly help scientists understand the physical , chemical and biological interactions that take place in dry permafrost , and will yield valuable lessons about the real - world difficulties of drilling in such an environment .
But even hauling a drill to a remote frozen valley in Antarctica wo n’t answer all the questions that need to be answered before sending a drill to Mars - because a drill wo n’t behave the same way on Mars as it does on Earth .
On Earth , when ice is heated ( by the friction of a rotating drill , for example ) , it melts ; it turns liquid .
On Mars , because of the thin atmosphere , heated ice does n’t melt , it sublimes : it skips the liquid - water phase and passes directly from solid ice to gaseous vapor .
This is not a minor point .
It complicates the process not only of designing a drill to perform properly on Mars , but also of testing its behavior on Earth .
For example , when Honeybee performed an ice - drilling test in a chilled metal cylinder , outside the Mars Simulation Chamber , the combination of the heat generated by the drill bit and the ambient temperature and air pressure in the room caused some of the ice to melt .
Then it refroze .
Which jammed the drill bit .
That wo n’t be a problem on Mars , because ice there wo n’t melt and refreeze : it will vaporize .
And when it vaporizes , it will expand , rapidly .
So when a drill bores down into martian ice , tiny soil particles loosened by the drill will shoot up out of the drill hole like a geyser , carried aloft by jets of water vapor .
That ’s not necessarily a bad thing .
In fact , it may turn out to be a cost - effective way to deliver subsurface material to a lander ’s scientific instruments .
“ Very often what you ’ll find , ” says Kris Zacny , senior scientist at Honeybee Robotics and a co-investigator on the IceBite project , “ is that getting the cuttings out [ of a drill hole ] is even more difficult than breaking the rock . ”
But despite its potential usefulness , the vapor - jet effect , among others , is impossible to test for under Earth conditions .
That ’s why Honeybee built the chamber .
Antarctica's University Valley , where later this year the IceBite team will field - test Honeybee Robotics ' rotary - percussion drill , boring as much as a meter into the subsurface ice .

Honeybee is investigating three types of drills : rotary , rotary - sonic and rotary - percussive .
A rotary drill is the most basic : it ’s like the drill you might use at home to poke holes in wood .
Do n’t try to use it on rock or concrete , though .
“ Without pressing really hard , ” says Zacny , all you ’ll succeed in doing is wearing out the bit .
Subsurface ice or icy soil on Mars will be “ as hard to drill as medium - strength sandstone , ” says Zacny .
And because the drill most likely will be attached to the end of a robotic arm , there wo n’t be any way to apply the required weight to make a rotary drill practical .
In a rotary - sonic drill , a pair of off - center weights at the head of the drill rotates , 100 to 200 times per second , inducing a small vertical vibration in the drill string ( the entire length of the drill from its head down to the bit ) .
Zacny compares this to an electric toothbrush .
“ Imagine this big toothbrush going down into the rock , ” he says .
Because of the vibration , “ the forces between the bit and the rock are much higher than the force that you ’re pressing with . ”
A meter - long rotary - sonic drill built by Honeybee for IceBite is currently being tested in the Mars Simulation Chamber .
But still being assembled on a lab bench in Honeybee ’s main office , slated for testing in the Mars Simulation Chamber this summer and in Antarctica later this year , is a newly designed rotary - percussive drill .
Like a rotary - sonic drill , a rotary - percussive drill adds a vertical component to the rotary motion of the drill bit , but instead of relying on vibration , a rotary - percussive drill adds force by , roughly 30 - 40 times a second , tapping the top of the drill with a weight , the equivalent of whacking it with a hammer .
Most rotary - percussive drills , however , use compressed air to accomplish this hammering effect .
That wo n’t work on Mars : martian air is too thin -- less than one - hundredth of the air pressure on Earth -- so Honeybee is experimenting with an unconventional spring - loaded mechanism whose spring gets slowly compressed and then suddenly released to produce the hammering pressure .
The temperature and pressure on Mars mean that nothing about drilling there will be easy .
But McKay hopes that all the lab and field testing planned as part of the IceBite project will ultimately produce a flight - ready drill .
And where does he propose to send it ?
Back to the Phoenix landing site .
“ The Phoenix landing site … is arguably the most likely site to support recent life on Mars , ” McKay says .
But , he adds , going back to the same place a second time wo n’t be just a dull rerun of the Phoenix mission .
The goal of his proposed future mission will be “ to explore a completely new place - the subsurface environment .
A place that no previous mission to Mars has investigated . ”

Drug traffickers fighting to control northern Mexico have turned their guns and grenades on the Mexican army , authorities said , in an apparent escalation of warfare that played out across multiple cities in two border states .
In coordinated attacks , gunmen in armored cars and equipped with grenade launchers fought army troops this week and attempted to trap some of them in two military bases by cutting off access and blocking highways , a new tactic by Mexico ’s organized criminals .
In taking such aggressive action , the traffickers have shown that they are not reluctant to challenge the army head - on and that they possess good intelligence on where the army is , how it moves and when it operates .
At least 18 alleged attackers were killed and one soldier wounded in the fighting that erupted Tuesday in half a dozen towns and cities in the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon , the army said , topping off one of the deadliest months yet in a drug war that has raged for nearly 3 1/2 years .
The U.S. Consulate in Monterrey issued a warning to Americans who might be traveling in northern Mexico for the Easter break , citing the sudden outbreaks of gun battles in Nuevo Leon and neighboring states .
Traffickers previously have fought with army patrols , but the attempt to blockade garrisons came after weeks of an intense , bloody power struggle between two rival organizations , the Gulf cartel and its erstwhile paramilitary allies , the Zetas , to control the region bordering South Texas .
Part of the strategy of Tuesday ’s assaults may have been to prevent the army from patrolling , to give the drug gangs a freer hand in their fight against each other .
“ This really speaks to the incredible organization and firepower that the drug - trafficking organizations have managed to muster , ” said Tony Payan , a border expert at the University of Texas at El Paso .
“ These are organizations that are flexible , supple and quick to react and adapt .
They no doubt represent a challenge to the Mexican state . ”
In Reynosa , one of the scenes of Tuesday ’s fighting , the local government put out alerts Thursday for residents to avoid parts of the city .
Residents said they heard gunfire and saw military armored personnel carriers moving through neighborhoods .
One person was reported killed .
“ People hear gunfire and get scared , ” said Jaime Aguirre , a radio talk show host .
“ But it ’s better to keep quiet and not hear anything so as not to risk reprisals . ”
Reynosa resident Yenni Gandiaga was driving to the gas station Tuesday morning when she heard gunfire getting closer and louder .
Then she saw the troops and the gunmen .
She turned down a side street to hide , crashing into two other cars in the process .
“ People ran about screaming , picking up their children , ” she said .
She hid in a stranger ’s house .
When she emerged after the combatants moved on , the windows of storefronts and cars were shattered .
The Mexican Defense Ministry in Mexico City put out a blow - by - blow account of Tuesday ’s events .
Taking a page from a manual on urban guerrilla warfare , gunmen struck at the same time Tuesday morning , and then again in the afternoon .
In Reynosa , a city in Tamaulipas state across the border from McAllen , Texas , gunmen positioned trucks , cars and trailers on a highway to block Campo Militar , an army base , about 11 a.m .
At almost the same time , they blocked a garrison in the city of Matamoros , about 60 miles to the east .
In Rio Bravo , between the two cities , traffickers battled with army patrols .
Later in the day , troops and traffickers clashed in other Tamaulipas towns and in neighboring Nuevo Leon state .
The army said it confiscated armored cars , grenade launchers , about 100 military - grade grenades , explosive devices and about 13,000 rounds of ammunition .
Seven men were captured .
“ The actions by these criminal organizations are a desperate reaction to the advances made by federal authorities in coordination with state and municipal security forces , ” Gen. Edgar Luis Villegas said .
It was not clear whether the fighting the army reported was with the Zetas or the stronger Gulf cartel .
Most of the violence has been cartel against cartel , with some bystanders getting caught in the cross - fire .
The gangs have also attacked police stations in many areas .
The Zetas , founded as a group of mercenary former soldiers working for the Gulf group , split away in a bid to take over part of the lucrative drug trade .
They are fighting to seize territory from the Gulf network in Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon , amid reports that other strong cartels , such as the one based in Sinaloa , may be uniting with the Gulf traffickers to wipe out the Zetas .
Dozens of people , primarily traffickers , have been killed in recent weeks as the two groups clashed in the broad triangle along the border from Nuevo Laredo to Monterrey to Reynosa and Matamoros .
Traffickers have flexed their muscle by repeatedly setting up roadblocks , closing highways and tying up traffic even in Monterrey , a major city .
“ It is a risky tactic because it has the potential of angering society , but it is a very effective show of power , ” said Martin Barron , a researcher at a Mexico City think tank .
The increased agility of the drug gangs seen in Tuesday ’s violence indicates good intelligence , experts here and abroad said .
Some of that intelligence comes from taxi drivers , street vendors and scores of other people on the traffickers ’ payroll who serve as lookouts for drug runners and their henchmen .
But Payan and others suggested that some of the precise , street - level intelligence may come from soldiers , adding substance to fear that as the army is increasingly dragged into the drug war it is becoming susceptible to the same cartel - financed corruption that has long corroded police departments and many political structures .
In Ciudad Juarez , Mexico ’s deadliest city and where the army has been deployed in greatest force , federal police are to begin taking over security duties this month as the army is gradually withdrawn , the government said .
The army has been criticized for rights abuses , including the disappearance of detainees and illegal searches .
By one newspaper ’s count , the drug war ’s death toll in March was the highest yet , more than 1,000 .

The Aurora Borealis has been celebrated in song
A question posed to Aberdeen tourist information staff could get easier to answer as an " awakening " Sun raises chances of seeing the Aurora Borealis .
Tourism staff have been asked in the past when the " lights were turned on " .
Experts have been reporting that the sun was stirring after a period of low activity .
Increased eruptions from the Sun - including solar flares - were expected to make the aurora , also known as the Northern Lights , a more frequent event .
Visitors unaware that the aurora was a phenomenon related to the Sun 's activity would ask tourism staff what time they were switched on each night .
Many elements of our natural and cultural heritage capture the imagination of visitors and occasionally we do get asked a question which raises a smile

The Aurora Borealis is also celebrated in the local song , The Northern Lights of Old Aberdeen .
Prof Eric Priest , of the Solar and Magnetospheric Research Group at the University of St Andrews , said the chances of seeing the aurora were likely to improve as the sun heads for what is known as a solar maximum .
He said : " The Sun 's activity varies with an 11 - year cycle and when it is more active there are more eruptions from the Sun called coronal mass ejections - some of which are related to flares .
" When they reach the Earth after about two days they produce an enhanced Aurora Borealis .
" In order to see it clearly you need to be away from lights and also as far north as possible , and so on those two counts Scotland is a great place to see the aurora . "
' Fantastic example ' Eric Walker , of the Highlands Astronomical Society , said the north of Scotland had seen impressive displays of the aurora in the past .
He said : " It is indeed exciting to hear that sunspot activity is on the rise again .
" We have been in one of the deepest sunspot minima for the last couple of years , 2008 was the second blankest year in a century , and for lovers of the Northern Lights this has been a lean period indeed .
Mr Walker added : " Sunspot activity appears to be linked to the frequency and intensity of the beautiful aurora .
The aurora pictured over the Highlands in 2005 " In autumn 2004 and winter 2005 there was a tremendous burst of intense aurora activity .
In 2005 the activity was so intense that the aurora activity was directly above the Scottish Highlands and we were able to look into the auroral corona itself . "
Ken Massie , VisitScotland regional director for Aberdeen City and Shire , said the aurora was a potential draw for visitors .
He said : " The north east is not only an area of rich culture but also stunning natural heritage .
" The Northern Lights are a fantastic example of this and any visitor who is privileged enough to have experienced them will undoubtedly have a memorable and unique holiday .
" Many elements of our natural and cultural heritage capture the imagination of visitors and occasionally we do get asked a question which raises a smile .
" However , the staff in our VisitScotland information centres are always on hand to share their expertise and enthusiasm for the local area and all it has to offer . "
' Space weather ' Scientists and astronomers in the UK and US have been making close observations of the Sun 's activity .
On Thursday , the Solar Dynamics Observatory was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida .
The observatory is designed to acquire detailed images of Earth 's nearest star to explain variation in its activity .
An active Sun can disrupt satellite , communication , and power systems at Earth - especially when it billows charged particles in Earth 's direction .
Scientists want to see if they can forecast this " space weather " better .
The Solar Dynamics Observatory will assist this drive by investigating the physics at work inside , on the surface and in the atmosphere of the Sun .

A few sporty Europeans showed us what it might look like in a popular video launched last month .
An Internet phenomenon , " Liquid Mountaineering " has received well over 4.5 million views on YouTube .
Viewers wondered if it was possible , while scientists insisted it was a hoax or publicity stunt .
Finally in early June , outdoor brand Hi-Tech Sports admitted they were behind the viral video and that an underwater bridge was responsible for the effect .
But given the video's immense popularity , we wanted to explore the biomechanics of walking on water .
The video claims that special water - repellent shoes allow you to stay on top of the water .
" This would only be true if the force from the water - surface tension on the shoes is enough to support one man 's weight , " says Eric Lauga , assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California , San Diego .
" Say these guys weigh 200 pounds and call g the acceleration of gravity .
The surface tension of water is gamma = 0.07 N/m .
If you put numbers in , you find a contact - line perimeter of 12,000 meters long .
It means each shoe should be a mile long and a mile wide . "

Hoax Alert :
An underwater bridge is responsible for these apparent water - walking abilities .
Nor does running into the water on a curve do anything to support their weight .
" However , if they could run fast enough , each time one of their feet slapped the water surface that would provide an inertial force from the water , and if they retract their feet fast enough before the water collapses , they could continue with the next foot , " says Lauga , who has studied how snails can drag themselves across a fluid surface .
" This is what the so - called Jesus ( basilisk ) lizard does . "
Jamaican runner Usain Bolt , the current world record holder for the 100 - meter sprint , ran 10.4 meters per second .
But J.W. Glasheen and T.A. McMahon , two Harvard biologists who studied how the basilisk runs on water , found that in order to mimic the lizard , a human would need to run at almost 30 meters per second , " a velocity beyond human ability . "
A man would also need " an average power output almost 15 times greater than the maximum sustained power output for humans . "
Devices may be able to help .
" If one is dragged across the water surface at high enough speed , by a motorboat , for example , the resulting lift forces are large enough to bear one 's weight ; hence one can water - ski with bare feet if the boat is high enough , " says John Bush , professor of applied mathematics at MIT .
Regardless of the physics involved , the video inspired .
" We all aspire to not be boxed in and to push our boundaries further , to achieve the unachievable , " says Ulf Gartner , who is featured in the video .
" It is not about walking on water .
What we do is a metaphor . "
But a reality check never hurts .
" If man were really capable of walking on water , " says Bush , " why would we have waited until now to get started ? "

With Senate Bill 1070 , state Sen. Russell Pearce and his supporters went after illegal immigrants .
Next , they 're going after babies .
Pearce plans to introduce legislation in Arizona that would deny birth certificates to children born here to non-citizen parents .
This has long been the goal of Pearce and national organizations like FAIR , the Federation for American Immigration Reform .
Pearce worked with a lawyer affiliated with FAIR to craft SB 1070 and most likely will do the same thing when he attempts to withhold citizenship from newborns of non-citizen parents .
Pearce recently told the news agency Reuters , " It is difficult to imagine a more self - defeating legal system than one that makes unauthorized entry into the U.S. a criminal offense and simultaneously provides perhaps the greatest possible inducement to illegal entry . "
He believes that children born to illegal immigrants should not be citizens .
" They are citizens of the country of their mother , " he said .
" That 's why they are called in some cases ' jackpot babies ' or ' anchor babies . ' "
Still , Pearce 's belief is not how the Constitution has been interpreted - so far .
The 14th Amendment , ratified in 1868 as a way to guarantee citizenship for freed slaves , says that " all persons , born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States . "
Ira Mehlman , national media director for FAIR , told me that his organization believes that non-citizens and illegal immigrants are not " subject to the jurisdiction " of the U.S. and their children should not be considered citizens .
He points out that the children of foreign diplomats born here are not U.S. citizens .
Others argue , however , that while diplomats cannot be prosecuted for crimes under U.S. law and therefore are not subject to our jurisdiction , we do prosecute border crossers , meaning that they are under U.S. jurisdiction .
" There is no question that whether it ( a law to deny birth certificates ) is initiated at the state level or whether it is initiated at the federal level , that ultimately this will wind up at the Supreme Court to be decided , " Mehlman said .
While a proposal to deny citizenship to such children has been introduced in Congress , it has n't come to a vote .
" It seems unlikely that Congress is going to take this up .
The states seem to be the incubators of these ideas .
Certainly Arizona has been right at the forefront all along , " Mehlman said .
With a Republican - controlled legislature and with opinion polls backing SB 1070 , Pearce 's proposal should have widespread support among lawmakers and a large majority of citizens .
Opponents of the idea expect to see such a bill .
Alfredo Gutierrez , an activist , former state legislator and one of the organizers of a boycott in response to SB 1070 , told me , " If they go after the children , then there is no denying that this is a racial thing , an attack on a specific ethnic group that is seen as a threat .
That kind of thing did n't exist for any other ethnic group .
It would pull the veil from the racists . "
I asked representatives of Gov. Jan Brewer , Sen. John McCain , Senate candidate J.D. Hayworth and attorney - general candidate Andrew Thomas , among others , if they would deny birth certificates to the newborns of non-citizens .
None responded .
I suspect they 're waiting for an opinion poll to tell them what they should think about it .
Why ?
Because folks on both sides of this argument agree upon one thing :
Trying to change the meaning of " born in the U.S.A. " could lead an even nastier fight than the one over SB 1070 .

Is there still anything of worth to mine out of the LEGO series of games ?
You take the bricks , you add a license , and away you go .
Surely these titles have to feel like paint - by - numbers by now ... right ?
After playing LEGO Harry Potter for an embarrassing number of hours , I 'm happy to report that there is still much life to be found in the series .
The game follows Harry Potter 's four years of school at Hogwarts , and replays the events of the books and movies in the expected humorous fashion .
Familiar scenes and characters are given that special LEGO touch , and the graphics have been given a little kick in the pants .
It 's an attractive game , with many delightful moments and extra touches for fans of the world .
Hogwarts castle is almost another character in the game , and you 'll unlock different areas as you learn more spells and become more powerful .
You 're in a school , after all , and this Metroid - vania aspect of the game is very welcome .
Flying on the broomsticks , saving other students , exploring the nooks and crannies of the castle — there is a lot to do , and parents will have even more fun by giving their children the other controller and playing the game in co-op mode .
Like past LEGO titles , there is only a slight penalty for failure , making the world safe and enjoyable to explore and poke around .
The presentation wo n't hold the hand of people who do n't already know the story , but if your children are already fans of the movies or books , they 're going to get these jokes .
This is something to play in addition to the book and film treatments of Harry 's world , and is best enjoyed after those .
Plus , according to my press pack , a patch for online co-op play is expected to be released very soon .
With 170 playable characters and damn near every setting from the books and movies included , being able to play with someone online will be a nice touch .
At launch though , only local co-op is supported .
Still , there is almost an embarrassing amount to see and do in the game , and the progression of learning spells , interacting with the castle , collecting items for potions , or simply trying to find all the bricks you need in each level will keep you occupied for a very long time .
You probably had a good idea whether or not you were going to buy this game before you began reading this review , but if you were on the fence , I can tell you that this is better than even fans will expect .
This is a series of games that could have easily gone stale , but I found myself exploring Hogwarts with a large smile on my face .
What more can you ask for ?
Sarah Posner interviewed Lou Engle in an effort to try and understand ’s Engle ’s claims that he does n’t support Uganda ’s legislation that carries the death penalty for gays while supporting Uganda ’s effort to take a “ principled stand ” against the homosexual agenda .
And what she found out is that while Engle might not support the death penalty for gays , he certainly does support their criminialization :
[ Engle ] made absolutely clear that he supports the criminalization of homosexuality , believes there could be a biblical basis for a death penalty , that the United Nations has promoted the “ homosexual agenda ” to Uganda ’s detriment , and he lauded the bill ’s promoters ’ efforts to take a “ principled stand ” against that .
…
I pressed Engle to explain what he meant by a “ principled stand ” and a “ principled bill . ”
I asked him whether he supported a law that dealt with homosexuality in some way , and he stated that there needs to be “ some kind of restraint from the homosexual agenda : ”
Most definitely .
For instance , the court case Lawrence v. Texas , is the court case that basically decriminalized homosexuality in the U.S. Everybody knew that when that bill passed , or when that court case shifted , then it opened the door for the legalization , for the definition , or the legalization of same - sex marriage , which is now rolling into America .
We knew that .
So I ’ve always had — yes , there needs to be a principled stand .
There needs to be some kind of restraint from the homosexual agenda being able to roll over this , a nation that does not want it .
…
I pressed him about which penalties in the bill he did n’t support — and he did say that although he could see someone supporting the death penalty , he did not , and he did not support “ hard labor ” as punishment or the requirement that churches report LGBT people to the authorities .
But when I asked him if he would support a bill with less harsh penalties , he added :

The four were allegedly shot close to the countries ' border
China says a North Korean border guard shot and killed three people near the countries ' border last week .
A fourth person was reportedly injured in the incident near the north - eastern border town of Dandong .
China has made a formal complaint to North Korea , a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry said .
The two countries are considered to be close allies and Beijing rarely makes any public criticism of its isolated neighbour .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told a regular news conference in Beijing that the four residents of Dandong , in Liaoning province , had been shot " on suspicion of crossing the border for trade activities " .
" China attaches great importance to that and has immediately raised a solemn representation with the DPRK , " he said , using North Korea 's full name ( Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ) .
Close ally
Mr Qin said the case was being investigated , but gave no further details .
Pyongyang has not commented on the accusations .
Illegal traders regularly cross the border between North Korea and China , taking black market goods into the impoverished country .
China is North Korea 's main trading partner and the country perceived to have the most influence on the state .
Tensions on the Korean peninsula have been high since the sinking of a South Korean warship in March with the loss of 46 lives .
An international investigation blamed North Korea for the sinking , but China has resisted pressure to condemn its ally .
Instead , it has urged both the Koreas to show restraint .
Last month , the North Korean leader , Kim Jong-il , was reported to have visited China to seek economic and political support .
China is crucial to North Korea 's fight for economic survival , providing Pyongyang with food , fuel and much - needed investment .
Beijing is also a participant in the six - party talks on North Korea 's nuclear programme .
The talks have been going on since 2003 without much progress .
In 2009 , North Korea detained two US journalists on the border with China , accusing them of entering North Korea illegally .
Laura Ling and Euna Lee , who said they were detained on the Chinese side , were sentenced to 12 years ' hard labour but were freed in August after four months in captivity , as part of a diplomatic mission spearheaded by former US President Bill Clinton .
A US man , Robert Park , was also arrested in December last year , after walking into North Korea across a frozen river .
He was released in February .
I taught for thirty years in some of the worst schools in Manhattan , and in some of the best , and during that time I became an expert in boredom .
Boredom was everywhere in my world , and if you asked the kids , as I often did , why they felt so bored , they always gave the same answers :
They said the work was stupid , that it made no sense , that they already knew it .
They said they wanted to be doing something real , not just sitting around .
They said teachers did n’t seem to know much about their subjects and clearly were n’t interested in learning more .
And the kids were right : their teachers were every bit as bored as they were .
Boredom is the common condition of schoolteachers , and anyone who has spent time in a teachers ’ lounge can vouch for the low energy , the whining , the dispirited attitudes , to be found there .
When asked why they feel bored , the teachers tend to blame the kids , as you might expect .
Who would n’t get bored teaching students who are rude and interested only in grades ?
If even that .
Of course , teachers are themselves products of the same twelve - year compulsory school programs that so thoroughly bore their students , and as school personnel they are trapped inside structures even more rigid than those imposed upon the children .
Who , then , is to blame ?

We all are .
My grandfather taught me that .
One afternoon when I was seven I complained to him of boredom , and he batted me hard on the head .
He told me that I was never to use that term in his presence again , that if I was bored it was my fault and no one else ’s .
The obligation to amuse and instruct myself was entirely my own , and people who did n’t know that were childish people , to be avoided if possible .
Certainty not to be trusted .
That episode cured me of boredom forever , and here and there over the years I was able to pass on the lesson to some remarkable student .
For the most part , however , I found it futile to challenge the official notion that boredom and childishness were the natural state of affairs in the classroom .
Often I had to defy custom , and even bend the law , to help kids break out of this trap .
The empire struck back , of course ; childish adults regularly conflate opposition with disloyalty .
I once returned from a medical leave to discover that all evidence of my having been granted the leave had been purposely destroyed , that my job had been terminated , and that I no longer possessed even a teaching license .
After nine months of tormented effort I was able to retrieve the license when a school secretary testified to witnessing the plot unfold .
In the meantime my family suffered more than I care to remember .
By the time I finally retired in 1991 , 1 had more than enough reason to think of our schools  with their long - term , cell - block - style , forced confinement of both students and teachers  as virtual factories of childishness .
Yet I honestly could not see why they had to be that way .
My own experience had revealed to me what many other teachers must learn along the way , too , yet keep to themselves for fear of reprisal : if we wanted to we could easily and inexpensively jettison the old , stupid structures and help kids take an education rather than merely receive a schooling .
We could encourage the best qualities of youthfulness  curiosity , adventure , resilience , the capacity for surprising insight  simply by being more flexible about time , texts , and tests , by introducing kids to truly competent adults , and by giving each student what autonomy he or she needs in order to take a risk every now and then .

But we do n’t do that .
And the more I asked why not , and persisted in thinking about the " problem " of schooling as an engineer might , the more I missed the point :
What if there is no " problem " with our schools ?
What if they are the way they are , so expensively flying in the face of common sense and long experience in how children learn things , not because they are doing something wrong but because they are doing something right ?
Is it possible that George W. Bush accidentally spoke the truth when he said we would " leave no child behind " ?
Could it be that our schools are designed to make sure not one of them ever really grows up ?

Do we really need school ?
I do n’t mean education , just forced schooling : six classes a day , five days a week , nine months a year , for twelve years .
Is this deadly routine really necessary ?
And if so , for what ?
Do n’t hide behind reading , writing , and arithmetic as a rationale , because 2 million happy homeschoolers have surely put that banal justification to rest .
Even if they had n’t , a considerable number of well - known Americans never went through the twelve - year wringer our kids currently go through , and they turned out all right .
George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Jefferson , Abraham Lincoln ?
Someone taught them , to be sure , but they were not products of a school system , and not one of them was ever " graduated " from a secondary school .
Throughout most of American history , kids generally did n’t go to high school , yet the unschooled rose to be admirals , like Farragut ; inventors , like Edison ; captains of industry like Carnegie and Rockefeller ; writers , like Melville and Twain and Conrad ; and even scholars , like Margaret Mead .
In fact , until pretty recently people who reached the age of thirteen were n’t looked upon as children at all .
Ariel Durant , who co-wrote an enormous , and very good , multivolume history of the world with her husband , Will , was happily married at fifteen , and who could reasonably claim that Ariel Durant was an uneducated person ?
Unschooled , perhaps , but not uneducated .
Deculturalization and ... Joel Spring Best Price : $ 1.32 Buy New $ 34.87 ( as of 09:20 EST - Details )
We have been taught ( that is , schooled ) in this country to think of " success " as synonymous with , or at least dependent upon , " schooling , " but historically that is n’t true in either an intellectual or a financial sense .
And plenty of people throughout the world today find a way to educate themselves without resorting to a system of compulsory secondary schools that all too often resemble prisons .
Why , then , do Americans confuse education with just such a system ?
What exactly is the purpose of our public schools ?
Mass schooling of a compulsory nature really got its teeth into the United States between 1905 and 1915 , though it was conceived of much earlier and pushed for throughout most of the nineteenth century .
The reason given for this enormous upheaval of family life and cultural traditions was , roughly speaking , threefold :
1 ) To make good people .
2 ) To make good citizens .
3 ) To make each person his or her personal best .
These goals are still trotted out today on a regular basis , and most of us accept them in one form or another as a decent definition of public education ’s mission , however short schools actually fall in achieving them .
But we are dead wrong .
Compounding our error is the fact that the national literature holds numerous and surprisingly consistent statements of compulsory schooling ’s true purpose .
We have , for example , the great H. L. Mencken , who wrote in The American Mercury for April 1924 that the aim of public education is not
to fill the young of the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence .
…
Nothing could be further from the truth .
The aim … is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level , to breed and train a standardized citizenry , to put down dissent and originality .
That is its aim in the United States … and that is its aim everywhere else .
Because of Mencken ’s reputation as a satirist , we might be tempted to dismiss this passage as a bit of hyperbolic sarcasm .
His article , however , goes on to trace the template for our own educational system back to the now vanished , though never to be forgotten , military state of Prussia .
And although he was certainly aware of the irony that we had recently been at war with Germany , the heir to Prussian thought and culture , Mencken was being perfectly serious here .
Our educational system really is Prussian in origin , and that really is cause for concern .
The odd fact of a Prussian provenance for our schools pops up again and again once you know to look for it .
William James alluded to it many times at the turn of the century .
Orestes Brownson , the hero of Christopher Lasch ’s 1991 book , The True and Only Heaven , was publicly denouncing the Prussianization of American schools back in the 1840s .
Horace Mann ’s " Seventh Annual Report " to the Massachusetts State Board of Education in 1843 is essentially a paean to the land of Frederick the Great and a call for its schooling to be brought here .
That Prussian culture loomed large in America is hardly surprising , given our early association with that utopian state .
A Prussian served as Washington ’s aide during the Revolutionary War , and so many German - speaking people had settled here by 1795 that Congress considered publishing a German - language edition of the federal laws .
But what shocks is that we should so eagerly have adopted one of the very worst aspects of Prussian culture : an educational system deliberately designed to produce mediocre intellects , to hamstring the inner life , to deny students appreciable leadership skills , and to ensure docile and incomplete citizens in order to render the populace " manageable . "
It was from James Bryant Conant  president of Harvard for twenty years , WWI poison - gas specialist , WWII executive on the atomic - bomb project , high commissioner of the American zone in Germany after WWII , and truly one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century  that I first got wind of the real purposes of American schooling .
Without Conant , we would probably not have the same style and degree of standardized testing that we enjoy today , nor would we be blessed with gargantuan high schools that warehouse 2,000 to 4,000 students at a time , like the famous Columbine High in Littleton , Colorado .
Shortly after I retired from teaching I picked up Conant ’s 1959 book - length essay , The Child the Parent and the State , and was more than a little intrigued to see him mention in passing that the modem schools we attend were the result of a " revolution " engineered between 1905 and 1930 .
A revolution ?
He declines to elaborate , but he does direct the curious and the uninformed to Alexander Inglis ’s 1918 book , Principles of Secondary Education , in which " one saw this revolution through the eyes of a revolutionary . "

ATHENS ( Reuters ) - Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Europe and the Middle East Monday , clashing with police as they protested against the Israeli storming of a Gaza - bound aid flotilla during which 10 activists were killed .
In Athens , some 3,500 protesters rallied outside the Israeli embassy , chanting “ Hands off Gaza ” and “ Free Palestine . ”
Several hundreds clashed with police , throwing chunks of marble , stones and bottles .
Police fired teargas to disperse them .
“ Demonstrators set barricades on fire , police chased them , there were a lot of stones and teargas and a few people had blood on their heads , ” a Reuters witness said , adding he saw four people injured .
Police said they detained five protesters .
The Israeli marines ’ action in the eastern Mediterranean sparked street protests and government ire in Turkey , long Israel ’s lone Muslim ally in the region , and thousands of followers of an anti-U.S. cleric took to the streets in Baghdad .
Across Egypt , which in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel , up to 8,000 Egyptians protested to demand the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in Cairo and called on the government to open its Rafah borders with Gaza .
The protests were organised by the Muslim Brotherhood , Egypt ’s biggest opposition group which is affiliated to Hamas , the Islamist group that took control of the Gaza strip in 2007 .
Two Brotherhood parliamentarians were on board the convoy ships .
“ Hamas you are the canon and the Brotherhood is your voice , ” chanted thousands of Egyptians protesting in Cairo .
The Brotherhood routinely organizes protests demanding the lifting of the Israeli blockade on Gaza .
Police used teargas in Paris when about 2,000 people demonstrated near the Israeli embassy , hurling stones , waving Palestinian and Turkish flags and brandishing banners saying “ Long live free Palestine ” and “ Criminal Israel . ”
Small , peaceful anti-Israel demonstrations were held in Rome and other Italian cities .
“ The Italian government needs to immediately call back its ambassador from Israel as other countries in Europe have done , ” said Paolo Cento , a leftwing politician among the demonstrators .
“ This is extremely serious and has no precedent whatsoever in the history of international diplomacy . ”
Swedish police said more than 5,000 protesters marched from a central Stockholm square toward the Israeli embassy , carrying banners and shouting slogans .
Chanting “ Boycott Israel , ” they held banners saying “ Free Gaza , ” “ Put Israel on Trial , “ Israel to The Hague ” and “ Gaza Bleeds . ”
When Codemasters announced its intention to make a racing game based on a popular line of toy cars , the project sounded like a cynical ploy to make a quick pile of cash .
In fact , the game originally began life under the iffy title of California Buggy Boys before the Micro Machines branding was applied .
Despite Codemasters ’ reputation for cheap - and - cheerful budget games for home computers , Micro Machines proved to become one of the most playable racing games available for the Nintendo Entertainment System when it made its debut in 1990 .
Playing to the humble NES ’s meagre hardware , Micro Machines was a simple , top - down racer where tiny toy cars zipped across such everyday landscapes as a breakfast table or a garden .
Fast and highly addictive , the Micro Machines games really came to life when played against human opponents , and the brilliant Micro Machines 2 : Turbo Tournament for the Sega Megadrive offered a hugely entertaining four player mode .
4. Burnout 3 : Takedown – PlayStation 2
The Burnout series arguably reached its zenith with this third entry , where the elements established in the first two games – the boost bar , which rewarded reckless driving with a pulse - quickening burst of extra speed , and the spectacular crashes when said reckless driving inevitably went awry – were honed into a game of pure racing perfection .
Brilliantly designed courses through built up cities and twisting country roads served as the backdrop to some of the most rewarding , addictive driving thrills yet achieved on a console .
There ’s nothing quite like driving along the wrong lane of a highway , the oncoming traffic skidding to avoid you , until your boost bar fills and you ’re propelled forward into the screen past your opponents .
An intensely private person who rarely gives personal interviews , Mark Shuttleworth spoke to Memeburn.com about what he values most in life , why he does n’t want to be a role model , and what the sexiest technology is around today .
The founder of Canonical and Ubuntu , Shuttleworth became a billionaire after selling Thawte to Verisign .
He is the founder of investment company Here Be Dragons and The Shuttleworth Foundation , which aims to make the world a better place by investing in education and technology projects that drive significant social change .
Shuttleworth also made headlines around the world when he became the first African to travel into Space .
Memeburn : Who is Mark Shuttleworth ?
[ This question is followed by a long , contemplative silence and then the answer . ]
Mark Shuttleworth : I would say that I am primarily a student .
The best thing about me is that I am a fast follower .
I have n’t invented that much in life , but I have connected ideas and people .
MB : What do you value most ?
MS : Health and nature and youth .
I am very conscious of the fact that life is very short .
I feel like we are all on a short fuse so we should make the most of our time here .
It is very dangerous to think that life is indefinite because then there is no urgency to get on and do anything .
I think a good life is about getting out and doing things .
You may live for another 50 years , but if you get on with it you ’re likely to enjoy it so much more .
MB : Do you miss South Africa ?
MS : Very much so .
Oddly I have been living abroad now for a decade and that has had an impact .
But I will always be South African , and I introduce myself as South African because I am very proud of all the complexities of that heritage .
It would be impossible to be me if I were n’t South African .
Life in South Africa has this extraordinary combination of being rich and edgy at the same time .
It is something that is common to a number of frontier environments , so I miss that .
It is a little bit frustrating to be in places where things work the whole time , because there is less to be done and it is easier to get complacent in those environments .
The places in the world that are agents of change are usually places like South Africa or Malaysia , or places where there are real challenges to solve and people have to come up with interesting new ideas and ways of solving them , .
I miss that , and the sense that things really do matter , which I think is true of South Africa .
I do n’t miss the sense that the only thing that matters is South Africa .
South Africa has to be part of the global dialogue .
But because the country is so rich and complex , people often do n’t realise the importance of understanding , participating with , or connecting to the countries around them in the broader world , and I think that is frustrating .
Having lived abroad , most of the people I have worked with in London were from all over the world , and there is always this uneasy frontier situation because you are never going to be local where you are .
But then you are also never going to be local back home either .
I guess I ’ve become a bit of a wanderer to a certain extent .
I have very strong roots and a very strong identity , and I feel I have a responsibility to work globally and think globally whether I am inside South Africa or outside of South Africa .
MB : What do you think about others wanting to emulate your success ?
MS : What they do n’t realise is that I have also had tricky setbacks .
I am not necessarily a role model in every respect .
I would hate to live a life where I am afraid to cross lines that may cause affront .
I guess I have it a little bit easier because I am not that much in the public eye .
But I did n’t set out to be a role model , nor did I set out to be perfect .
I set out to learn , and in that sense , my life has been very satisfying .
Another thing is that there are very few things that I do that you could only do if you were in my very lucky position .
I live off a tiny fraction of the wealth that I am entrusted with .
What I am saying is that you can live a perfectly satisfying life without the same kinds of success that I have had .
Ultimately many people do .
It is a bit of a red herring to think that you need to get as lucky as I did in order to be something in life ; I think that ’s just nonsense .
I meet people all the time that I admire , that live satisfying and thrilling lives .
But they have very different kinds of adventures , and challenges , and successes .
MB : What are the most exciting innovations you ’ve seen internationally ?
MS : The things that are most exciting are the ways in which computing is becoming wearable .
It is becoming so tightly integrated into our daily lives .
The computer is n’t just a work device any more .
It ’s an entertainment device , it ’s a communication device , and it ’s how we talk to our friends and our families .
We spend more time talking to our friends and our families through a computer than we do in person .
I do n’t think that is a bad thing , because we are talking to people wherever they are in the world .
This whole sense of truly immersive wearable computing – you could be walking down the street and you will just know that your friend is in a book shop over there , so you can just walk in and say hi – is wonderful because of the immediacy of that computing .
On the other side , there ’s this huge sense of scale in cloud computing where we are headed for data centres with ten million computers in a data centre that will be a big city of machines .
Obviously I am passionate in making sure that Ubuntu is first choice for platforms for that sort of environment , which is something of a challenge that will keep me out of trouble .
MB : Do you still have dreams ?
MS : I have different dreams now .
I guess I like making or finding interesting connections .
I think that opportunity always presents itself in person .
So in order to find opportunity you have to be out there and talking to people .
So most of my dreams are about things that I have come across or into contact with and which could grow and turn into big open dreams .

Lena Redux Student Prank Becomes Football 's New Favorite Hymn
Lena who ?
A group of university students have remade Eurovision 's winning song into an unofficial World Cup football anthem .
But what started as a joke , has resulted in a cult hit -- and a record contract .
Von Cathrin Schaer
Today in victim - blaming , a pamphlet making the rounds in Bristol , VA alleges , " some rape victims would not have been raped if they had dressed properly . "
The upside : Bristol residents , including a local pastor , are outraged .

In an incident that should have earned her some hazard pay , 19 - year - old Keshia Canter was handed the pamphlet as she worked the drive - through at Bristol 's Hi-Lo Burger .
Claire Galofaro of the Bristol Herald Courier reports that the woman who proffered the pamphlet told Carter , " Even though nothing is showing , you 're being ungodly .
You make men want to be sinful . "
Elements of Canter 's " ungodly " look : jeans , boots , a zebra - print t- shirt , a black jacket ( zipped up ) , and a lip ring .
The pamphlet suggested , " You may have been given this leaflet because of the way you are dressed , " and later made the following claim :
Scripture tells us that when a man looks on a woman to lust for her he has already committed adultery in his heart .
If you are dressed in a way that tempts a men to do this secret ( or not so secret ) sin , you are a participant in the sin .
By the way , some rape victims would not have been raped if they had dressed properly .
So can we really say they were innocent victims ?

Aside from being pretty much the most upsetting possible example of concern - trolling ( oh btw , your clothes could make someone rape you ! ) , the leaflet 's claim is offensive to men and women alike .
Unfortunately , this kind of victim - blaming has been all too common lately , and a recent British study showing that a majority of women think victims are sometimes at fault for rape made it seem like rape culture was thriving on both sides of the pond .
But in an encouraging turn of events , Bristol residents are taking a stand against it .

Sandra G. Rasnake , sexual assault program director at Bristol 's Crisis Center , says the leaflet 's claim is " insulting to men . "
She elaborates , " The men that I know and associate with are not so lust - driven that they cannot control their urges .
By this person 's argument , everyone working at Hooters deserves to be raped . "
And it 's not only those employed in dealing with assault who are angry .
Pam Yates , Keshia Canter 's mother , says ,
What if my daughter had been a rape victim ?
I hope that they never handed this to anyone , especially a young person , who 's been through that and struggles with that daily .
And then they get handed something that says they are at fault .
I cannot believe that a Christian , someone who walks in God 's shoes , would have made this .

Perhaps the most heartening response comes from one of Bristol 's prominent Christians , Rev. Bill Houck , pastor of Northstar Christian Church .
While he supports " modest dress , " Houck also says ,
It is this type of thinking that would cause a woman not to report being raped and to somehow think it is her fault .
As a Christian , a father and a husband , that is a horrific statement .
The rapist is wrong period .

Houck 's words underscore the fact that religion does n't have to include disrespect for women , and that being a Christian does n't mean seeing rape as a response to a woman 's " temptation . "
While it 's upsetting to read this latest missive in the long annals of victim - blaming , it 's good to know that Bristol 's residents are stepping up to defend a woman 's right to safety and control over her own body — no matter what she wears .

Brad DeLong wonders how the proponents of tight budgets and tight money are prevailing in the midst of mass unemployment , low interest rates , and incipient deflation .
It ’s actually not all that surprising .
Horrifying , but not surprising .
The case for expansionary policies in the face of a slump is intellectually difficult ; Keynes described the writing of the General Theory as a painful process of discovery , and so it is .
The natural instinct of almost everyone is to think that tough times require tough measures , and that if the economy is suffering , the government should tighten its own belt .
It would take a clear consensus from economists to overcome that natural bias .
And that consensus has , of course , been lacking — largely because a significant proportion of the economics profession has spent the last three decades systematically destroying the hard - won knowledge of macroeconomics .
It ’s truly a new Dark Age , in which famous professors are reinventing errors refuted 70 years ago , and calling them insights .
On top of that , anti-stimulus appeals to a fundamental meanness of spirit that is always present in the political world .
The super - asinine we shall always have with us .
May I say that I expected something like this ?
It ’s part of the reason I was so anxious to see Obama go for the maximum stimulus possible : it seemed obvious that he would have only one shot .
And because that shot was n’t big enough , I really do think we ’re looking at a lost decade .
Would you like to manually choose which graphics card is in use on a MacBook Pro ?
You can now keep track of which GPU is in use and then manually switch between the two graphics cards included within the MacBook Pro series , thanks to a third party utility called gfxCardStatus .
It ’s a free app and to be able to switch GPU on the fly all you need to do is download a utility called gfxCardStatus , we ’ll show you how it works .
How to Manually Switch Graphics Card on MacBook Pro
You can get gfxCardStatus here for free , it ’s donationware so if you ’re thrilled with the app throw the developer a couple bucks .
Once you have gfxGraphicsCardStatus installed you will gain a menu item which you can use to toggle the GPU card to the integrated GPU or the discrete GPU .
Install gfxCardStatus and then click on the “ i ” menu when it appears in the menu bar on the Mac Choose “ Integrated ” or “ Discrete ” , or “ Automatic Switching ” to let Mac OS determine what GPU to use on its own
It ’s really that simple to switch your GPU manually .
The nice little app is works with the all modern MacBook Pro’s and later with an integrated GPU and discrete GPU .
If you do not have dual GPU capabilities the tool will not work .
The third party app allows GPU switching and GPU control , as well as the following :
* Manually switch between the MacBook Pro GPU ’s on demand through a menu bar application !
* gfxCardStatus tells you which card is currently in use by adjusting the menubar icon ; showing an ‘ i ’ icon for the Intel HD GPU , and an ‘ d’ icon for the discrete card , whether it ’s an NVIDIA GeForce or an ATI or AMD card .
* Lists dependent processes to see which apps are currently using the discrete GPU processor .
This functionality really should have been baked into a system update for these MacBook Pro’s .
Since the 330 m is power hungry , if you want to preserve battery life you ’ll almost certainly be better off using the Intel HD Graphics card instead .
Note that the application is “ a little bit on the buggy side ” according to Engadget , and we ’d recommend approaching anything that modifies your hardware settings with some caution .
Another GPU option is available for some Macs , and that is to disable GPU switching on MacBook Pro , but that ’s only an option on newer model hardware .
The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) granted more than 100 certifications for use of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) by various federal , state and local government agencies last year , and is on pace to approve about 70 applications this year .
But some officials are complaining that existing federal regulations are inconsistent and confusing , potentially stymieing their plans for takeoff .
Arguably the most vocal critic on that front is the chairman of the aviation committee for the International Association of Chiefs of Police ( IACP ) , the world 's oldest and largest nonprofit group of police executives .
Donald Shinnamon , whose day job is public safety chief for the small city of Holly Hill , Fla . just north of Daytona Beach , charges that the FAA is applying its rules inconsistently and defying federal laws about government - operated aircraft .
" There is an immediate need by state and local public safety personnel for unmanned aerial systems , " he said at an unmanned systems confab here this week .
But by his interpretation , the FAA 's rules mean " it 's OK to fly a model aircraft but not OK to fly an aircraft in search of a murder suspect " without its permission .
To perform an effective job of aerial surveillance , however , means flying drones at higher altitudes -- which takes them directly into the flight path of everything from medical helicopters and Cessnas to commercial jets landing at nearby airports .
Pilots do n't object to police use of drones , but say they must follow the same rules ( including avoidance procedures ) and undergo similar certification procedures as airplanes .
Police agencies insist that would be too expensive .
Drones have been in use for years by the military and appear to be only growing in popularity .
Now they 're also becoming alluring to resource - strapped local police departments .
They say UAVs can deliver the same -- or better - - bird 's - eye view as a helicopter or airplane , but at a fraction of the cost and with arguably less training and personnel required .
( IACP , for its part , has n't taken an official stance on the issue but is tracking it , a spokeswoman said . )
Say there are swimmers caught in a riptide , and county officials want to send help .
It would cost anywhere from $ 450 to $ 1,200 per hour for L.A. County Sheriff 's Office Commander Charles " Sid " Heal to send one of its helicopters , but a UAV would cost " cents on the dollar , " he said .
" And if it crashes , it goes into the ocean and floats away . "
The FAA admits it is still wrestling with how exactly to keep tabs on the emerging robots ' use .
It is in the process of finalizing a five - year " road map " for introducing UAVs into the national airspace .
For now , it has imposed a number of rules that attempt to draw lines based on who 's operating the UAV and for what purpose .
Civilian or commercial UAV users can apply for an " experimental certificate " that allows flights for research and development or crew - training purposes .
( As of late June , the FAA had issued 13 of those documents . )
Hobbyists who intend to fly the machines like model airplanes -- that is , at altitudes less than 400 feet , away from populated or " noise - sensitive " areas -- are generally off the hook .
" Public " users , which include the military and government agencies , are allowed to apply for a permission document known as a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization , or COA for short .
They 're supposed to show they can control the aircraft in question .
If granted , that certificate allows use of a drone in a defined airspace for a particular period of time , usually up to a year .
A COA often contains other restrictions , too , such as limiting flight time to daylight hours or requiring that a ground observer or accompanying " chase " aircraft keep visual contact with the airborne UAV at all times .
Cumbersome certification process
That process is where officials like Shinnamon say the FAA is off the mark .
Generally speaking , manned aircraft operated by military or government agencies can be operated without a pilot 's license or an " airworthiness " certificate , which governs whether a vehicle is fit to fly .
In Shinnamon 's view , it 's contrary to public aircraft law for the FAA to require UAVs operated by the same entities to go through a different " cumbersome " certification process .
He also took issue with the flight limitations imposed by the certificates , suggesting law enforcement and public safety agents need to be as nimble as possible when incidents occur .
Other proponents of UAV use have argued that if hobbyists are generally off - limits to FAA control , small UAVs operated under similar circumstances should be treated the same .
For instance , after L.A. County officials test - launched in a park last summer without prior permission from the FAA , the agency indicated it was n't allowed .
The occurrence left Commander Heal , who presides over that project , scratching his head .
In a telephone interview , he voiced incredulity that , by his interpretation , teenagers could fly model airplanes in the same parks without the FAA 's permission but a police - operated drone , which he argued could have " immediate " life - saving applications in his region , had to be certified .
FAA spokeswoman Alison Duquette defended her agency 's practices .
The decision to require special permission for UAVs reflects what the FAA views as unique risks presented by unmanned vehicles , which the agency believes are n't yet technologically capable of making all the perceptions that a manned craft can .
" Our first role is to do no harm , " she said in a telephone interview .
The civilian piloting community would like to see the FAA do even more to rein in UAV use , citing grave concerns about the potential for dangerous collisions .
The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association ( AOPA ) has been lobbying for UAVs to be held to the same rules as manned aircraft .
The group is also leading a committee under the umbrella of the RTCA , an international aviation standards body , to devise uniform industry guidelines that would likely steer the FAA 's own deliberations about new regulations .
UAVs " should be safetly integrated into the national airspace system with other users , and what that means is having some ' see and avoid capability ' to detect other aircraft and the ability to communicate with air traffic control stations , " AOPA spokeswoman Kathleen Vasconcelos said in a phone interview .
Pilots undergo extensive training on collision detection and avoidance .
Planes that fly at night are required to have certain types of lights , for instance .
Operating an aircraft near busy airports ( in government parlance , " Class B " airports ) requires a transponder that broadcasts its altitude .
And during all flights that take place in poor weather or higher than 18,000 feet above sea level , the pilot must be in radio contact with controllers .
Last summer , AOPA reported the Gaston County , N.C. police department to federal authorities when it discovered that the officials were flying a small UAV for surveillance purposes without a certificate , which prompted the FAA to prohibit its use .
Privacy advocates have also raised alarms about the idea of new digital eyes patrolling the skies .
The Electronic Privacy Information Center 's Melissa Ngo , who has written about the privacy implications of increased government use of UAVs , said it 's important to sort out a number of questions about the potential for their misuse and abuse .
For instance , authorities tout UAVs as being far quieter than their manned counterparts , which some authorities view as the answer to residents ' complaints about helicopter noise levels .
But the presence of virtually silent and increasingly smaller machines raises obvious privacy concerns .
" Have state and local police departments spoken to city councils or the public at large about the use of UAVs to watch the general public in everyday activities ? " she said in an e-mail interview .
" Civilian use of UAVs by state and local police would create a world of constant , unseen surveillance . "
Local officials are n't necessarily looking for unfettered UAV - driving rights , Shinnamon said .
Ideally , the FAA will be able to work with state and local government officials to come up with UAV - specific regulations , which address things like how high the drones can fly , how far they can travel from their operator , and whether they need to be in the driver 's line of sight .
" Once we overcome this regulatory issue , I honestly think the use of this technology will explode at the local government level because it offers just so many benefits to us and the ability to serve our citizens , " Shinnamon said .
Heal , whose office tested a drone last year but has not yet secured formal permission to use it , said he does n't " detect any sense of urgency " on the FAA 's part to make its regulations simpler for local officials to follow .
" We 're going to do this ; this is coming , " he said .
" And ( the FAA ) can jump on this train or they can run along behind it , but it is going to leave without them . "

Inside Gorleben A Visit to Germany 's Proposed Nuclear Waste Site
Will an exploration mine in Gorleben become Germany 's permanent nuclear waste dump ?
After a 10 - year moratorium on research on the project , the government in Berlin is preparing to resume work .
It will likely still take years before the site is approved for storage .
SPIEGEL ONLINE took a peek inside a mine that has been the source of protests for years .
Sen .
Ben Nelson ’s most prominent constituent ( if you exclude Tom Osborne , of course ) is billionaire investor Warren Buffett , who was opposed to provisions in the financial reform bill that would regulate existing derivative contracts .
There was a move afoot to exempt those pre-existing derivatives from the bill ’s reach , but it failed .
That may explain why Nelson deserted his party and voted not to bring the bill to the floor for debate .

In my last post in the 7 Baby Steps series , we looked at Baby Step 1 , saving up an emergency fund of $ 1000 .
You save up that baby emergency fund in order to insure yourself against the risk of life 's little emergencies that have a way of popping up at the least opportune time .
If you do n't save up that money as an insurance policy , you can be assured that your plan to get out of debt will be set back many times over by many little “ emergencies ” .
Continues after Advertisement
If you have an emergency fund saved , no new debt is created , and you just take the time to re-stock that emergency fund in case of further expenses .
Today we will look at Baby Step 2 , paying off all debt using the debt snowball .
Pay Off Your Debt Using The Debt Snowball
Now that you ’ve got your $ 1000 emergency fund saved , it 's time to get intense about paying off all your debt .
Dave Ramsey likes to call this getting “ gazelle intense ” , in reference to the bursts of speed and intensity a gazelle will use in order to get away from a cheetah ( or in our case , debt ) .
For many people this step is the longest in your 7 baby steps .
If you ’ve built up a lot of debt over the years in the form of student loans , auto loans , credit card debt and other things , it probably took you a long time to get so far in the hole , and it will take quite a while to dig your way back out .
But you CAN get back out !
If you 're not so far in the hole , getting out of debt can happen a lot quicker , and you can get on to the next steps of building up a larger emergency fund , paying off your home early , building wealth and giving more .
If you 've gotten this far and you have n't done a budget yet , now would be the time to get started .
Figure out where you are in regards to your income , expenses and your debt obligations .
Do a zero based budget and make sure that every dollar is accounted for – because every extra dollar is now going to be going to debt reduction .
Once you ’ve got all of your income , expenses and debt listed , follow these steps to get rid of your non-mortgage debt .
( Mortgage debt is paid off separately in another baby step , so exclude it for now )
The Debt Snowball
Here is a rundown of the debt snowball plan .
Put all your debts in order from the smallest balance to the largest balance .
.
After you have paid for food , clothing , transportation and a roof over your head ( the necessities ) , pay the minimum payments on all of your debts .
.
Put any extra money left over towards paying off the smallest debt first .
first .
Pay off your smallest debt , and then “ snowball ” the money you were paying on that debt over to the next largest debt .
Continue paying off the next largest debt , and when that one is complete , roll it all over to the next largest debt until you are completed .
That 's not too hard , right ?
Just pay off your debts from smallest to largest until they are all paid off !
Other Methods Besides The Debt Snowball
If you read the personal finance blogs you 'll read a lot of posts talking about how Dave Ramsey is bad at math , or how he is not giving people the right advice because his debt snowball plan is n't technically the most mathematically sound way to get out of debt .
Those people say that in order to do it the best way , you would need to list your debts from the highest interest first , to the lowest interest , and pay them off in that order .
Once they ’re in order you pay the minimums , and put any extra money towards the highest interest debt first .
Some have called this the debt avalanche .
Mathematically the debt avalanche IS best way to get out of debt .
Ramsey has even said on his radio program that the debt snowball is n’t the best way to get out of debt if all you 're paying attention to is the numbers .
But he believes it is the best way to get out of debt because it does a better job of taking the psychology of debt reduction into account .
When you pay off the smaller debts first you get what he calls “ quick wins ” that give you that psychological boost that help to keep you motivated and keep you on the road to debt reduction .
With other methods , too often you ’ll end up burning out and giving up on debt reduction .
In his eyes , after working with thousands of people to get out of debt , he has found the debt snowball to be the most sustainable debt reduction method .
When it comes down to it , however , I do n't think you can go wrong with either method .
As long as you 're disciplined , and are determined to get out of debt , do the one that works best for you – or do a hybrid of the two !
As Dave Ramsey says , “ You ca n’t go wrong getting out of debt “ .
No New Debt , And A Commitment To Paying Off The Old Debt
If your plan for debt reduction is going to work , you need to make sure that you 're doing a budget , that you 've committed to creating no new debt , and that you work HARD towards paying off your old debt .
Here are a few things you can do to help make your debt snowball much more effective .
No new debt in the form of loans , credit cards , mortgages or anything else !
Try being credit card free .
It is n't what our society would suggest , but it can be very freeing to pay cash , not not use credit cards .
Sell stuff .
If you 're like most families you probably have a lot of extra stuff laying around the house .
Sell as much of it as you can on ebay , craigslist , and via garage sales .
Take on an extra part time job .
A lot of people will take on a temporary side job in order to aid their quick destruction of debt .
Work hard , sell things , get extra jobs , and just get intense about your debt reduction plan and you ’ll have your debts paid off in no time !
What ’s your opinion of the debt snowball ?
Have you used it , or the debt avalanche – or another system – to get out of debt ?
Tell us about it in the comments .

The victim of a car accident can require as many as 100 pints of blood — that 's blood from 100 generous donors across the country , meticulously matched for blood type and screened for diseases .
More than 38,000 blood donations are needed daily in the U.S. , but only 38 percent of Americans are eligible to donate blood , and of those , only 8 percent actually do .
The list of eligibility criteria that a donor must meet is long , ranging from simple characteristics such as age and weight requirements to more complex ones surrounding medical and travel history .
Among them is the risk for human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
Certain factors thought to increase this risk , including illicit intravenous drug use and , if you 're a man , having had sex with another male even once since 1977 , currently prohibit you from ever donating blood . *
But AIDS research pioneers from the Jewish General Hospital and McGill University in Montreal think the ban is outdated .
In their report , published May 25 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal , they call for a change in policy , which was created by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in 1983 — before HIV / AIDS screening tests were available .
" Today 's technology makes it almost impossible for HIV to slip through , and the total ban puts a huge burden on blood agencies and the blood supply , " said lead author Mark Wainberg , in a prepared statement .
He helped in the discovery of 3TC , one of the first drugs to control HIV .
" We constantly have blood shortages that would not occur , perhaps , if we had a more reasonable policy . "
History of the ban
In the spring of 1981 cases of an unusually aggressive form of Kaposi's Sarcoma , a benign tumor that normally affects older people , and a rare lung infection called pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) began to be reported among gay men in New York City and California .
To learn more about the transmission of this new , seemingly acquired form of immunodeficiency , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) formed a Task Force on Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections .
In July task force coordinator James Curran told The New York Times there was no apparent danger to nonhomosexuals .
But by December , cases of PCP were also turning up in illicit intravenous drug users .
By the summer of 1982 , 452 cases or the new disease in 23 states had been reported to the CDC .
Haitians and hemophiliacs also appeared to be vulnerable , resulting in the moniker , the " 4 - H club " ( for homosexuals , heroin addicts , Haitians and hemophiliacs ) .
That December a 20 - month old child who received multiple blood transfusions died from AIDS - related infections .
The first cases of possible mother to child transmission were also reported .
Evidence that the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS , the term for the disease officially adopted by the CDC in September of that year ) could spread through blood transfusions caused panic .
And in January 1983 a CDC - held public meeting led to a consensus to ban blood donation by men who have sex with men .
The rationale : AIDS was a blood - borne disease and the majority of cases had occurred in homosexual men .
" The 1983 ban has hung on so long , unfortunately , because many people became infected by HIV in the early ' 80s through blood transfusions , and they have mounted continuing pressure on the blood agencies to maintain the ban , " Wainberg said in a prepared statement .
" While we can sympathize with them , this no longer makes sense in 2010 , and with each passing year it makes less sense . "
Since 1983 the number of heterosexually transmitted infections has increased dramatically , accounting for about a third of total infections in the U.S. in 2006 , according to CDC estimates .
But up to 47 percent of all HIV infections ( 62 percent in men ) are still transmitted through male - male sexual contact , according to CDC statistics from 2007 .
Nevertheless , current blood screening techniques can effectively eliminate the risk of HIV - infected blood , regardless of whether it came from a donor who has had such contact in the past year or the past 33 years .*
Weighing the risks and benefits
After a pint of blood is collected , it is processed into its transfusible components : plasma , platelets and red blood cells .
A dozen tests are then performed to establish the donor 's blood type and screen for infectious diseases .
Since 1985 the American Red Cross has used enzyme immunoassays to test for antibodies to HIV - 1 and HIV - 2 .
A positive result is confirmed using at least one additional technique to identify virus - specific antibodies .
Whereas the number of AIDS cases that resulted from transfusions before screening measures were implemented is unknown , CDC - reported mathematical estimates based on HIV - positive donation rates in 1985 suggest that as many as 7,200 transfusion recipients could have received infected blood components .
Antibody - based screening measures " virtually eliminated " the risk of transmission by transfusion , which now sits at about one in two million , according to the Red Cross .
In 1999 the Red Cross added another technique to its screening process call nucleic acid testing , which detects the virus 's own genetic material using the same gene - amplifying techniques used to test for paternity .
The test reduces the amount of time that a person 's tested blood could yield a false negative , called the " window period , " from three to six months with antibody screening alone ( because it takes time for the body to produce antibodies to the virus ) to about 12 days .
" This " window period " is often the most dangerous time for transmission , because the host may be unaware that he or she is carrying the virus and might unknowingly donate infected blood , " Wainberg and colleagues report .
But they argue that improvements in screening technology make the current total ban on donors who have had male - male sexual contact pointless , and that the temporary one - year ban implemented for heterosexuals with multiple partners should also be applied to men who have sex with men .
Currently , women who have had sex with men banned for life are only prevented from donating for a year .
The major benefit of allowing men who have sex with men to donate blood after a reasonable temporary ban would be a boost in the blood supply , the authors say .
" In the United States it has been estimated that a five - year deferral would lead to an increase of 71,400 donors , whereas a one - year deferral would lead to an increase of 139,000 donors , " they report .
They also say blood clinics would stop losing healthy donors who refuse to donate because they find the current bans offensive .
" When a discriminatory policy is n't justified by the science , it leads to controversy , " Wainberg said in a prepared statement .
" We 've seen protests and boycotts of blood drives on Canadian campuses , so I think the blood agencies would be better off if they agreed with us .
I suspect , honestly , that many of them already do , in private . "
But protecting patients who receive blood is the priority for agencies like the Red Cross .
" More important than increasing the donor pool is ensuring the safety of the blood supply , " says Red Cross spokesperson Molly Dalton .
The agency has tried to get the FDA to reexamine the guidelines as new scientific evidence becomes available , Dalton says .
But the latest discussions , which took place in May 2007 , did not lead to any changes .
" We ’re continuing to work with the [ American Association of Blood Banks ] to ensure that policies are fair and based on scientific evidence , " Dalton notes .
The policy , she adds , will be reviewed again at a meeting this summer .

WASHINGTON —
The operational leader for Al Qaeda in Afghanistan was killed in an American missile strike in Pakistan ’s tribal areas in the last two weeks , according to a statement the group issued late Monday that American officials believe is correct .
The militant leader , Mustafa Abu al - Yazid , an Egyptian , was a top financial chief for Al Qaeda as well as one of the group ’s founders , and was considered by American intelligence officials to be the organization ’s No. 3 leader , behind Osama bin Laden and his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahri , another Egyptian .
“ His death will only be a severe curse by his life upon the infidels , ” Al Qaeda said in a statement issued to jihadist Web sites and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group , which monitors statements by jihadists .
A United States official said American intelligence analysts believed the statement from Al Qaeda was accurate .
They said the death of Mr. Yazid , also known as Saeed al - Masri , was a significant setback to Al Qaeda ’s ability to help plan and support cross - border attacks against American and allied forces in Afghanistan from its haven in Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
A Chattanooga police officer who arrested a man last week for traffic violations as the man desperately was trying to get his wife to a hospital has been placed on paid administrative leave , according to a police spokeswoman .
Officer James
Daves will remain on leave pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation into his conduct , Lt. Kim Noorbergen said via e-mail .
Mr. Daves followed Eric Jesse Wright to Erlanger hospital last Wednesday night after he ran two red lights while trying to get his wife , Aline Bacelar Wright , to the emergency room .
She was showing signs of having a stroke , she told the Times Free Press last Friday .
Mr. Daves told Mr. Wright at the emergency room that he would be arrested , according to the Wright family .
By Friday , Mr. Wright had been booked into the Hamilton County Jail and charged with seven crimes , including assault on police , disorderly conduct , reckless endangerment , felony evading arrest , driving on an expired registration and two counts of traffic - signal violations .
For complete details , see tomorrow 's Chattanooga Times Free Press .
The controversial article which led to today ’s resignation by the top commander in Afghanistan and David Petraeus as his replacement is discussed as if it was a celebrity gossip column .
It actually makes the substantive case that the occupation of Afghanistan is regressively destructive .
An article by Michael Hastings at Rolling Stone has led to the resignation of the commander of the U.S. - led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) occupying Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal .
The media bru-haha is focused on the ISAF commander ’s ( COMISAF ) loose - tongue , a blatant disrespect from him and staff toward the Obama Administration , U.S. diplomats , congresspeople and NATO allies in the coalition .
Sadly , the highlight of the article is where Mr. Hastings concludes : “ counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never - ending demand for the primary product supplied by the military : perpetual war ” .
Furthermore , The New York Times keenly pointed out last night at its editorial page that the “ article does n’t suggest any serious policy disagreements between the president and Gen. McChrystal ” .
Gen. McChrystal , all have reasonably been under the impression , is on the same page with his replacement , Gen. David Petraeus — now - former commander U.S. Central Command and central crafter of the U.S. counterinsurgency doctrine ( COIN ) that has been successfully sold to President Barack Obama .
The president ’s campaign rhetoric to replicate the Iraq Surge in Afghanistan displayed that he was sold long before becoming president .
“ This is a change in personnel , but it is not a change in policy , ” he assured the press in his speech today .
The article notes the military is likely to want another troop surge next summer when the president is scheduled to begin cutting down the U.S. military presence .
In the first paragraph , Mr. Hastings notes how the Afghan occupation is becoming more and more overtly unilateral :
He ’s in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction , in essence , that we actually have allies .
Since McChrystal took over a year ago , the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United States .
Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government , forced the resignation of Germany ’s president and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops .
McChrystal is in Paris to keep the French , who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan , from going all wobbly on him .
Mr. Hastings notes that Gen. McChrystal “ first encountered Obama a week after he took office , when the president met with a dozen senior military officials ” at the Pentagon and “ sources familiar with the meeting ” said “ McChrystal thought Obama looked ‘ uncomfortable and intimidated ’ by the roomful of military brass ” .
In March 2009 , the president added 21,000 troops to the occupation of Afghanistan and soon after replaced Gen. David McKiernan with Gen. McChrystal as COMISAF .
Upon having his first a one - on - one with the president as the new COMISAF , Gen .
McChrystal expressed that there was no commitment from the president to the occupation operations :
Their first one - on - one meeting took place in the Oval Office four months later , after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job , and it did n’t go much better .
“ It was a 10 - minute photo op , ” says an adviser to McChrystal .
“ Obama clearly did n’t know anything about him , who he was .
Here ’s the guy who ’s going to run his fucking war , but he did n’t seem very engaged .
The Boss was pretty disappointed . ”
The fact is that the operations in Afghanistan revolve around the Petraeus Doctrine of COIN .
Another fact is that COIN is a complex , multi- faceted effort to ‘ save ’ a ‘ failed state ’ .
Another fact is that foreign occupation does not save failed states .
The military aspects of COIN , in practice , have varying effects as occupation forces live among the local population in some places , police the streets in others , perform tactical raids in others , execute all - out military offensives in others , etc. :
COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the enemy , but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild , or build from scratch , another nation ’s government — a process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years , if not decades , to achieve .
The theory essentially rebrands the military , expanding its authority ( and its funding ) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare :
Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps .
In 2006 , after Gen. David Petraeus beta - tested the theory during his “ surge ” in Iraq , it quickly gained a hardcore following of think - tankers , journalists , military officers and civilian officials .
Nicknamed “ COINdinistas ” for their cultish zeal , this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution for Afghanistan . [… ]
“ The entire COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people , ” says Douglas Macgregor , a retired colonel and leading critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal .
“ The idea that we are going to spend a trillion dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense .
In its most idealistic format , benchmarks are required to evaluate and modify strategy and direct tactics ; more importantly , measuring the status quo to the benchmarks and sub-marks are crucial to the execution .
Even then , everything can go perfect , and it can all be for naught .
Yet , the commander - in - chief of the Afghanistan occupation showed little concern for the actual strategy , tactics or for what he is aiming with prolonging and expanding the occupation to the top commander of the mission .
The controversy that has risen from Mr. Hastings ’ article seems to be ridiculous .
In the early days of being with the COMISAF and his squad and his conclusion after the month with them was :
The general ’s staff is a handpicked collection of killers , spies , geniuses , patriots , political operators and outright maniacs .
There ’s a former head of British Special Forces , two Navy Seals , an Afghan Special Forces commando , a lawyer , two fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts .
They jokingly refer to themselves as Team America , taking the name from the South Park - esque sendup of military cluelessness , and they pride themselves on their can - do attitude and their disdain for authority .
The fact is that COIN is not , has not and most likely will not be effective to secure the Afghan population from militant resistance to the Kabul government and the quest for governing power by the more organized factions of the resistance .
Pres. Obama entertained — what was referred to at the time as — “ the four options ” , which The Washington Post ( WaPo ) reported at the time would cost around $ 1bn per thousand troops .
Christi Parsons and Julian Barnes reported them at the Los Angeles Times as :
At least 40,000 additional troops , the ‘ medium - risk ’ option from General Stanley McChrystal , the top commander of the U.S. - led occupation — the ‘ low - risk ’ option being an escalation of 80,000 troops ; 34,000 additional troops , including 23,000 for combat and support , 7,000 for the occupiers ’ command base and 4,000 trainers , officials confirmed over the weekend ; 20,000 additional troops , the ‘ high - risk ’ option from Gen. McChrystal — ” known by military planners as ‘ the hybrid ’ , ” WaPo reports , “ to shore up security in 10 to 12 major population areas ” ; and around 12,000 additional troops , supported by Senator John Kerry ( D - MA ) , more geared toward counterterrorism operations , maintaining the same troop level for counterinsurgency .
To execute a COIN strategy in Afghanistan , the U.S. and its allies would have needed to commit at least another 100,000 troops to begin building an Afghan Security Force of 400,000 .
This assessment was made by us before military officials confirmed the number , 600,000 , as the amount of ISAF forces plus those allied with the Kabul government needed to begin stabilizing Afghanistan .
“ Nation - building would be impossible even if we knew how , and even if Afghanistan were not the second - worst place to try , ” George Will wrote last September at WaPo .
“ Afghanistan would need hundreds of thousands of coalition troops , perhaps for a decade or more .
That is inconceivable . ”
The president pledged 30,000 more troops , showing he “ had thrown his weight , however hesitantly , behind the counterinsurgency crowd ” , according to Mr. Hastings , but adds that realism is gutting the COINdeologues :
Today , as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan , the prospects for any kind of success look bleak .
In June , the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000 , and the number of IEDs has doubled .
Spending hundreds of billions of dollars on the fifth - poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population , whose attitude toward U.S. troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile .
The biggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on , prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it as a “ bleeding ulcer . ”
In June , Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year .
The president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire : a quagmire he knowingly walked into , even though it ’s precisely the kind of gigantic , mind - numbing , multigenerational nation - building project he explicitly said he did n’t want .
Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to accomplish in Afghanistan , it ’s going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm .
“ It ’s not going to look like a win , smell like a win or taste like a win , ” says Maj.
Gen. Bill Mayville , who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal .
“ This is going to end in an argument . ”
Where the COINdeologues ’ fire is fueled is that :
While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable command of all military aspects of the war , there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side .
Instead , an assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio : U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry , Special Representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke , National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into the mess , from John Kerry to John McCain .
This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal ’s team to call the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan .
“ It jeopardizes the mission , ” says Stephen Biddle , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal .
“ The military can not by itself create governance reform . ”
Mr. Hastings notes the “ strained ” relationship with Gen. McChrystal and Amb . Eikenberry , a three - star lieutenant - general stationed in Afghanistan in 2002 - 05 :
The relationship was further strained in January , when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New York Times .
The cable was as scathing as it was prescient .
The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal ’s strategy , dismissed President Hamid Karzai as “ not an adequate strategic partner , ” and cast doubt on whether the counterinsurgency plan would be “ sufficient ” to deal with Al Qaeda .
“ We will become more deeply engaged here with no way to extricate ourselves , ” Eikenberry warned , “ short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and chaos . ”
Gen . McChrystal called this a “ betrayal ” , adding the purpose was to the ambassador to “ save face in the history books … if we fail ” .
Mr. Hastings adds his “ handling ” of Afghan President Hamid Karzai is the “ most striking example of [ the COMISAF ’s ] usurpation of diplomatic policy ” :
It is McChrystal , not diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke , who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead Afghanistan .
The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government , and since Karzai is not considered credible by his own people , McChrystal has worked hard to make him so .
Over the past few months , he has accompanied the president on more than 10 trips around the country , standing beside him at political meetings , or shuras , in Kandahar . [ … ]
This is one of the central flaws with McChrystal ’s counterinsurgency strategy :
The need to build a credible government puts us at the mercy of whatever tin- pot leader we ’ve backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his cable .
Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less - than - ideal partner .
“ He ’s been locked up in his palace the past year , ” laments one of the general ’s top advisers .
The Kandahar province has been seen as a territory “ vital ” to control by ISAF and planned a heavy military surge to do so which was scheduled for this month .
After a surge into the Marja province — that has been dubbed a self - defeating failure , in theory and practice , by any reasonable standards — has left a larger mess , the Kandahar Surge has been delayed for a couple of months .
The illegitimacy of the Kabul government is highlighted by the atrocities of ISAF operations since Pres. Obama began his troop surge in March 2009 .
Since announcing his second surge , more ‘ hearts and minds ’ have been lost :
In the first four months of this year , NATO forces killed some 90 civilians , up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over .
In February , a Special Forces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover - up , and in April , protests erupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus , killing five Afghans .
“ We ’ve shot an amazing number of people , ” McChrystal recently conceded .
Despite the tragedies and miscues , McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that the U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone .
It ’s “ insurgent math , ” as he calls it — for every innocent person you kill , you create 10 new enemies .
Mr. Hastings notes that the soldiers are not very mathematical , as many are dissatisfied and fearful of being told to show restraint .
And this is a key flaw to COIN doctrine : you can have a great cause and policy , but the executors are n’t deeply comprehensive of the rationale behind getting from point A to B to C , etc. Mr. Hastings reported of a talk Gen. McChrystal had with soldiers :
The Taliban , he insists , no longer has the initiative — “ but I do n’t think we do , either . ”
It ’s similar to the talk he gave in Paris , but it ’s not winning any hearts and minds among the soldiers .
“ This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks , ” McChrystal tries to joke .
“ But it does n’t get the same reception from infantry companies . ”
During the question - and - answer period , the frustration boils over .
The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use lethal force , about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence .
They want to be able to fight — like they did in Iraq , like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal .
“ We are n’t putting fear into the Taliban , ” one soldier says . [… ]
A soldier complains that under the rules , any insurgent who does n’t have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a civilian .
“ That ’s the way this game is , ” McChrystal says .
“ It ’s complex .
I ca n’t just decide :
It ’s shirts and skins , and we ’ll kill all the shirts . ”
If there ’s a lack of evidence , how is the person they ’re watching ‘ go free ’ an insurgent ?
An insurgent is simply an illegitimate rebel and legitimacy is defined as that which is consistent with the will of the Kabul government and ISAF .
When both are illegitimate , as they are , COIN is fitting a square peg into a brick wall , as Mr. Hastings added :
“ Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing , ” McChrystal says , citing an oft - repeated maxim that you ca n’t kill your way out of Afghanistan .
“ The Russians killed 1 million Afghans , and that did n’t work . ”
When the man heading the forces ’ specialty is the excessively terrorizing village and home raids in the dead of night and targeted extrajudicial assassinations , moral , legal and rational legitimacy is an battle .
Though , the article does a lot to display Gen.
McChrystal ’s devotion to reprimanding civilian killers among the ISAF ranks , the night raids have just been dirtier and intelligence agencies handle the assassinations in Pakistan .
Mr. Hastings concluded with damning historical facts and the conditions on the ground di8splaying that COIN is a fantasy and using it as a means of occupying Afghanistan , of all places , is insane :
When it comes to Afghanistan , history is not on McChrystal ’s side .
The only foreign invader to have any success here was Genghis Khan — and he was n’t hampered by things like human rights , economic development and press scrutiny .
The COIN doctrine , bizarrely , draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent memory : France ’s nasty war in Algeria ( lost in 1962 ) and the American misadventure in Vietnam ( lost in 1975 ) .
McChrystal , like other advocates of COIN , readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy , expensive and easy to lose .
“ Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan , ” he says .
But even if he somehow manages to succeed , after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland , the war will do little to shut down Al Qaeda , which has shifted its operations to Pakistan .
Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools , roads , mosques and water - treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock .
“ It ’s all very cynical , politically , ” says Marc Sageman , a former CIA case officer who has extensive experience in the region .
“ Afghanistan is not in our vital interest – there ’s nothing for us there . ”
But facts on the ground , as history has proven , offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course .
Even those closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home does n’t begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things are in Afghanistan .
“ If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war , it would become even less popular , ” a senior adviser to McChrystal says .
Such realism , however , does n’t prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from dreaming big : Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year , as Obama promised , the military hopes to ramp up its counterinsurgency campaign even further .
“ There ’s a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next summer if we see success here , ” a senior military official in Kabul tells me . [… ]
After nine years of war , the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack .
The very people that COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there .
Our supposed ally , President Karzai , used his influence to delay the offensive , and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things worse .
“ Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem , ” says Andrew Wilder , an expert at Tufts University who has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan .
“ A tsunami of cash fuels corruption , delegitimizes the government and creates an environment where we ’re picking winners and losers ” — a process that fuels resentment and hostility among the civilian population .
So far , counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never - ending demand for the primary product supplied by the military : perpetual war .
There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using the word “ victory ” when he talks about Afghanistan .
Winning , it would seem , is not really possible .
Not even with Stanley McChrystal in charge .
EDIT : Mr. Hastings was on AntiWar Radio with Scott Horton to discuss his article .
The interview was posted at AntiWar.com last night ( 8:09 ) :
http://scotthorton.org/radio/10_06_23_hastings.mp3
Gareth Porter aptly noted at Inter Press Services ( via AntiWar.com ) the replication of Bush Administration policy in the decision to make Gen .
Petraeus the new COMISAF :
In calling on Petraeus , the Obama administration appears to be taking a page from the George W. Bush administration ’s late 2006 decision to rescue a war in Iraq which was generally perceived in Washington as having become an embarrassing failure .
But both Obama and Petraeus are acutely aware of the differences between the situation in Iraq at that moment and the situation in Afghanistan today .
Ein Leck in der Gaszuleitung ist schuld am Unglück in St. Pölten , sagen Sachverständige .
Ob Fahrlässigkeit vorliegt , ist noch offen .
Fünf Bewohner konnten nur noch tot aus den Trümmern des Wohnhauses geborgen werden .
Ein massives Leck in der Gaszuleitung hat die Explosion eines Wohnhauses im Süden St. Pöltens ausgelöst , durch die am Donnerstag in der Früh fünf Menschen ums Leben gekommen sind .
Diese Ursache hat der Sachverständige Christian Tisch vom Bundeskriminalamt ( BK ) am frühen Freitagabend genannt .
Es dürfte damit ein Stromausfall am Mittwochabend in Zusammenhang mit dem Gasaustritt und der späteren - explosion stehen .
Der St. Pöltner Staatsanwalt Karl Fischer bezeichnete es als " für juristische Schlussfolgerungen zu früh " .
Es gehe noch um die endgültige Ermittlung der Konkretursache und dann darum , ob jemanden ein Vorwurf zu machen ist .
Der Vorwurf von fahrlässiger
Tötung bzw .
fahrlässiger Gemeingefährdung werde untersucht .
Was die Explosion im Endeffekt ausgelöst hat , ist weiterhin unklar .
Möglich sei ein defektes Gerät im zerstörten
Haus oder ein offenes Feuer , etwa von einer Kerze oder einer Zigarette .
Gasexplosion in St. Pölten : Bilder der Katastrophe
" Kein Zweifel " über Identität der Opfer
21 Stunden hat der Großeinsatz der Feuerwehr gedauert , bis am Freitag um 4.45 Uhr Brand Aus gegeben werden konnte .
Die Bergung der vermissten Personen - zwei Männer und drei Frauen - dauerte vom späten Donnerstagnachmittag bis nach Mitternacht .
" Das letzte Opfer wurde um 0.50 Uhr geborgen " , sagte Bürgermeister Matthias Stadler .
" Es ist so , dass die Toten die fünf Vermissten sind " , sagte Alfred Schüller vom Landeskriminalamt NÖ .
Darüber bestehe an sich " kein Zweifel " .
In dem Haus wohnten ein älteres Ehepaar ( der Mann war ein passionierter Kunstmaler ) , dessen Tochter sowie eine Enkeltochter .
Zudem dürfte der Lebensgefährte der Tochter zu Gast gewesen sein , als die Explosion erfolgte .
Dort gemeldet , aber zum Unglückszeitpunkt außer
Haus waren außerdem noch eine weitere Enkeltochter sowie ein nicht verwandtes Ehepaar .
440 Tonnen Schutt durchsucht
Um sicherzugehen , dass sich außer den vermissten und geborgenen Personen keine weiteren Opfer im Schuttkegel befinden , wurde der gesamte Unglücksbereich " bis zum letzten Ziegel " durchkämmt , schilderte Bezirksfeuerwehrkommandant Dietmar Fahrafellner .
Rund 440 Tonnen Schutt mussten dafür großteils händisch von der Feuerwehr auf eine Lkw - Flotte verladen werden .
Bis zu tausend Leute im Einsatz
Seit Donnerstag 8
Uhr , dem Zeitpunkt des Unglücks , waren rund 600 Feuerwehrmänner im Einsatz .
Für die Arbeiten mit schwerem Atemschutz benötigten sie über 700 Atemluftflaschen .
Dazu kamen noch rund 200 Kräfte der Rettungsdienste Rotes Kreuz sowie Arbeitersamariterbund sowie zahlreiche Beamte des Magistrats , der Stadtpolizei sowie des Bundes - und Landeskriminalamts .
Insgesamt waren " in Spitzenzeiten bis zu tausend Leute im Einsatz " , so Stadler .
Verletzt wurde seitens der Einsatzkräfte niemand .
Einige angrenzende Häuser wurden durch die Explosion sehr stark beschädigt - es wurden Fensterstöcke und Türen herausgerissen .
Andere Gebäude hätten dagegen nur innerlich sichtbare Schäden .
Eine Kommission soll die Schäden erheben .
Gemeinsam mit dem Land Niederösterreich wolle man helfen , alle Schäden auch über Versicherungssummen hinausgehend abzudecken , wurde versprochen .
Spendenkonto eingerichtet
Die Stadt St. Pölten hat unter dem Titel " Hilfe für die Opfer der St. Pöltner Gasexplosion " ein Spendenkonto ( Nr. 918755 ) bei der Sparkasse NÖ Mitte - West ( BLZ : 20256 ) eingerichtet .
Im Rathaus seien sehr viele Anrufe eingegangen , wie man helfen könne teilte Bürgermeister Stadler .
Der Magistrat habe darauf reagiert .

WASHINGTON — Several days before the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , BP officials chose , partly for financial reasons , to use a type of casing for the well that the company knew was the riskier of two options , according to a BP document .
The concern with the method BP chose , the document said , was that if the cement around the casing pipe did not seal properly , gases could leak all the way to the wellhead , where only a single seal would serve as a barrier .
Using a different type of casing would have provided two barriers , according to the document , which was provided to The New York Times by a Congressional investigator .
Workers from the rig and company officials have said that hours before the explosion , gases were leaking through the cement , which had been set in place by the oil services contractor , Halliburton .
Investigators have said these leaks were the likely cause of the explosion .

Some 6,000 Israelis demonstrated in Tel Aviv Saturday to protest the Israeli raid that killed nine people on the Gaza aid flotilla earlier this week , and were met by several hundred rightists , Haaretz reports :
Leftist and rightist demonstrators clashed Saturday night in Tel Aviv as more than 6,000 Israelis gathered to protest the Israeli raid on a Gaza - bound aid ship earlier this week , in which nine activists were killed .
The protest was originally planned by to mark the anniversary of the Six Day War which broke out 43 years ago today .
Among the organizers were left wing parties Meretz , Hadash and Peace Now organization .
The demonstrators carried banners saying " The government is drowning us all , " " We must stride for peace , " and " A right wing government = clear and immediate danger to state security . "
As the demonstrators marched from the Rabin Square near the city 's municipal building toward the Tel Aviv museum several hundred of rightist demonstrators followed the demonstration .
Upon their arrival at their final destination the spirits heated up between the two opposing groups , during which they two sides cursed and shouted at each other .
A smoke grenade was also hurled at the left wing demonstrators from an unknown source .
...
Hundreds of left wing demonstrators carried Israeli flags to establish that they were not demonstrating against Israel nor questioning the country 's existence , but rather protesting the actions executed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's right - wing government .
Meet the New Boss , Part Two : Executive Power and Police Statism
It ’s been argued by more than one person that Scott Brown defeated Martha Coakley , in part , because Coakley was such a lame and unappealing candidate .
But there ’s one point that has n’t received much attention : her cynical role , as a district attorney , in preventing the release of a man who was almost certainly innocent of the crime he ’d been convicted of .
George Amirault , who along with his mother and sister operated the Fell ’s Acre Day School , was convicted in 1984 of serial child molestation .
Child testimony in that case , which was subsequently recognized as part of a bizarre trend of runaway daycare molestations in the eighties , included accusations that Amirault inserted a butcher knife into a four - year - old ’s rectum ( there was no medical evidence of injury ) .
Children also implicated two imaginary persons , “ Mr. Gatt ” and “ Al , ” as well as a therapist investigating the case .
After the case was reopened eight years later , Superior Court Judge Isaac Borenstein remarked that “ Every trick in the book had been used to get the children to say what the investigators wanted . ”
When the Board of Corrections voted 5 - 0 to release Amirault in 2000 , prosecutor Coakley persuaded the governor to keep him imprisoned .
In the words of Mark Rosenthal , “ Coakley , placing more value on defending the infallibility of her office and on appearing tough on crime than on seeing that injustice be rectified , embarked on a public - relations crusade to keep Gerald Amirault behind bars . ”
Think about that , and what it entails .
Think about your reaction when you learn of some private citizen , like that creepy old guy in Austria , who holds someone against their will for years .
There ’s not a dime ’s bit of moral difference between such people and the typical prosecutor , Republican or Democrat , who will almost certainly choose to knowingly keep an innocent person in prison rather than suffer political embarrassment .
Those people would sooner kill Anne Frank than jeopardize their precious conviction ratios .
Police statism and executive authoritarianism are hardly Republican monopolies .
Under Barack Obama , who campaigned on a rollback of the Bush administration ’s executive power grab , the new Democratic Justice Department has frequently found itself defending against challenges to powers ( for example , indefinite detention without trial ) asserted by Bush .
Obama has publicly disavowed waterboarding and other “ tough interrogation techniques ” ( aka torture ) , and intends to shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison .
But he still supports indefinite detention in principle , and intends to use Bagram Air Base for essentially the same purpose as Gitmo — the difference being that it ’s less visible and less controversial than a prison camp just off of Florida .
The growth of the executive National Security State and of domestic police statism has been a bipartisan trend since World War II , aside from a brief period of retrenchment after Watergate and the Church Committee .
The growing police statism of the Bush years was a direct continuation of trends under Clinton , who built in turn on the creeping authoritarianism of Nixon and Reagan .
The USA Patriot Act consisted , in considerable part , of provisions Clinton had sought in his 1996 counter - terrorism legislation but was unable to railroad through Congress .
And one of the most dangerous powers exercised by Bush — the power to classify domestic organizations as “ terrorist ” by executive fiat and then subject their assets to civil forfeiture — was actually granted by the Clinton - era legislation .
Those of us who hoped for a Church Committee - style rollback of Bush ’s power grabs were sadly disappointed .
At best , we ’re back to the incremental growth of bureaucratic Caesarism , instead of dramatically fascistic claims of total authority by monsters like Cheney and Giuliani .
For every authoritarian right - winger like Orrin Hatch or Richard Shelby , there ’s an equally cop- and prosecutor - friendly Democrat like Dianne Feinstein or Charles Schumer .
Most recently , Obama ’s Supreme Court nominee Elana Kagan has shown herself to be quite friendly to executive power .
That really should n’t be a surprise coming from a Solictor General .
She is not only friendly to extraordinary claims of executive national security powers , but a fairly hard - line defender of law enforcement in criminal justice issues .
“ In her current position , ” Radley Balko writes , “ Kagan and her subordinates have filed amicus briefs and argued the pro-prosecution , pro-law enforcement position in every criminal justice - related case to come before the Supreme Court since Obama took office . ”
She has weighed in against attempts to curtail state civil forfeiture practices more draconian than those at the federal level , against proposals to hold prosecutors civilly liable for knowingly manufacturing evidence , against a guaranteed right to confront forensic experts , and against attempts to require post - conviction DNA testing when it might exonerate a prisoner .
If you seriously expect state functionaries to make good faith efforts to reduce their own power ( when they ’re in office , that is ) , you really should stop and think about it for a while .
Doctors will this week call for a total ban on all homoeopathic treatment on the NHS .
Hundreds of delegates to the British Medical Association 's conference are expected to support seven motions all opposed to the use of public money to pay for remedies which they claim are , at best , scientifically unproven and , at worst , ineffective .
Critics of the 200 - year - old practice also want junior doctors to be exempt from working at homoeopathic hospitals because it goes against the principles of evidence - based medicine .
Sugar pills and placebos have no place in a modern health service , they say , especially as the NHS must find £ 20bn in savings over the next few years .
But supporters claim homoeopathy helps thousands of patients with chronic conditions such as ME , asthma , migraine and depression who have not responded to conventional medical treatments .
The British Homoeopathic Association ( BHA ) points out that less than 0.01 per cent of the massive NHS drug bill is spent on homoeopathic tinctures and pills .
Nevertheless , the conference will also hear calls for homoeopathic remedies to be banned from chemists unless they are clearly labelled as placebos rather than medicines .
The over - the - counter market is worth around £ 40 m a year , and rising , according to Mintel , the consumer research organisation .
The increasingly vocal dissent follows a report from MPs on the influential science and technology select committee earlier this year , which also urged the NHS to cease funding homoeopathic treatments due to a clear absence of scientific proof about its efficacy .
The MPs criticised current licensing and labelling regulations which " lend a spurious medical legitimacy " to homoeopathic products which are no more than sugar pills .
But supporters of homoeopathy are passionate and are unlikely to take this lying down .
David Tredinnick , the Tory MP and outspoken supporter of complementary therapies , tabled an early day motion last week calling on the Government to reject calls for a centrally driven ban and instead allow local services and clinicians to continue making decisions .
A protest will take place outside the BMA conference in Brighton on Tuesday .
Homoeopathy works on the principle of " like cures like " , so patients are treated with diluted substances that would cause the same symptoms in a healthy person .
More than 55,000 NHS patients are seen through four homoeopathic hospitals every year , while thousands more are treated by dually trained GPs .
This costs the NHS an estimated £ 10 m , a tiny fraction of the overall £ 80 bn health budget .
But this is too much for some .
Dr Gordon Lehany , a psychiatrist and chair of the BMA 's Scottish junior doctors committee , who has proposed one of the motions calling for the ban , said it was wrong to spend even a few million pounds of public money on useless homoeopathic treatments when new cancer drugs were being rejected on the grounds of cost .
He said : " We 're not saying homoeopathy should n't happen , just that it should not be funded on the NHS .
While placebos can work , they are not medicines , there is no active ingredient , and so if people want to access these expensive sugar tablets , they have to find the money themselves . "
Cristal Sumner , the BHA 's chief executive , said : " While we are in the grip of new financial austerity measures , the BMA is launching an attack on a field of treatment that helps thousands of people in a cost - effective way .
Patients have been able to access homoeopathy on the NHS since its inception .
It is an important treatment choice for both patients and doctors . "
The patient : ' It saved my life .
Is n't that worth something ?'
Helen Llewelyn , 31 , from Haringey , north London , suffered from chronic physical pain and depression as a result of endometriosis which conventional medicine , including surgery , failed to help .
She was referred to the Royal London Homoeopathic hospital in 2007 .
" My homoeopathic treatment includes two medicines for physical pain and one for my mental state .
I saw a homoeopathist three times and it worked .
I come from a very scientific background ; I 'm certainly not someone drawn naturally to homoeopathy .
I did n't think the medicines would work but they did .
I thought anti-depressants would work but they did n't .
So I do n't put a lot of merit on the placebo argument .
To say that funding for homoeopathy on the NHS is a waste is extremely short - sighted .
It will save thousands on useless medicines .
More importantly , it saved my life .
Is n't that worth something ?
I would still be clinically depressed otherwise .
It made me much more productive in society . "

House rolls tend to be mixes of a lot of things , and the more items they pile on , the more expensive the item is .
While one or two huge rolls may be filling , you will probably have a more nutritious and filling meal by ordering a few basic items , along with the satisfaction of variety .
Often you are paying for the name of the roll rather than the food itself , and these rolls can be loaded with fillers such as panko ( bread crumbs ) , sprouts , and other tasty yet valueless items .
By ordering rolls or sushi / sashimi with items that you specifically want , not only will you spend less money , but you will get more of what you specifically want .
2 . Order the sashimi platter
Fat and protein fill you up much better than carbohydrates ( rice ) so a nice filling meal can easily be made of the default sashimi platter , or a few choice pieces of sashimi .
Restaurants will often have a sashimi platter that is a great value versus ordering sashimi items a la carte .
One additional benefit of the platter is that you may end up trying items that you would never think to order and find that you enjoy them .
And if you particularly dislike a certain type of fish , they will often make substitutions if you ask .
3 . Drink tea with your meal
You might be tempted to try that great house wine , or the Momokowa Diamond sake , but green tea is usually offered for free , and goes well with sushi .
It ’s a great way to shave off a significant amount of cost from your overall bill , particularly for those who like to sip something other than water while dining .
Green tea is quite good for you as well , so it ’s a double benefit , you can keep to your budget and have a healthful and tasty treat too .
4. All You Can Eat
There are restaurants that offer “ all you can eat ” sushi buffets .
They usually wo n’t not include the top of the line items ( e.g. toro ) , but they will have plenty of the basics , and lots of them .
I used to do this every Sunday morning at a local restaurant and always rolled away satisfied .
By searching the Internet you can easily find many lists of these restaurants , so prepare yourself for a sushi feast without breaking the bank ( “ all you can eat ” is often abbreviated “ AYCE , ” which may come in handy for those searches ) .
5 . Eat more of the filler foods
Order a roll or a few pieces of sushi along with one of the many inexpensive items on the menu .
Often for just a few dollars you can also have a bowl of rice , or edamame ( steamed immature soybeans ) , soup , or some other simple yet filling food .
A bowl of edamame and a salmon roll can make for a filling meal .
6 . Make sushi at home
Easier said that done you may think , however making sushi at home is actually easier than you realize .
While the initial learning curve may be steep , it is fun .
Making sushi at home is significantly cheaper than going out to a restaurant , you would be amazed .
I make sushi at home just about every month and the costs are in line with any other normal dinner expense .
All you need is some sushi grade fish ( I get mine from Catalina Offshore Products ) , and a decent guide to making sushi at home , which I have made .
Meshi agare !

One Friday night in the early 1990s , my family rented an old black - and - white foreign film for our weekend 's entertainment .
I do n't recall the movie 's title , let alone what any of us thought of it when we viewed it , but I remember very clearly a bit of promotional copy on the front of the VHS cassette 's cardboard slipcase , in the space usually reserved for Siskel and Ebert 's thumbs : NOW WITH YELLOW SUBTITLES !
I 'd never thought of subtitles as having ( let alone needing ) colouration .
It was like being told that you can pour lemonade on your breakfast cereal : I guess it 's technically possible , but what would be the point ?
Now , many years and Google searches later , I realize that those yellow subtitles did merit at least some of the excitement .
For decades , the standard way to apply subtitles to a movie had been an intricate process in which tiny two - point letters were etched into a finished print of the movie using a combination of letterpress plates , chemical washes , and — as technology progressed — lasers .
Subtitles were white because the film emulsion beneath them had been scraped or burned away — the light shone through the letterforms ' pure celluloid .
It worked well enough for a dark scene shown in a darkened theater , but less so on television , and woe to the foreign film that ventured into the bright outdoors : translations hid out in the grass , got lost in the snow .
I guessed this latter bit during the course of the film — apparently to the exclusion of forming any long - term memories about plot or title — and by the time the credits rolled , I 'd concluded that the yellow subs ' reason for existence was also their downfall : they kept the dialogue legible at the expense of never letting you forget that you were reading something foreign to the original film .
Though they solved a technical problem , the yellow video subtitles undermined one of the main attractions of movie subtitles : the assumption that we can dive into another culture and , aided by comfortable , transparent technology , breathe as we 're accustomed .
Still from Fellini's 8 ½ ( 1963 ) .
Not the movie I 've been talking about , but you get the idea .
All stories , even true ones , become fictions in their telling .
Cinema is fiction upon fiction , making use of compressed and guided views , techniques of editing , novel ways of seeing , all of which have grown and evolved over more than a century of story upon story , film upon film .
Subtitles , at least when they 're not included in the initial release , scrape out their own fictitious space .
You have all the challenges of translation — how to transfer the content and nuance of speech from one voice to another — with the added technical constraints that whatever 's said must fit into short , center - justified , grammatically correct semantic units of no more than two lines , to remain on the screen for no less than one and no more than six seconds .
I got those last bits from the European Association for Studies in Screen Translation 's " Code of Good Subtitling Practice , " which makes for interesting reading .
The stipulation for grammatical correctness , for instance , references subtitles ' role as a model for literacy .
And it 's heartening to know that there 's a robust spoiler - alert clause in article 15 of the Code : " Subtitles must underline surprise or suspense and in no way undermine it . "
Character exposition via subtitle , in Buster Keaton 's College ( 1927 )
Subtitles precede the movies , having had a long and healthy career in printed matter of all types .
They worked their way into the silent cinema as printed cards explaining or commenting on what was happening in the filmed sequences .
Now these title cards are called intertitles , but in the day they were simply subtitles .
For instance , in her 1916 book How to write for the " movies " , Louella O. Parsons offers what might be the earliest version of Rule 16 of the Subtitler 's Code , about the dangers of the too - long subtitle :
You can not be prodigal in your language and interpose any unnecessary flowery phrases ; footage is too precious .
Neither must you express yourself in the stilted words of a child just learning to talk .
As an apt illustration of the too long subtitle we might give :
" It is surely the inevitable will of God that has brought this affliction upon us .
We must in this adversity bow our heads to His commands . "
That is all very well if you have one thousand feet of film at your disposal to give to your subtitle , but when you have a limited amount of footage why not be sensible and merely say :
" God 's will be done . "

A year later , Everybody 's Magazine ran a glowing profile of Anita Loos , who made her name subtitling Douglas Fairbanks swashbucklers and D.W. Griffith epics .
Loos 's subtitles for Griffith 's 1916 epic Intolerance : Love 's Struggle Through the Ages even employ footnotes to help viewers keep track of the film 's millennia - spanning quadruple - plotline .
Of Loo 's craft the journalist writes :
The subtitle has only been in vogue a few years .
It differs from the title — the wording between scenes which describes the action of the picture that is to come — in that it need not attend to business .
It is meant only for the audience , and though at times in the supposed speech of the characters in the film , it may be a mere comment outside the picture and addressed to the audience like the aside of our fathers ' theatre .
Silent film subtitle with explanatory footnote , Intolerance ( 1916 )
That 's what I miss about the post - talkie school of subtitles .
Often , waist - deep in the swamp of some obscure foreign film , what I want most is not to know what the characters are saying but to get an explanation of what 's going on , or just an acknowledgement of the strangeness of the story and the oddness of the foreign film - watcher 's predicament ( which , among other things , keeps us from really looking at the actors ' faces ) .
The only time this sort of meta- commentary comes in the sound era is in cinematic spoofs like Monty Python and the Holy Grail or the films of Carl Reiner .
A rare humourous subtitle from the sound era .
Monty Python and the Holy Grail ( 1975 )
Generally , though , when looking for subtitular humour , it 's up to the viewer to discover his own .
Subtitles , once suitably legible , generally do their best to disappear ; it 's only when something goes wrong in the presentation that their workings and complexity become apparent .

Not as good as Michael Jordan , but good enough in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai ( Hindi , 2000 )
Every month or two my friends will get a late - night email from me containing a fuzzy picture of my TV screen frozen in a moment in which the subtle subtitle machinery has gone wrong .
The film in question is usually from India ; Bollywood movies ( and their regional equivalents ) present a unique subtitling situation .
First of all , the target idiom is generally a variety of Indian English , which of course makes sense given the speech of both translator and average viewer , meaning that even perfect execution will often look odd to American eyes .
Secondly , Indian movies are generally quite long , and I 've noticed that the quality of the subtitles generally plummets by the time you enter the third hour of the film : grammar goes slack , dialogue becomes terse , there are long awkward stretches where you hear voices but see no words .
I figure the screen translation economics work out such that somewhere around the one hundred twentieth minute , anyone still watching is sufficiently committed to the film that there 's no additional return on investment for perfecting the subtitles that remain .
I imagine a video editing suite somewhere in the suburbs of Mumbai or Chennai , where the key moment arrives and the lead translator hands off the balance of the film to some sub - subtitler and heads outside for a well - deserved masala dosa .
A third - hour subtitle from Alai Payuthey ( Tamil , 2000 )
Finally , though , the greatest amount of South Asian subtitle strangeness often boils down to Article 12 of the Code : " Songs must be subtitled where relevant . "
It 's in their songs that Indian films dip deepest into translation - defying metaphor .
There 's only so much that can be done : the words may correspond but the underlying sentiment remains amusingly , thrillingly novel .
Romantic song lyric from Mullum Malarum ( Tamil , 1978 )
" I love watching movies with subtitles , " a friend told me recently .
" They make me feel so smart ! "
There 's something to that observation , especially when one knows enough of the film 's language to pick out familiar words as the translations flash by on the screen 's lower third .
When I watch a film like Fatih Akin 's wonderful The Edge of Heaven , my high school German comes streaming back .
At least , it seems that way .
I get the pleasant surface recall without the work of actually stringing sentences together on my own .
Das wird viel , um , schwerer sein ?
Speaking German in The Edge of Heaven ( 2007 )
Sometimes I take the smartness game too far and try to watch a film in one language I 've studied , with the DVD subtitles set in another ( say , a Hindi film with Spanish subs ) .
The end result is usually a headache - inducing mental tug - of - war that yields , if such a thing is possible , negative comprehension .
I ask myself , why would a person do that ?
Not to feel smarter , certainly not to get more out of the movie .
Could it be that I love watching movies with subtitles because they make me feel dumber ?
There 's something to that as well .
Watching movies that take place outside the realm of one 's cultural fluency always involves a tension of desires : we want to be transported , we want to fit right in .
There 's something comforting about not - quite - comprehension , about speech in all its nuance whittled down to one or two lines on the screen , coloured for contrast but still — when it works out right — invisible .
Following a poll on the Senate race in Illinois that had the Green candidate at 14 percent , a poll released today from PPP shows Green candidate for governor Rich Whitney – who received about 10.5 percent of the vote in 2006 – garnering 9 percent of the vote .
At this point in the polls in 2006 , Whitney was not even included in any polls , but he was in the low single digits in August ( see here ) .
Interestingly , Whitney was only seen favorably by 5 percent of those polled , much as Senate candidate LeAlan Jones only had 2 percent say they had a favorable opinion of him .
For both Greens , 80 percent or more of the respondents did n’t have an opinion one way or the other , showing that the biggest challenge in their campaigns might simply be making the Illinois electorate aware that they exist as an option .
The full poll results can be seen here .
The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a broad right of privacy for workers who send text messages on the job , ruling that supervisors may read through an employee ’s communications if they suspect rules are being violated .
In a 9 - 0 ruling , the justices said a police chief in Ontario , Calif. , did not violate the constitutional rights of an officer when he read the transcripts of sexually explicit text messages sent from the officer ’s work pager .
FOR THE RECORD :
Text message ruling :
An article in Friday ’s LATExtra section about a Supreme Court ruling rejecting a broad right of privacy for workers who send text messages on the job identified the lawyer representing the city of Ontario as Kent Ashland .
The city is represented by Kent L. Richland of the Los Angeles firm Greines , Martin , Stein & Richland . —
In this case , the high court said , the police chief ’s reading of the officer ’s text messages was a search , but it was also reasonable .
The court ’s ruling comes at a time when most U.S. workers spend at least part of their day talking on phones or sending messages on computers or cellphones , many supplied by their employers .
At issue was whether the 4th Amendment ’s ban on “ unreasonable searches ” puts any limits on searches by public employers .
The court said the limits were minimal , so long as the employer had a “ work - related purpose ” for inspecting an employee ’s desk or reading messages sent by the employee on an agency paging system .
This decision applies directly to the more than 20 million employees of state and local governments , as well as federal workers .
In the past , the court ’s decisions on the right to privacy have also influenced decisions in the private sector .
The ruling tossed out a privacy suit brought by a former police sergeant against the police chief in Ontario .
Concerned that officers were using their text pagers mostly for personal messages , Chief Lloyd Scharf decided in 2002 to read some of them .
He learned most of the messages sent by Sgt. Jeff Quon were personal , and some were sexually explicit .
Some of Quon ’s messages were sent to an ex-wife , others to a girlfriend .
In August 2002 , for example , the audit found Quon had sent or received 456 messages , but only 57 were work - related .
After learning his messages had been read , Quon sued Scharf and the city , and won a ruling from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals .
Its judges said there was no need to snoop through Quon ’s personal messages .
They noted that Quon ’s commanding officer had told him he could use the pager for personal messages , so long as he paid the cost .
But the Supreme Court disagreed .
The justices said the law tilts the balance in favor of the employer , not the employee .
A public employee has at most “ a limited privacy expectation ” when using a text pager supplied by the police department , the justices said .
“ Because the search [ by the police chief ] was motivated by a legitimate work - related purpose and because it was not excessive in scope , the search was reasonable , ” said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy in City of Ontario vs. Quon .
More than 20 years ago , in its only similar ruling , the high court had upheld the search of an office and the desk of a doctor who worked for a state - run hospital in Northern California .
In that case , the justices said that although the doctor had some right to privacy in his desk , hospital administrators could search if they had a legitimate basis for suspecting wrongdoing .
In Thursday ’s opinion , the court said the same rationale applied to messages sent on a texting system supplied by a public agency .
The lawyer for Quon called the ruling a setback for employees everywhere .
“ It is a very bad opinion , ” said Michael McGill , a lawyer in Upland .
“ They are chipping away at the constitutional rights of employees . ”
Kent Ashland , a lawyer for the city of Ontario , said the ruling vindicated the actions of the police chief .
“ This says what they did was reasonable in light of the circumstances , ” Ashland said .
He also said the ruling was not a complete defeat for workers .
“ The court says there must be a legitimate reason for the search .
It protects privacy to that extent . ”
The text messaging case drew wide interest among experts in workplace law and privacy .
Kennedy cautioned that the decision was narrow and did not seek to resolve all the disputes that will arise in an era when most employees spend much of their day using computers and cellphones .
Business lawyers said they advised employers to tell employees they did not have a right to privacy when they used a computer or cellphone supplied by the agency .
And employees need to heed the warning , said Damon Dunn , a Chicago lawyer .
They “ need to anticipate their communication devices may be monitored for seemingly routine business purposes , ” he said , “ even if the search reveals intimate and embarrassing information . ”

Taliban fighters are burying dirty needles with their bombs in a bid to infect British troops with HIV , The Sun reported Wednesday .
Hypodermic syringes are reportedly hidden below the surface of explosive devices , pointing upwards to prick bomb squad experts as they hunt for devices .
The needles are feared to be contaminated with hepatitis and HIV .
And if the bomb goes off , the needles become deadly flying shrapnel .
The tactic , used in the Afghan badlands of Helmand , was exposed by British ex-Army officer Patrick Mercer .
" Are there no depths to which these people will stoop ?
This is the definition of a dirty war , " Mercer said .
Razor blades are also being used .
All Royal Engineer and Royal Logistic Corps bomb search teams have been issued with protective Kevlar gloves .

There is a reason why life is built of cells , and why most cells are too small to see without a microscope .
It ’s easy in a small space to keep critical components squeezed together and close at hand , the better for the right enzymes to encounter the right substrates in a timely fashion and a million tiny bonfires to burn .
“ Cells are not like an aquarium where a fish swims by now and again , ” said Dr. Bassler .
“ They ’re jam - packed inside .
They ’re teeming with stuff .
They ’re like a house filled with necessary clutter , or New York City , or a Thanksgiving table loaded with so many dishes you do n’t know where you might put another plate . ”
Much of the cell ’s interior is taken up by the cytoplasm , which , as several biologists have gleefully observed , pretty much has the texture of snot .
The appearance of random ooze , however , is deceptive .
“ There ’s a beautiful architecture ” to the cytoplasm , Dr. Bassler said .
“ Everything is in the right place and bumping around , and the membrane holds them together so they ca n’t get away from each other . ”
When the Venter team inserted the synthetic version of the Mycoplasma mycoides genome into the cellular housing of the Mycoplasma capricolum bacterium , the newcomer took full advantage of the resident cytoplasmic wares .
It used the thousands of little biodevices called ribosomes to stitch together amino acids into new proteins .
It relied on complex molecular assemblages to maintain its DNA in working order and to duplicate that DNA when it was time to divide .
It thanked its lucky base pairs that a greasy lipid cell membrane and stiffer bacterial wall not only kept the inside appropriately , bioactively dense , but also kept the outside appropriately out , for an exposed cytoplasm would soon be scavenged for parts , most likely by a neighboring microbe .
Considered together , the modern cell is dauntingly complex , which is why most researchers in the youngish field of synthetic biology address only one or two pieces of it at a time .
Last year , George Church of Harvard Medical School and his colleagues reported that they had created an artificial ribosome .
James J. Collins , the co-director of the Center for Biodynamics at Boston University , is working on a synthetic DNA toggle switch , to flip genes on and off at will .
In Denmark , Dr. Rasmussen is seeking to design the most stripped - down minimalist suggestion of a functioning cell .
As he sees it , there are three basic capacities that a living cell must possess .
It must have a means of channeling free energy in the environment to meet its demands : that is , it must have some form of metabolism .
It must have an enclosure : a cell membrane .
And it must have the informational wherewithal to reproduce itself : a genome .
Dr. Rasmussen and his co-workers have devised reasonable if crude facsimiles of the three cellular non-negotiables , and they ’ve managed to merge two of them together in any given experiment — and in one case even all three of them .
The goal of contriving a self - replicating and autonomously metabolizing protocell , however , continues to elude them .
“ We have the instruments , ” he said , “ but it does n’t sound like an orchestra yet . ”
Just pick up your baton , hum a few bars , and give it three billion years .

Cannes canned , 1968
Surely the most dramatic year for this drama queen of world festivals was 1968 , during the student riots , strikes and general unrest that spread around France from Paris .
It led to directors Godard , Truffaut , Louis Malle , Polanski , Lelouch and Milos Forman calling press conferences , withdrawing films and demanding a shutdown in sympathy with the students .
After two days of sit-ins , the festival called a halt to proceedings .

A year later , British starlet Simone Silva let her bikini top slip off in front of photographers snapping Robert Mitchum , cementing the Riviera 's reputation as an eternal sunshine of the topless kind .

The only documentary ever to win the main prize is Fahrenheit 9/11 , Michael Moore 's anti-Bush , anti-Iraq war polemic .
It was awarded by a jury presided over by Quentin Tarantino – " on artistic merit " .
However , the victory for Moore , which made international front - page news , illustrates the often political nature of Cannes selections ; many believe that the juries can be " influenced " according to a French political agenda .

Hall , the No. 2 skater on NHL Central Scouting 's ranking of North American skaters for the 2010 Entry Draft , now leads the tournament with 4 goals and 5 points .
Dale Mitchell , Justin Shugg , Kenny Ryan and Adam Wallace also had goals for the defending Memorial Cup champions .
Goalie Philipp Grubauer , No. 15 on Central Scouting 's ranking of North American goaltenders , stopped 25 of 27 shots .
Jimmy Bubnick , a 2009 sixth - round pick of the Atlanta Thrashers , scored a pair of second - period goals for the Western Hockey League champion Hitmen .
Windsor , which became the first team in Memorial Cup history to win the tournament after losing its first two games , now is in line to become the first team to repeat as Memorial Cup champions since the 1994 - 95 Kamloops Blazers .
They 'll finish round - robin play with a game Tuesday against the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League champion Moncton Wildcats ( 6 p.m. MT , NHLN - US , SPORTSNET ) .
Mitchell , a 2007 third - round pick of the Toronto Maple Leafs , opened the scoring when he converted an Eric Wellwood pass just 2:38 into the game .
Just 1:17 later , with Cody Sylvester in the penalty box slashing , Hall took a breakout pass from fellow top prospect Cam Fowler and rifled a slap shot off the rush past Hitmen goalie Martin Jones .
Then , 8:15 into second , Hall made a nice move in the offensive zone and backhanded a drop pass to Shugg -- No. 53 on Central Scouting 's list -- and he wristed a shot past Calgary goalie Martin Jones to make it 3 - 0 .
Bubnick scored twice in a 3:13 span to pull Calgary within one , reviving memories of Saturday , when Calgary trailed Moncton 3 - 0 in the second and 4 - 2 with six minutes before rallying for a 5 - 4 victory .
Hall ended Calgary 's comeback hopes 12 seconds into the third period when he stripped Griffen Nyren of the puck at the Hitmen blue line , broke in alone on Jones and slid a shot between his skates to make it 4 - 2 .
Ryan , a 2009 second - round pick of the Maple Leafs , scored a short - side goal over Jones ' left shoulder with 3:04 left to close the scoring .
The goal was set up by Buffalo Sabres '09 first - round pick Zack Kassian using his 6 - foot - 3 , 214 - pound body to protect the puck deep in the Calgary end .
Wallace scored into an empty net with 41 seconds left to close the scoring , and on the ensuing faceoff fought Calgary 's Rigby Burgart .
The loss was Calgary 's first , and leaves them with the same 1 - 1 record as Brandon .
Those teams will play Wednesday ( 8 p.m. ET , NHLN - US , SPORTSNET ) , with the winner earning a spot in the semifinals .
Jeannette Bougrab , présidente de la Halde depuis avril 2010 .
AFP / OLIVIER LABAN -MATTEI
La nouvelle présidente de la Haute Autorité de lutte contre les discriminations et pour l'égalité ( Halde ) , Jeannette Bougrab , a fait voter début mai par le collège de l'instance de lutte contre les discriminations une délibération visant à doubler son indemnité mensuelle , qui passe de 6 900 à 14 000 euros , selon Le Canard enchaîné .
Une information aussitôt démentie par l'intéressée .
L'hebdomadaire précise que cette délibération , en date du 3 mai et qui ne figure pas sur le site de la Haute autorité de lutte contre les discriminations et pour l'égalité , a été votée sous le titre de " modification de règlement de gestion des professionnels " .
Toujours selon Le Canard enchaîné , la présidente de la Halde bénéficiera également d'une indemnité de résidence .
L'indemnité du prédécesseur de Mme Bougrab , Louis Schweitzer ( président du conseil de surveillance du Monde ) , était de 6 900 euros .
Mme Bougrab a " vigoureusement " démenti dans un communiqué " les accusations qui sont portées contre elle " et assure qu'il s'agit " de faits totalement faux et sans fondement " .
" Jeannette Bougrab perçoit donc la même indemnité de fonction que son prédécesseur , à savoir la somme de 6 135,32 euros net par mois " , assure le communiqué .
" Le chiffre de 14 000 euros annoncé par le Canard enchaîné est donc faux et infondé . "
" Comme pour tout agent de la fonction publique , et ce quel que soit son poste , Jeannette Bougrab touche également une indemnité de résidence correspondant à 3 % de son traitement " , ajoute le texte .
Jeannette Bougrab , 36 ans , a été nommée présidente de la Halde par un décret du 16 avril du président de la République , Nicolas Sarkozy .
Créée par la loi du 30 décembre 2004 , la Halde bénéficie d'un budget annuel de 11,9 millions d'euros et emploie quatre - vingt - sept personnes .
Elle était présidée depuis sa création par Louis Schweitzer , dont le mandat est arrivé à échéance le 8 mars .
L'existence de la Haute Autorité est menacée par un projet de loi en discussion au Parlement instituant un " défenseur des droits " qui remplacerait non seulement la Halde , mais aussi le défenseur des enfants , la Commission nationale de déontologie de la sécurité ( CNDS ) et le médiateur de la République .

hassan abdulla al thawadi , chief executive of the qatar 2022 bid , said the new stadiums would be linked with a new metro system and integrated into the bus network .
in the history of the FIFA world cup has never been staged in a middle eastern country .
the final decision will be announced on 2 december 2010 , when fifa president joseph s. blatter , who will announce the host nations in 2018 and 2022 , as decided by the 24 members of the FIFA executive committee .
SEATTLE — Baseball fans across the nation admitted Monday that the sight of Ken Griffey Jr. in a backwards baseball cap — an iconic image that once filled fans with joy and promise and a feeling that maybe , just maybe , eternal youth was possible — now makes them feel completely and utterly depressed .

" To see him wear his hat like that is actually heartbreaking , " 27 - year - old Seattle resident Peter Morley said of Griffey , who is hitting .152 this spring training .
" It just does n't look right anymore , you know ?
It does n't look natural . "
" Maybe it 's because his face is fatter , " Morley added .
As the 40 - year - old Griffey begins his 22nd season , fans say the sight of the once - lean five - tool player flipping his cap around is no longer synonymous with athletic excellence , infinite potential , or effortless cool .
Instead , they claim it is a sad reminder of how time takes its toll on the body , how we try to relive our former glory but never quite do , and how the prime of our life passes in an instant .

Fans also say that Griffey 's backwards cap reminds them , especially those of them in their mid- to late 20s , that their childhoods are most definitely over .
" This is going to sound weird , and I can't quite describe why , but seeing Griffey with his hat backwards used to make me feel like summertime .
Does that make any sense ? " said a fan , who wished to remain anonymous , adding that 16 years ago he purchased a fitted Seattle Mariners cap and wore it backwards every day to emulate Griffey .
" I can't believe I 'm saying this , but now I wear my hats forwards simply because he still wears his hat backwards .
It 's just too painful . "

Fans say the sight of Griffey in a backwards hat was most uplifting in the early to mid-1990s , before his move to Cincinnati .
Their joy at seeing his face beneath the bill - less cap reportedly peaked during the 1993 Home Run Derby when Griffey , hat turned round on his head , became the first player to hit the warehouse beyond the right field fence at Camden Yards .
However , during Griffey 's injury - plagued seasons from 2000 to 2007 , the sight of the backwards hat caused feelings of frustration , anger , and hopelessness , and eventually became associated in their minds with countless utterances of the phrase , " Get up , you 're fine .
Please get up .
Oh , God . "

The moment of complete and utter despair came yesterday as Griffey hit a now - rare home run during batting practice and cheering fans realized they were fooling themselves into thinking 2010 would be a fairy - tale season .
" I honestly believed that , when he returned to Seattle last year , seeing his Mariners hat turned backwards again would make me feel better , " said Seattle resident David Jaffe , adding that the sight of Griffey in a backwards White Sox cap sent him into a downward spiral he'd like to forget .
" But when I actually saw him it just made me more upset .
It finally dawned on me that I 'm this pathetic guy trying to recapture a moment in 1994 that will never exist again . "

According to a Sporting News poll , 43 percent of baseball fans can't even bear to look at Griffey wearing his hat backwards .
Another 24 percent say the visual reminds them of torn hamstrings .
And 33 percent of respondents said that images of Alex Rodriguez , Prince Fielder , or CC Sabathia wearing their hats backwards just are n't the same , and actually make things much worse .
One hundred percent of respondents said they 'd like to see Griffey play 10 more years and break every record there is , adding , " Fuck you if you do n't believe he can do it . "

" You know what ?
I saw a recent picture of him with his hat backwards , and if you looked at it from the right angle , you could believe he had just one chin , and the gray hairs in his goatee were actually nothing more than the spring sunlight shining through , " said Michael Dorenzo , who , despite being from New York , is a hardcore Seattle Mariners fan because of Griffey .
" He was ' The Kid ' again . "
" Jesus Christ , " he continued , suddenly growing morose .
" Who am I kidding ?
I guess we all have to die some day . "

When asked for comment during a press conference yesterday , Griffey , his hat backwards , smiled broadly , and for one brief moment appeared to be the same man who led Seattle to the ALCS in 1995 .
He then coughed wildly , sending the cap flying off his head .
A sense of rhythm , in my opinion , is the single most important aspect to guitar playing which separates the good guitarists from the bad ones .
I even feel that rhythm is more important than the choice of notes , believe it or not .
After all , it ’s not what you play that ’s important – but how you play it .
You could play the blues in an entirely wrong key but if your rhythmic phrasing is good , it will still sound good .
Unfortunately , rhythm is an area which beginners tend to neglect .
They prefer to practise fancy tapping techniques or sweep picking rather than getting the basics of rhythm .
And the result – sloppy guitar soloing .
So how can this be corrected ?
You must train yourself to have a good sense of rhythm and the best way of doing this is by using a metronome .
What I like to do is to play the major scale ( or any other scale that you prefer ) up and down the fretboard whilst keeping to the beat of the metronome .
I would play the scale using quarter notes , eighth notes and sixteenth notes , and I would also try varying and combining the rhythmic phrases .
Doing so trains you to recognize the differences between the different note durations .
Once you ’ve got the hang of these basic rhythms , you could try playing the scale in a swing rhythm or even triplets – the trick is to be aware of your rhythm and having full control of the timing of your notes .
Remember – sloppy rhythm makes a sloppy guitarist !

Atlas Shrugged , Ayn Rand ‘s 1,000 page allegorical novel about why people who read Atlas Shrugged are superior beings who “ welcome ” rapes from other superior beings , for that is what all superior beings find sexy , is slated to hit the big screen next year .
Directing and starring as the most superior “ welcomed ” rapist of all , John Galt , will be Paul Johansson of One Tree Hill fame .
Johansson will also direct .
Eroticized fascism has never looked so gauche !
In this edition of Sexist Beatdown , join Sady Doyle of Tiger Beatdown and I as we discuss the class concerns of objectivist rape fantasy , the inherent horniness of soft - core steel production , and whether Atlas Shrugged : The Paul Johansson Story can possibly be worse than the 1949 film adaptation of the Fountainhead ( trailer above , tl ; dr version below ) :
[ youtube:v=x8fkdBz2bds ]
SADY : AYN RAND !
AYN RAND AYN RAND .
AMANDA : Enough !
I am overcome by the urge to be sexually conquered by the small group of captains of industry who I believe to be my intellectual superiors !
SADY : A superior woman , I see !
Unlike the puling mewling soft - featured panderers of compassion and mooching !
And , like , school lunches !
Wicked inferior greed - children , feeding on the lunches of the elite !
AMANDA : It takes a special woman indeed to earn a hate fuck from that guy from One Tree Hill .
SADY : This was always my favorite part of Ayn Rand :
There ’s always ONE WOMAN who is , like , super - smart and super - competent and super - skilled at all this industry stuff that everyone else sucks at because they ’re socialists .
( Also , this woman is always thin and “ angular . ” “ Angular ” is the key defining visual attribute of Virtue , in the Rand lexicography . )
She is , explicitly , better at this than every man in the entire world .
EXCEPT FOR HER BOYFRIEND !
He chooses her to smack around or rape or whatever ( AND SHE LOVES IT ) because that is how very superior she is .
Like , I ’d really rather NOT be superior if it means getting slapped all the time ?
AMANDA : But from whence will you experience the natural eroticism derived from the physical and intellectual imbalance between the masculine and the feminine ?
SADY : I dunno .
Professional wrestling ?
AMANDA : Ayn Rand loves gender equality , to a point — - the point where she personally thinks it ’s really not sexy , at which point the greatest man in the world rapes the greatest woman in the world , who he knows will just love it .
Because that ’s how great she is .
Are inferior beings allowed to rape people in Ayn Rand novels ?
Or is middle - class intimate partner violence not as glamorous ?
SADY : Eh .
I think a lot of the rough sex derives from the sort of romanticized fascism of the novels .
It ’s all about the right of the strong to fuck over the weak .
There ’s not a lot of structural engagement — any attempt at it is met with some sort of “ YOUR BOOTSTRAPS ! PULL ON THEM ” lalala - I - ca n ’t - hear - you thing — but whatever .
So the right of , say , multimillionaire industrialists to pay their factory workers one cent a day is the same as the right of that multimillionaire factory worker to beat up his girlfriend .
The girlfriend gets to play the role of Good Inferior Person , in that she totally loves it and is honored by it .
Unlike those mewling puling mooching factory workers who want to raise the minimum wage enough to buy food with it , or whatever .
AMANDA : Totally not a turn on !
I have to admit that I would have loved to see a big - budget Atlas Shrugged cast with immaculately angular captains of Hollywood .
But I ’m pretty sure Ayn would n’t be too pleased that some more round - faced television actors are pinching pennies in order to realize her greatest work .
You know , maybe they ’re going to make this amazing recession - era Atlas Shrugged that puts an ironic spin on her glorification of wealth , but I think probably it ’s just going to be a half - assed dud that does n’t even capture the ridiculous grandeur of her stupid book .
SADY : Haha , yeah .
I myself am greatly looking forward to the movie .
Because the whole point of it — superior people make superior products and earn superior money because they ’re superior ! — is going to be really complemented by the spectacle of this broke - assed movie made with former WB stars for like five cents .
I mean , this is an expensive movie , on the face of it .
There are like gleaming teal sci- fi train tracks and uberbridges and megaweapons that can explode a goat and the whole thing ends in a postapocalyptic landscape with the death of civilization and everyone in it .
( SPOILER . )
How are they going to pull that off , Claymation ?
Or are they just going to film the speeches ?
The seventy - seven page speeches ?
Which , I guess , is the real draw .
Ayn Rand writes the stupidest things you ’ve ever heard , but she wraps it up in this package that says you have to be A GENIUS to agree with her , so you make your way through the seventy - seven page speech and you ’re like , “ I DO agree !
Plus I done gone and read me some philosophy !
I ARE a genius , Ayn ! ”
AMANDA : Right , I mean , I bet the crack team behind this production can find a way to paraphrase the whole thing .
Like : “ Not only am I a genius , but I ’m also one of the hottest people alive .
Also , I hate women just the appropriate amount , a position that is n’t sexist in the least , because a woman wrote this book , and anyone who disagrees is simply irrational . ”
KABLOOEY !
Or something .
SADY : Yeah .
Poor Paul Johansson .
I mean , I may personally feel that the best way to embody boyish blonde sexually irresistible Everydude John Galt is NOT to hire a dude who looks like the scarier variety of nightclub bouncer , but he ’s not only playing this iconic poor - hater :
He ’s directing the thing .
Quite possibly because they could n’t find anyone else .
AMANDA : How could you put a film like this in anyone else ’s hands but the most superior person available for every position involved , Paul Johansson of One Tree Hill ?
The positive here is that if Ayn Rand ’s novel is any indication , they wo n’t need to hire an editor .
SADY : Maybe he ’ll apply lessons learned in his previous erotic straight - to - video thriller “ Bitch Hunter 2 : Night of the Evils ” and EDIT IT AS WELL .
A true capitalist can do ANYTHING !
With no training !
It is like the Matrix !
What excites me is that they might be splitting it up into a trilogy .
As with the Harry Potter and the Lords of the Rings and so on and so forth .
Because , in the first part of this book , LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENS .
Dagny rides trains and Hank buys her a necklace and hates his wife .
People will be leaving the theater like , “ so … trains , then ? ”
AMANDA : There will , of course , be plenty of soft - core shots of steel tracks and shit .
I for one expect to be extremely aroused .
SADY : The history of Ayn Rand is that people are super - persuaded by her books until those books are filmed .
“ The Fountainhead , ” written by Rand herself , is notoriously bad , mainly because Rand insisted they keep in the speeches .
People were super - turned - on by the edgy rape scenes and the One Man Takes A Stand Against Society bullshit , and then they started filming it and were like … “ wait a second !
No -one actually talks like this !
And they ’re arguing over buildings the whole way through !
This shit is SUPER - BORING , oh noes ! ”
So , in a way , the “ Atlas Shrugged ” movie is the best thing that could possibly happen .
Provided you hate “ Atlas Shrugged . ”
AMANDA : I think enough people hate “ Atlas Shrugged ” that this movie actually has a fighting chance at the box office .
Astronomers have measured a superstorm for the first time in the atmosphere of an exoplanet , the well - studied " hot Jupiter " HD209458 b .
The very high - precision observations of carbon monoxide gas show that it is streaming at enormous speed from the extremely hot day side to the cooler night side of the planet .
The observations also allow another exciting " first " -- measuring the orbital speed of the exoplanet itself , providing a direct determination of its mass .
The results appear in the journal Nature .
" HD209458 b is definitely not a place for the faint - hearted .
By studying the poisonous carbon monoxide gas with great accuracy we found evidence for a super wind , blowing at a speed of 5000 to 10 000 km per hour , " says Ignas Snellen , who led the team of astronomers .
HD209458b is an exoplanet of about 60 % the mass of Jupiter orbiting a solar - like star located 150 light - years from Earth towards the constellation of Pegasus ( the Winged Horse ) .
Circling at a distance of only one twentieth the Sun-Earth distance , the planet is heated intensely by its parent star , and has a surface temperature of about 1000 degrees Celsius on the hot side .
But as the planet always has the same side to its star , one side is very hot , while the other is much cooler .
" On Earth , big temperature differences inevitably lead to fierce winds , and as our new measurements reveal , the situation is no different on HD209458 b , " says team member Simon Albrecht .
HD209458 b was the first exoplanet to be found transiting : every 3.5 days the planet moves in front of its host star , blocking a small portion of the starlight during a three - hour period .
During such an event a tiny fraction of the starlight filters through the planet 's atmosphere , leaving an imprint .
A team of astronomers from the Leiden University , the Netherlands Institute for Space Research ( SRON ) , and MIT in the United States , have used ESO 's Very Large Telescope and its powerful CRIRES spectrograph to detect and analyse these faint fingerprints , observing the planet for about five hours , as it passed in front of its star .
" CRIRES is the only instrument in the world that can deliver spectra that are sharp enough to determine the position of the carbon monoxide lines at a precision of 1 part in 100 000 , " says another team member Remco de Kok .
" This high precision allows us to measure the velocity of the carbon monoxide gas for the first time using the Doppler effect . "
The astronomers achieved several other firsts .
They directly measured the velocity of the exoplanet as it orbits its home star .
" In general , the mass of an exoplanet is determined by measuring the wobble of the star and assuming a mass for the star , according to theory .
Here , we have been able to measure the motion of the planet as well , and thus determine both the mass of the star and of the planet , " says co-author Ernst de Mooij .
Also for the first time , the astronomers measured how much carbon is present in the atmosphere of this planet .
" It seems that HD209458 b is actually as carbon - rich as Jupiter and Saturn .
This could indicate that it was formed in the same way , " says Snellen .
" In the future , astronomers may be able to use this type of observation to study the atmospheres of Earth - like planets , to determine whether life also exists elsewhere in the Universe . "

Server Side Updates
The last few weeks have included a lot of purely server - side updates , as we 've improved the robustness of the game , fixed a lot of bugs , and added internal features to give us better insights when there 's a problem .
Changes include :
- Mitigated a bug with duplicate NPCs ( Leviathans , etc ) showing up in some locations .
- Fixed a bug causing some NPCs to " park " in the wrong locations .
- Fixed problem causing people to occasionally damage their capital ships when undocking .
- Optimized performance of the game server for certain cases .
- Added many new performance - monitoring analytics for the core game server .
- Made purchase experience more robust to upstream payment - gateway outages .
- Fixed a problem with AI path data being generated incorrectly on some sectors .
- Threaded AI path generation , plus other tweaks , to improve startup time on certain complex sectors .
- Added new analytics for monitoring a variety of connection and internal performance data .
We appreciate all the reports on Bugs and elsewhere , sometimes it takes us a few days to track something down , but we fix any issue as quickly as we can .
Newer game - content updates are slated to appear before long .
It 's been important that we focus on back - end stability and capacity for a little while , before the next round of content drops .
Thanks for your patience in the meantime .
Vendetta Online 1.8.520 , Prediction Monitoring VO 1.8.520 includes :
- Players ' positions are now reset if high latency transients are detected during combat situations .
- Added client - side prediction to the application of explosion - force on dynamic debris .
The fact that this is a " two sentence update " belies the complexity and development time that went into it .
- Update 1 - Firstly , this update includes a new system we 'll call " Prediction Monitoring " .
To put it simply , this is a system that , under a very specific and narrow set of PvP combat conditions , will begin monitoring the movements of players , and if necessary , replacing player - client derived network updates with server - enforced positioning .
This should only impact people with * very * high latency ( on the order of 800 ms ) , or people who suddenly experience network dropouts ( packets lost or delayed ) .
If the server enforces a network update , the player may move or " drift " in a direction the server thinks is most appropriate based on their previously - accepted movement update .
This prevents people from inducing lag that may cause them to " jump " excessively long distances , or become impossible to target .
People experiencing server - enforced positioning from the Prediction Monitoring system will not be " instant kills " .
They 'll still be moving , and their momentary periods of linear motion will still be sporadic .
CHAT will also display a message to anyone who experiences server - enforced positioning , which says " High latency detected , resetting position . "
See the Suggestions Forum for a more thorough RFC thread on the topic , and how the system is implemented .
There are a great many factors that narrow the scope of the system to the smallest number of circumstances , specifically to minimize any impact of the system outside of PvP ( for instance , PvE against bots is unaffected ) .
Most importantly , for the system to be engaged , players must currently :
A ) Be able to harm one another ( no same - nation players in a Capitol system ) .
B ) NOT be grouped with one another .
The system is explicitly disabled for group - members .
C ) NOT be located in a No Fire Zone ( NFZs exclude the system , as it could make docking too challenging for high ping players ) .
D ) Weapons fire must be instantiated within 3000 meters of another player .
If this is all fulfilled , then Prediction Monitoring will be engaged for 30 seconds on the respective players .
The expectation is that each future " shot " within 3000 meters will re-engage the system for another 30 seconds , and the timer will allow the system to " turn off " quickly when not needed .
Like everything in this game , the system is a Work In Progress , so real - world testing feedback is welcome on the related Suggestions Forum thread .
- Update 2 - Certain sectors , like Latos F12 , have been testing new physically dynamic " debris " for some time .
These debris can be moved by ship impact or explosions , and will physically interact with other objects based on relative masses , creating an interesting set of physical reactions based on gameplay ( also leading to a lot of potential future gameplay ) .
The physical reactions are shared over the network , and we 've recently improved the game 's ability to instantly predict the physical impacts on the game client , before later re-synchronizing the results with the server .
This means that previous issues with " delayed jumping " of physics responses in debris , due to ping times , are now drastically less visible .
The combination of previous performance enhancements to the rendering engine ( since April ) , along with improved network synchronization and fewer visual artifacts , may cause the " debris " to become much more widely employed in the game in the future .
Eventually we may even have options for players to move high - mass objects around , such as asteroids , to create strategic barriers .
Similarly , miners might need to move surrounding asteroids to get their larger ships closer to higher - value ores .
Lots of different possibilities emerge , with a more dynamic , physically - reactive environment .
Vendetta Online 1.8.519 VO 1.8.519 includes :
- Corporate Sector Run prizes have been added .
100 k credits for each System the racer complets along the designated route .
50 k credits for each kill of an eligible racer outside of Odia M - 14 .
Top prize raised from 5 M to 9 M credits .
- Corporate Sector Run advertisement and registeration descriptions have been updated .
- Fixed lua error when displaying System Notes .
- Fixed issue with Trade mission 's Procurement list being blank in the new dynamic economy sectors .
- Improved NPC path - finding persistence between sector restarts .
We intend to continue expanding and refining automated Events , like the Corporate Sector Run race .
If you have feedback on how existing events work , or ideas for additional events , please feel free to post about that on Suggestions .
Server Side Updates , VO 1.8.518 The 06/12 Server - Side Update ( last night ) included :
- Leviathan weapon fire no longer goes through thinner asteroids .
Should also impact Conquerable Station Turrets , etc .
- The NPCs no longer use the internal docking bays on the station in Verasi I - 5 .
- NPC AI path generation has been improved and adjusted .
- Our ability to visually debug problems with the NPC AI path generation has been improved .
VO 1.8.518 included :
- Added new NPCs to the Unknown System that may pursue you throughout the system .
- NPCs may continue to aggro on pilots after they dock and re-launch from capships .
- Queens now defend the Leviathan instead of drifting away .
- Fixed lua error when attempting to load system notes that plugins created .
The change to high - speed Gauss from large turrets should make for improved strategies in approaching Leviathan , Conquerable Stations and the like .
Note that this is a physical - impact change ; it 's possible there are some long - lived visual effects that may still pass through objects , for the moment , but you wo n't be damaged by them .
Other tweaks to Queens and more elaborate cross-system NPC behaviour should also prove interesting , and lead to more content down the road .
New System and VO 1.8.517
- The system is " hidden " , but can be found with a clue from an in - game News article ( PDA -> Comm ) about a rescued explorer .
- The new system contains a particular type of bot that will occasionally drop a new weapon : the Gravity Mine Launcher .
This new system can be expected to change periodically ; everything from the risks and dangers , to the actual sectors themselves .
We 're looking to add unique minerals and ores that only exist there , more unusual bot types with drops , and other content .
The wormhole may eventually become more challenging to locate , moving periodically .
Threats to the main game universe may even pour forth from hidden strongholds .
VO 1.8.517 includes :
- Improved performance relating to instanced rendering on DX11 , GL4 , Vulkan and ES3 .
Most apparent with very dense sectors , using shadows .
- Fixed a graphics problem on PC , where certain asteroids were not using existing higher - quality object assets .
- Fixed a rendering issue with refracting ice crystals on Vulkan .
Anyone who has n't seen it already , should also take a look at the latest game Newsletter :
https://www.vendetta-online.com/newsletter/05.2020/newsletter.05.2020.html
As related in the latest Newsletter , a new Star System has been added to the game :-

Fixed a graphics problem on PC , where certain asteroids were not using existing higher - quality object assets .-
Fixed a rendering issue with refracting ice crystals on Vulkan .
Anyone who has n't seen it already , should also take a look at the latest game Newsletter :
VO 1.8.514-516
Some really significant changes in the last couple of weeks , particularly expanding the new supply - based economy to include the entire Latos system .
There will continue to be a lot of economic changes and tweaks , as time goes on and we continue to monitor how things are working .
Feedback on the economy is welcome , via the Suggestions forum and the like .
Server side issues fixed tonight :
- Fixed rare issue with player getting stuck leaving a turret just as the capship leaves the sector .
- Fixed rare issue with player attempting to launch from a ship with no launch bays , or in a ship that is not in the local inventory .
- Fixed rare issue with player taking control of their capship and launching at the same time .
VO 1.8.516 included ( Tuesday , 5/19 ) :
- Next - generation dynamic economy has been expanded from Latos N - 2 , to now include all of Latos ( C - 2 , N - 15 ) .
- Target supply capacities for related min/max pricing values have been tweaked a bit , for the Latos economy .
This will continue to evolve .
- Convoy Escort missions will now only appear in stations where the " requested " delivery is Locally Produced .
This changes the distribution and total number of available Escort missions .
- Escort mission state , along with more dynamic factors of the economy , are now persistently saved and restored during server restarts .
This means Escort missions are available immediately after restarts .
- Fixed an issue where a source station may not continue supplying a destination station if that station was already supplied .
- Updated targeted Character Info menu to display more badges .
The region can also be scrollable , although no scroll bar will appear .
- If an item that would otherwise disappear is sold to a dynamic economy station like Latos N - 2 , the item will be put into your station storage instead of disappearing and you will receive a message that it happened .
- Player - owned capships being attacked in NFZ now enable the Self Defense mechanism for the owner to defend against the attacker .
- Strike - force squads no longer accumulate ( pointlessly ) under certain conditions .
- AI sector navigation and long - term learning algorithms have been changed .
This may take time to impact the game visibly .
- Server -side analytics have been improved and expanded for various AI , NPC and economic functionality .
We can now simulate the economy at 100x speed , for testing .
VO 1.8.515 included :
- Destination sectors are now preloaded when a player begins a jump / warp / death animation for a smoother transition .
- Optimized navmap updates when Hive / Deneb overlays change .
- Trident livery textures are now preloaded to minimize stalls when it is seen for the first time .
VO 1.8.514 included :
- The cost of buying back your ship and addons when in a Deneb skirmish mission now displays the correct value of 0 .
- Fixed issue with hive indicators in the navmap not updating properly .
- Clearing out Central and Critical Hives before the skirmish starts was n't being properly counted towards the Hive Sector Hunter badges .
Counts have been retroactively applied .
Server-side Release
Over the past week , we 've made the following changes :
- Fixed a bug that caused spawning far too many escort missions , under certain conditions .
- Addition of new economy analytics , to further track millions of new data points relating to trade convoys .
- Improved existing analytics that track the state of AI relating to NPC navigability .
- NPCs convoys are less likely to be stalled for lengthy periods , while docking ( although they can still take awhile on certain stations with limited docking bays ) .
- Fixed certain rare - condition bugs with NPCs docking .
- Furies will not become aggressive if a player repairs them .
- Mitigated Furie issue with aggression when transitioning from Park to Follow , further work remains to be done .
This work does n't necessarily scream " gameplay drop " , but we 're still trying to expand on the new Latos N - 2 test economy , and a huge part of that is making sure the delivery convoys actually work properly .
Because we 're actually delivering items in the NPC convoys " for real " and are not faking it in the background , it 's fairly complicated to handle all the different edge cases and unusual circumstances .
The actual individual ship carrying the actual item has to reach the destination .
For a single given ship , that 's fine , but across thousands of ships flying across the galaxy per day , there are plenty of problems that can arise .
That 's where the analytics come in , to help us monitor and measure that situation .
Of course , monitoring roughly 135 stations delivering about 250 unique goods to another 135 stations , with various convoy states and success / failure conditions , can quickly blow up into tens of millions of data points to track .
That 's a whole other type of challenge .
But , that 's also why we spent a bunch of time building a new analytics cluster to handle this , last fall .
Anyway , we 're hopeful that next week we 'll be able to do some more content drops .
In the meantime , please let us know if you find any bugs or major issues , via the Bugs forum .
Thanks everyone !

Hope to see you there !
Vendetta Online 1.8.509 VO 1.8.509 includes :
- Added experimental chat abuse reporting tool .
Type /report " character name " to open the UI to select the offending text and category to submit it for administrative review .
While this is still early in feature development , this is a big step down the road towards our being able to react more quickly and effectively to toxic and inappropriate chat behaviour , when it should arise .
Basically , this will replace the " vote mute " system , instead providing a Report mechanic , where - in people can select an example of the bad behaviour , from their text - chat history , and submit it along with their " report " .
This has two effects , first that it makes it much easier for administrators to make a decision about specific behaviour , and secondly it should drastically reduce the abusive use of vote - mute itself to make organized " attacks " against people who may not actually be behaving badly .
The results of submission may have several effects .
For instance , Reporting a spammer may have the same effect as " vote mute " , where the spammer is temporarily silenced by a variety of people reporting their behaviour .
Then , once the Report is also validated by administrative staff , the spammer may have additional repercussions , like a longer - term mute , or other action .
Reports that are seen as inappropriate and invalid by administrative staff are also more likely to get a rapid reaction , up to ( if necessary ) removing an individual 's ability to make a Report .
People who submit Reports are likely to see whether or not their report was Validated or Invalidated at some point when the administrative decision is made .
This will help them gauge their future reports , and hopefully also give some sense that their feedback has been evaluated and put to good use .
The nature of " Mutes " themselves are also evolving .
We 've added the ability to permanently mute players on public channels of 1 and 100 , if they 're unable to improve their behaviour ; and we may also change traditional administrative mute actions to function on a " logged - in - time " basis , rather than a " wall - clock " basis .
To be clear , this " / report " implementation is only a prototype .
We do intend this to become fully integrated into the game UI , and be usable by players on mobile devices , VR and PC .
But , to begin with , it has been implemented as a console command .
We would appreciate it if people would try to use this new system , instead of " vote mute " or Support Tickets , in the event of people behaving inappropriately on the public in - game chat channels ( 1 and 100 ) .
Have a great weekend , everyone , and be sure to stop by for the Events on Saturday !

CONCLUSION
MKADMI Abderrazak ( 2004 , pp . 132-133 )
Le travail collaboratif a certainement beaucoup d'avantages par rapport au travail individuel , et ce par le rassemblement de plusieurs efforts dans l'élaboration d'une tâche commune .
Ces avantages peuvent être énumérés en quatre points essentiels à savoir :
- Une meilleure productivité : il permet d'avoir une analyse très détaillée sur la relation coûts - performances .
Il permet ainsi de donner aux usagers une idée précise sur les actions prises concernant leurs dossiers .
- Une clarté des actions à prendre : chacun des membres du groupe a une vision très claire des tâches à effectuer , et d'autres tâches effectuées par les autres .
- Une visualisation claire des tâches , et ce en donnant la possibilité de connaître à tout moment l'avancement exact des projets , les coûts et les périodes de pointe .
-
Une meilleure image de l'entreprise par l'amélioration de la qualité de service , le temps de réponse et l'état d'avancement du projet .
MKADMI Abderrazak ( 2004 , p. 186 )
L’enquête que nous avons menée nous a ( Les enquêtes que nous avions menées nous ont ) permis de connaître de plus près les besoins informationnels de nos utilisateurs et leurs modes de prise de décision pour la résolution d’un projet architectural , qui s’effectue par des échanges de point de vue dans les différentes activités de collaboration .
En se basant sur l’hypothèse qu ’une bonne interface d’une base de documents ( bibliothèque ) [ Hcc 1 ] numérique n’est pas seulement celle qui implique des outils intelligents et experts pour la recherche d’informations , mais qui , en plus , favorise le travail collaboratif entre les différentes personnes , cette enquête nous a permis de ( ces enquêtes nous aideront à ) repenser l’architecture des systèmes de recherche d’information à travers l’établissement d’ une grille d’évaluation de l’interface ( des interfaces ) de ces nouveaux types de systèmes supportant le travail collaboratif .
Il est vrai que formaliser un objet provoque une transformation de l’état de l’objet qui oblige à une certaine concrétisation matérielle de ce même objet , car les traces écrites et dessinées produites par le concepteur ne font que refléter ce qu ’il a dans son esprit .
C’est pour cela que nous avions demandé et exigé deux représentations à des moments différents du processus de réflexion du même ouvrage .
La comparaison des résultats des images visualisées sur l’ordinateur a également permis de vérifier qu ’un concepteur recherche rarement une seule chose à la fois .
La variété des ouvrages figurant sur la mosaïque finale de la recherche le montre bien .
The annual meeting was instead dominated by questions about Shell 's environmental record in Nigeria , where green groups claim it has not addressed local concerns about water pollution , oil leaks , pipeline sabotage and gas flaring .
Malcolm Brinded , director for upstream , said Shell " hopes " to end the controversial practice of burning excess gas during oil extraction but would not put a date on when this would happen .
He said there was no evidence that flaring causes health issues , but acknowledged its high carbon emissions .
The south - west coast of India is particularly exposed to algal blooms .

The problem of toxic algae is not just confined to the Nordic countries - in India algal blooms are threatening poor people 's access to food and their livelihoods , a problem that has been exacerbated by global warming .
With funding from the Swedish Research Council for Environment , Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency , researchers from the University of Gothenburg are to attempt to reduce the effects of algal blooms .
As in many other developing countries near the equator , millions of people in India depend on the sea as a source of income and food .
Exports of farmed tiger prawns and other aquatic organisms are an important part of the Indian economy , and mussels and oysters are often the main source of protein for many poor people .
But marine farming in India is beset with problems .
When pathogenic bacteria , viruses and toxic algae attack , the farmed prawns are treated with antibiotics , which results in resistance .
It is also common for the water in the aquaculture ponds to be treated with environmentally harmful chemicals .
Global warming is predicted to make harmful algal blooms larger and more numerous , as higher temperatures lead to more precipitation and a greater run-off of nutrient salts into the marine environment .
The south - west coast of India is particularly exposed in this respect , and it is here that a research project from the University of Gothenburg is to monitor the impact of climate change on algal blooms , with funding from the Swedish Research Council for Environment , Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning .
The background is that the Indian authorities are investing heavily in developing mussel and oyster farms in the hope that they will be able to increase export revenue and produce an environmentally friendly , protein - rich food for the country 's sizeable population .
Systematic monitoring that can predict when and where algal blooms will occur is needed if the investment is to pay off .
Using their own investigations and material from Indian colleagues , Anna Godhe and her team at the Department of Marine Ecology will study how the phytoplankton has changed over the last 50 years - a period when the surface water temperature of the Indian Ocean has risen by 1.5 degrees .
" We want to find out which species are expected to cause future blooms , so that we can see how monitoring can be made more efficient , " says Godhe .
" We will also be producing models showing how climate change affects tropical ecosystems , something that has only been done to a very limited extent before . "
" I think our research is important , not least because India 's strong growth has meant that aid has been scaled down , at the same time as we have realised that environmental problems extend beyond national borders and are worried that everyone in India will get a car and a fridge .
We forget that this is a country that is grappling with enormous infrastructure problems , and that more than 700 million people live on less than a dollar a day . "
Around 100 marine species emit some form of toxin .
These accumulate in filtering organisms such as mussels , which cause illness and , in a worst case scenario , death for anyone who eats them .
Other toxins cause damage to fish that are kept in captivity , such as farmed fish .

Many Canadians who opened a tax - free savings account are getting a nasty surprise this month .
They ’re being penalized for excess contributions , even though they kept their balances under the $ 5,000 annual limit .
If you have contributed the maximum to a TFSA and you withdraw any of your money , you must wait until the following year to contribute again .
Removing and replacing money in a single year means you ’ll get dinged for 1 per cent of the amount you contributed over the initial $ 5,000 .
Take Catherine Lyall , who put $ 5,000 into a TFSA last year .
Short of money to pay bills , she took out $ 4,970 from the account and put it back later in 2009 .
The CRA said she had over - contributed $ 4,970 for six months – or $ 29,820 in total – and had to pay back 1 per cent ( or $ 298.20 ) .
Meanwhile , she earned about $ 48 of tax - free interest – far outweighed by the penalty .
Qasim Abbas has a similar story .
After putting $ 5,000 into a TSFA on Jan. 2 , 2009 , he took out $ 1,500 on Jan. 26 and replaced it on Feb. 2 , 2009 .
He was told he had made a $ 1,500 over - contribution for 11 months – or $ 16,500 in total – and he owed $ 165 .
Transfers can also get you into trouble .
Witold Borozynski opened a tax - free account with ING Direct on Jan. 1 , 2009 .
Finding a better offer at HSBC , he transferred $ 4,999 from ING to a TFSA at HSBC on Jan. 22 , 2009 .
He was over the limit in the first month of the year , the CRA said .
He owed 1 per cent of $ 4,999 times 12 months – or $ 59,988 in total – which meant a tax bill of $ 599.98 .
“ I feel I was charged taxes on money I never had , ” he said .
“ Maybe it ’s a classic example of missing the super - fine print . ”
Federal finance minister Jim Flaherty announced technical changes last October designed to restrict tax avoidance schemes and prohibit asset transfer transactions between TFSAs and other registered or non-registered accounts .
But he did n’t say transfers of TFSAs from one institution to another would be penalized – or transfers within a single institution – even though it ’s happening to some taxpayers .
Max Peterson transferred his TFSA from a TD Waterhouse discount brokerage account to a TD Canada Trust branch last year .
Now he ’s learned that the transfer was counted as a new contribution .
Gerry Vercaigne did the opposite , moving his TFSA from a TD Canada Trust branch to his TD Waterhouse brokerage accounts .
He ’s been told to pay $ 392.62 in tax on $ 39,626 in over - contributions – and his wife , who did the same thing , has a similar tax bill .
I ’m hearing from many people ordered to pay tax on so - called TFSA over - contributions .
Their letters , dated June 1 , demand a response by the end of the month .
Taxpayers have two options , explains CRA spokeswoman Caitlin Workman .
They can send in payment right away if they agree with the proposed TFSA return for 2009 .
Or they can complete a form ( RC243 - SCH - A ) , showing the changes they want to make .
Disagreement can be costly if you have no case .
“ If we do not receive your TFSA return and payment on or before June 30 , 2010 , we will issue an assessment , which will include any penalties and interest that may apply , ” Brigitte Latimer , CRA assistant director of data assessment , wrote to Abbas .

Many people are going online with complaints at the Canadian Tax Resource Blog , http://blog.taxresource.ca, and my own blog , http://www.ellenroseman.com.
Taxpayers and financial institutions need help understanding how the TFSA rules work .
It would be nice to see Ottawa do a public education campaign and waive penalties for over - contributions made in error during the first year .

Now that Lost has finally concluded , one of the questions on everyone ’s mind is , what will all of the cast members do for an encore ?
Some of the actors , such as Matthew Fox and Evangeline Lilly , claim that they plan to retire from TV for good , while others already have their next gig lined up ( Daniel Dae Kim in the new Hawaii Five - O , for example ) .
A select few will probably go on to have even bigger careers , and some may have to fight to overcome typecasting , but one actor that already seems to have the potential to be a break out star is Josh Holloway ( Sawyer ) .
Word on the street is that Holloway has recently been in talks with Marvel for an unknown role in one of their upcoming comic book movies .
While no one seems to know for sure what the deal is , there has been plenty of speculation over some of the possibilities .
According to the highly reputable fan site Avengers News ( okay , so I ’ve never heard of it before ) , Holloway is being tipped for a “ lead role ” in an upcoming Marvel movie .
Their prediction is that it could be one of three characters : Henry Pym aka Ant - Man , Clint Barton aka Hawkeye , or Timothy “ Dum Dum ” Dugan .
I ’ve never even heard of the last guy ( the article says he is an important S.H.I.E.L.D. member ) , but are any of these really “ lead roles ” ?
I guess Ant - Man would at least be in his own movie eventually .
Personally , I have absolutely no idea if Holloway would fit any of these characters , but apparently he was offered the role of Gambit once upon a time , and that makes sense to me !
What do you think , can you see Josh Holloway as a superhero ?
Are there any other non-Avengers characters that they could be considering him for ?
Which Losties have the most potential for a big career ahead of them ?
Delibar , Delicious and Pinboard client for Mac
Dear users of Delibar ,
We want to say something about two of our apps , so we ’ll give you the short and less short versions .
We are retiring Delibar and Pixa .
They both had good runs , especially since we launched Delibar back in 2006 .
But people do n’t bookmark links the way they used to ( heck , Delicious.com does n’t even work anymore ) , and Pixa ’s userbase shrank for a variety of reasons .
We decided to take the lessons we learned from these apps and move on .
We have pulled Delibar and Pixa from sale in the Mac App Store and on our website , and the demos are no longer available .
Support for existing owners will continue through the end of 2018 , but then we ’ll retire that too .
Thank you for using Delibar and for supporting the Shiny Frog team .
Please check out our latest invention , Bear : a beautiful writing app for crafting notes and prose .
If you are interested in alternatives to Delibar : the Pinboard bookmarking service has a healthy list of third - party apps that support it .
Thanks ,

Two young Afghan girls who tried to escape their forced arranged marriages were caught at a police checkpoint and sent back to their remote village where they were publicly whipped 40 times each for trying to flee .
The girls , 13 and 14 , were disguised in boys clothes and had been fleeing for two days through rough terrain from their marriages to older men before they were caught by a policeman in January who ignored their pleas for help and immediately sent them back to their village knowing what awaited them , even though flogging is illegal , the New York Times reports
We apologize , but this video has failed to load .
tap here to see other videos from our team .
Try refreshing your browser , or Two Afghan child brides lashed for fleeing arranged marriages Back to video
.
The girls ’ abusers videotaped the entire ordeal , but sympathizers with the victims were able to smuggle out this graphic video
and get it to the independently operated Afghanistan Human Rights Commission , which released the video on the weekend .
In the video , the girl barely flinches and two men take turns administrating the lashes to the girl ’s legs and buttocks .
The girl uses her head scarf to cover part of her face and her eyes are closed for most of the flogging .
The mullah doing the flogging waits for another man to cover the girl ’s face with her scarf before continuing with the punishment .
A loud crack can be heard each time the leather strap meets the girl ’s body .
As readers will know , I have been thinking about the hullabaloo about CO2 and global warming and I quickly concluded that CO2 is no threat , wo n’t do any significant warming ( which would be good anyway ) , and is in fact 100 % good for the planet .
But someone said to me , if CO2 is no danger , that does n’t mean that humans are not causing a danger in some other way .
Of course I agreed with this , because there are lots of things humans are doing wrongly and thereby causing terrible damage to our world ( and the CO2 storm in a teacup is distracting us all from fixing those real problems ) .
My friend then went on , however , to propose that the danger was still global warming and that the mechanism was , instead of CO2 greenhouse warming , the mere fact that human technology gives off heat .
All the power used by all the machines and transport and so on eventually ends up as waste heat .
Maybe that is in itself enough to cause us serious warming trouble ?
So I did some calculations .
According to the laws of thermodynamics , the process of doing useful work must necessarily lose some of the energy from the fuel in the form of waste heat ; and that heat , well , heats .
In other words , because of the huge extra amount of useful work we do , we create excess heat that would not have been here otherwise , and that heat has to either be dissipated somehow , or else raise the temperature .
The factors that have caused the ice ages , as we saw , are primarily small changes in insolation ( heating ) by the Sun .
The changes can happen because the Sun ’s energy output changes or because of cyclic changes in the Earth ’s orbit and inclination , etc. , changing the amount of heat that actually arrives on the surface .
Changes in the Earth ’s orbit are believed to be the triggers for the onset of ice ages , and the changes in heating caused by those changes are thought to be quite small compared to the total power output of the Sun .
This might lead us to suspect that human - caused changes in the amount of heat at the surface might indeed have a significant effect on the climate .
To answer this question , we need to compare the amount of variation due to the Sun with the amount of heat emitted by industrial civilisation .
if the latter is ‘ in the same ballpark ’ as the former , then human civilisation might be holding off the onset of a new ice age .
Although there is much dispute about the exact mechanism that causes the onset of ice ages , much of it does n’t concern us right now because one basic fact is clear : somehow or other , the responsibility lies with changes in the amount of heat received from the Sun .
One theory is that the cause is Northern Hemisphere summer cooling .
At our current stage in geological history , the North Pole is surrounded by land masses , which are snowed under every winter .
If the summers became just a bit colder , then some of that winter snow would remain on the ground throughout summer , and would then turn to ice .
The ice will reflect sunlight much better than green plants or dirt or even liquid water , so the cooling will accelerate and the next summer will be even colder and leave even more ice lying around .
And so the planet falls into an ice age .
Retained heat in the oceans slows down the changes and ‘ smooths over ’ short - term effects , but once the process starts , the killing ice eventually reclaims its deathly kingdom .
Dr David Archibald suggests that a key measure of this process is the amount of insolation at 65° north latitude .
The power of the Sun at 65 °N is about 476 Watts per square metre .
That means that at midday in mid-summer at , say , Reykjavik ( at 64 °N , almost the only significant city anywhere close to 65 °N ) , the Sun has about the power of five old - style incandescent light bulbs .
When summer sun at this latitude is sufficient to melt the winter snowfall , all is well .
Other factors in this calculation are the length of summer ( because , for example , a longer , but slightly cooler summer might melt more ice than a shorter warmer one ) and how high in the sky the Sun is in mid summer .
And the higher it is in summer , the deeper and colder the long winter ‘ night ’ will be .
The factors are complex and researchers disagree as to how exactly they should be combined in order to make good predictions , but some combination of these factors decides whether we bask in life - giving warmth or flee the deadly cold .
We cannot hope to make predictions from the kind of short overview we are doing here , but we can get an idea of the magnitudes involved .
How much radiant energy the Sun has in the past or will in the future shine upon the Earth at this latitude can be reliably calculated from basic physical and astronomical properties of the way the Earth orbits the Sun and how that orbit changes with time .
This is not an uncertain thing like the forecasts of climate models ; it is not exactly easy to calculate , but it depends only upon the extremely well verified equations of Newtonian physics ( or , if you prefer a few thousands of a percent more accuracy , relativity ) .
If we did n’t know how to do these calculations , we could never have landed men on the Moon or flown discovery missions past Saturn and on to Uranus and Neptune .
Yes , we do know how to make these calculations and we know it very reliably .
When the calculations are done , we find that at the depth of the last ice age , around 22,000 years ago , the Sun ’s power ( again at 65 °N ) was around 463Wm - 2 .
On the other hand , at the height of our own interglacial , the Holocene , which occurred about 11,000 years ago ( yes , we have been on the downward slope ever since — though you would never guess it from the hairy scary stories about warming in the media ) the summer insolation at 65 °N was about 527Wm - 2 .
In other words , we have :
What When Sun ’s Power Previous Ice Age 22,000 years ago 463 Wm - 2 Holocene Peak 11,000 years ago 527Wm - 2 The Perfect Time Now 476Wm - 2
From these figures , we may make the following inferences :
The difference between peak warmth and deepest cold was around 55 Wm - 2 ; The current value , being only 13 Wm - 2 above the value at the depth of the ice age , is almost all the way back to ‘ cold conditions ’ ; it may be that only stored ocean heat is keeping us out of an ice age ( for now ) .
Moving on , how do these power figures compare with human energy output ( mainly by burning fossil fuels ) ?
Human energy usage in 2006 was 491 exajoules .
This translates to an average power usage of 15.56 terawatts each second ( divide by the number of seconds in a year ) .
To compare this with the Sun ’s power as discussed above , we need to average this over the entire planet .
The Earth ’s surface area is 510 million sq. km. , which gives 30,500 W per sq. km , or 0.03 Wm - 2 .
One final adjustment is needed to allow us to do the comparison : the Sun ’s insolation given above was as received at noon , whereas this figure is an average over the whole planet .
Since the planet ’s area is four times the areas of a circle of the same radius , we must multiply by four , giving about 0.12 Wm - 2 as our final figure for comparison .
The human energy output of about 0.12 Wm - 2 is clearly overpowered by even the smallest of the numbers we have looked at so far .
The 13 Wm - 2 difference between ice age conditions and today is at least a hundred times larger than human energy output .
We might delay a killer ice age slightly , but our heating of the planet is nowhere near large enough to save us .
Are we heating the Earth too much – with heat ?
Ron House June 3 , 2010
As readers will know , I have been thinking about the hullabaloo about CO2 and global warming and I quickly concluded that CO2 is no threat , wo n’t do any significant warming ( which would be good anyway ) , and is in fact 100 % good for the planet .
But someone said to me , if CO2 is no danger , that does n’t mean that humans are not causing a danger in some other way .
Of course I agreed with this , because there are lots of things humans are doing wrongly and thereby causing terrible damage to our world ( and the CO2 storm in a teacup is distracting us all from fixing those real problems ) .
My friend then went on , however , to propose that the danger was still global warming and that the mechanism was , instead of CO2 greenhouse warming , the mere fact that human technology gives off heat .
All the power used by all the machines and transport and so on eventually ends up as waste heat .
Maybe that is in itself enough to cause us serious warming trouble ?
So I did some calculations .
According to the laws of thermodynamics , the process of doing useful work must necessarily lose some of the energy from the fuel in the form of waste heat ; and that heat , well , heats .
In other words , because of the huge extra amount of useful work we do , we create excess heat that would not have been here otherwise , and that heat has to either be dissipated somehow , or else raise the temperature .
The factors that have caused the ice ages , as we saw , are primarily small changes in insolation ( heating ) by the Sun .
The changes can happen because the Sun ’s energy output changes or because of cyclic changes in the Earth ’s orbit and inclination , etc. , changing the amount of heat that actually arrives on the surface .
Changes in the Earth ’s orbit are believed to be the triggers for the onset of ice ages , and the changes in heating caused by those changes are thought to be quite small compared to the total power output of the Sun .
This might lead us to suspect that human - caused changes in the amount of heat at the surface might indeed have a significant effect on the climate .
To answer this question , we need to compare the amount of variation due to the Sun with the amount of heat emitted by industrial civilisation .
if the latter is ‘ in the same ballpark ’ as the former , then human civilisation might be holding off the onset of a new ice age .
Although there is much dispute about the exact mechanism that causes the onset of ice ages , much of it does n’t concern us right now because one basic fact is clear : somehow or other , the responsibility lies with changes in the amount of heat received from the Sun .
One theory is that the cause is Northern Hemisphere summer cooling .
At our current stage in geological history , the North Pole is surrounded by land masses , which are snowed under every winter .
If the summers became just a bit colder , then some of that winter snow would remain on the ground throughout summer , and would then turn to ice .
The ice will reflect sunlight much better than green plants or dirt or even liquid water , so the cooling will accelerate and the next summer will be even colder and leave even more ice lying around .
And so the planet falls into an ice age .
Retained heat in the oceans slows down the changes and ‘ smooths over ’ short - term effects , but once the process starts , the killing ice eventually reclaims its deathly kingdom .
Dr David Archibald suggests that a key measure of this process is the amount of insolation at 65° north latitude .
The power of the Sun at 65 °N is about 476 Watts per square metre .
That means that at midday in mid-summer at , say , Reykjavik ( at 64 °N , almost the only significant city anywhere close to 65 °N ) , the Sun has about the power of five old - style incandescent light bulbs .
When summer sun at this latitude is sufficient to melt the winter snowfall , all is well .
Other factors in this calculation are the length of summer ( because , for example , a longer , but slightly cooler summer might melt more ice than a shorter warmer one ) and how high in the sky the Sun is in mid summer .
And the higher it is in summer , the deeper and colder the long winter ‘ night ’ will be .
The factors are complex and researchers disagree as to how exactly they should be combined in order to make good predictions , but some combination of these factors decides whether we bask in life - giving warmth or flee the deadly cold .
We cannot hope to make predictions from the kind of short overview we are doing here , but we can get an idea of the magnitudes involved .

Overview
“ Socialism ” is a negative for most Americans , but certainly not all Americans .
“ Capitalism ” is regarded positively by a majority of the public , though it is a thin majority .
There are certain segments of the public – notably , young people and Democrats – where both “ isms ” are rated about equally .
And while most Americans have a negative reaction to the word “ militia , ” the term is viewed more positively by Republican men than most other groups .
These are among the findings of a national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press that tests reactions to words and phrases frequently used in current political discourse .
Overall , 29 % say they have a positive reaction to the word “ socialism , ” while 59 % react negatively .
The public ’s impressions of “ capitalism , ” though far more positive , are somewhat mixed .
Slightly more than half ( 52 % ) react positively to the word “ capitalism , ” compared with 37 % who say they have a negative reaction .
A large majority of Republicans ( 77 % ) react negatively to “ socialism , ” while 62 % have a positive reaction to “ capitalism . ”
Democrats ’ impressions are more divided :
In fact , about as many Democrats react positively to “ socialism ” ( 44 % ) as to “ capitalism ” ( 47 % ) .
Reaction to “ capitalism ” is lukewarm among many demographic groups .
Fewer than half of young people , women , people with lower incomes and those with less education react positively to “ capitalism . ”
The survey , conducted April 21 - 26 among 1,546 adults , measured reactions to nine political words and phrases .
The most positive reactions are to “ family values ” ( 89 % positive ) and “ civil rights ” ( 87 % ) .
About three - quarters see “ states ’ rights ” ( 77 % ) and “ civil liberties ” ( 76 % ) positively , while 68 % have a positive reaction to the word “ progressive . ”
Reactions to the word “ libertarian ” are evenly divided – 38 % positive , 37 % negative .
On balance , Republicans view “ libertarian ” negatively , Democrats are divided , while independents have a positive impression of the term .
“ Militia ” elicits the most negative reaction of the nine terms tested : Just 21 % have a positive reaction compared with 65 % who have a negative response .
Partisan Divide over “ Socialism ”
The most striking partisan differences come in reactions to the word “ socialism . ”
Just 15 % of Republicans react positively to “ socialism ” while 77 % react negatively .
By more than two - to - one ( 64 % to 26 % ) , independents also have a negative impression of “ socialism . ”
However , Democrats are evenly divided – 44 % have a positive reaction to “ socialism ” while 43 % react negatively .
“ Capitalism ” elicits a less partisan reaction .
About six - in - ten Republicans ( 62 % ) react positively to “ capitalism , ” compared with 29 % who have a negative reaction .
About half of independents ( 52 % ) have a positive impression while 39 % react negatively .
Among Democrats , 47 % react positively to “ capitalism ” while nearly as many ( 43 % ) react negatively .
There is a substantial partisan divide in views of the word “ progressive . ”
However , majorities of Democrats ( 81 % ) , independents ( 64 % ) and Republicans ( 56 % ) have a positive reaction to “ progressive . ”
More than four - in - ten independents ( 44 % ) react positively to the word “ libertarian , ” while 32 % have a negative reaction .
Democrats are nearly evenly divided ( 39 % positive , 37 % negative ) .
However , Republicans on balance have a negative impression of this term ( 44 % negative , 31 % positive ) .
Majorities of Democrats ( 70 % ) , independents ( 66 % ) and Republicans ( 59 % ) react negatively to the word “ militia . ”
Nearly twice as many Republicans ( 27 % ) as Democrats ( 15 % ) have a positive view of this term .
Young People Lukewarm Toward “ Capitalism ”
Young people are more positive about “ socialism ” – and more negative about “ capitalism ” – than are older Americans .
Among those younger than 30 , identical percentages react positively to “ socialism ” and “ capitalism ” ( 43 % each ) , while about half react negatively to each .
Among older age groups , majorities view “ socialism ” negatively and “ capitalism ” positively .
People 65 and older have a particularly negative reaction to “ socialism ” – 73 % have a negative impression of the term compared with just 14 % who are positive .
But those 65 and older are no more likely than those ages 30 to 64 to have a positive reaction to “ capitalism ” ( 56 % vs. 55 % ) .
More than twice as many blacks as whites react positively to “ socialism ” ( 53 % vs. 24 % ) .
Yet there are no racial differences in views of “ capitalism ” – 50 % of African Americans and 53 % of whites have a positive reaction .
Those with a high school education or less are evenly divided over “ capitalism ” ( 44 % positive vs. 42 % negative ) .
Among those with some college experience , 49 % react positively to “ capitalism ” as do 68 % of college graduates .
Those with a high school education or less are more likely to express a positive view of “ socialism ” than do those with more education .
People with family incomes of $ 75,000 or more are the only income group in which a clear majority ( 66 % ) reacts positively to the word “ capitalism . ”
Views of “ socialism ” also are much more negative among those in this income category ( 71 % negative ) – and those with incomes of $ 30,000 to $ 75,000 ( 64 % negative ) – than those with incomes of less than $ 30,000 ( 46 % negative ) .
Conservative Republicans stand out for their overwhelmingly negative reactions to “ socialism ” ( 84 % negative ) and highly positive reactions to “ capitalism ” ( 67 % positive ) .
No more than about half in other political groups , including moderate and liberal Republicans ( 51 % ) , have a positive impression of “ capitalism . ”
Perhaps surprisingly , opinions about the terms “ socialism ” and “ capitalism ” are not correlated with each other .
Most of those who have a positive reaction to “ socialism ” also have a positive reaction to “ capitalism ” ; in fact , views of “ capitalism ” are about the same among those who react positively to “ socialism ” as they are among those who react negatively ( 52 % and 56 % , respectively , view “ capitalism ” positively ) .
Conversely , views of “ socialism ” are just as negative among those who have a positive reaction to “ capitalism ” ( 64 % negative ) as those who react negatively ( 61 % negative ) .
There are some differences in the relationship between these terms by demographic groups , although the association is not particularly strong among any group .
For instance , among college graduates , 71 % of those with a positive reaction to “ capitalism ” have a negative reaction to “ socialism . ”
By contrast , among college graduates who have a negative view of “ capitalism ” a smaller proportion have a negative view of “ socialism ” ( 51 % ) .
Gender Differences in Views of “ Militia ”
While the word “ militia ” is viewed negatively , there are gender and partisan differences in reactions to this term .
Overall , twice as many men ( 28 % ) as women ( 14 % ) say they have a positive reaction to the word “ militia . ”
In addition , more Republicans ( 27 % ) than independents ( 20 % ) or Democrats ( 15 % ) have positive impressions .
Republican men have a more positive impression of “ militia ” ( 36 % positive ) than do Democratic men ( 19 % ) .
Moreover , GOP men have a more positive reaction than do Republican women ( 18 % positive ) .
There also is a sizeable gender gap in independents ’ reactions to “ militia . ”
Among independents , 28 % of men have a positive reaction to “ militia , ” compared with just 10 % of women .
The gender differences are more modest among Democrats ( 19 % positive among men vs. 12 % among women ) .
Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) is sick of the super - rich avoiding estate taxes .
On Thursday , he made good on his word : he today introduced legislation to restore the estate tax on the wealthiest Americans , which he says would bring in at least $ 264 billion in the next ten years to help reduce the national debt .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ This legislation would ensure that the wealthiest Americans in our country , millionaires and billionaires , pay their fair share while exempting 99.7 percent of Americans from paying any estate tax whatsoever , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Sanders said in a release .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ At a time when we have a record - breaking $ 13 trillion national debt and a growing gap between the very rich and everyone else , people who inherit multi-million and billion dollar estates must not be allowed to avoid paying their fair share in estate taxes . ”

Sander ’s release notes that the estate tax was abolished this year “ as a result of tax law changes signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2001 .
For the first time since 1916 , heirs to multi-million and billion dollar fortunes may receive their entire inheritance free of any federal taxes , a giveaway that will cost the U.S. treasury at least $ 14.8 billion in lost revenue this year alone . ”
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I get a little bit tired of being lectured by Republicans for the deficit we are in , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Sanders said — asserting that Bush - era Republicans “ funded but failed to pay for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ; tax breaks for the wealthy ; a prescription drug bill written by the pharmaceutical industry ; and a $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout . ”
Among the legislation ’s highlights :
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Exempt the first $ 3.5 million of an estate from federal taxation ( $ 7 million for couples ) , the same exemption that existed in 2009 .
That would leave 99.75 percent of all estates exempt from the federal estate tax next year .
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Create a progressive rate so the super wealthy pay more .
The tax rate estates valued between $ 3.5 million and $ 10 million would be 45 percent , the same as the 2009 level .
The rate on estates worth more than $ 10 million and below $ 50 million would be 50 percent , and the rate on estates worth more than $ 50 million would be 55 percent .
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Include a billionaire ’s surtax of 10 percent .
According to Forbes Magazine , there are only 403 billionaires in the United States with a collective net worth of $ 1.3 trillion .
Clearly , the heirs to these multi-billion fortunes should be paying a higher estate tax rate than others .

The White House estimated that closing the loopholes would generate at least $ 23.7 billion in revenue over 10 years .
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Protect family farmers by allowing them to lower the value of their farmland by up to $ 3 million for estate tax purposes .
The bill also would increase the maximum exclusion for conservation easements to $ 2 million .
The non-partisan Tax Policy Center has estimated that only 80 small businesses and farm estates throughout the country paid an estate tax in 2009 , affecting only three out of every 100,000 people who passed away .
ROME 
In a sign of sharply rising tensions between the Vatican and Belgium , Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday criticized as “ surprising and deplorable ” a raid on church property last week by Belgian police officers investigating sexual abuse by clerics .
In an exceedingly rare personal message and rebuke of a sovereign country , the pontiff also stressed the church ’s “ autonomy ” to conduct its own investigations and criticized the “ deplorable methods ” of the Belgian police , who detained bishops , confiscated files and even drilled into the tombs of at least one cardinal in the Cathedral of Mechelen , north of Brussels , in a search for documents .
“ On several occasions I have personally reiterated that such serious issues should be attended to by both civil and canon law , with respect for their reciprocal specificity and autonomy , ” Benedict said in a statement circulated by the Vatican on Sunday .
He also expressed his “ closeness and solidarity ” with the Belgian clergy and André - Joseph Léonard , the archbishop of Belgium and the president of the Belgian Bishops ’ Conference .
ATHLETES competing in this year 's Commonwealth Games held in Delhi will travel to the stadium along the Barapullah Elevated Road , one of many transport projects sprouting up in India 's capital city .
Half - built sections of the road loom dramatically over the streets below , as if straining to reach the concrete supports on the other side .
India 's economy has taken a similarly elevated route through the global financial turmoil .
Its growth never fell below 5.8 % ( see chart ) , thanks to a timely fiscal splurge .
But just as a cantilever cannot extend too far before it buckles , so an economy cannot place too much weight on a single source of support .
India 's merits special caution , its budget deficit topping 10 % of GDP in the fiscal year that ended on March 31st .
The growth figures released on May 31st were therefore doubly welcome .
They showed that India 's GDP expanded by 8.6 % in the year to the first quarter .
And as heartening as the rate of growth was its source : investment in fixed assets ( such as elevated roads ) accounted for more than half of it ; government consumption contributed hardly at all .
By “ stepping up ” its investments , “ industry has shown its confidence in the economic recovery , " said Chandrajit Banerjee of the Confederation of Indian Industry ( CII ) .
The biggest bets are being placed by India 's mobile - telephone operators , who bid no less than 677.2 billion rupees ( $ 14.6 billion ) between them in the government 's recent auction of the airwaves for speedy third - generation ( 3G ) networks .
A second auction now under way may raise another 300 billion rupees from firms seeking to offer broadband internet over wireless networks .
This windfall , far exceeding the government 's target of a total 350 billion rupees , will help it narrow its budget gap this year .
But the government 's gain was the telecoms industry 's loss .
To compete in the auction , mobile operators have borrowed heavily , some from overseas .
Instead of India 's government owing money to sleepy domestic bondholders then , India 's most dynamic companies now owe money to foreign creditors .
Whether this helps the economy or not will depend on whether the government spends the auction proceeds better than the telecoms companies would have done .
If a slowdown in government outlays was welcome , a slowdown in private consumption , which grew by only 2.6 % in the year to the first quarter , was not .
The CII blamed this weakness on high prices , which have dogged the government 's second term .
In a press conference on May 24th , Manmohan Singh , India 's prime minister , singled out inflation as a " matter of deep concern " , but pointed to signs of a " moderating trend " .
He 's right to point out that wholesale - price inflation has eased , from over 10 % in February to 9.6 % in April , compared with a year earlier .
But even as the cost of foods ( including manufactured foods , such as sugar and dairy ) begins to fall , the price of other manufactured goods is gathering some momentum .
The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) , which has raised interest rates twice this year , still has work to do .
The pace of rate hikes will be governed by two imponderables : the monsoon , which is now sweeping up the coastal state of Kerala , and the squalls on world financial markets , which have swept outwards from Greece .
If the monsoon lives up to expectations , the prospect of a good summer harvest will help to quell food inflation .
That will , in turn , lower inflation expectations , making the RBI 's life easier .
By the same token , bad financial weather may keep interest rates low around the globe .
If so , the RBI will be wary of raising its own rates too far ahead of other central banks .
The RBI worries that higher rates could invite heavier inflows of foreign capital .
This would push up the rupee , damaging India 's exporters .
Overseas investors traditionally flee emerging markets in periods of global financial angst .
But an economy growing at 8.6 % may look a safer bet than the moribund markets of Europe and America .
Rohini Malkani of Citigroup points out that Indian companies were able to borrow $ 4.3 billion overseas in March , the most they have in two years .
Prominent among the companies raising money were India 's infrastructure firms and its telephone operators .
That leaves India 's policymakers with a big strategic decision .
They could rebuff this foreign capital , by tightening caps , regulations and other restrictions on foreign investment .
Or they could take advantage of it , betting that a stronger rupee is a worthwhile price to pay for faster telecoms networks and elevated roads over India 's congested city streets .
" I 've gotta stop saying ' Women ca n't direct , ' " tweeted Bret Easton Ellis after seeing Fish Tank .
And yet here he is today , saying it again .
You see , women lack a necessary implement ( no , not a penis ) : " the male gaze . "

Ellis is doing a week - long series at Movieline discussing his novels ' screen adaptations .
Up today : American Psycho , which was directed by Mary Harron .
Asked by Kyle Buchanan about re-evaluating his stance on women directors after seeing Andrea Arnold 's Fish Tank , Ellis said he'd also liked The Runaways .
But for the most part I 'm not totally convinced , [ except for ]
Andrea Arnold , Kathryn Bigelow , Sofia Coppola … Not Mary Harron ?
Mary Harron to a degree .
There 's something about the medium of film itself that I think requires the male gaze .
What would that be ?
We 're watching , and we 're aroused by looking , whereas I do n't think women respond that way to films , just because of how they 're built .
You do n't think they have an overt level of arousal ?
[ They have one ] that 's not so stimulated by the visual .
I think , to a degree , all the women I named are n't particularly visual directors .
You could argue that Lost in Translation is beautiful , but is that [ cinematographer Lance Acord ] ?
I do n't know .
Regardless of the business aspect of things , is there a reason that there is n't a female Hitchcock or a female Scorsese or a female Spielberg ?
I do n't know .
I think it 's a medium that really is built for the male gaze and for a male sensibility .
I mean , the best art is made under not an indifference to , but a neutrality [ toward ] the kind of emotionalism that I think can be a trap for women directors .
But I have to get over it , you 're right , because so far this year , two of my favorite movies were made by women , Fish Tank and The Runaways .
I 've got to start rethinking that , although I have to say that a lot of the big studio movies I saw last year that were directed by women were far worse than the sh***y big - budget studio movies that were directed by men .
Which are we talking about ?
I mean , do I want to say this on the record ?
Did you see The Proposal ?
Anyway , whatever .

Where to start ?
The part where he sounds semi-apologetic about his misogyny and then reclaims it all over again to claim that The Proposal is worse than say , Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen ?
How about the part where Ellis thinks a director is always responsible for the visual components of a movie , except for when that director is a woman like Sofia Coppola ?
Or that women do n't have a visual sensibility because he thinks only men get one ?
Or when he says that all female directors are " emotionalist " ?
It is tempting to go through one by one , and point out the absurdity of these claims .
Then again , in addition to his printed and onscreen oeuvre , this is a man whose previous Tweets have included , " John Mayer in the March Playboy is one of the most interesting , funny and revelatory celebrity interviews I 've ever read .
He just gets it . "
In other words , his idea of revelatory is saying things that are deep - seated , prejudicial convention and protesting that everyone can't handle his edgy truth .
So he really does n't care if it 's actually true or not .

For example , in the same interview , Ellis says , " I 've always thought that the feminists got it totally wrong on [ American Psycho .
But I ca n't go there anymore . "
Presumably , that is because the feminist PC police has so exhausted him , he has to find new ways to articulate his disdain .
I can't find a better way to articulate mine than Manohla on the same topic :
Fuck him .

This weekend marked the ninth edition of Bonnaroo , a festival that ’s as good for people - watching as it is for band - watching .
Roughly 150,000 glow stick - wielding folks descended on a sleepy farm in Manchester to , like , totally get stoked for Dave Matthews and wander around in rain boots and bikinis .
And oh , the sights !
We saw a balding dreadlocked man .
We saw a guy with a loincloth made of an empty case of Natty Light .
We saw a group of people watching They Might Be Giants while wearing Viking costumes .
We saw people longing for the relative cleanliness of a gas station bathroom .
And , of course , we saw bros .
While Bonnaroo is traditionally known for hippies — and there were plenty of them there too — this year ’s headliners read like every frat dude ’s ultimate panty - dropping party playlist : Jay - Z , Weezer , Zac Brown Band , Kings of Leon , Michael Franti & Spearhead , Kid Cudi , and , obviously , that King of All Bros , Dave Matthews ( “ If you do n’t like ‘ Crash , ’ you have no heart , man , ” as one bro said to me ) .
Your intrepid Flavorwire correspondent set out to compile a taxonomy of bros in their native environment .
Below the jump : Browatch 2010 .
Brotentials
These are not yet full - on bros , but do show burgeoning hints of brodom :
Note the purple crocs and cut - off khaki shorts , as well as the CamelBak backpack .
This particular example was watching Umphrey ’s McGee , a hint of brodom to come , but perhaps also just a healthy ironic appreciation for jam bands .
Only time will tell whether those with brotential will blossom into full - on bros .
Signs include : more camouflage than necessary , questionable footwear , tendency to wear cheap sunglasses given out by sororities .
Brohemians
These are your combination frat dude - hippies , denoted by a simultaneous love of tie - dye and wristbands that say “ I heart boobies . ”
Generally , the fashion choices come directly from Electric Kool - Aid Acid Test , sprinkled with bro staples such as the polarized sunglasses and Croakies ( bands that allow bros to hang sunglasses around their neck backwards , usually in neon colors or camouflage ) .
Note the hands - free cigarette move : pure bro .

GDIs
These are not bros .
These are anti-bros .
Bros are against long , stringy , headbanded hair ( if it must be long , it should also be weirdly lush and accompanied with beard or held back by backwards baseball cap ) .
Bros do not wear tweed newsboy caps unless some totally lame chick , like , made them or something because she bought it as a birthday present instead of that totally sweet fotball jersey they ’ve been eying .
Do n’t be fooled .
Seen everywhere .
The Broletariat
These are the bros with the strongest connection to the means of broduction .
They avoid popped collars and Polo shirts in favor of no shirts , or shirts with pithy slogans like “ Female Body Inspector ” and “ You ’d Be Prettier If I Was Drunker . ”
Their general uniform includes Rainbow flip - flops , a baseball cap or floppy fisherman ’s hat , and aforementioned polarized sunglasses .
Here , a group of the broletariat looks quizzically at the beer station , wondering if noon is too early for a $ 6 Bud Light .

The Brogeousie
Though a certain sense of fraternity entitlement is a native characteristic of all bros , the brogeousie are the ones who most embrace it .
They are generally in the upper echelons of the fraternity hierarchy , serving as president and arranging car washes ( FREE 4 CHIXX ! ) .
A pink button - down or Polo T - shirt — preferably with popped collar in combination with pattern shorts — is the uniform of choice .
Even in improbably humid weather in the middle of a farm , the brogeousie seem never to sweat .
They greet each other with either hearty high fives or the “ bro hug , ” in which both parties embrace through a kind of quasi - wrestling move .
These bros are the most frequent proponents of “ icing , ” though Smirnoff Ice was ( unfortunately ) not available during Bonnaroo .
Most stuffed their crotches with miniature bottles of liquor to smuggle into the Centeroo , and had at least one inflatable item on them at all times .
Spotted at : Jay - Z , Tenacious D , She & Him , Kings of Leon
Brohams
Class clowns turned bros , these are the guys who organize the pranks at their fraternity .
At Bonnaroo , they ’re most likely to be wearing clothing cobbled together from glow sticks or , in the case of this fine , young bro-gentleman , a hat made from a case of Natty Ice .
Those joke sunglasses available at Spencer ’s are popular with this crew , particularly the ones that are shaped like pints of beer ( “ Beer goggles , brah ! ” ) .
Spotted at : Aziz Ansari , Conan O’Brien
Brodaddies
Older bros who keep that frat house spirit alive through crashing Bonnaroo and yelling “ Show us your tits ! ” through bullhorns at 4 am .
( true story ) .
These are bros past their bro-peak , but they still love to chug Milwaukee ’s Best ( THE BEAST ) and advise their younger bro compatriots that they can drink them under the table .
This particular brodaddy is also a broham .
Spotted at : Stevie Wonder , Kris Kristofferson , GWAR
Brodysseus
These are wandering bros , fond of hacky - sack and disc golf .
These are the contingent of the brogeousie who like to sweat — as opposed to playing polo and sailing .
A glow - in - the - dark frisbee is a must , as is a bandanna or sweatband and a CamelBak .
Gotta stay hydrated , bro !
Seen at : any spot in the field where there was enough room to kick around a ball or fling something .
Bro-Getters
These are the bros who get shit DONE .
They plan the party , they hustle the girls to the party tent , and then they trip balls to Dave Matthews .
Note the look of glee at the beginning of the Zac Brown Band show , and the bro-necklace , indicating a willingness to transgress bro-fashion boundaries .
These are bro-visionaries , foraging new ground for bros everywhere .
Broseidon , King of the Brocean
These are the Princes o’ the Bro-universe , the Greek Gods of brodom .
The Popes of the Bro-Vatican .
The “ Ph ” in “ Phish . ”
Generally , a T - shirt referencing both Greek life and beer is a necessity , as is then altering the T - shirt so it displays more of your arm muscles .
( “ Welcome to the gun show ” is also an acceptable T - shirt slogan choice . )
Polarized sunglasses are a must , as is a confusingly ornate tattoo and a steady supply of Keystone Light for your minions .
If Bonnaroo were Animal House , Broseidons would be Bluto .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday 27 May 2010
The profile below of Diane Abbott mentioned some ongoing resentment at a past decision by the Labour MP and party leadership hopeful to send her son to a fee - paying school , " given her position on the left and her criticism of Tony Blair and Harriet Harman for making the same educational choices " .
In the latter two cases , the schools involved – London Oratory , and St Olave 's grammar in Kent – were actually state - funded .
Choice of the Oratory was criticised because the school had opted out of local authority control ; choice of St Olave 's was criticised because admission was selective .
' I 'm just wondering what to ask you next , " said a bewildered James Naughtie on the Today programme this morning .
And that was worth a headline in itself .
It is not often that the broadcaster , essayist , master of vocabulary meets a phenomenon that renders him inarticulate .
But it was on Naughtie that Diane Abbott , Labour MP , journalist , television star , formerly the high priestess of New Labour 's awkward squad , dropped her bombshell – first mooted in Thursday 's Guardian – that she intends to contest the Labour leadership .
Others listening from the Labour establishment will have been just as surprised as Naughtie ; horrified even .
Lucky for them that they did n't have to react in front of a mic .
And why was it so surprising ?
Well look at the contenders so far .
Two Milibands , Ed Balls , Andy Burnham , John McDonnell .
Five straight white men , all with a track record – or is that a charge sheet – of chasing high office in the past , the bad old days .
Each is imbued with their own distinctive qualities , it is true .
But one can look at the contestants and wonder , what about diversity ?
So , at a stroke , Abbott 's dramatic statement of intent changes the dynamic of Labour 's competition for its highest office .
Many would say the dynamic badly needed changing .
But is Abbott the person to do it ?
Definitely yes , says Simon Woolley , director of Operation Black Vote , who floated the idea of an Abbott candidacy on the Guardian 's Comment is Free site on Wednesday .
" Above all , Diane came into politics to tackle racial inequality , " says Woolley .
" She has a track record of speaking out and a track record of difficult battles .
Think of the fight all those years ago against the Sus laws , the Stephen Lawrence issue .
You get the odd curve ball from her and you think , where did that come from .
But she is strong left and has a record in grassroots politics that makes us extremely proud of her . "
Yes , says Hilary Wainwright , the socialist feminist writer and former editor of periodical Red Pepper .
" She will stir things up and open things up .
Things need stirring up .
It was completely closed down under Blair and debate was frowned upon . "
It is not just about having a woman run , she says .
" If Patricia Hewitt was running , I would n't be very confident .
But Diane was never a Blair babe .
I disagree with her on some things ; PR and the importance of comprehensive education .
But she was against the war and has independence of spirit . "
Yes , says leftwing Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn , also a fan of John McDonnell .
" There was an attempt to railroad the debate into a small number of candidates , but we need a wide range , " he says .
" Both are good colleagues , experienced , well informed .
We need that kind of candidate . "
Some would support her decision to run , even if they do n't support Abbott herself , among them the writer Suzanne Moore , who ran against the Labour backbencher in her heartland Hackney North and Stoke Newington .
" I am very glad she is standing because I am one of the people who complained that there is not enough diversity , " Moore says .
" I do n't think she is a fantastically good MP or would be a good leader of the Labour party .
But I respect that fact that she has put her hat in the ring . "
So she has friends , faithful and fair - weather , but given her profile and a track record , who can be surprised that she also has enemies ?
In the weeks to come , she may hear a great deal from them .
" Diane sold her principles by sending her kids to private school and spending a lot of time on the box cosying up to Michael Portillo , making comments for the sake of projection on TV , " one grumbled , anonymously , yesterday .
" Is there much difference between her and George Galloway in the way they behave in the media ?
This may be more about Diane 's ego than a serious bid . "
Such comments are easily elicited around Westminster – predictions of failure voiced as much in hope as expectation .
But then , Abbott says , hurrying from her airy office in Portcullis House to yet another rolling news interview , vitriol from the Labour establishment has long ceased to trouble her .
" They have always seen me as troublesome because I am one of the few people who have managed to maintain a high profile which is not controlled by the party .
I can't be bought .
I have worked hard at my politics and I have always kept close to my base .
There are a lot of people who do n't agree with me about everything , but that 's OK .
They think that I am genuine and I speak my mind . "
Certainly we have had long enough to get used to Diane Abbott , 56 .
She was elected to Westminster city council in 1982 as one of the first black female councillors .
Her rise from municipal politics was speedy .
In 1987 she was sent to parliament to become one of just four ethnic - minority MPs .
Her first parliamentary speech concerned the inequities of Britain 's immigration policies .
Of those four MPs , both Paul Boateng and Keith Vaz would ascend to high office , but Bernie Grant never benefited – perhaps he never wanted to – and Abbott 's career has never before risen above the level of backbencher .
But that is why , her supporters might argue , she has been so effective .
She has won widespread plaudits for her work investigating the underachievement of black children in London schools and highlighting the efforts of those who excel .
She was a leader of the campaign to raise minority representation in politics through the " black sections " movement and she was one of the early campaigners for all - women shortlists .
Her record on dealing with immigration cases in a multiracial constituency is impressive .
She voted against the war and has taken a consistent stand against New Labour 's erosion of civil liberties .
Her contribution to the Commons debate on 42 days detention was described by Conservative MP David Davis as , " one of the finest speeches I have heard " .
But undoubtedly she has baggage , and some of it may prove heavy for her if she collects the necessary signatures from colleagues and formally joins the race for the leadership .
The heaviest will be her decision to send her son James to a private , fee - paying school , a position she herself described as " indefensible " and " intellectually incoherent " , given her position on the left and her criticism of Tony Blair and Harriet Harman for making the same educational choices .
She will have to deal with the continuing resentment from that decision .
Like ash from the Icelandic volcano , it never quite goes away .
But while acknowledging these inconsistencies , she remains unapologetic .
" One of the things that marks me out from the rivals is that I brought up a child on my own for 18 years .
I have had to take some difficult decisions .
I have not done everything right , but it was absolutely the right thing for my son at the time .
I do n't regret that . "
It remains a handy , lumpy stick to beat her with , but she 's sanguine .
" If it had n't been this , it would have been something else . "
There has to be good reason to volunteer for the upheaval a leadership campaign would bring , but from the outside it is hard to see it .
Despite the best efforts of Moore and the other wannabes in Hackney North , Abbott doubled her majority at this latest election .
She 's a backbencher , but not just a backbencher .
She is also a celebrity .
Her exposure on the late night political programme
This Week , alongside Andrew Neil and all cosy with Michael Portillo on the pundits ' sofa , was supposed to last for just four weeks .
She has been doing the programme now for the last six years .
" They do audience research and This Week has the highest audience appreciation of any political programme , " she says proudly .
" The next most favourite of those who liked our show was Midsomer Murders .
I can relate to Middle England . "
Everybody wants to .
Why not settle for that ?
" I followed the Obama campaign and it seemed strange that when the US has a black president , we did n't even have a black candidate for our leadership .
I looked at the front - runners , all male , all white , all former policy wonks , and it just seemed wrong .
It is annoying that the Tories are now to the left of us on civil liberties .
What are we going to do about Afghanistan .
Where is the serious debate about the economy ?
Who is going to talk about the balance between cuts and tax ?
In Hackney , one person 's public sector cut is another person 's job .
Many of them will be women , heads of households . "
The noises from the nascent campaign were not , she says , encouraging .
" One of the things that made me run was hearing candidate after candidate saying the immigration lost us the election .
Rather than wringing our hands about the white working class and immigration , we need to deal with the underlying issues that make white and black people hostile to immigration ; things like housing and job security .
We need to be careful about scapegoating immigrants in a recession .
We know where that leads . "
It may all come to nothing .
No 32 signatures , no leadership campaign .
But amid the media frenzy that enveloped Abbott after her chat with James Naughtie , she was calm yesterday .
Surprised at the level of attention , but knowing perhaps that after years on the sidelines , her candidature could do the party a vital service .
She has never sought to fly this close to the sun before , but she has always had respect for the notion of leadership .
The photographs in her office show Nelson Mandela , Jesse Jackson , PJ Patterson , the former prime minister of Jamaica .
She might not be able to run , and if she did , it is barely conceivable that she could win .
But that 's not the point .
The point would be the journey .
" I looked at the situation and thought if not now , when ?
And if not me , who ? "
FRESNO , Calif . -
The gang member who inked a gang tattoo on a 7 - year - old boy testified Friday there 's nothing wrong with tattooing a minor as long as parents give their permission .
Travis Gorman also told a Fresno County Superior Court jury that he would tattoo his own daughter once she turned 7 if the child 's mother approved .
" I love tattoos , " said Gorman , who has more than a dozen of them on his face , neck , arms and body .
Gorman , 22 , and fellow gang member Enrique Gonzalez , 27 , are on trial , accused of aggravated mayhem and willful cruelty to a child for tattooing a quarter - sized dog paw on the hip of Gonzalez 's son .
Prosecutor William Lacy contends that Gonzalez held down his son while Gorman inked a dog paw - the symbol for the Bulldogs gang - with the intent to promote the criminal street gang .
If convicted , they face life in prison .
Gonzalez was supposed to testify Friday , but Gorman spent nearly all day on the witness stand , clarifying his view of what happened during Easter break last year .
He said the boy was n't telling the truth when he testified earlier this week for the prosecution that he did n't want the tattoo and that his father held him down .
" He was throwing a fit .
He wanted a tattoo , " Gorman told the jury of six women and six men .
Gorman said he wanted to set the record straight because he initially told police after his arrest in April last year that he did n't tattoo the boy .
" Why would I tat a 7 - year - old ?
That 's crazy , " Gorman said in a taped police interview , which was played to the jury Friday .
He changed his story when a detective told him the boy identified him .
On the witness stand Friday , he told jurors he lied to police to shift blame to Gonzalez and stay out of trouble .
He said he was now telling the truth in court because " I 'm under oath . "
In the taped police interview , Gorman said Gonzalez picked out his son's tattoo .
But on the witness stand , he said the boy wanted the dog paw after he pestered his father .
Gorman also testified that Gonzalez never held down his son and said the boy told him and others that he wanted the tattoo so he could " be like his dad . "
Gorman said Gonzalez loves his two sons , and they love him .
He testified he tattooed the boy as a favor to Gonzalez , whom he described as a close friend - " like a brother . "
" It was not my intention to hurt the boy in any way , " Gorman testified .
Gorman said he is no longer a Bulldog gang member , but admitted that he 's been convicted of theft - related crimes in 2007 and 2008 .
Behind bars , he said , he was considered a loner and had to join the Bulldogs and get gang tattoos to survive .
If he did n't join , he told the jury , " it would be like a sheep in a lion 's den . "
In prison , Gorman said he became a tattoo artist , though he does n't practice the art on his own body .
If set free , he said he would focus on his attention on his girlfriend , their 2 - year - old daughter , his ailing father , and his tattooing skills .
The trial resumes Tuesday after the holiday break .
Welcome to the new SysAdmin Series , where we will cover apps and other tips and tricks for using your Android device to help you get the job done and stay on top of things in the realm of system administration .
Probably the foremost tool for any sysadmin is a good SSH client .
My favorite so far is ConnectBot , by Kenny Root and Jeffrey Sharkey .
At the time of this writing , this free , lean , simple SSH client is at version 1.6.2 , weighs in at 352KB and has had more than 250,000 downloads and enjoys a 5 - star rating from over 10,000 users , and describes itself as such in the Android Market :
ConnectBot is a powerful open - soure Secure Shell ( SSH ) client .
It can manage simultaneous SSH sessions , create secure tunnels , and copy / paste between other applications .
This client allows you to connect to Secure Shell servers that typically run on UNIX - based servers .
Using ConnectBot
When we launch the app , we see a list of hosts that we have pre-configured :
connectbot - 1 - host list
I select a host to connect to , and it prompts me for my credentials :
connectbot - 2 - asking for a password
At this point , I 'm sitting at a prompt and can use the app however I need to do my job ( left image below ) .
If I need more screen real estate , I can tap my device 's " back " button to remove the keyboard ( center image below ) .
If I need the keyboard back again , I can tap anywhere on the screen to reveal a keyboard icon ( right image below ) .
Thankfully , the Nexus One has an amazing AMOLED screen so the small font is n't too hard to read .
I imagine the larger screened devices such as the Sprint EVO 4G will be even better .
connectbot - 6 - ls-l
Finally , when disconnecting , we are prompted for confirmation .
If we stay connected and return to the home screen of hosts , we see a green icon next to any hosts we 're currently connected to .
connectbot - 7 - disconnect
Tunelling
I did n't have opportunity to test the secure tunneling .
If any readers have experience with this , please feel free to leave a comment below .
Settings
The settings menu of the home screen of the app will allow you to manage your public keys , configure a custom color scheme , and browse a wide variety of other settings .
Remember keys in memory
This checkbox will allow you to keep unlocked keys in memory until backend service is terminated .
This will let ConnectBot check for new versions of itself ; somewhat redundant .
Settings are ' daily ' , ' weekly ' and ' never ' .
Persist connections
This checkbox will allow connections to stay connected while the app is running in the background .
Terminal Emulation
Emulation Mode
There are several terminal emulation modes such as xterm - color , vt100 , ansi and screen .
Scrollback Size
The default of 500 lines should be enough ; increasing this will use more RAM on your device .
User Interface
Rotation Mode
This setting will let you force ConnectBot to rotate the display if you so choose .
The default setting will rotate the screen as you tilt your device , but you can ' fix ' the display in landscape , portrait or automatic mode .
Full Screen
If you select this checkbox ( default : off ) , you can hide the status bar on the screen to give you extra screen real estate .
Directory Shortcuts
This will select how to use Alt for '/ ' and Shift for Tab .
Camera Shortcut
This will let you set a keyboard shortcut to activate a camera .
This seems like a pretty strange thing to include in an SSH client .
Since I use the Swype keyboard , I could not change to the native Android keyboard for testing this feature .
Keep Screen Awake
This disables your phone from setting your screen to sleep .
Keep Wi-Fi Active
This prevents your device 's wifi from turning off while you 're actively connected to a host .
Bumpy Arrows
This will vibrate your device when sending arrow key scrolling when using a trackball .
Terminal Bell
Audible Bell
Checkbox setting , default is on .
Bell volume
Volume setting for audible bell .
Vibrate on Bell
Default is on .
Background Notifications
Checkbox , default is on .
This sends a notification on your device 's Notification bar when an active terminal sends a Bell event .
Conclusions
I personally use ConnectBot quite often when I 'm not at a system and need to do some very quick work .
The size of the screen and limited keyboard do n't make the app very practical for long - term use , especially when you can use tethering apps ( covered in another SysAdmin article later ) or using the native tethering within Froyo ( Android 2.2 ) .
This is not a shortcoming of ConnectBot , this would affect any SSH client on an Android device with a smaller screen .
The only problem I really found in ConnectBot was that an active session does n't treat the screen as a native input field -- a long - tap on the screen in a typical input field would allow you to change your Input Method , where I might want to change to a different keyboard layout ( ie : Swype or native Android keyboard ) .
This is pretty minor , however .
With the number of downloads , it 's very clear that there is a demand for a good terminal app on the Android platform , and ConnectBot seems to be the clear leader .
Well , it looks like Google will be kicking off its forthcoming Google Editions e-book service on a high note -- Japan Today is reporting that the company has managed to score the backing of " almost all " publishers in the United States .
That apparently brings the total number of publishers and authors on board to over 25,000 , and the total number of books set to be available to somewhere in the neighborhood of two million -- or over four million if you include the public domain books that Google already makes available for free .
As far as we can tell , however , Google itself still is n't saying any more on the matter publicly than it did last week , when it confirmed that the service would be launching in late June or July .

The lion queen : The London woman who saved Africa 's rare white lions from trophy hunters - and almost certain extinction
The first time she met a rare African white lion - destined for a trophy hunter 's cabinet - Linda Tucker knew she had to fight to protect them .
Sitting round the campfire in the African bush with my sister and our friends , we drank beer while we watched the burning embers shooting sparks into the starlit darkness .
My safari holiday to Timbavati , on the edge of South Africa 's Kruger National Park , seemed like the perfect antidote to my frenetic life in London .
Back home , I worked long hours as an account manager at an advertising agency , having recently given up my career as a model for Yardley and L'Oreal .
It was the primal sound of roaring lions that drew us deeper into the bush that night in November 1991 .
The spirit of the legendary rare white lions had haunted the Timbavati bushveld for centuries .
Legendary : Rare white lions have haunted the Timbavati bushveld for centuries
The offspring of the more usual tawny lion , they are not albino but are the product of a recessive gene that inhibits the pigment in their fur and which also causes them to have blue eyes .
Hunted to apparent extinction , they had not been spotted in the wild for almost a decade .
Now , our game ranger , Leonard , wanted to show us a tawny pride of lions that he believed might still carry the white gene and therefore had the potential to produce white cubs .
From the urgent , exuberant tone the lions were making that night , Leonard was convinced that a lioness might have given birth , so we headed off into the darkness hoping to catch a glimpse of a white cub .
At the very moment that we picked out the glowing amber eyes of a large lion , there was a rasping sound from our open - topped vehicle and it came to a shuddering halt .
The agitated lions were too close for comfort .
In the headlights I glimpsed shadowy shapes and caught the outline of a snarling lioness .
The last thought in our minds at that point was whether she might have any white cubs .
As Leonard jammed the gears into reverse to make a speedy exit , the vehicle jolted violently .
A tree trunk had got caught under the front axle , breaking the steering column .
We were stuck .
Stranded and unprotected in the midst of angry lions , we waited .
I was terrified and my legs felt like jelly .
A fully - grown lion crouched not ten metres away , eyes fiery with rage .
Leonard ordered us to keep calm .
' If you run , the lions will bring you down , ' he said .
Reassuring us that he had his rifle , Leonard told us to just ' sit tight ' .
There followed a horrible , petrified silence .
But then , out of the blackness , a ghostly presence came towards us .
It was an old woman and , unbelievably , she carried a baby on her back .
Behind her followed a young girl and a wide - eyed youth .
In a trance - like state , each holding on to the other , they silently clambered into the Land Rover , sitting among us like phantoms .
There they stared blankly into the darkness , into the field of lions from which they had come .
' White lions mean big revenue in the " canned " lion trophy industry , which breeds the animals in captivity in order to be shot by paying customers '
It 's hard to explain the impact this woman had on our group - because all of a sudden complete calmness descended and my sister 's boyfriend , Andries , announced that he was going to walk the mile or so back to camp to retrieve the other vehicle and save us all .
With a look of determination in his eyes , he pushed past the old lady and grabbed the youth saying , ' Come on , let 's go ' .
He assumed the young man could show him the route and they set off , fearlessly walking through the lions , while we sat in the Land Rover , too stunned to speak .
As we watched their figures disappear into darkness , I tried not to think about what lay ahead for them .
After waiting for what seemed like hours - although it was nearer 45 minutes - another Land Rover emerged from the bush .
Miraculously , Andries had passed unharmed through the lion - infested darkness and had come back to rescue us .
When I returned to London I tried to put the events of that night out of my mind , but I kept thinking about this mysterious woman and how she had transformed our fear into courage .
I struggled on for three years , but the material world of advertising seemed trivial and soulless .
So , feeling utterly exhausted by my life , I gave up my job , sold my house and returned to South Africa , determined to find out as much as I could about the woman who had saved us .
Living in a hut in Timbavati , I exchanged my designer suits and heels for jeans and boots .
Even though my friends and family thought I was crazy , they knew I had to do this .
It did n't take long to find the mysterious woman .
Her name was Maria Khosa and she was a ' lion shaman ' and a renowned sangoma , or medicine woman .
When we met again , she told me how she had heard our panic - ridden shouts in the darkness that night and come to our aid .
She explained that the lion was not an enemy but a guardian spirit .
Like a little lion lamb : Linda found Marah in a ' canned ' hunting camp in a town called Bethlehem , in South Africa 's Free State province
Over the next six years , I spent as much time as I could with Maria , getting to know her , learning how important it was to love and respect nature - and the white lions formed a huge part of that teaching .
To the tribal elders , they are sacred animals , but hunting has meant they had died out in the wild .
My first direct contact with a white lion was a female cub named Tendile .
She belonged to Ed Hern , who owned the Rhino and Lion Reserve , about a 45 - minute drive from Johannesburg .
Hern was hand - rearing the cub , but within weeks of her birth , trophy hunters were asking him how much they would have to pay him for the chance to hunt her .
To my profound relief , Hern remained unswayed .
Given the white lions ' rarity , it is not surprising that they mean big revenue , especially throughout the ' canned ' lion trophy industry , which breeds lions in captivity in order to be shot by paying customers .
Despite public outcry , it is a practice that draws clients from prosperous countries .
On the two occasions I visited Tendile , seeing her grow into a magnificent lioness , I knew that I wanted to save these animals .
' I can't imagine anything more rewarding than what I do now .
These lions are my children '
Maria told me that I would be sent a sign to show me what I had to do next .
I was somewhat disbelieving , but then I heard from a friend about a white lioness cub that had been born in a ' canned ' hunting camp in a town called Bethlehem , in South Africa 's Free State province , on Christmas Day .
It was the only sign I needed - I knew then that I would not rest until I had freed this cub and brought her to Timbavati .
Her name was Marah and I was able to make a secret visit to the camp to see her .
She was like a little lion lamb , and I fell in love with her on sight .
To get her out , I enlisted the help of the courts and , fortunately for me , because Marah 's father had been stolen from a zoo , it meant the zoo had a legal right to demand that she be handed over .
The camp was raided by the police and Marah was rescued .
The plan had been for me to take her to Timbavati and set her free , but the zoo , realising that they had a prime genetic specimen for breeding , now refused to hand her over .
I returned to the courts to fight for her once again , arguing that I had a contract with the zoo to adopt Marah .
And , while I waited for the court to make a decision , Marah gave birth to three snow - white cubs .
It was during my fight to free Marah , which took me two years , that I set up the Global White Lion Protection Trust in 2002 .
But with my savings dwindling , I needed to raise money and awareness of our struggle to ensure the survival of the white lions .
I knew that the only way to protect them was to buy land in Timbavati , the white lion 's ancestral home , and secure it as a protected area for them where they could live without fear of being hunted .
I could n't afford to buy a large enough piece of land , but then Sheryl Leach , an American philanthropist and the creator of the children 's TV character , Barney , the purple dinosaur , heard about the Trust and made a huge donation , so we were able to buy 2,200 acres .
Fight for survival : Linda knew that the only way to protect the white lions was to buy land in Timbavati , their ancestral home
Marah and her cubs arrived in Timbavati in 2004 , and we had to ensure that the lions had as little human contact as possible so that they remained ' wild ' .
From the start , she defied all the critics who said that because she had been born in captivity and having no camouflage because of her whiteness , she would never learn to hunt .
But she tried - and , by day five , she had hunted down and caught a porcupine .
After five weeks , she was totally self - sufficient and able to feed herself and her cubs without any outside help .
A year later , we needed to introduce lions from other bloodlines to increase the population .
Marah 's two sons were now old enough to form their own pride , which they did with two tawny lionesses from the region .
The Trust also introduced another rescued white male , Mandla , from a different bloodline , who paired off with Marah 's daughter , Zihra .
Last year , she gave birth to three snowy cubs , the first white lion cubs to be born in the wild since 1991 .
Tragically , after all Marah had been through , she died in 2007 while hunting - she 'd crawled into a warthog burrow , which collapsed on her .
I have struggled to make sense of her death , because , without her , there would have been no Global White Lion Protection Trust .
But I take some comfort from the fact that , just like her birth on Christmas Day , there is something symbolic about her dying at Easter time .
And so our fight to save the white lions and to see an end to ' canned ' hunting goes on .
We have two prides of nine lions , and we expect more cubs to be born soon .
However , with more births , the amount of land we need increases because , once the youngsters grow up , they will need their own territory .
Today , I live within the safe area with my partner , Jason Turner - a lion ecologist who heads up the Trust 's scientific projects - and our two prides roam free in their natural habitat .
While Jason studies the genetics of the white lions , I am more focused on the mythical side , so together we make a great team .
People ask me if I miss my old life , but I can't imagine anything more rewarding than what I do now .
These lions are my children .
They recognise me , but I keep my distance and allow them their independence .
I look at them like any mother with a brood of growing youngsters .
And , in the end , the most loving gift you can give is freedom .

In an interview with the BBC , Sri Lanka ’s powerful defense minister , Gotabaya Rajapaksa , exploded with rage and said that the former head of the country ’s military , Gen. Sarath Fonseka , who was lauded last year for defeating a Tamil separatist insurgency , could be hanged for reportedly claiming that the government had ordered the military to execute prisoners .
General Fonseka was arrested in February , just days after losing a presidential election to Mahinda Rajapaksa , the defense secretary ’s brother , and charged in a military court with having engaged in opposition politics while still serving in the government .
Last month he appeared in civil court to answer a separate charge that he had incited unrest by saying in a newspaper interview that the defense secretary had ordered the execution of surrendering Tamil Tiger rebels .
As the BBC reported , the general “ said he had been misquoted by the newspaper and that the case was part of an attempt to silence him . ”
Stephen Sackur , who conducted this week ’s interview with Gotabaya Rajapaksa , explained on the BBC ’s Web site :
General Fonseka told me , in a clandestine telephone interview , that he would be prepared to testify before any independent investigation of alleged abuses during the Tamil war .
“ I will not hide anything , ” he said .
When I put this possibility to Mr. Rajapaksa he responded with an extraordinary tirade .
In the interview , after Mr. Sackur asked if General Fonseka was in detention and faces court martial “ because he , in essence , accused you of a war crime ? ” Mr. Rajapaksa shouted :
He ca n’t do that .
He was the commander .
He ’s responsible — that ’s a treason !
We will hang him if he do that !
I ’m telling you , that ’s a treason !
How can he lie that ?
How can he betray the country ?
How can he , by such lies — if he says that , he is a liar .
He is a liar !
Since the end of the war with the Tamil Tigers , Sri Lanka ’s government has resisted calls for an international war crimes investigation from human rights groups and the United Nations .
The conflict between Sri Lanka ’s defense secretary and its former military commander is also complicated by the fact that Mr. Rajapaksa is an American citizen , who once worked as a computer systems administrator in Southern California , and General Fonseka holds a green card granting him the right to permanent residence in the United States .
As The Lede mentioned in January , during Mr. Fonseka ’s visit to America to see his daughters last year , he was reportedly asked by the Department of Homeland Security to discuss Gotabaya Rajapaksa ’s possible involvement in war crimes during the final campaign against the Tamil Tigers .
Mr. Fonseka returned to Sri Lanka instead .
In excerpts from the interview broadcast on Sri Lankan television , Mr. Rajapaksa strenuously defended the conduct of Sri Lanka ’s military during the conflict with the Tamil Tigers .
“ I can tell you one thing , ” he said .
“ Our military was a highly disciplined military . ”

Mordechai Vanunu , who served 18 years in prison for leaking Israel 's nuclear secrets , began to serve a three - month prison sentence on Sunday .
Vanunu , who was released in 2004 , returned to prison after refusing to perform community service for contacting a foreigner without authorization , a violation of his parole .
He was arrested last December on suspicion that he had met with a Norwegian national at a hotel lobby .
Vanunu 's attorney had stressed then that the man 's ties with the Norwegian woman had nothing whatsoever to do with espionage .
" I survived 18 years [ in prison ] - I could survive [ even ] another six , " Vanunu shouted outside the Jerusalem District Court on Sunday .
" Are you trying to discipline me ?
You can not take my freedom of expression away ... I 'm not an animal , " he stated .
A panel of Supreme Court justices decided last Tuesday to return Vanunu to prison after the former technician at the alleged Dimona nuclear plant was denied his request to serve his community service in Arab - dominated east Jerusalem .
He told the judges that he was worried about being attacked in west Jerusalem by angry Israelis .
Vanunu was jailed in Israel for discussing details of his work as a Dimona technician with the British .
He reportedly revealed Israeli nuclear secrets and gave the newspaper photographs of the plant 's operation .
Under the terms of his parole , Vanunu also is prohibited from leaving the country or approaching foreign embassies .
Germany provided a real signal of intent with a thrilling demolition of 10 - man Australia to get their 2010 World Cup campaign off to a flying start .
Coming into the tournament without injured talisman Michael Ballack , doubts over the future of coach Joachim Loew and the second - youngest squad in the competition , many might have expected Germany to struggle in South Africa .
But if their effervescent display in Durban is anything to go by , the three - time champions could be real contenders for the title come 11 July .
Lukas Podolski and Miroslav Klose continued their remarkable scoring record at international level with a goal apiece to take their joint tally to 88 , Thomas Mueller and Cacau added the gloss , while in playmaker Mesut Ozil they appear to have found a real superstar .
They were aided by the harsh dismissal of Australia 's key man Tim Cahill , given a straight red card for a clumsy but hardly malevolent challenge on Bastian Schweinsteiger on 55 minutes .
Germany , though , had given notice of their attacking class long before that .
Klose has already been denied by Aussie keeper Mark Schwarzer when Podolski drilled in the opener from Mueller 's cross , and moments after Klose had wasted another glorious chance , poking wide from eight yards , the Bayern Munich man nodded in Phillip Lahm 's delicious cross to make it 2 - 0 .
In fairness , Australia had the odd half - chance , Jason Culina heading a Brett Emerton cross over and Richard Garcia sending a snap - shot past the post - while a second - half appeal for handball against Per Mertesacker in the box might have warranted closer inspection .
But what Germany lacked in defensive strength , they more than made up for in pace , power and technique up front .
Ozil twice had the chance to get on the scoresheet having been sent through one - on - one , his first effort cleared off the line by Lucas Neill and his touch failing him the second time .
And then came Cahill 's sending off , after which Germany 's domination was absolute .
Schwarzer did his best to keep the score down , saving twice from Klose , and once apiece from Sami Khedira and Podolski as Germany tore through the Australia defences time and again .
But the Fulham keeper could do little about Germany 's third , Mueller tucking in off the post from the edge of the area , and even less about their fourth , substitute Cacau tapping in from Ozil 's centre .
Loew took the opportunity to rest the likes of Klose , Ozil and Podolski thereafter and , as a result , the Germans were unable to maintain their fluidity in attack in the closing stages .
Australia even carved a late chance for a consolation , Nikita Rukavytsya volleying straight at keeper Manuel Neuer from Scott Chipperfield 's cross .
However , the Germans ' work had long been done at that point and they saw the match out in comfort to take top spot in Group D and serve warning to their rivals in South Africa .

A Saudi court convicted a man and sentenced him to four months in prison and 90 lashes for kissing a woman in a mall , a government - owned daily reported Thursday .
Saudi religious police arrested the man and two women after seeing them on mall cameras " engaging in immoral movements in front of other shoppers , " the Al - Yom newspaper said .
The man , who is in his 20s , was seen with a woman " sitting on one of the chairs , exchanging kisses and hugs . "
It was unclear what the other woman was doing .
Neither the man nor the women were identified by name .
The kingdom 's powerful religious police , under the control of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice , enforce Saudi Arabia 's strict interpretation of Islam , which prohibits unrelated men and women from mingling .
Zealous officers routinely jail unrelated couples found sitting together in restaurants or coffee shops .
The policemen also patrol public places to ensure women are covered and not wearing makeup , shops close five times a day for Muslim prayers and men go to the mosque and worship .
Such kissing busts have increased as economic pressures have made it harder for young couples to marry .
Young men often must pay more than $ 50,000 in dowry and gold before their brides ' families will accept marriage - a huge burden in a country where economists put male unemployment at over 20 percent .
But the Saudi establishment remains divided on how far separation rules should go .
King Abdullah has been encouraging change in the oil - rich kingdom since becoming crown prince in 1982 , and has intensified his efforts since assuming the throne in 2005 .
Male and female students can study together at the newly opened King Abdullah Science and Technology University , launched by the Saudi monarch last year .
Abdullah dismissed a prominent hard - line cleric who criticized the policy .
But in April , the head of the religious police fired the chief of the Mecca branch for suggesting that women and men should be able to mix freely , showing that such reforms have their limits .
The newspaper said the man sentenced for kissing will receive his 90 lashes in three batches , and is banned from malls for two years .
The women will be tried in another court .
“ The technology must be scaled down , and the period for which the data can be retained should be brought down to a month .
The Government has never made a case for why it needs to be kept longer than this . ”
A nurse famously photographed being kissed by an American sailor in New York ’s Times Square in 1945 to celebrate the end of World War Two has died at the age of 91 , her family said on Tuesday .
The V - J Day picture of the white - clad Edith Shain by photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt captured an epic moment in U.S. history and became an iconic image marking the end of the war after being published in Life magazine .
The identity of the nurse in the photograph was not known until the late 1970s when Shain wrote to the photographer saying that she was the woman in the picture taken on Aug. 14 at a time when she had been working at Doctor ’s Hospital in New York City .
The identity of the sailor remains disputed and unresolved .
From then on the photograph also made its mark on Shain ’s life as the fame she garnered led to invites to war related events such a wreath layings , parades and other memorial events .
“ My mom was always willing take on new challenges and caring for the World War II veterans energized her to take another chance to make a difference , ” her son Justin Decker said in a statement .
Shain , who died at her home in Los Angeles on Sunday , leaves behind three sons , six grandchildren and eight great - grandchildren .

Abstract
This short paper discusses various aspects of Lisp 's interaction with the outside world , including file systems , error systems , and window systems .
Observations are made about the current state of Common Lisp and its interactions with the " outside . "
Suggestions are made about possible future directions for Lisp evolution .
Introduction
It should be obvious to any student of Common LISP : The Language ( CLtL ) [ Steele 84 ] that Common Lisp is not so much a language as it is a constraint on a language .
The fact that a myriad of technical details are left unspecified means that every actual implementation of present day Common Lisp must have significant implementation - dependent aspects .
This implies that there can be no implementation will run in any other implementation .
Of the many issues left vague by CLtL , some are related to data representation or algorithms , which may need to vary between implementations .
The site - effect behavior of operators like DELETE and REMPROP is not fully specified , for example .
Also , various issues of sharing between structures created by the QUOTE special form and the backquote facility are left up to the implementation .
Although significant , these issues do not preempt the programmer 's ability to use the associated facilities because the parts that are left vague are not necessary to the useful employment of those facilities .
The lack of specification is an important use of information hiding which for the most part adds strength , rather than weakness , to the Common Lisp language .
In contrast , however , some things left vague in CLtL cannot be justified as desirable information hiding .
These are things which programmers frequently do need to know , but which were not possible for the designers of Common Lisp to agree upon prior to the publication of CLtL .
They include interfaces to the file system , where a standard exists but needs repair ; the error system , where a standard is ready to be proposed ; and the window system , where considerable design work remains to be done before a standard can be considered .
Vendors have tried independently to fill the gaps left by CLtL , and many of their solutions have been quite creative .
But rarely have they been compatible with one another .
In the end , developers of portable application programs are always left to answer the same important question :
" Do I settle for the least common denominator for the sake of portability , or do I use the best of what each system provides at the cost of maintaining implementation - dependent code ? "
The File System
A Standard in Need of Repair
Many users are surprised to find how ill defined the CLtL file system interface really is .
This is probably because most implementations make good faith effort to provide a useful interpretation of the fairly vague terminology which the pathname chapter contains .
As such , the programmer often does n't realize how much he is taking for granted until he tries to port his application to another implementation , particularly one provided by a different vendor on a different operating system .
Common Lisp is not entirely to blame here .
It would have been very desirable to say that all file systems have hierarchical directories ; that all filenames have at least 32 characters ; that all filenames have a name , a type , and a version ; or that all file systems use upper ( or lower ) case as canonical in filenames .
But file systems are separate from Lisp in most implementations ; they come with the operating system and they have fixed , unmodifiable constraints that make the specification of a portable standard very complicated .
In order to present the illusion of added structure , Common Lisp could have simulated types or version numbers for file systems which did n't provide them primitively , but in cases where Lisp needed to cooperate with other programs that did not analogous simulation , many problems would probably have arisen .
The Lisp Machine community had dealt successfully with " generic file systems " for years , but only by providing a much larger set of primitives than the Common Lisp designers were willing to accept .
Although the Common Lisp pathname system was based on the Lisp Machines , in fact that it was only a subset proved to be a problem .
Given the degree of variation in file systems , there were really only two ways in which the Common Lisp file system interface could have been done better :
The designers of Common Lisp could have decided that the problem was too complicated for a serious interface to be provided and could have provided a radically simpler interface .
For example , they might have defined that functions like LOAD and OPEN takes only strings and might have asserted that such strings are inherently implementation - dependent and must be dealt with using sharpsign conditionals .
( Present day reality is n't far from this . )
The designers of Common Lisp could have opted to provide primitives and functionally more like what is provided on Lisp Machines .
However , there were many who believed that Common Lisp was already too large ; it is unlikely that any additional complexity could have gotten past the committee .
Many of the problems with the Common Lisp file system interface were not anticipated by the designers .
This is probably because implementors were initially concerned primarily with their own interfaces .
They read the manual and implemented that they believed was a true interpretation of what it said .
Only when users began to port programs from implementation to implementation did the degree of divergence become apparent .
The Condition System
Ready for Standardization
Traditionally , Lisp and most other languages have treated program errors as things which should simply never happen .
If you got an error , your program halted ; there was nothing more to be done .
It is this hard - line of errors which is to a large extent responsible for the dim view that the public has traditionally taken towards computers .
The traditional stereotype of a computer which , given a large problem that contains only a minor detail in error , simply says , " It does not compute ! " ( rather than being more fault tolerant ) is not far from the truth .
About all that CLtL says about errors is that they are " handled in an implementation - dependent way . "
It suggests that each implementation have an interactive debugger although it offers no further detail .
It also suggests that implementors provide a means for trapping errors , but again it gives no detailed advice .
This leaves writers of large , portable programs in a quandary because most of the functions in CLtL are willing under some circumstances to signal an error .
In a few cases , there is no defined way to test in advance for those circumstances in order to avoid them .
( Various floating - point arithmetic and file system errors are common examples . )
Fortunately , the state of the art in handling Lisp error conditions has improved dramatically in the past five years , and Common Lisp is now in a position to adopt a condition system which will substantially improve the condition handling capabilities of user programs .
The system being developed [ Pitman 87 ] is a modification of a design originated by Weinreb and others at Symbolics in 1983 .
In this system , an error is signaled when a program wants to admit to the " outside world " that it is struck and does not know how to usefully proceed .
No further computation can occur without external intervention .
Programs may at any time establish restart points to which control may be transferred in the event of trouble .
At the point where an error occurs , there is an effective branch in the road with typically several restart points to which control might be transferred .
Other programs can handle the condition by providing advice about which branch to take .
As soon as a selection is made , the process of handling is complete and the original program continues .
The error condition is represented by a structured object which holds information about the situation .
The signaling protocol is standardized in a way that allows other programs to conveniently receive information about a condition being signaled and the restarts available in that context .
Those programs can then provide advice about how to proceed .
If no program offers advice about how to proceed , handling is attempted interactively using the debugger .
Some important features of this condition system are :
The representation of conditions as objects is standardized .
A hierarchy of condition types is provided .
Simple type discrimination is a common way to decide whether and how to proceed from various errors .
Information about how the condition object is displayed is separated from the structure of the object , so handlers need not parse error message strings .
In some older Lisp dialects , certain kinds of errors could not be signaled unless the signaler was prepared to handle a particular style of restarting .
In this system , the process of signaling and the process of establishing restarts are usefully decoupled .
Using the condition system requires no special understanding of Lisp internals .
The program interface is surprisingly portable .
The system has been generalized to allow the notion of non-error ( non-fatal ) conditions , which do not require user intervention even if unhandled .
Graphics and Windows
Standard Needed , But None is Sight
More and more programmers have at their disposal a bit - mapped screen , a state - of - the - art pointing device , and perhaps even a full window system .
In spite of this , the set of display operations available in Common Lisp is extremely limited .
The only operations defined are those which are fully compatible with a screen printing terminal interface .
The programmer cannot even reliably clear the screen using only Common Lisp primitives , much less read a cursor position , draw a box , or accept mouse input .
There are competing theories about how windows and graphics should be introduced into Common Lisp .
Common Lisp could provide a standard Lisp - level interface to a low level console device control protocol such as X .
This is the approach taken by those involved in the CLX effort .
It would assure a strong base on which to build portable programs which use windows and graphics .
It would also simplify the task of the documentation writer because only a single interface style would generally need to be documented .
There are two main disadvantages to this approach .
The first is that the X protocol is too low level .
Even its strong proponents agree that at least one and perhaps several layers of abstraction need to be built upon it before a level is reached which is practical for day - to- day programming .
The second disadvantage is that it causes an application to have the same look on all systems , rather than allowing its interface to adapt to the interface style of the host system .
This tends to thwart the desire of hardware or operating system vendors to provide a " uniform look " for all products that run in their environment .
Alternatively , Common Lisp could provide a very abstract interface to the window system .
This is the approach taken by ; the CommonWindows effort .
This approach is likely to appeal most to users because it provides the Lisp system with the greatest latitude in producing an interface that is culturally compatible with other programs running on that same machine .
The key disadvantages are that there is less opportunity for the application designer to do any fine tuning of the interface , and that documentation for portable applications may be considerably more complicated since the interface could have a very different " feel " in each environment .
Given the tremendous market pressure to find a solution to the window system problem in the near term , and given the Common Lisp tradition for compromise , it seems likely that the ultimate result will be a hybrid one .
Probably layers such as the following will continue to be added from low level to high level as they can be agreed upon :
Low Level Device Control Protocol
Interactive Stream Protocol
Output Graphics Protocol
Window System or User Interface Management System
At the same time , certain high level interfaces will probably be provided directly .
For example , one could easily imagine the Common Lisp designers moving to adopt facilities for high - level interfaces to common idiomatic tasks , such as simple menus , multiple - choice menus , box drawing , and table formatting .
Those who could not make do with these high level interfaces would presumably fall back on whatever layer of the emerging layered display protocol had been standardized upon the time the standard went to press , or sacrifice compatibility with the portable standard by suing a proprietary or " de facto " standard .
Even once the display protocols are worked out , there is a long list of other issues related to windows which have been swept under the rug by the current Common Lisp design but which show up often enough in everyday programming to deserve explicit treatment in some future standard .
Among these are the question of newline confirmation of input , the echoing behavior of interactive READ - CHAR , input editing , character sets , fonts , multi-processing ( including issues of memory sharing ) , locks , and asynchronous interrupts .
Conclusion
Common Lisp has traditionally attempted to stay out of the business of specifying " programming environments . "
Yet the constant pressure from users to provide an environment in which complex applications can be delivered portably is somewhat in conflict with this desire .
The new Common Lisp condition system leaves many decisions still open to the implementation , but moves a step closer to changing Common Lisp from a programming language to a complete programming environment .
The various window systems proposals which are being considered still continue this trend .
Those who think Common Lisp is already too big should brace themselves for things yet to come .
