For once , the invoking of the teenage victim of online stalking is probably not completely cynical .
Sometimes , it is .
In 2002 , after 13 - year - old cheerleader Christina Long was apparently killed by someone she met online , politicians purported to honor her memory by passing the " Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act " to create the .kids.us domain space exclusively for content aimed at children 12 and under .
Nobody with an ounce of sense could have truly believed that the existence a . kids.us domain would have prevented Christina Long 's death ( and certainly not the people who knew the facts of her case , since the police found that she had been actively looking for older sex partners online ) .
In Megan Meier 's case , at least the proposed laws are on - topic , and the authors probably really believe they will help .
But will they ?
Consider two laws proposed by state senators in Megan 's home state of Missouri .
Senate Bill 762 , introduced by Sen. Yvonne Wilson , would require schools to adopt anti-cyberbullying policies .
Sen. Scott Rupp has introduced Senate Bill 818 , which would prohibit " cyber harassment " defined as conduct which " serves no legitimate purpose , that would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress , and that actually causes substantial emotional distress to that person " , with increased penalties if committed by an adult over 21 against a minor under 17 .
Obviously the Wilson bill would not have applied in the Meier case , since the harassment was not committed by a real school student , but the bill could have still been inspired by an attempt to prevent future incidents caused by real students .
The Rupp bill could apply to any teen - on - teen or even adult - on - adult harassment .
So what actual effect would they have ?
The Wilson bill punts the question by simply requiring school districts to set up anti-cyberbullying policies , but not specifying what would be prohibited or what the consequences would be .
This is not to say that the state legislature should have micro-managed what school districts should prohibit , but there 's no way to find fault with a bill that leaves the decisions up to someone else .
However , any policy that attempts to regulate off - campus conduct would run into constitutional problems , as most cyber - bullying occurs outside of school ( since Facebook and MySpace remain blocked to most students ) .
That leaves the Rupp bill , which is far more detailed , but still less than specific as far as people being able to read it and know in advance what kind of conduct is prohibited .
Would it really criminalize any messages sent between teenagers that led to hurt feelings ?
The bill says that it does not apply to " constitutionally protected activity " , falling into the general category of bills that say " This bill prohibits XYZ except that anything protected by the First Amendment is n't prohibited " , supposedly so that people can't say the bill violates the First Amendment , but which really means that nobody knows what 's allowed .
The bill helpfully explains that " such constitutionally protected activity includes picketing or other organized protests " , but since most cyberbullying does not take the form of tormentors sending their targets pictures of picket signs reading " ERIC IS GAY " , this still does n't help to determine what is permitted .
But there 's something much more worrisome here .
The conduct prohibited in the bill does n't depend entirely on the message itself ; it is restricted to content " that actually causes substantial emotional distress " .
Presumably this seemed like a good way to target the kinds of messages that caused Megan Meier to kill herself , without also outlawing all the other thousands of " You suck and I do n't want to be your friend any more " sent between teenagers every day .
But consider from the point of view of a message 's recipient :
At some point in the future , a victim of cyberbullying might know that other cases of cyberbullying have been prosecuted , butin cases where they caused the victim " substantial emotional distress " .
So the law says to the victim :
You can strike back against your tormentors , you can ruin their lives and let the world know what they did to you , but And that 's the basic Catch - 22 of cyberbullying legislation :
You can't prohibit meanness that causes someone to harm themselves , without also prohibiting the basic meanness that many teenagers put up with every day — unless you make the crime contingent on the victim actually harming themselves , in which case you 've created hugely perverse incentives for them to do so .
I admit I do n't have an easy answer either .
The National Crime Prevention Center lists tips for teens to deal with cyberbulling : " (1 ) Refuse to pass along cyberbullying messages ; ( 2 ) Tell friends to stop cyberbullying ; ( 3 ) Block communication with cyberbullies ; ( 4 ) Report cyberbullying to a trusted adult . "
Sorry , I 'm sure they do n't mean well , but if you 're a teen and your problem is people saying hurtful things about you online to your friends , this is so unhelpful as to probably leave the victim feeling worse .
1 through 3 do n't even address the problem , and " report it to an adult " ?
Most cyberbullying is not illegal .
So I would take the efforts that schools put into preventing cyberbullying — which may not deter the worst bullies , and which could be unconstitutional as applied to off - campus activity anyway — and reinvest them into teaching kids to deal with it : the self - esteem building programs which are much derided as political correctness run amok , but which can be judged a success if they help build resistance to bullying .
Above all , put as much emphasis on tracking the results of esteem building programs , as on tracking the results of regular academic programs , so that statistics can be used to determine after the fact what kinds of programs are working best , rather than going in with preconceived notions .
Learning how to deal with catty bitches ought to be treated as at least as important as learning the date when the Treaty of Ghent was signed .
Out in the real world , there are still catty bitches , but nobody ever asks you about the Treaty of Ghent .
With all the talk about the housing bubble and ways to help fix the situation , it seems that for every solution , two more problems pop up .
We saw housing prices fall in the last couple months , but then we hear that the inflation rate in 2007 went up 6.3 % , the largest increase in 17 years .
Now an approved stimulus package has been aimed at the struggling lower and middle classes by giving them checks ranging from $ 600 to $ 1,200 .
However , many homeowners know that the sad truth is that the money that the government hopes will fuel retail purchases and the economy , will likely just be used to help folks stay in their homes one more month while they try to avoid foreclosure .
The House , seizing a rare moment of bipartisanship to respond to the economy ’s slump , overwhelmingly passed a $ 146 billion aid package Tuesday that would speed rebates of $ 600 - $ 1,200 to most taxpayers . …
The measure would send rebates to some 111 million people , including roughly 35 million families who do n’t make enough to pay income taxes .
Individuals with adjusted gross income of $ 75,000 and couples making $ 150,000 would get rebates equal to the taxes they paid , up to $ 600 for individuals and $ 1,200 for couples .
Those making more than that would see their rebate go down by 5 percent of every dollar of income over the limits .
Taxpayers would get at least $ 300 , even if they paid less than that in taxes — or $ 600 for couples .
That ’s also the case for those who do n’t pay income taxes but earn at least $ 3,000 .
All eligible people would get an additional $ 300 per child .
Despite these glimmers of hope though , it seems that affordable real estate still eludes the grasp of many buyers .
What real estate slump ?
The Bay Area 's rich are still snapping up high - end properties for record sums .
On Friday , a mystery shopper agreed to buy the unfinished penthouse at the Millennium Tower for $ 11 million .
That 's $ 2,288.81 for each of the San Francisco property 's 4,800 square feet , a range rarely exceeded even when the space is built out - that is to say , when it actually includes walls and finishes .
The buyer , who was n't identified per the building owner 's policy , put down $ 1 million to begin the escrow process .
The deal is further evidence that people are willing to pay ever higher prices for luxury Bay Area real estate , particularly downtown San Francisco condominiums , even as thousands of average homeowners are wrestling with plummeting prices and fighting off the specter of foreclosure .
High - end homes operate in their own universe because the availability is limited and the very wealthy are largely immune to the main factors dragging down the broader market .
" On the upper end , it has definitely gone up , " said Alan Mark of the Mark Co. , a marketing and research firm for the condominium industry .
" There 's a deep market for large , high - end condominium residences that have great views . "
New York - based Millennium Partners is developing the $ 500 million , 60 - story glass structure at 301 Mission St. , which is scheduled to open in spring 2009 .
Sales began in November and despite an average price tag of $ 2.5 million , the company is well ahead of its goals , said Richard Baumert , managing director with Millennium .
" The momentum has been pretty strong since the day we opened , " he said .

And not just at the Millennium .
During the fourth quarter of last year , 40 condos and single - family homes traded hands in San Francisco for more than $ 3 million - adding up to a total of $ 213.8 million in real estate sales , according to Pacific Union GMAC Real Estate .
That 's up from 22 sales for $ 119.4 million a year earlier .
The trend has continued into the new year :
-- A six - bedroom , five - bath home listed for $ 6.45 million in Ross went into escrow in January .
-- A three - bedroom , two - bath property on 113 acres in Calistoga sold for $ 6 million on Feb .
7 .
--
An eight - bedroom , 9 1/2 - bath house in Hillsborough traded hands for $ 11 million .
It went on the market Jan. 28 , sold on Jan. 29 and closed on Feb .
5 .
-- Units that sold at the St. Regis Hotel and Residences in San Francisco two years ago are trading for 50 percent more today .
These deals are occurring even as the broader market tumbles , with resale homes in the nine - county Bay Area falling 43.7 percent in January and median prices dropping nearly 9 percent from a year earlier , according to DataQuick Information Systems .
The high - end market is experiencing the opposite trend primarily because things like tight credit , prices that outpace incomes and subprime mortgages are n't of particular concern to the wealthy , who can often pay all cash , said Avram Goldman , chief executive officer of Pacific Union .
And while there is a glut of inventory in markets hammered by foreclosures , the supply of very high - end homes is extremely tight across the region .
A five - year wait for a premium property in a tony San Francisco neighborhood is not uncommon , said Malin Giddings , who specializes in upscale San Francisco real estate for TRI Coldwell Banker .
" We have so many more buyers who have money than we have inventory , " she said .
" I do n't care how much money you have , I can not make people move . "
On top of that , more people are becoming wealthy , as the rich are getting richer - creating additional demand that pushes prices higher .
The top 1 percent of California 's taxpayers saw their income jump 107.7 percent from 1995 to 2005 , after adjusting for inflation , according to a California Budget Project report last year .
Similarly , Forbes reported late last year that the collective net worth of the individuals on its 400 richest list grew $ 290 billion from the prior year to $ 1.54 trillion .
" The affluence in the U.S. is the greatest it has ever been , " said Richard Welty , president of Welty Capital Management in Lafayette .
" They 're taking ( money ) out of investments and buying that dream house . "
ejabberd is probably the first XMPP application server ever released .
This article introduces this new concept and explains how to build a distributed event - based infrastructure for social networking .
The example application that illustrate this article is a distributed Twitter - like microblogging platform .
Introduction
Since I designed the first version of the pluggable pubsub module for ejabberd in early 2007 , I had in mind to turn it into a powerful application server .
I have already blogged about the power of the new API of ejabberd 2.0 pubsub engine .
However , this single article does not do any justice to this idea and how it can change the face of the web .
Customizable services based on pubsub is XMPP ( eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ) at its full speed .
The XMPP protocol has been designed since the beginning to be a near real time routing / distribution engine .
A piece in the puzzle was missing however .
This is where I think our new plugin based pubsub API fills the gap and turn ejabberd into the first XMPP application server .
As a proof of concept and as a way to robustify our API , we have written the Personal Eventing via Pubsub ( PEP ) as a plugin of our pubsub engine .
It is a big specification and should clearly show the potential of the framework .
The XMPP application server : The Twitter case
The PEP implementation was still not enough to demonstrate that ejabberd is a fault - tolerant , highly scalable application development platform for the Web 2.0 era .
I decided to start a serie of articles demonstrating how to build a distributed Twitter - like microblogging platform based on ejabberd 2.0 .
Step 1
The goals of the first development step are the following :
Write a new ejabberd service as a pubsub extension : this is a XMPP Twitter - like application code itself .
Show that you can integrate with other pieces of the XMPP framework and not only the event distribution :
The code uses the service browser as a user interface , building a fully dynamic hierarchy .
Write the near realtime publishing / distribution code .
To show how powerfull it is , I wrote the code in a way that node creation and subscriptions are not necessary .
You only have to publish content and it is distributed to anyone that can see your presence .
The end result , like PEP , is closely integrated to the user roster .
The architecture is distributed across as many user base ( domain ) as you want : A user can get events from users having their account in a large number of different servers .
Writing a new plugin to define custom node hierarchy
I wanted to build a special service hierarchy so that the application integrates nicely in XMPP service discovery .
I wanted a dynamic discovery tree whose content was depending on who was doing the query .
This would make the application more user friendly and the example much more impressive .
To write a custom node hierarchy with our API , you simply have to write a nodetree plugin .
I have written the nodetree_twitter module to handle our special hierachy looking like the following :
Root node : “ twitter ”
Special node : MyStream .
This is a collection displaying your latest published posts .
Special node : FriendsStream .
It contains the latest posts of my friends .
Special node : MyFriends .
It contains the list of your friends and allow you to see the latest posts of a given contact .
Friends are taken from the instant messaging contacts list : I defined this friends list as “ the people that already share their presence with me ” .
This way users do not have to manage the cumbersome subscription process specially for this application :
Their friends from their contact list are cleverly reused .
Note that the node hierarchy is not defined in the Pubsub specification ( XEP - 0060 ) , but is totally needed to make the application flexible .
This pubsub node hierarchy does not violate the Pubsub specification , so we are fine with it .
This is the result as shown by Psi ’s service discovery : :
The contact Blaine ( thank you for your comments , by the way ) is coming directly from my roster .
Posting entries
Posting an event is simply sending a small piece of XML code in ejabberd .
As Psi does not support publishing events to our special virtual nodes ( yet ; ) ) , we will send it from Psi XML console .
For example , I can send the following piece of code in the XML console .
I publish the post on my special pubsub node MyStream :
< iq type=' set ' to=' pubsub.localhost ' id='publish1 '>
< pubsub xmlns= 'https://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
< publish node= '/twitter/MyStream '> < item > Demoing my Twitter - like code</item > </ publish > </ pubsub > </iq >
The message is received instantly by all the contacts that have subscribed to my presence .
No polling mechanism is needed .
This is the beauty of using ejabberd XMPP App Server .
The received message is the following :
< message from=" pubsub.localhost " to =" test1@localhost " > < event xmlns= " https://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#event " > < items node= " /twitter/FriendsStream " > < item id =" 4B2C8277256 F " > Demoing my Twitter - like code</item > < /items > </ event > </ message >
Note that the dynamic hierarchy is very powerful :
We publish on our special node .
The message seems to come from another special node on the other end , for the sake of consistency .
Persistence
I did nothing special for persistence of the published items .
It is handled as a default by the ejabberd pubsub framework .
We can browse our new service to check that the blog post has been actually published :
I did not yet write the part of the code to browse friends posts .
This will be part of a second article .
Conclusions
The end result is the basis of a Twitter - like application .
It is fully distributed at the web scale .
You can run this application on different servers and get events from people with account on different servers .
It is compliant with ejabberd clustering and high scalability features .
Most of all , thanks to our Pubsub API , I wrote this first code in 3 hours .
It tooks something like 200 to 300 lines of code to write this extremely powerful infrastructure .
Yes , that ’s amazing , I agree , as I was surprised myself by how easy and fast it was to write !
After a bit of clean - up , the code will be added to ProcessOne contributions Subversion repository .
If you are impatient to play with the code , please drop me a mail :)
In a next article , I will present the second stage of this application .
I will add better and complete browsing of the items and publish directly for the service browser thank to adhoc commands supported in Psi .
In the meantime , I hope to get this experiment running with client developers :
It would be very nice see the messages received properly displayed in OneTeam and in Psi .
Stay tuned !
David Letterman Gets his Writers Back From the Strike
is one savvy man !
Not only will his late night show with CBS return to the air on January 2nd , but he will return will his full staff of writers .
Jeff Hermanson , an executive of the Writers Guild of America said Worldwide Pants , Letterman 's production company , reached a " full , binding , independent agreement . "
Letterman will not be the only late night show to return .
Jay Leno , Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Kimmel will also be back but still without a writing staff .
Maybe they need to get a negotiating lesson from Dave .

Minnesota Monitor writer Abdi Aynte , in an interview with Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) adopted FAUXNews framing in casting Ellison ’s cosigning of impeachment resolution H. Res. 333 as a move to “ … keep those [ … ] far - left constituencies happy .
The article , entitled : After a year in Congress , Ellison proves critics wrong elicited my response online :
“ Far Left ”
Submitted by
Mikael Rudolph of ImpeachforPeace.org
( not verified ) on Tue , 01/01/2008 – 14:46 .
I must challenge your insinuation that our Representative was pandering to what you have inaccurately written off as the “ far left ”  in cosigning H. Res. 333 calling for the impeachment of Vice President Richard B. Cheney .
While a member of the Minnesota House , Keith Ellison initiated a resolution to impeach both President George W. Bush and Cheney despite knowing it would not succeed due to the then - majority held by the GOP .
This was an act of integrity .
While running for Congress , Keith Ellison spoke out strongly and unflinchingly in favor of impeachment at a rally in Loring Park our organization held on October 5th , 2006 without hesitation nor fear of it affecting his electability adversely .
It did n’t .
He won handily , as he should have and he will even more clearly this fall .
Every time Rep. Ellison has been asked in an interview over the past year about his support of impeachment proceedings he has clearly and without hesitation reiterated his position against the chronic corruption and pervasively illegal activities of this worst - ever White House administration .
In an American Research Group Poll conducted last July , 54 % of Americans were found to favor impeachment hearings beginning against Cheney .
That means that 100 % of “ The Left ”  and 4 % of the moderate “ Right ”  at that time favored calling to account and publicly investigating this administration ’s “ soft fascism ”  “ “ as Presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) calls it .
Just prior to the mid-term elections of November , 2006 , editor and publisher of “ The Conservative ”  magazine and former Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan called true conservatives to vote against all Republicans who were in alignment with Bush policies .
In less than two weeks and with a nearly pervasive corporate media blackout , Rep Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) has gathered nearly 173,000 signatures calling for the impeachment of Cheney as of today :
Add your name here :
http://wexlerwantshearings.com/
Six - term Congressman Wexler along with Ellison , is a member of the House Judiciary Committee , where impeachment proceedings would be initiated .
Over 50 % of the Democratic members of the HJC have either cosigned H. Res. 333 or Wexler ’s letter calling for impeachment or both .
With a strong majority in the HJC held by the Democrats , we may be very close to hearings at long last .
Prior to Rep. Ellison cosigning 333 , I personally had the privilege of speaking in front of the monthly DFL Executive Committee meeting and calling for a resolution to encourage Ellison to cosign 333 .
The resolution was passed nearly unanimously with only one negative vote among the 40 or so in attendance .
Rep . Ellison was acting consistently with a stance he has held for years with regard to the Bush Administration “ “ not willing to be complicit by inaction with their crimes and misdemeanors .
Rep. Ellison also showed himself to be in touch with the opinions and will of his constituency as shown by the DFL Executive Committee vote and our organization ’s experience in tabling and lobbying 5th District residents over the past few years which has made clear to us that the vast majority of Minneapolis residents are strongly in favor of impeachment of both Cheney and Bush .
I strongly encourage you to reconsider the use of such misleading phrases as “ far left ” .
Can 54 % of the American people and perhaps as many as 65 - 70 % or even higher of Minnesota 5th District voters fit into your definition of “ far left ” ?
To the left of “ ˜soft fascism ’ is “ ˜centrism ’ or “ ˜populism ’ , or even democracy .
Remember that dream ?
Please leave the use of such delusory phrases as “ ˜Far Left ’ and “ ˜ Democrat Party ’ to propagandists such as Bill O’Reilly , the rest of the FAUXNews spin machine and so much of the rest of the corporate media which is often nearly indistinguishable from them .
As a journalist you need to be better than that .
You are better than that .

In any case , Megan 's mother , Tina Meier , said there was nothing to suggest her daughter would have taken her own life .
But an internet " romance " with a boy called Josh Evans changed all that .
Josh was supposed to be 16 , and he charmed Megan through her MySpace website .
They never spoke , since Josh said his parents did not have a phone .
Josh was , however , a fiction , an invention of Drew , a neighbour of the Meiers in Dardenne Plains , Missouri .
Drew created Josh to try to find out what Megan was saying about Drew 's daughter .
At one time , Lori and Curt Drew 's daughter and Megan were best friends , but they drifted apart , and when Megan changed schools she ended the friendship .
Lori Drew had told a neighbourhood girl about the hoax , and the girl 's mother , who asked for anonymity , said that " Lori laughed about it " , adding that she would " mess with Megan " .
Soon after Josh insulted and turned on Megan , she killed herself .
Law enforcement authorities warn that older children and teenagers tend to be most at risk from internet predators because they are less likely to be supervised .
They are also more open to discussing personal issues and relationships , although the predators police have in mind are probably nothing like Lori Drew .
A child and school psychologist , Laurie Zelinger , said the internet was intensifying pressures on adolescents .
They were particularly susceptible to peer pressure and peer acceptance as part of becoming independent .
" We know that kids are so desperate to be accepted that they will violate their own rules .
They need to experience affiliation , and a sense of belonging will lead children to engage in behaviours that are counter to family values and even their own sense of conscience .
" Before the internet , all of this happened in school hours .
They would pass notes in class , have sorts of sign language , use the telephone when they reached home … now neighbourhoods are more spread out , people are living in large homes , children tend to maintain contact through the internet and text messaging .
They can have this contact 24 / 7 .
It 's magnifying an issue that 's always existed . "
Zelinger said that understanding adolescent behaviour meant understanding how their brains develop , which is in a predictable pattern from back to front .
The cerebellum , located in the back , houses the amydala , which is the seat of emotion .
As such , adolescents often experience rage and fear , since that area is among the first areas to develop .
The front part of the brain , the last to develop , controls decision - making , interpreting emotions and executive decisions , rendering teens biologically incapable of making mature decisions in some contexts .
Between the ages of 12 and 16 , the prefrontal cortex also shows decreased grey matter , thereby further limiting the capability of the child to make sound decisions .
Then puberty rushes in , bringing an onslaught of hormones seeking excitement and arousal .
This combination of late front brain development , with its poor decision - making skills , and hormonal influences , often leads to risk - taking behaviour and intense emotional involvement .
Teens can thus be easily influenced , intensely reactive and especially vulnerable to the opinions of peers .
Megan Meier had tried desperately to join the popular crowd at her school , only to be teased about her weight , her mother told The New York Times .
At the beginning of eighth grade last year , she transferred to a nearby Catholic school and soon had a new group of friends , lost 9 kilograms and joined the volleyball team .
Because Megan had been on holiday with the Drews , Lori Drew knew she had been prescribed antidepressant medication and that she had a MySpace page .
As " Josh " , Drew contacted Megan through her web page .
For Megan , the online relationship sparkled until one day Josh turned on her and sent a message that read : " I do n't like the way you treat your friends , and I do n't know if I want to be friends with you . "
He also said she was " fat " and " a slut " .
They argued online for an hour and other girls who had linked to Josh 's website added abusive messages to Megan .
On October 16 , last year , Josh sent his final message , telling Megan the world " would be a better place " without her .
Soon afterwards , Tina Meier found her daughter hanging from a cloth cord .
As the crisis unfolded , Lori Drew reportedly rang the neighbourhood girl in whom she had confided , telling her to " keep her mouth shut " .
She did .
Lori and Curt Drew attended Megan 's funeral and wake ; they even asked the Meiers to hide their children 's Christmas presents in the garage .
Weeks later the neighbour who sought anonymity told Megan 's parents the truth about Josh .
" I felt like such a fool , " Ron Meier told The New York Times .
" I 'm supposed to protect my family , and here I allowed these people to inject themselves into our lives . "
He smashed the Christmas presents , and it was when the Drews complained to police about the damage that Lori Drew 's explanation for her role in Megan 's death became clear .
Tina Meier said no words could explain her rage : " These people were supposed to be our friends . "
An practitioner of internet law , Parry Aftab , says " Josh 's " attack on Megan was compounded when girls who knew Megan joined in , creating a mass cyber - bullying episode .
" Everyone says Megan had a crush on a boy and it broke up and she killed herself .
This was a lot more than that , " Aftab says .
She said girls who read Josh 's comments joined in the attack .
Aftab says bullying comprises 80 per cent of complaints to social networking sites .
" Cyber bullying follows you everywhere .
It will follow you home and to grandma's .
You can't avoid it by leaving the schoolyard and you never know if it 's your best friend or your worst enemy , " she says .
" Sixty per cent of cyber - bullying is anonymous , and best friends know your secrets and your passwords . "
Children need to be taught to use privacy settings to protect themselves and their identity .
They should not share passwords to their sites , and they should admit only friends to them .
They should be also prepared to change passwords , not choosing obvious ones that others could easily guess .
Parents are be advised to check their children 's sites to ensure material immediately accessible does not put their children at risk , Aftab says .
Information they may not want parents or teachers to see should be guarded from public view , and parents should insist on seeing their children 's network pages " tomorrow " .
" It 's important parents do n't overreact and give their kids time to prepare the site for them to see , " she says .
The Meiers lived secretly with their knowledge of Drew 's involvement for a year while the FBI investigated the case , but no charges have been laid .
A police spokesman says Drew 's behaviour might have been rude and immature but it was not a crime .
The internet may be new - era technology , but in the absence of legal action against Lori Drew it has triggered a round of old - style retribution .
Drew 's address and phone number have been widely publicised on websites and blogs drawn to Megan Meier 's tragedy , along with calls for a boycott of the Drew family company .
Neighbours have shunned the Drew family , who still live four doors from where Megan took her life .
The Meiers have moved out .
Aftab , who is working with Tina Meier on developing coping resources for children , confirmed Tina and Ron Meier have separated .
Ron lives in fear that if something happens to the Drews , he will be a prime suspect .
The case has raised talk of legislation against internet harassment , but the young will remain at risk .
Zelinger says hormonal and developmental changes mean adolescents are a vulnerable , impulsive group that seeks increasing peer contact .
" I think the internet brings more of this .
It leaves a printable account for a child to read over and over again , " she says .
" It 's something for them to ruminate over .
They can become preoccupied . "

It was one move that does n't figure in the cricket textbooks - at least not yet .
Faced with a naked man during a crucial innings , Australian batsman Andrew Symonds responded in no-nonsense fashion .
He delivered a classic forearm smash to the hapless streaker , sending him crashing to the turf before he was escorted away by police and ground staff .
Scroll down for more ...
When cricketers attack : Symonds eyes his target , drops his shoulder and extends his elbow
Bang :
The streaker is lifted off his feet and crashed to earth at Brisbane 's The Gabba
British - born Symonds , a 32 - year - old all - rounder , had yet to score when the pitch invasion happened during a one - day international against India in Brisbane .
Undeterred , he went on to score 42 for the Aussies although it was n't enough to prevent the visitors winning by a nine - run margin .
The streaker comes crashing to the ground before a policeman detains him
Caught : A policeman pounces on the streaker who faces a fine and stadium life ban
The streaker faces a fine up to 3,000 Australian dollars ( £ 1,420 ) for the pitch invasion and is expected to be charged with willful exposure by Queensland state police .
Symonds could have faced punishment for breaching the code of conduct relating to " physical assault of a rival player , an official or a spectator " , but an official said last night that no action would be taken .
In 1976 , fellow - Aussie Greg Chappell escaped censure for batting a streaker on the bottom during a match in Auckland .

Investing for your retirement is one of the most important things you can do for your future .
And one of the best ways to do that is by investing in an Individual Retirement Account ( IRA ) .
There are two main types of IRAs which most people are eligible to contribute to – the Traditional IRA and the Roth IRA .
They have the same contribution limits , but other than that , they are two very different retirement plans .
Which is better ?
Comparing Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs
The most important difference between the Roth IRA and Traditional IRA is how the contributions and withdrawals are taxed .
Traditional IRA contributions are made with pre-tax income , meaning your contributions are made from income that has not yet been taxed .
The benefit is that you get an immediate tax deduction ( if you meet tax - deductible income levels , as mentioned below ) .
Qualified withdrawals from your Traditional IRA are taxed at the time you make a withdrawal .
The minimum age for withdrawals is age 59 ½.
Roth IRA Contributions are made with after - tax income .
Qualified withdrawals are tax - free , as long as you are age 59 ½.
We ’ll cover more details for each of the two retirement accounts in more detail in a moment .
But first , the following chart compares the two different IRAs and offers a side - by - side comparison for a better understanding of how these two plans work .
Features Traditional IRA Roth IRA
Who can contribute ?
You can contribute if you ( or your spouse if filing jointly ) have taxable compensation but not after you are age 70 ½ or older .
You can contribute at any age if you ( or your spouse if filing jointly ) have taxable compensation and your modified adjusted gross income is below certain amounts ( see IRA Contribution Limits ) .
Are my contributions deductible ?
You can deduct your contributions if you qualify .
Your contributions are n’t deductible .
How much can I contribute ?
The most you can contribute to all of your Traditional and Roth IRAs is the smaller of :
- For 2019 & 2020 , $ 6,000 , or $ 7,000 if you ’re age 50 or older by the end of the year ; or your taxable compensation for the year .
There are income limits for tax deductions for Traditional IRAs and income limits for Roth IRA eligibility .
See below for more information .
What is the deadline to make contributions ?
Your tax return filing deadline ( not including extensions ) .
For example , you can make 2019 IRA contributions until April 15 , 2020 .
When can I withdraw money ?
You can withdraw money anytime .
However , there may be tax implications if you make withdrawals prior to age 59 ½.
Roth IRA contributions can be withdrawn penalty - free at any time .
However , there may be tax implications if you make withdrawals of the earnings prior to age 59 ½.
See Roth IRA withdrawal rules for more information .
Do I have to take required minimum distributions ?
You must start taking distributions by April 1 following the year in which you turn age 70 ½ and by December 31 of later years .
Not required if you are the original owner .
Are my withdrawals and distributions taxable ?
Any deductible contributions and earnings you withdraw or that are distributed from your traditional IRA are taxable .
Also , if you are under age 59 ½ you may have to pay an additional 10 % tax for early withdrawals unless you qualify for an exception .
None if it ’s a qualified distribution ( or a withdrawal that is a qualified distribution ) .
Otherwise , part of the distribution or withdrawal may be taxable .
If you are under age 59 ½ , you may also have to pay an additional 10 % tax for early withdrawals unless you qualify for an exception .
What You Need to Know About Traditional IRAs
Simplified Definition : A Traditional IRA is a tax - deferred retirement vehicle .
Contributions to a Traditional IRA plan may be tax deductible depending on the taxpayer ’s income , tax filing status and other factors .
Contributions to Traditional IRAs are made on a pre-tax basis , meaning the money is invested before it is taxed .
The benefit to investing pre-tax money is that it has the potential to lower your current tax bracket , and your money can grow tax - free until you withdraw it .
Qualified withdrawals are treated as ordinary income and may be subject to income tax .
Traditional IRA Income Limits :
Everyone is eligible to contribute to a Traditional IRA , but not everyone will get the benefit of a tax deduction .
The ability to deduct your Traditional IRA contributions is based on your modified adjusted gross income , or MAGI .
Here is a list of the Traditional IRA deductibility limits ( 2019 limits listed ) .
2020 Traditional IRA Deduction Limits
If Your Filing Status Is ... And Your Modified AGI Is ... Then You Can Take ...
Single or Head of Household $ 65,000 or less a full deduction up to the amount of your contribution limit .
more than $ 65,000 but less than $ 75,000 a partial deduction .
$ 75,000 or more no deduction .
Married Filing Jointly or Qualifying Widow ( er ) $ 104,000 or less a full deduction up to the amount of your contribution limit .
more than $ 104,000 but less than $ 124,000 a partial deduction .
$ 124,000 or more no deduction .
Married Filing Separately less than $ 10,000 a partial deduction .
$ 10,000 or more no deduction .
If you file separately and did not live with your spouse at any time during the year , your IRA deduction is determined under the " Single " filing status .
Single , Head of Household , or Married Filing Separately can deduct the full amount of their contribution their MAGI is $ 65,000 or less .
Deduction rates phase out beginning at a MAGI above $ 65,001 , and end at $ 75,000 .
There is no tax deduction for those who have an income higher than $ 75,000 .
can deduct the full amount of their contribution their MAGI is $ 65,000 or less .
Deduction rates phase out beginning at a MAGI above $ 65,001 , and end at $ 75,000 .
There is no tax deduction for those who have an income higher than $ 75,000 .
Married Filing Jointly can make maximum Roth IRA contributions for an income of $ 104,000 or less .
Roth IRA eligibility ends at $ 124,000 .
There is no deduction for taxpayers who have an AGI of greater than $ 124,000 .
Note : Congress reviews retirement account contribution limits each year , and may increase limits based on several factors .
The limits and MAGI levels in this article represent current deductibility limits .
Traditional IRA Withdrawals :
Traditional IRA holders are eligible to withdraw from their IRA at age 59½ , at which point their withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income .
There are stiff penalties for early withdrawal ( with certain exceptions ) .
Required Minimum Distributions :
Owners of Traditional IRAs are subjected to Required Minimum Distributions , which begin at age 70 ½ .
This means Traditional IRA holders are required to make a minimum withdrawal every year regardless of whether or not they need the money .
Advantages of a Traditional IRA :
There are several advantages for investing in a Traditional IRA , and they primarily deal with taxes .
The tax savings at the time of investment may be enough to decrease your taxable income to a lower tax bracket .
Many retiree ’s income is lower in retirement years , thus they may have a lower tax rate when they withdraw their funds .
Depending on your income , you may be able to use a Traditional IRA to lower your tax bracket during your working years , and then withdraw your money in retirement in a low tax bracket .
Disadvantages of a Traditional IRA :
The minimum required distribution is a disadvantage because it requires IRA holders to withdraw a certain portion of their funds – whether they want to or not .
It is also difficult to determine what your tax rate will be in retirement .
What You Need to Know About Roth IRAs
Simplified Definition : A Roth IRA is a tax - exempt retirement vehicle .
Contributions to Roth IRAs are not tax deductible when they are made ; however , qualified distributions made during retirement years are tax - free .
Roth IRA Income Limits :
Roth IRA eligibility is limited based on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income ( MAGI ) .
Here are the limits for 2020 :
2020 Roth IRA Income Limits
If Your Filing Status Is ... And Your Modified AGI Is ... Then You Can Contribute ... Married Filing Jointly or Qualifying Widow ( er ) $ 196,000 or less up to the limit more than $ 196,000 but less than $ 206,000 a reduced amount $ 206,000 or more Zero.
Married Filing Separately and You Lived with Your Spouse at Any Time During the Year less than $ 10,000 a reduced amount $ 10,000 or more Zero .
Single , Head of Household , or Married Filing Separately and You Did Not Live with Your Spouse at Any Time During the Year $ 124,000 or less no deduction .
more than $ 124,000 but less than $ 139,000 a partial deduction .
$ 139,000 or more Zero .
Single , Head of Household , or Married Filing Separately can contribute the maximum if their MAGI is $ 124,000 or less .
Contribution rates phase out beginning at a MAGI above $ 124,001 , and end at $ 139,000 .
can contribute the maximum if their MAGI is $ 124,000 or less .
Contribution rates phase out beginning at a MAGI above $ 124,001 , and end at $ 139,000 .
Married Filing Jointly can make maximum Roth IRA contributions for an income of $ 196,000 or less .
Roth IRA eligibility ends at $ 206,000 .
Roth IRA Withdrawals :
The minimum withdrawal age is 59 ½.
When the money is withdrawn , none of it is taxed .
The principal can also be withdrawn at any time without penalty , however , the earnings must remain in the IRA or they will be subject to taxes and penalties if withdrawn early .
There are other rules that allow Roth IRA account owners to make withdrawals of the principal when certain criteria are met , or make withdrawals for expenses such as college or as a first - time home buyer .
Be certain you understand Roth IRA withdrawal rules before making a withdrawal because making a mistake can be extremely expensive if you end up owing penalties or fees .
It ’s also a good idea to make sure early withdrawals wo n’t hurt your retirement chances .
So be sure to research all options before pulling from your retirement account .
Learn more about Roth IRA withdrawal rules here !
Required Minimum Distributions :
There is no Required Minimum Distribution for Roth IRA accounts .
But there can be RMDs for Roth 401k plans and similar Roth retirement accounts .
Be sure to understand the rules regarding your other retirement accounts .
One common planning strategy is to roll Roth 401k funds into a Roth IRA at retirement to avoid the RMD requirement .
As always , consult a financial planner or tax professional to make sure this is a good idea for your situation , and to avoid making any costly mistakes .
Advantages of a Roth IRA :
The biggest advantage of a Roth IRA is tax - free withdrawals on the principal and all earnings .
The other advantage is the absence of minimum withdrawal requirements .
Disadvantages of a Roth IRA :
Not everyone qualifies for a Roth IRA because of the income limits .
It is possible , however , to do a Roth IRA Conversion , which allows people to convert their Traditional IRA or another retirement fund into a Roth IRA .
There are rules with Roth IRA Conversions , and the downside is you have to pay taxes on the amount you convert into a Roth IRA ( unless you are converting from a non-deductible Traditional IRA ) .
The tax rules can get a little involved , so it ’s best to consult with a tax professional or read the full details before converting to a Roth IRA .
Which IRA is Better – Traditional or Roth ?
Investing in IRAs is a great way to diversify your taxes in retirement years , and as you can see , there are distinct advantages to each type of IRA .
If you are like me and have the option of funding a company 401 ( k ) plan or another tax - deferred retirement plan , then a Roth IRA may be the way to go .
This gives me investments that benefit me now by decreasing my taxable income with my 401 ( k ) contributions but also investing in a Roth IRA , which will give me tax - free withdrawals in retirement .
It is very difficult ( or impossible ) to predict our future tax brackets , so tax diversification is a strong benefit to retirement planning .
Where to Open a Traditional or Roth IRA
You can open an IRA in a variety of places , including banks , credit unions , brokerage firms , with an independent financial advisor , and more .
In general , I believe it ’s best to stick with a financial institution that focuses on investing , as many IRA accounts offered by banks focus on Certificates of Deposit , or have funds with high fees .
In general , you will have more investment options with financial institutions that offer full investment services .
We have a list of preferred locations to open an IRA .
I recommend investigating your personal situation and investing in whichever plan you decide is best for you .
If you are eligible for both , you also have the option of splitting your investment to take advantage of tax benefits now , and in retirement .

Disaster Unfolds Slowly In The Gulf Of Mexico
WJG
For the past ten years or so I 've been a mixed Windows / Linux user .
Jolted along by a presentation that I made at an OpenAdvantage [ L1 ] seminar earlier this year , I decided to put Windows on the back - burner and spend my time running Linux .
Putting OS considerations aside , I needed to think about re-working my custom apps running under Tcl / Tk on Windows .
Windows and MacOS discourage us from fiddling about with the appearance of things , whereas Linux , well ...
Now , that I 've settled into things and got Gnome looking the way I like it , I want my tcl apps to fall in line .
Not an easy thing to do in Tk - under Linux as everything still looks like Motif .
So the dilemma is GTk or Tk ?
Well - Gtk .
But what about Tcl ?
If we refer to the Gtk+ developer site [ L2 ] we do find bindings listed and , as seems par for everything else , Python is the preferred choice .
But why should it be ?
The following piece of Python code puts a single button in the middle of a toplevel window .
The link for PyGtk [ L3 ] .
#!/usr/bin/env python # example helloworld.py import pygtk pygtk.require ( ' 2.0 ' ) import gtk class HelloWorld : def hello ( self , widget , data= None ) : print " Hello World " def delete_event ( self , widget , event , data= None ) : print " delete event occurred " return False def destroy ( self , widget , data= None ) : print " destroy signal occurred " gtk.main_quit ( ) def __init__( self ) : self.window = gtk.Window(gtk.WINDOW_TOPLEVEL ) self.window.connect(" delete_event " , self.delete_event ) self.window.connect (" destroy " , self.destroy ) self.window.set_border_width( 10 ) self.button = gtk.Button ( " Hello World " ) self.button.connect(" clicked " , self.hello , None ) self.button.connect_object(" clicked " , gtk.Widget.destroy , self.window ) self.window.add(self.button ) self.button.show ( ) self.window.show ( ) def main ( self ) : gtk.main ( ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : hello = HelloWorld ( ) hello.main ( )
Here 's the equivalent in Gnocl , effectively one line of code .
In PyGtk , the coder still needs to manually made connections between events and handlers which Gnocl does automatically .
Is n't the purpose of scripting to reduce code - recreation the minimum , not merely to make recreation easier ?
#!/bin/sh # the next line restarts using tclsh \ exec tclsh " $ 0 " " [ email protected ] " package require Gnocl gnocl : : window - child [ gnocl : : button - text " Hello World " - onButton Press exit ] - onDelete exit
Which one would you choose ?
Find the Gtk C code here [ L4 ] .
LV Another consideration - check out Tile , which , as Ttk , comes with Tk starting in Tcl / Tk 8.5 .
Perhaps it would be worthwhile seeing how to improve the Ttk - Gtk cooperation ?
LBarret
Tile is very promising but the argument for gnocl is pretty weak : mainly better syntatic sugar .
Furthemore , this is vanilla GTk ; many people use autoconnect mechanisms that make the difference less important .
Comparing the other example seen on the gnocl mainpage may show that the difference is not that important .
WJG
Thanks for the comments - but .
I 'm not dealing with issues regarding the Tk - Tile debate , but how to get the best out of easy scripting with Gtk .
If I want to run my apps on Windows , I 'd leave them the way they are , ' cause they look pretty good and the rendering of widgets is just fine to me .
If I 'm running Linux , then I want it to adhere to my desktop theme , whatever that might be .
Tk does n't do that , and neither , I suspect , will Tile .
[ LV
Actually , one of the major ideas behind Tile , in my understanding , is that it would in fact recognize theme changes , at least on MacOS X and Windows .
I do n't know what it does on Linux right now , but the framework should be in place to do it .
However , you are not interested , so no need to go farther on that point . ]
Let 's keep comments salient to the content of the page which is the ease of building Gtk based UI applications in a tcl script .
I would have thought this a cause for celebration in itself .
Check the code by using it and not just look the screen shots , try the real alternatives : building Gtk apps in C !
WJG Fellow Wiki users , have the courtesy not to swap code which has been placed on this page for a purpose .
Someone changed the Python code to a clip which was not correct .
I have restored it back to what it should be .
Nickname WJG , have the courtesy not to massively over - inflate code to prove a point .
The Python code you posted contains additional behavior not found in the Gnocl code , and in addition is needlessly verbose .
WJG ( 31/10/07 ) Nickname , please read the posting .
This is n't my code but that from the PyGtk website .
Besides , apart from the code that you posted did n't work ( not on my machine anyway ) it 's still more verbose than the gnocl code !
So , reciprocate the courtesy .
Leave postings be ; if you wish to make a point with reasoned debate then add it , do n't censure others !
If I 'm wrong , or there 's a better view , fine I 'll be the first to listen and fix any errors .
Here 's a useful link on Wikiquette [ L5 ]
For those who really need it , here 's Nickame 's posting ...
peterc 2008 - 08 - 14 :
It 's worth looking at the Tile - GTK theme [ L6 ] by Georgios Petasis .
Even the 0.1 screenshot at http://www.ellogon.org/~petasis/tcl/tile-gtk-dev-0.1.png looks pretty good .
I 'd really suggest sticking with Tile if at all possible .
DKF : One thing to note is that though Gtk ( and Qt ) apps are theoretically portable between X11 , Windows and OSX , they really do n't look good on non-X11 .
( For a number of years I was forced to use a Qt - based app for some work - critical things , and it clunked horribly on Win .
With OSX , the difference is even starker ; apps usually have to be rewritten to look and work right there because the GUI is n't CUA - derived . )
By contrast , it 's much easier to make a Tk app ( especially with Ttk ) look wholly native on Win and OSX .
WJG ( 16/08/04 ) DKF , I agree with you .
Gtk does n't have the native look on Windows but , Peterc misses the point , Gnocl is n't about beautifying Tk. Gnocl is about making Gtk / Gnome applications , not Tk applications .
I 've not tried tile - gtk , perhaps I will later .
For Gnome aficionados , however , Gtk compliance means use of the Gtk widgets followed by the Gnome widget set .
Personally I got into Tcl / Tk because I wanted to use the easiest way of writing X compliant Linux programs which in the late 1990s was Tk. I love Tk , but I think that its had its day .
Gtk / Gnome appears to be more popular than Qt/ KDE and so I want my Tcl apps to work directly with Gtk .
This basically means Gnocl .
I might be putting the cat amongst the pigeons now , but , I would even profess the view that the Gtk widget set is better than the Tk offering .
As I 've said , I 've not tried tile - Gtk but do feel that if it looks like Gtk , then I would expect it to behave like Gtk .
Frankly , I do n't expect many converts to Gnocl , even when the next release is out ( I 'm currently putting the finishing touches to rel. 0.9.93 ) but then I do n't encounter many converts to Tcl / Tk these days either .
Perhaps one reason why Python and Ruby are gathering more interest than Tcl in the Linux world is due to the lack of a specific graphics package , something which gave Tcl / Tk the edge a generation ago .
Ironically ,
Tk may work directly with X , but it has an unnatural feel to Linux users running Gnome .
#!/usr/bin/env python # example helloworld .py import gtk window = gtk .
Window ( ) window.connect ( ' destroy ' , gtk.main_quit ) button = gtk.
Button ( ' Hello World ' ) button.
connect ( ' clicked ' , gtk.main_quit ) window.add ( button ) window.show_all ( ) gtk.main ()
default WJG , the example may still be more verbose than the Gnocl example , but very less so .
The original comparison is still quite unfair .
FYI , I corrected ( and shortened ) the Python example above .
Anyway , GUI design with code still sucks -- you need an interactive way to design UIs and Gnocl does n't provide that .
For scripting , you usually need only quite limited capabilities and there are more suitable toolkits for that .
Besides , I have problems with Gnocl seemingly doing certain things " automagically " , like entering the GTK main loop .
What if you want to nest the main loop ?
WJG ( 13/08/08 )
I 'm not so certain that ' GUI design with code still sucks ' .
My take on the matter is that interactive GUI design produces more code than necessary .
At best it 's a means of reducing the programmers exposure to verbose code or , more likely , is used to workaround a lack of solid GUI coding skill .
Good GUI design comes from clearly thinking through the various controls necessary for an application and perhaps even sketching the intended layout .
Working with interactive tools often leads to just fiddling around with widgets or trying to make something visually complex .
But who am I to comment ?
Conversations with other developers leads me to form the opinion that too many programmers relish in the complexity of their code , even if the code is terse even for themselves to explain .
To compare the Gnocl offering with the pyGTk script , is I now admit , an injustice - the Gnocl commands offer so much more !
The forthcoming release of Gnocl , for instance , has a few nice enhancements .
Here 's one line of code for example .
set txt [ gnocl : : text \ - baseColor xffffcd \ - baseFont { Sans 14 } \ - onButtonPress { bpProc %w %b %s } \ -onButtonRelease { brProc %w %b %s } \ - onKeyPress { kpProc %w %k %s } \ - onKeyRelease { krProc %w %k %s } ]
Apart from automatic support for scrolling windows , event and signal management , the latest version supports tag events and extended default settings support and the familiar Tk style substitution strings .
How many lines of PyGtk code do we need for this ?
Or , if you wish , how many lines of Glade XML code ?.
Which is easier to understand as a scripter ?
And , of course , the Gnocl code is totally reusable !
A PyGtk app , is a PyGtk app .
Gnocl is a scripting extension to Tcl just like Tk .
To be fair , the Gnocl C source code ought to be compared with the PyGtk script as its is at this level that the same Gtk library functions are called .
Gnocl is intended to simplify the process of developing Gtk applications .
I 'm sure that PyGtk does make the development of Gtk applications easier than pure Gtk C code , but then , its largely acting as some sort of glue ; one still needs to know the innards of the Gtk Libraries to make sense of PyGtk .
Gnocl , on the other hand , enables new or established Gtk developers to move straight into creating their new Gtk applications .
Finally , the mainloop .
This can be called explicitly if needed with the gnocl : : mainLoop command .
But then , why would it need to be nested elsewhere ?
RLH I would choose Gnocl because it uses Tcl. =)
WJG
The right answer !
I wish more people would give Gnocl a go .
Tcl has much to offer the programmer but Python seems to be leading the popularity polls .
Learning a scripting language takes time and the more diverse bindings that are available to it the more likely it is to attract interest from potential users .
At the 2008 LugRadio Live conference in the UK I met quite a large number of young programmers ( ie. under 30 and young enough to be my kids ) who were now setting out on their careers .
Most were involved in the use or development of web - based applications and all the talk was on Python and Python bindings .
I 'm not saying that Python ( or Pythong as it was called by most that weekend ) is a lesser language no , what I am saying is that users of Tcl should be more proactive in supporting diversity .
Rather than coming up with another megawidget set based around the same old Tk offerings , spend some time writing something new .
The package I work on developing and evangelise is Gnocl , the Tcl / Gtk bindings , but has anyone worked to put a Tcl / Qt binding together yet ?
The choice for choosing Python cannot be that its ' easier ' or a less complex option .
In fact , I met a number of coders who were using PyGtk bindings for their applications who appeared produced a lot of code to generate their GUIs .
Gnocl , by comparison would have required only a few lines .
By adopting the Tcl command / option route means that the serious job of ' wiring up ' the signals and their event handlers has all been done , its waiting there to be used - there is no need to resort to Tcl scripting the C equivalent because the bindings are merely a wrap around the C library routines .
And , of course , there 's the mandatory eye - candy and UI conformity .
Because this is not the concern of the Gnocl scripter , but the Gtk package , it 's always as good as it gets .
RLH I am playing around with it in a VM using Xubuntu .
Gnocl is pretty nice .
I may at some point get involved with the project as well .
METHODOLOGY -- This fifth Smartest State designation is awarded based on 21 factors chosen from Morgan Quitnos annual reference book , Education State Rankings , 2006 - 2007 .
To calculate the Smartest State rankings , the 21 factors were divided into two groups : those that are negative for which a high ranking would be considered bad for a state , and those that are positive for which a high ranking would be considered good .
Rates for each of the 21 factors were processed through a formula that measures how a state compares to the national average for a given category .
The positive and negative nature of each factor was taken into account as part of the formula .
Once these computations were made , the factors then were assigned equal weights .
These scores then were added together to determine a states final score ( SUM  on the table above . )
This way , states are assessed based on how they stack up against the national average .
The end result is that the farther below the national average a states education ranking is , the lower ( and less smart ) it ranks .
The farther above the national average , the higher ( and smarter ) a state ranks .
This same methodology is used for our annual Healthiest State , Safest and Most Dangerous State and Safest / Dangerous City Awards .
The table above shows how each state scored in Morgan Quitnos fifth annual Smartest State Award .
Word comes that unpublished studies of antidepressants show the drugs are overrated ( " Antidepressants Under Scrutiny Over Efficacy , " Personal Journal , Jan. 17 ) .
This is n't a surprise to many of us who have prescribed them .
Sadly , the $ 21 billion antidepressant industry is built more on marketing hype than medical science .

Why Scala ?
By Tim Dalton , OCI Software Engineer
December 2007
Introduction
Scala is a programming language that integrates features of object - oriented and functional programming languages .
It is statically typed and compiles to JVM bytecode .
A scripting interpreter is also part of the Scala language distribution .
At the time of this writing , the current release of Scala for the JVM is version 2.6 with a significantly less mature .NET version beginning to get more attention .
This document provides an overview of those aspects of Scala that make it an intriguing option for development on the JVM platform and perhaps eventually .NET as well .
Scala was invented at the EPFL ( Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne ) in Switzerland primarily by Martin Odersky , a professor there .
Oderksy is the co-designer of Java generics and the original author of the javac reference compiler .
The Scala language was first released in 2003 .
Scala Basics
The Scala distribution requires 1.4 or later of the Java Runtime Environment ( JRE ) .
It can be downloaded from the Scala language download page .
To run examples in this document , ensure that the ./ bin directory of the Scala distribution is included on the execution path ( PATH environment variable ) and that the JAVA_HOME environment variable references the location of a JDK or JRE version 1.4 or later .
The best way to describe a language is to show code and explain what is happening .
The ubiquitous Hello World coded in Scala :
package HelloWorldDemo object Main { def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) = println ( " Hello World " ) ; }
Save the above text in a file named HelloWorldDemo.scala , compile via scalac HelloWorldDemo.scala , and execute using scala HelloWorldDemo.Main .
That will result in the output , Hello World .
Actually , Scala source files do not need to have any particular name nor conform to any directory structure .
The source for multiple Scala classes and other types documented here can be in a single file .
Features demonstrated in " HelloWorldDemo " :
Singleton objects versus classes :
Scala does not support static methods within classes , but supports singleton objects designated by the keyword object .
All methods of a singleton object are the equivalent of Java statics .
An object and class of the same name are called " companions " .
A common idiom in Scala is a singleton object acting as a factory for its companion class .

An object and class of the same name are called " companions " .
A common idiom in Scala is a singleton object acting as a factory for its companion class .
Arrays are collections :
Arrays are implemented in Scala as a collection class with a parameterized type ( generic ) specified using square brackets .
Scala supports generics even when the underlying platform is Java version 1.4 , which pretty much the same capabilities as Java 1.5 or later .

Implicit static import of Scala object scala .
Predef :
The println method is defined in the Scala singleton object , scala .
Predef , which is statically imported to all Scala objects much like the implicit import of java.lang in Java .
All classes in the packages java.lang and scala are implicitly imported as well .
A more complex example :
package SwingDemo import javax .
swing .
{ JFrame , JLabel } object Main extends Application { def getTitle ( ) = " Scala can Swing " val frm = new JFrame ( getTitle ) frm .
getContentPane . add ( new JLabel ( " Hello World " ) ) frm. setDefaultCloseOperation ( JFrame .
EXIT_ON_CLOSE ) frm. pack frm setVisible true }
To one accustomed to Java , there appears to be typographical errors in the example above , but there are no errors and it will compile .
Scala has a very flexible syntax as compared to Java and other statically typed languages .
This allows for a greater degree of conciseness , code can become more like a " Domain Specific Language " ( DSL ) and new idioms can be invented .
Many features of Scala are enabled by this syntactical flexibility .
Like Java , Scala uses curly braces {} to define the scope of an object , class , method , or other block of code .
It does have a different notation for importing packages in that multiple classes from a given package can be specified using a curly brace notation and uses _ instead * to import all from a package .
Features demonstrated in " SwingDemo " :
Interoperability with existing Java libraries : Scala compiles to Java byte code and interacts with Java classes seamlessly .
Singleton object , Application , in standard library :
The Application object can be extended to eliminate the need to implement the main method and code just goes inside the class definition .
, in standard library : Type inference :
The Scala compiler can oftentimes infer the type of an object so there is no need to explicitly specify the type .
In the SwingDemo example , the compiler can figure out that frm is a JFrame .
Types can be explicitly specified for clarity .
In the example above , the line var frm : JFrame = new JFrame ( getTitle ) , could be used as well .
The return type of methods can be inferred also .
The getTitle ( ) method has an inferred return type of String .
The method declaration with explicit return type would be def getTitle ( ) : String = .
There is a special type , Unit , that is the Scala equivalent to void .
A method that does not return a type is inferred to return a Unit .
The main method of the HelloWorldDemo .
Main object earlier has Unit as it's inferred return type and could be explicitly specified as def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = .
Sometimes types need to be explicitly specified to coerce an object into a type other than what would have been inferred .
For example var n=1 will infer n to be an Int .
To force n to be a Byte use , var n: Byte=1 .
Values versus variables : Scala uses keywords val and var to indicate a value versus a variable .
Values are immutable and are the equivalent of final in Java while variables are mutable .
Values and variables defined in the object or class definition context represent properties and are in effect public by default , but can be protected or private just like Java .
Inferred trailing semi-colons :
Though there are some exceptions , the compiler can figure out where a line of code ends .
Optional empty parameter lists :
Providing that no object or class property have the same name , parenthesis around empty parameter lists are optional .
In the above example , the compiler can determine that getTitle invokes getTitle ( ) .
Optional " dot notation " and parenthesis around single parameter in certain cases :
When the invocation is in the form , < object > < method > < parameter(s ) > , the parenthesis around the parameters and the .
between the object reference and method name become optional .
The line frm setVisible true in the SwingDemo example above demonstrates this .
This is valuable for implementing DSLs .
Scala Types
Scala is a pure object - oriented language and does not support primitives .
In the scala package , there are classes Char , Byte , Short , Int , Long , Float , Double , and Boolean that correlate to Java primitives .
When Scala objects interact with Java , conversions between primitives and those types are implicitly performed .
Other Notable Syntax Features :
Multi-line strings :
Scala uses triple - quotes for strings that span multiple lines .
Example :
var str = " " " This is a multi- line string " " "
Non-alphanumeric characters in method names :
Scala allows characters in method names that are not allowed by Java .
Coupled with the fact that parenthesis around single parameters are optional this enables a form of operator overloading .
Here is a demonstration :
package FooPlusBarDemo class Foo ( value : Int ) { def + ( bar : Bar ) = value + bar. value } class Bar ( val value : Int ) object Main extends Application { val foo = new Foo ( 13 ) val bar = new Bar ( 23 ) println ( foo + bar ) }
Running the above application should produce the output 36 .
The expression foo + bar could be also expressed as foo .+( bar ) .
Scala has rules as to whether a method is usable as a infix , prefix , or postfix operation .
All methods can be used as an infix operator like the foo + bar expression above or as postfix operators .
However , methods that end with colon , : , are right associative instead of left associative .
The following characters can be used for prefix operations , '+' , '-' , '!' , and ' ~ ' , that are defined using notation def unary_ .
Here is an example of unary / prefix operation , postfix , and a right associative infix operation :
package PreInPostFixDemo class
Foo ( val value : Int ) { def unary _! = " !!! " + value + " !!! " def % = value + " % " def * : ( multiple : Int ) = value * multiple } object Main extends Application { var foo = new Foo ( 62 ) Console .
println ( ! foo ) // unary Console . println ( foo % ) // postfix Console . println ( 2 * : foo ) // infix and right associative }
Output :
!!!62 !!!
62 % 124
The expression ! foo is the equivalent of foo .! , foo % is the same as foo . % , and the expression 2 * : foo , being right associative , is the equivalent of foo .*: ( 2 ) .
The List data type , described later , utilizes right associative infix operators .
-- Inferred return values based on result of last expression in code block
Scala does not require an explicit return in a method , though it is supported .
Scala uses the result of the last line in the code block as the return value for the block .
If the last line is a Java method returning void , then the method is inferred to return Unit .
Example :
def NullSafeToUpper ( s : String ) = { println ( " in NullSafeToUpper ) if ( s == null ) " NULL " else s.toUpperCase }
This example demonstrates how the result of the last expression in a block of code is the inferred return value and that if constructs in Scala can also act like the < condition > ?
< then - expression > : < else - expression > construct in Java .
Since both possible results of if ( s == null ) are strings , then String is the inferred return type for the method .
-- Primary constructors
The primary constructor of a Scala object is defined as part of the class definition itself .
Object properties can also be defined in the primary constructor .
Example :
package ValVarConstructorDemo class ImmutableFoo ( val value : Int ) class MutableFoo ( var value : Int ) object Main extends Application { val immutable = new ImmutableFoo ( 54 ) val mutable = new MutableFoo ( 32 ) println ( " Immutable value = " + immutable .
value ) //
Compiler wo n't allow : immutable .value = 65 println ( " Mutable value = " + mutable .
value ) mutable .
value = 39 println ( " Mutated Mutable value = " + mutable .
value ) }
Output :
Immutable value = 54 Mutable value = 32 Mutated Mutable value = 39
Parameters provided to the primary constructor can use val or var to indicate whether properties of the same name should be defined for the object .
Specifying a val makes the property accessible by an implicit accessor method , while var makes the property also mutable using an implicit mutator method .
These accessors and mutators are implemented in a way that allows access in the same manner as a public field in Java .
The value property in ImmutableFoo and MutableFoo classes in the above example demonstrates value and variable properties .
Scala can subclass based on a superclass constructor .
Example :
package DogSpeakDemo class Mammal ( name : String ) { override def toString ( ) = " Mammal named " + name } class Dog ( name : String ) extends Mammal ( name ) { def speak ( ) = println ( this .
toString + " says Woof " ) } object Main extends Application { var rinTinTin = new Dog ( " Rin Tin Tin " ) rinTinTin. speak }
he example above will output Mammal named Rin Tin Tin says Woof .
The Dog class extends the Mammal class and uses the Mammal ( name : String ) constructor to pass the name to the super class .
( Note : Scala requires explicit override for overriding methods . )
Allowing constructors and fields to be specified as part of the class definition itself allows simple classes to be defined using a single line of code .
Secondary constructors can be defined by implementing this methods .
The example below adds a secondary constructor that takes a double value for the AbsoluteNumber class :
class AbsoluteNumber ( num : Int ) { var value = Math. abs ( num ) def this ( dbl : Double ) = this ( dbl . toInt ) }
The this ( dbl : Double ) constructor simply invokes the primary constructor with the double value converted to an integer .
Secondary constructor parameters do not become properties for the object .
-- Ability to specify accessors and mutators and create virtual public fields
Scala provides the ability to define accessor and mutator methods that hide the implementation of an object property .
Example :
package AbsoluteNumberDemo class AbsoluteNumber ( num : Int ) { private var _ value = Math. abs ( num ) def value = _ value // " getter " method def value _= ( num : Int ) = _ value = Math. abs ( num ) // " setter " method } object Main extends Application { var absolute = new AbsoluteNumber ( 10 ) printf ( " Absolute = {0}
" , absolute .
value ) absolute .
value = - 5 printf ( " Absolute = {0}
" , absolute .
value ) }
The example produces output :
Absolute = 10 Absolute = 5
To a client object , an AbsoluteNumber object appears to have a public field named value .
The def _= ( ) notation specifies a mutator method that is used to perform assignment to the property in question .
This allows Scala classes to better conform to the Uniform Access Principle 1 which states that the services on an object should be available through a uniform notation that does not reveal whether they are implemented through storage or through computation .
The num parameter provided to the primary constructor becomes a hidden property .
Default apply method Methods named apply have special meaning for Scala objects and classes .
These are methods that are invoked by using a " method - less " expression in the form , < object > . ( [ < parameters > ] )
package ApplyDemo object
Foo { def apply ( n : Int ) = printf ( " FooObject ( {0} )
" , n ) } class
Foo { def apply ( n : Int ) = printf ( " FooClass ( {0} )
" , n ) } object Main extends Application {
Foo ( 1 ) var foo = new Foo foo ( 2 ) foo ( 3 ) }
Output :
FooObject (1 ) FooClass ( 2 ) FooClass (3 )
Expression " Foo ( 1 ) is the equivalent to Foo.apply ( 1 ) .
Scala arrays and other collections classes use the apply method to provide indexers .
Array access in Scala is done with parenthesis and not square brackets like in Java .
-- Type Aliasing
Scala supports type aliasing which allows types to be defined as aliases to other types .
Example :
package TypeAliasDemo object Main extends Application { type ArrayOfIntArrays = Array [ Array [ Int ] ] var arrs : ArrayOfIntArrays = Array ( Array ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) , Array ( 4 , 5 , 6 ) , Array ( 7 , 8 , 9 ) ) printf ( " arrs ( 1 ) ( 2 ) = {0}
" , arrs ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ) }
Output :
arrs ( 1 ) ( 2 ) = 6
Type aliases can be inherited from super classes or traits .
More about traits later .
Functional Programming with Scala
Functional programming is getting more serious consideration outside of academia because of characteristics that are advantageous for concurrent programming .
A main reason for this is that a pure functional language maintains no global state .
The stack represents the state and therefore function invocations that are not dependent on each other can easily run concurrently .
Though Scala cannot be considered a pure functional language , it borrows many features from popular functional languages .
With a little discipline by developers , benefits can be reaped .
First Class Functions
Functions in Scala are objects and can be passed like any other object .
Function objects are expressed as in form , [ ( ) ] => .
Example :
package FunctionDemo object Main extends Application { val multiply = ( x : Int , y : Int ) => x * y // value referencing function object def add ( x : Int , y : Int ) = x + y // method of the Main object val pow = ( x : Int , y : Int ) => { // more elaborate function object var i = 0 ; var result = 1 ; while ( i < y ) { result = result * x ; i = i + 1 } result } def doOper ( x : Int , y : Int , func : ( Int , Int ) =>
Int ) = func ( x , y ) println ( " doOper ( 3, 4 , multiply ) = " + doOper ( 3 , 4 , multiply ) ) println ( " doOper ( 3, 4 , add _ ) = " + doOper ( 3 , 4 , add _ ) ) println ( " doOper ( 3, 4 , pow ) = " + doOper ( 3 , 4 , pow ) ) println ( " doOper ( 3, 4 , ( x : Int , y: Int ) => x * 2 + y ) = " + doOper ( 3 , 4 , ( x : Int , y : Int ) => x * 2 + y ) ) }
Output :
doOper ( 3,4 , multiply ) = 12 doOper ( 3,4 , add _ ) = 7 doOper ( 3,4 , pow ) = 81 doOper ( 3,4 , ( x: Int , y: Int ) => x * 2 + y ) = 10
The doOper method takes two integers and a function object that takes two integers and returns an integer .
The < function or method name > _ expression indicates a partially applied function .
This prevents the compiler from interpreting the expression as an attempt to invoke the function .
When used with a method , like the add _ expression above , a function object is generated that delegates to the add method .
The doOper ( 3,4 , ( x: Int , y: Int ) => x * 2 + y ) expression passes an anonymous inline function object to the doOper method .
Inline function objects like this are often referred to as Lambda Expressions .
A function object without parameters is a code block that can be passed around just like any other object .
Example :
package BlockDemo object Main extends Application { def timeBlock ( block : =>
Unit ) { val start = System . currentTimeMillis ( ) block printf ( " Block took {0} milliseconds
" , System .
currentTimeMillis - start ) } def repeat ( n : Int ) ( block : =>
Unit ) = ( 1 to n ) . foreach { x => block } def test = { var str = " yada " repeat ( 2 ) { println ( str ) } val fiveTimes = repeat ( 5 ) _ str = " blah " fiveTimes { println ( str ) } } time Block { ( 1 to 4 ) . foreach { x => println ( " x = " + x ) } } test }
Output :
x = 1 x = 2 x = 3 x = 4
Block took 32 milliseconds yada yada blah blah blah blah blah
The timeBlock method takes a block as a parameter and reports how many milliseconds it takes to execute it .
The test method is used to demonstrate that values and variables in the scope of the method are accessible by the block .
The ability to access values and variables in the current scope within code blocks represents a form of lexically scoped closures .
( Note : the 1 to n expression uses a to method on the Int class and is equivalent to 1.to ( n ) which returns a Range object that can be iterated over for each value between 1 and n . )
The multiple parameters lists for the repeat is one way that Scala supports currying .
Currying is a technique in functional programming of reducing a function call containing multiple parameters to multiple function calls each with usually a single parameter .
Each intermediate function call would return a function representing a partial application of the parameters .
The expression repeat ( 5 ) _ represents a partially applied function which is a function object that takes a code block as parameter to complete the application of repeat .
Nested functions provide another form of currying .
Example :
package NestedBlockDemo object Main extends Application { def repeat ( n : Int ) = { def executeBlock ( block : =>
Unit ) = ( 1 to n ) . foreach { x => block } executeBlock _ } val sevenTimes = repeat ( 7 ) sevenTimes { println ( " hello " ) } }
The executeBlock function is nested in the repeat method and it is partially applied as the return value .
Built - in support for List and Tuple Data Types
List and tuple types are very common in functional programming languages and Scala implements them both .
Both types are immutable .
Example :
package TuplesAndListsDemo object Main extends Application { val list1 = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: 5 :: 8 :: Nil // List [ Int ] inferred val list2 = List ( 13 , 21 , 34 ) // Another List [ Int ] println ( " list1.head = " + list1. head ) println ( " list1.tail = " + list1. tail ) val concatenated = list1 ::: list2 println ( " list1 and list2 concatenated = " + concatenated ) println ( " concatenated list maps to square = " + concatenated .
map ( x => x * x ) ) println ( " concatenated list even numbers = " + concatenated .
filter ( _ % 2 == 0 ) ) val tuple1 = ( 1 , " one " , 1.0 ) val tuple2 = ( 1 , " two " , 2.0 ) println ( " tuple1._1 = " + tuple1 . _ 1 ) println ( " tuple2._3 = " + tuple2 . _ 3 ) }
Output :
list1.head = 1 list1.tail = List ( 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 ) list1 and list2 concatenated = List ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 ) concatenated list maps to square = List ( 1 , 4 , 9 , 25 , 64 , 169 , 441 , 1156 ) concatenated list even numbers = List ( 2 , 8 , 34 ) tuple1._1 = 1 tuple2._3 = 2.0
The list1 and list2 values demonstrate two ways to define a list in Scala .
The list1 value uses a special instance of List called Nil that represents an empty list and then uses the right - associative operator , :: , repeatedly .
An equivalent expression is val list1 = Nil. : : ( 8 ) .::( 5 ) .::( 3 ) .::( 2 ) .::( 1 ) .
The implicitly imported scala package defines a List singleton object with an apply method that accepts a variable numbers of arguments of a parameterized type .
The parameterized type usually can be inferred .
Scala supports variable arguments like Java does in 1.5 and later .
This apply method acts as a factory and returns an implementation of the List class .
The assignment expression for list2 uses this method .
Both forms of list instantiation demonstrate Scala syntax enabling other features .
Lists in Scala support methods to return the first item , head , or the rest of the list , tail .
Other common list operations like map and filter are provided as well .
Map methods apply a function object to each item in the list and return a new list with the result from each .
Filter methods apply a function object that returns a boolean to each item and return a new list of items that evaluated to true .
The _ % 2 expression is shorthand for a function object that could be expressed as x:T => x % 2 where T is the type of the item in the list or as x => x % 2 since the type can be inferred .
Tuples are groupings of objects of differing types .
Scala
Tuple objects have methods in the form _ where is number from 1 to the total number of objects in the tuple .
Pattern matching
Another common feature of functional languages is pattern matching .
In Scala , pattern matching is not quite as integrated in to the language as it is in Erlang or OCaml where functions themselves have multiple definitions and the one invoked is based on how arguments match patterns .
Scala provides a match / case construct .
Example :
package PatternDemo case class Person ( name : String , age : Int ) object Main extends Application { def doMatch ( any : Any ) = any match { case x : Int =>
" Integer = " + x case x : Float =>
" Float = " + x case x :: 10 :: rest =>
" List head = " + x + " second = ten rest = " + rest case x :: rest =>
" List head = " + x + " rest = " + rest case ( x , 10 ) => " Tuple , _ 1 = " + x + " , ten " case ( x : Int , y : Int ) if ( x + y ) == 10 => " Tuple = ( " + x + " , " + y + " ) sum = 10 " case ( x , y ) => " Tuple = ( " + x + " , " + y + " ) " case Person ( name , age ) if ( age < 18 ) =>
" Young Person named " + name case Person ( name , age ) =>
" Adult Person named " + name case s : String => " String = ' " + s + " ' " case _ =>
" Something else " } println ( doMatch ( 1 ) ) println ( doMatch ( 1.0 F ) ) println ( doMatch ( 7 :: 10 :: 19 :: Nil ) ) println ( doMatch ( 1 :: 2 :: Nil ) ) println ( doMatch ( 7.5 :: 2.5 :: Nil ) ) println ( doMatch ( ( 1 , 2 ) ) ) println ( doMatch ( ( 3 , 10 ) ) ) println ( doMatch ( ( 4 , 6 ) ) ) println ( doMatch ( new Person ( " Tim " , 40 ) ) ) println ( doMatch ( Person ( " John " , 6 ) ) ) println ( doMatch ( " string " ) ) println ( doMatch ( new java .
util .
Date ( ) ) ) }
Output
Integer = 1 Float = 1.0 List head = 7 second = ten rest = List ( 19 ) List head = 1 rest = List ( 2 ) List head = 7.5 rest = List ( 2.5 ) Tuple = ( 1,2 ) Tuple , _1 = 3 , ten Tuple = ( 4,6 ) sum = 10 Adult Person named Tim Young Person named John String = ' string '
Something else
The first case that matches the passed value is processed and only that one .
There is no need for something like break as in Java .
Case clauses can extract values from the matching pattern and use them as values in the corresponding execute block .
For example , the case x::10 : : rest clause matches any List with a second value equal to 10 .
The value x is assigned the first item of the list and the rest value will reference a List containing the remainder of items or Nil if there are none .
A case class in Scala is a class that adds functionality that enables pattern matching for that class .
Added functionality includes generation of a companion class with a factory apply method that creates an instance of the class .
Hence , case classes can be instantiated without new .
The Person ( " John " , 6 ) expression uses the apply method on the Person singleton object as a factory to create an instance of the Person class and is equivalent to new Person ( " John " , 6 ) .
Case class companions objects also have methods to allow fields to be extracted and used in the execute block for the case clause .
Two case Person clauses in the above example extract the name field .
Case clauses can use if conditionals that are called " guards " to further specify the match .
The case _ clause is a " match anything " clause that acts like a default : clause on a Java switch statement .
One area of Java that represents a simple form of pattern matching is exception handling .
Scala uses its own pattern matching constructs to process exceptions .
Example :
try { //
Exception prone code } catch { case ex : java . io .
FileNotFoundException => System . err . println ( " File Not Found " ) case ex : java . io .
EOFException => System . err . println ( " Unexpected EOF " ) case ex : Exception => System . err . println ( " Other Exception " + ex. getMessage ) }
Other Scala Language Features
Scala has many advanced features as compared to Java .
Prominent features are outlined below :
Traits
Traits are an improvement over Java interfaces in that they can contain implementation code .
They are similar to Ruby mixins and provide a form of multiple inheritance .
Scala classes can use many traits .
Example :
package FooBarTraitDemo trait Foos { def doFoo ( text : String ) = printf ( " {0} : Foo ( \ " { 1} \ " )
" , this .
toString , text ) } trait Bars { def doBar ( text : String ) = printf ( " {0} : Bar ( \ " { 1} \ " )
" , this .
toString , text ) } class FooClass extends
Foos { override def toString = " FooClass " } class BarClass extends Bars { override def toString = " FooClass " } class FooBarClass extends Bars with Foos { override def toString = " FooBarClass " } class Now { override def toString = new java .
util .
Date ( ) . toString ( ) } object Main extends Application { val foo = new FooClass val bar = new BarClass val fooBar = new FooBarClass foo .
do Foo ( " One " ) bar .
doBar ( " Two " ) fooBar .
doFoo ( " Three " ) fooBar .
doBar ( " Four " ) val fooBarNow = new Now with Foos with Bars fooBarNow .
doFoo ( " Five " ) fooBarNow .
doBar ( " Six " ) }
Output :
FooClass : Foo ( " One " ) FooClass : Bar ( " Two " ) FooBarClass : Foo ( " Three " ) FooBarClass : Bar ( " Four " ) Sat Dec 01 12:58:33 CST
2007 : Foo ( " Five " ) Sat Dec 01 12:58:33 CST
2007 : Bar ( " Six " )
The FooClass and BarClass have the Foos and Bars traits respectively while FooBarClass has both traits .
Traits can override methods on the objects that use them .
The expression , new Now with Foos with Bars , demonstrates that an object with traits can be declared anonymously like an inner class in Java .
The fooBarNow value is assigned an object that is a subclass of Now that has both the Foos and Bars traits .
Sequence comprehensions
Sequence comprehensions ( also called " for comprehensions " ) provide a syntax to iterate over multiple enumerations , apply conditionals , and either produce a new sequence or execute a function object on each item .
Example :
package ForDemo case class Team ( name : String , score : Int ) object Main extends Application { var evens = for ( i < - 1 to 100 if i % 2 == 0 ) yield i ; println ( " Evens = " + evens ) var teams =
List ( Team ( " Klingons " , 132 ) , Team ( " Daleks " , 93 ) , Team ( " Kzinti " , 66 ) , Team ( " Martians " , 65 ) , Team ( " Vogons " , 55 ) , Team ( " Ewoks " , 33 ) ) for ( team1 < - teams ; team2 < - teams if team1 != team2 && team1 .
score > team2. score ) { println ( team1 . name + " defeated " + team2. name ) } }
Output :
Evens = RangeFM ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 , 38 , 40 , 42 , 44 , 46 , 48 , 50 , 52 , 54 , 56 , 58 , 60 , 62 , 64 , 66 , 68 , 70 , 72 , 74 , 76 , 78 , 80 , 82 , 84 , 86 , 88 , 90 , 92 , 94 , 96 , 98 , 100 ) Klingons defeated Daleks Klingons defeated Kzinti Klingons defeated Martians Klingons defeated Vogons Klingons defeated Ewoks Daleks defeated Kzinti Daleks defeated Martians Daleks defeated Vogons Daleks defeated Ewoks Kzinti defeated Martians Kzinti defeated Vogons Kzinti defeated Ewoks Martians defeated Vogons Martians defeated Ewoks Vogons defeated Ewoks
The first sequence comprehension in the above example iterates over a range of integers from 1 to 100 and returns a new sequence containing even numbers .
The second one has two iterations over the same sequence nested to compare the scores of each team to all other teams and produce output indicating the result .
Sequence comprehensions provide a sort of query language for sequences .
Implicit Conversion Methods
Scala supports implicit methods that are often used for converting types .
If the compiler encounters a type mismatch , it will look for an implicit method that takes the specified type and returns the required type .
Example :
package ImplicitsDemo class Foo ( val value : Int ) { override def toString = " Foo ( " + value + " ) " } class Bar ( val value : String ) { def printValue = Console . println ( value ) } object Main extends Application { implicit def Foo2Bar ( foo : Foo ) = new Bar ( foo. value .
toString ) def printBar ( bar : Bar ) = bar .
printValue printBar ( new Foo ( 42 ) ) }
The printBar method expects a Bar object , but is provided a Foo object .
The compiler will implicitly insert a call to Foo2 Bar since it takes a Foo and returns a Bar .
The method name is not significant here .
An error will result if the compiler finds multiple matching implicit methods .
Explicitly , the last line would be printBar ( new Bar( new Foo.value.toString ) ) .
The scala .
Predef object provides many implicit conversion methods with self - explanatory names like byte2int and int2long to perform various conversions .
Similar concepts in Java would be the implicit call to Object. toString ( ) when an object is passed to various print methods and auto - boxing of primitives to objects when needed .
XML Processing
Scala supports XML as a built - in data type and includes operations that are similar to XPath expressions for querying the document object model ( DOM ) .
Example :
package XMLDemo object Main extends Application { val xmlDoc = < phonebook > < entry > < name > Joseph Blow < / name > < number type = " home " > 312 - 542 - 2311 < /number > < number type = " mobile " > 526 - 321 - 8729 < /number > < /entry > < entry > < name > John Q. Public < / name > < number type = " home " > 526 - 442 - 9332 < /number > < number type = " mobile " > 312 - 333 - 1228 < /number > < /entry > < entry > < name > Jane Doe < / name > < number type = " home " > 526 - 412 - 5223 < /number > < number type = " mobile " > 312 - 231 - 2193 < /number > < /entry > < / phonebook > println ( " Names : " ) ( xmlDoc\\ " name " ) . map ( _ . text ) . foreach ( println ) println ( "
Numbers in 526 Area Code : " ) ( xmlDoc\\ " number " ) . filter ( _ . text .
startsWith ( " 526 " ) ) . map ( _ . text ) . foreach ( println ) }
Output :
Names : Joseph Blow John Q. Public Jane Doe Numbers in 526 Area Code : 526-321-8729 526-442-9332 526-412-5223
In the above example , the map and filter functions transform the results of the \\ operations .
The _.text expression is shorthand for a function object , x:T => x.text where T is the parameterized type of the list being mapped or filtered .
Sequence comprehensions could be used on XML as well for more concise expressions .
The following section of code is more readable and could be used in the XMLDemo example above :
println ( " Names : " ) for ( name < - xmlDoc\\ " name " ) println ( name .
text ) ; println ( "
Numbers in 526 Area Code : " ) for ( number < - xmlDoc\\ " number " if number .
text .
startsWith ( " 526 " ) ) println ( number .
text ) ;
Scala code can be embedded in the XML within curly braces {} .
Below is an example of a servlet implemented in Scala that uses XML with embedded values :
package ServletDemo import javax .
servlet .
http .
HttpServlet import javax .
servlet .
http .
HttpServletRequest import javax .
servlet .
http .
HttpServletResponse class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet { override def doGet ( request : HttpServletRequest , response : HttpServletResponse ) : unit = { var user = request .
get Parameter ( " user " ) if ( user == null ) { user = " " } var html = < html > < head > < /head > < body > < h1 > Hello { user } < /h1 > < form >
User : < input type = " text " name = " user " length = " 16 " / > < / form > < / body > < / html > response .
getWriter .
println ( html ) } }
The user value is retrieved from the servlet parameters and is embedded in the HTML to be rendered .
Actors Library
This feature was inspired by a similar concept in the functional language , Erlang .
Actors are basically concurrent processes that communicate via message passing .
Actors support both synchronous and asynchronous message passing .
Example :
package ActorDemo import scala .
actors .
Actor import scala .
actors .
Actor .
_ case class Stop ; class Initiator ( receiver : Actor ) extends
Actor { def act ( ) { receiver !
" Can you here me now ? " receive { case response : String => { println ( " Initiator received response :
" + response ) } } receiver !
Stop } } class Receiver extends
Actor { def act ( ) { while ( true ) { receive { case msg : String => { println ( " Receiver received :
" + msg ) sender !
" Yes I can . " } case _: Stop => { println ( " Receiver received Stop . " ) exit ( ) } } } } } object Main extends Application { val receiver = new Receiver ; val initiator = new Initiator ( receiver ) receiver .
start initiator .
start }
Output :
Receiver received : Can you here me now ?
Initiatator received response : Yes I can .
Receiver received Stop .
Actors implement the method act which is analogous to the Runnable.run ( ) method in Java .
A ! method is used to send a message to the receiving actor .
Message queues are used to store messages until the receiver is ready to process them .
Scala actors use a thread pool that initially contains four threads .
When an actor blocks via receive a thread is blocked and is not available for the pool .
The actor library will grow the pool if a new actor needs a thread .
The Scala actors library provides a means for an actor to not consume a thread when blocked by using a combination of loop and react methods .
Due to the way react is implemented , looping using while does not work .
Example of the Receiver class using loop and react :
class Receiver extends
Actor { def act ( ) { loop { react { case msg : String => { println ( " Receiver received :
" + msg ) sender !
" Yes I can . " } case _: Stop => { println ( " Receiver received Stop . " ) exit ( ) } } } } }
This form of actor is called an " Event - based actor " and is much more scalable than the thread - based counterpart .
Lazy Evaluation
This feature was new as of Scala version 2.6 .
It allows an object property not to be evaluated until the value is accessed .
Below is a code sample illustrating this :
package LazyEvalDemo import java .
lang .
Math // scala .
Math object lacks " PI " import java .
awt .
Point class Polar ( val angle : Int , val distance : Int ) { def cartesianX = distance * Math. cos ( angle * ( Math .
PI / 180 ) ) def cartesianY = distance * Math. sin ( angle * ( Math .
PI / 180 ) ) val eagerCartesianPoint = { println ( " eagerCartesianPoint being instantiated " ) ; new Point ( cartesianX. toInt , cartesianY .
toInt ) } lazy val lazyCartesianPoint = { println ( " lazyCartesianPoint being instantiated " ) ; new Point ( cartesianX. toInt , cartesianY .
toInt ) } } object Main extends Application { val polar = new Polar ( 30 , 10 ) println ( " Angle : \t " + polar .
angle ) println ( " Distance : \t " + polar .
distance ) println ( " Cartesian X : \t " + polar .
cartesianX ) println ( " Cartesian Y : \t " + polar .
cartesianY ) println ( " Eager Cartesian Point : \t " + polar .
eagerCartesianPoint .
toString ) println ( " Lazy Cartesian Point : \t " + polar .
lazyCartesianPoint . toString ) }
Output :
eagerCartesianPoint being instantiated Angle : 35 Distance : 10 Cartesian X : 8.191520442889917 Cartesian Y : 5.7357643635104605 Eager Cartesian Point : java.awt.Point[x=8,y=5 ] lazyCartesianPoint being instantiated Lazy Cartesian Point : java.awt.Point[x=8,y=5 ]
The property eagerCartesianPoint is instantiated upon construction of the Polar object while the lazyCartesianPoint property is not instantiated until it is accessed .
Lazy evaluation is useful in preventing waste as the result of unused resources without implicit coding .
Anonymous Typing
Sometimes also referred to as " Structural Typing " , this is another feature introduced in version 2.6 .
It allows a form of " duck typing " when a type can be declared based on the methods implemented .
Any classes that implement those methods match that type .
package DuckTypeDemo class
Foo { def quack : String = " Foo - quacks " def waddle ( distance : Int , units : String ) =
" Foo waddles " + distance + " " + units } class
Bar { def quack : String = " Bar - quacks " def waddle ( distance : Int , units : String ) =
" Bar waddles " + distance + " " + units } object Main extends Application { type Duck = { def quack : String ; def waddle ( d : Int , u : String ) : String } val duckList = List [ Duck ] ( new Foo , new Bar ) duckList . map ( _ . quack ) . foreach ( println ) duckList . map ( _ . waddle ( 10 , " feet " ) ) . foreach ( println ) }
Output :
Foo - quacks
Bar - quacks
Foo waddles 10 feet Bar waddles 10 feet
In the preceding example , classes Foo and Bar do not share an interface or a trait , but do implement the methods specified in the Duck type alias and therefore can comprise a list of type Duck .
In other words , they quack like a Duck and waddle like a Duck and therefore both can be considered a Duck .
Summary
Scala 's features make it as close to a dynamic language as a statically type language can get and yet maintain the performance characteristics of compiled Java .
Scala approximates features that make dynamic languages like Ruby and Groovy attractive .
Functional language features allow Scala programs to follow a more functional style when it is better suited for the task at hand or take a non-functional or imperative approach .
Features of Scala will certainly get consideration for inclusion in future versions of Java , particularly type inference and first class functions in the form of closures .
There is a precedent for this in that Martin Odersky provided the basis for Java generics .
The unique characteristics of Scala as compared to other languages for the JVM platform make it compelling language for Java developers to learn and perhaps come to use .

[ 1 ] Object - Oriented Software Construction by Bertrand Meyer
As willingness to serve in the Army has declined , the Pentagon has developed a number of smoke - and - mirror techniques to field and maintain a ground force in Iraq and Afghanistan .
I 've written about them before , but I 've just discovered one I 'd missed : the training of Air Force enlistees as convoy drivers .
Loaning airmen to the Army began in 2004 and in some ways parallels the Navy 's Individual Augmentee ( IA ) program .
Donna Mills wrote of the program last year —
Today , the Air Force is a full partner with the Army and Marine Corps as it runs convoys throughout Iraq in support of military operations there , with more than 1,000 transporters , special police and medical and personnel specialists trained to help provide security ....
To ensure airmen are prepared , the Basic Combat Convoy Course , or BC3 for short , packs into just four weeks the combat skills airmen will need to stay alive as they carry out the mission : weapons , tactics , maneuver and small - unit leadership skills , among them .
That 's no small task , considering the limited ground combat training most airmen receive .
Airmen typically receive just one week of field experience during basic training and fire their weapons only once every two years .
Outsourcing logistics — first to Halliburton , then to the Air Force
The Pentagon under Donald Rumsfeld wanted to keep the Army lean and mean — no cooks or convoy drivers , thank you .
Halliburton would provide .
But it turns out that a convoy is a very dangerous place to be .
Insurgents began to kidnap and / or kill Turkish and Jordanian drivers , and no amount of money could entice them onto the highways .
The situation was so bad that when a group of U.S. Army Reservists refused a convoy mission , the service could n't see fit to court - martial them .
So the Air Force was tasked to reduce overland convoys by increasing the number of airlifts , which has continued to this day .
And at the same time airmen either volunteered or were forced into convoy duty on the ground !
In February 2005 David McClemore was writing —
Lackland [ Air Force Base ] designed and launched the course six months ago to help the manpower - strapped Army with convoy security .
....
....
It marks the first time Air National Guard noncombatant personnel have been mobilized in support of Army combat operations .
" This is not a war of front lines and traditional combat .
This is a war of convoy ambushes and car bombs , " Mr. Pike [ of globalsecurity.org ] says .
" The Army has been turned inside out looking for additional soldiers to fight the war .
With the Army and Marines ' personnel systems under great pressure , it 's been a very different war for the Navy and Air Force . "
The Army 's failure to provide for its logistical needs came up tangentially in some remarkable testimony yesterday before the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Under discussion was a proposed increase in the size of the Army and Marine Corps —
Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey , an international relations professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , N.Y. , described what he sees as the “ disastrous state ” of ground forces , a broken commitment to troops because of broken equipment , missed training and his sense that the 95,000 increase in Army and Marine Corps personnel planned over the next five years is n’t fast enough to provide relief .
The 95,000 — 65,000 soldiers and 30,000 Marines by 2012 — are not enough , he said , because of the extraordinary means used to field forces .
This includes having 20,000 Navy and Air Force personnel assigned to traditionally ground - force missions such as convoy duties and guarding detainees , using stop - loss to prevent people from leaving the military when their obligation has ended , recalling people from the Individual Ready Reserve — who “ in many cases ” did not even have a relevant military skill , McCaffrey said — and relying on contractors and civilians to replace military personnel , both in combat theaters and even for stateside assignments such as being instructors for military training .
There 's nothing that government does — including fighting a war — that can't be done better by the private sector , right ?
The Air Force 's Combat Action Medal
Meanwhile this arrangement with the Army has been sort of on the Q.T .
It was reported in a few news outlets but has basically gone unnoticed .
Now so many airmen have served on the ground without proper recognition that the Air Force has announced it 's about to issue a " Combat Action Medal . "
Incredibly , some airmen have received the Army 's Combat Action Badge but are n't allowed to wear it on an Air Force uniform .
Can a military this rigid win a war , you wonder ?
According to Bryant Jordan ,
For many airmen who have served on war tours alongside soldiers , the Air Force ’s refusal to let them wear the sister - service badge has been a real sore spot
.... Perhaps owning an Air Force combat medal will lessen that disappointment .
And the effect on the Air Force ?
By all accounts the reassigned airmen could hardly be more pleased to be taught how to drive and shoot before they head to Iraq or Afghanistan for a 4 - month deployment .
But there 's the slightest hint that there are some who'd rather demur .
Michelle Roberts reports that —
Many airmen were surprised at the assignment .
" I was expecting just to be a vehicle operations troop , dealing with wreckers , forklifts - vehicles like that , " said Senior Airman Robert Bledsoe , who manned a 50 - caliber gun during his first deployment to Iraq .
" It opened my eyes a bunch . "
He completed a second round of training last week with a unit that will deploy within about a week for a 6 - month tour , longer than the standard 4 - month deployments for most Air Force personnel but much shorter than the 15 - month tours active Army personnel now face .
Staff Sgt. Stewart Jordan , a transport instructor for the course , said even the most reluctant airmen - turned - soldiers usually come around , ultimately finding the mission fulfilling .
" Those that it 's tougher on realize that they signed on the dotted line , " he said .
Even if it 's true that those now in the Air Force are perfectly happy to join the Army for a romp , it may not be equally true for people currently considering enlistment .
There is to be a drawdown of the Air Force to 316,000 personnel .
According to Bruce Rolfson and Vago Muradian , Air Force General T. Michael “ Buzz ” Moseley is having doubts —
If the Air Force airlift and Army support requirements increase , Moseley has doubts that 316,000 airmen will be enough to fill the jobs .
At 316,000 airmen , Moseley said , it is also questionable whether the Air Force will have the manpower to fill in - lieu - of jobs that otherwise would have been done by Army troops .
One option would be to “ plateau ” the force at 330,000 instead of cutting to 316,000 as planned .
And the situation for the Air Force is said to be dire —
“ Moseley is in a real bind here , ” said analyst Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute , Arlington , Va .
“ On the one hand his fleet is falling apart with age , and yet on the other , U.S. strategy in the global war on terror is making ever greater demands on U.S. air power .
I do n’t think anybody outside the Air Force understands how far gone U.S. air power is .
The airmen are stressed out , the aircraft corroded and the modernization budget is being cut ....
The BC3 program can't be a plus for the Air Force .

In the race for delegates , Ron Paul appears to closely trail Romney for first place
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 4 , 2008
ARLINGTON , VIRGINIA – While most reports about this past weekend ’s Maine Caucus focused on the purely symbolic presidential preference poll , in the meaningful race to secure delegates to the state convention Ron Paul is primed to finish second with likely 35 percent of the total delegates .
Delegates to the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis are elected by the state delegates .
Internal results from 10 of 16 counties , including the largest cities of Portland , South Portland , Lewiston , Auburn , Augusta , Waterville , Bangor , and Brewer , show Ron Paul picking up 215 of 608 State Convention delegates so far reported , or 35 % .
“ Ron Paul ’s strong second place finish in Maine , in which he beat John McCain , is proof that this race is far from over , ” said Ron Paul campaign manager Lew Moore .
“ We ’ll continue to battle for every delegate in this wide - open race for the Republican nomination . ”
In the presidential preference poll , with 70 percent reporting , Ron Paul is in third place just two percentage points behind John McCain .
However , the Maine preference poll is purely a beauty contest , and in the actual election of state delegates the so - called “ frontrunner ” McCain is far behind Ron Paul .

Premium $ 139.99
All domestic roaming , long - distance , Mobile Web 2.0 , Internet access , unlimited messaging to anyone in the USA , V Cast Video , VZ Navigator and Mobile e-mail .
Source : Verizon NEW YORK  AT&T ( T ) and T - Mobile on Tuesday moved quickly to match Verizon 's ( VZ ) $ 99.99 all - you - can - eat wireless plan , leaving just one big carrier — Sprint Nextel ( S ) — on the sidelines .
Sprint probably wo n't stay there long , predicts Roger Entner , a senior vice president at IAG Research .
" I think the likely outcome is that Sprint comes out with an unlimited plan that is ( priced ) slightly below " the others , Entner said .
In a recent interview with USA TODAY , Sprint Nextel CEO Dan Hesse said he is considering an unlimited plan , though details are still being worked out as to how such a plan might be structured .
On Tuesday , Sprint spokeswoman Leigh Horner said the company is continuing to evaluate rate plans but declined to elaborate .
Horner said Sprint is testing two unlimited plans in a handful of markets , including San Francisco and Tampa .
In those trials , Sprint is offering unlimited domestic voice , text and messaging for $ 119.99 ; another plan that also offers mobile broadband is $ 149.99 a month .
Verizon 's plan , unveiled Tuesday , marks a dramatic turn for the U.S. wireless industry , which has historically sold consumers big " buckets " of monthly minutes for a set price .
Part of the industry 's affinity for buckets owes to the fees companies take in from customers who exceed their monthly allotments .
Those " overage " charges generate billions in profit each year .
Now that the bucket has been tossed for high - end customers willing to spend $ 100 a month or more on wireless , value - priced variations may not be far behind .
And that could be very good news for consumers , Entner says .
Unlimited plans " are a really good deal , " he says , particularly for people who dump landline phones .
But price wars are n't so good for wireless carriers , which enjoy big profit margins and , as a result , legions of supporters on Wall Street .
Concerned that a price war might be brewing , investors on Tuesday pummeled the stocks of AT&T , Verizon and Sprint .
Verizon , the parent of Verizon Wireless , which is n't separately traded , fell 6.6 % to $ 35.34 .
AT&T , whose wireless business also is not separately traded , saw its shares slide 5.3 % to $ 35.89 .
Shares of Sprint , whose main profit center is wireless , fell 3.6 % to $ 9.23 .
T - Mobile is owned by German phone giant Deutsche Telekom ( DT ) .
Entner , for one , does n't think a price war is likely , mostly because the carriers know how bloody that would be .
" Nobody benefits from a price war , " he says flatly .
But given the heated state of competition in wireless , he also allows that almost anything is possible .
" They 're like penguins , " Entner says , referring to wireless carriers in general .
" When one jumps into cold water , they all follow . "
AT&T is the USA 's No. 1 wireless carrier with 70 million customers .
Verizon is No. 2 with nearly 66 million , and Sprint , which has been bleeding customers over the past year , is No. 3 with 54 million .

You can tell that NASA is really serious about sending astronauts back to the Moon – they ’re even working on the moonbuggies ( I mean , rovers ) .
In order to get the best designs possible , the agency is opening up the competition to student teams to design the best lunar rovers they can .
The 15th annual race is going to be in Huntsville , Alabama on April 4 - 5 , 2008 .
And who knows , maybe some of their good ideas might make it all the way to the Moon .
More than 40 student teams from the US and other countries have already registered for the 15th annual Great Moonbuggy Race .
The students have to design , build and then race their own two - person lunar vehicles across a simulated surface of the Moon .
Here are the important rules :
each buggy must be the work of students from a high school or institute of higher learning
it must be human powered
the unassembled vehicle must fit within a 1.2 - metre ( 4 - foot ) cube
the passengers must be able to carry it 6 metres ( 20 feet )
the assembled vehicle has to be thinner than 1.2 metres ( 4 feet )
it has to carry a bunch of simulated rover equipment , like a camera , antenna , and batteries
The total length of the course is about 1,100 metres ( .7 miles ) , and strewn with rocks , craters and other lunar hazards .
The team , consisting of a male and female , have to race their rover through the terrain as quickly as possible .
Each team gets two runs , and the fastest times are the winners .
The three fastest - finishing buggies in both high school and college categories will win prizes from the race sponsors .
There are also awards for the most unique moonbuggy design , best overall design , most improved team , best rookie team and most spirited team
There ’s still time to register for the competition – registration ends on February 1st .

It 's official - Volkswagen is unveiling a hybrid to challenge the mighty Toyota Prius .
And not just any hybrid , but a diesel - electric hybrid it says will deliver 69.9 mpg .
VW 's been experimenting with hybrids of the gasoline - electric variety since the early 1990s , but the Golf hybrid it will unveil next month at the Geneva Motor Show is the first production model the German company 's rolled out .
Volkswagen is n't offering much in the way of details , but the car is expected to have a parallel hybrid drivetrain with a 2.0 liter engine .
Look for it to have an all - electric mode at low speed , start - stop capability , regenerative braking and a 7 - speed DSG double - clutch transmission , according to Auto Express and AutoBlog Green .
What 's all the techno - jargon mean ?
The Golf Hybrid will get almost 70 mph mpg ( ed. note : D'oh ! ) while meeting Europe 's stringent Euro V and America 's Tier 2 Bin 5 emissions standards , making it green enough even for California .
The car is said to emit just 89 g/ km of CO2 .
( For comparison , the Prius emits 104 g/ km and Honda Civic Hybrid emits 116 . )
The hybrid Golf may be just the start .
According to Britain's Channel 4 , VW is considering the hybrid drivetrain in a Jetta and Audi A3 .
DailyTech says it also could appear in the VW
Tiguan and Audi Q5 crossover utility vehicles .
Auto Express says the Golf hybrid will be offered for sale in Europe by the end of next year .
No word yet on when we might see it on this side of the pond .
VW has n't released a picture of the hybrid , so we 're offering a shot of its diesel Golf Bluemotion .

[ Stockroom , via Boing Boing ]
It might have been 20 years ago when I noticed two men on the platform at Euston station .
They were businessmen , heavy overcoats , bound for Manchester .
The larger of the two picked a thread from the overcoat of the smaller man , as if he owned him .
The smaller man looked powerless and I knew that it was this relationship I wanted to explore in The Last Enemy : the power of the state over the individual ; the power of the official who stops you in the street and demands to see your papers ; to check your data , your private history .
UK has more CCTV cameras per head than any other country
A trick that script writers use to help focus their story is to think up the slogan for the movie poster .
As I embarked on the first draft in 2005 there was a debate getting underway about ID cards and whether or not we were sleepwalking into a surveillance society .
I set the story in the future at a time when ID cards were compulsory and we were all under greater surveillance after a terrorist attack in the UK .
I did n't want to write science fiction ; I wanted reality set just around the corner .
So writ large across my poster was : " The Future is Closer than You Think " .
It was a slogan that turned out to be horribly true ; I delivered the script a month before the London tube bombings .
After 7 July , anti-terrorist legislation was brought in with breathtaking speed : ID cards linked to a central database , the dilution of habeas corpus , constraints on the rights of freedom of speech and of freedom of assembly ; reality was threatening to overtake my " futuristic " story .
Taken for granted
Technology was also rapidly changing : in an early script I had CCTV cameras that could not only listen but lip -read .
I edited this out because it was thought too fanciful , yet such cameras and software are now installed in our cities .
The 7 July attacks show " the individual has never been so dangerous "
We are all responsible for the state in which we live .
I wanted to write about us , the sleepwalkers .
My central character , Stephen Ezard , returns to Britain having spent some years in China , and this gives him a clear perspective of just how much his homeland has changed .
Britain is no longer the country he had always taken for granted ; the tolerant liberal democracy that is our default setting .
Our perceptions have perhaps become dulled by living here .
Ezard discovers a country that has come under increasing terrorist attack and has now has a high level of surveillance with more aggressive policing .
Confusion over cards
Five million CCTV cameras , more cameras than any other country and a centralised database of all your personal details linked to an ID card .
We have an intelligence service who work incredibly hard and are passionate about saving our lives
Terrorist attacks have shown that the individual has never been potentially so dangerous and at the heart of the story is the question of how much information the state should know about us and in what form .
There now seems to be confusion over ID cards : will it be a voluntary system , and if so , what purpose might that serve ?
Or will cards become compulsory through stealth - a necessity for travel , banking , employment , or to access health and welfare ?
A comparison is often made with ID cards on the Continent , yet they are nothing like the UK ID card because they hold far less information .
Mass of information
Plans for the UK ID card are that it will be linked to the National Identity Register , a centralised data bank that can hold up to 50 categories of personal information : current and any subsequent places of residence , fingerprint details and other biometric information , national insurance number and driving licence details .
( See internet links , above right , for a full list . )
ID CARDS First ID cards to foreign nationals this year From 2010 , all passport applicants will be issued with ID cards MPs will vote on whether to make them compulsory Ministers say ID cards boost national security , tackle identity fraud , prevent illegal working and improve border controls Critics say they are an infringement of civil liberties and a waste of money
They will contain a photo , name , address , gender and date of birth .
A microchip will hold biometric information
And there 's a similar laziness in the belief it's only the guilty who have something to lose ; the innocent have nothing to hide .
To many the perils of a surveillance society seem abstract , a load of " what ifs " that will never have much bearing on most of our lives .
Yet the innocent do have something to hide - their privacy , and that is linked to dignity .
The innocent will have to prove every day that they are innocent by what is on their card .
The purpose of The Last Enemy is of course to entertain ; hopefully at the end of five - and - a - half hours there will also be a resonance .
Peter Berry 's new drama series The Last Enemy is on BBC 1 at 2100GMT on Sundays from 17 February .
The programme was made by Box TV .
Below is a selection of your comments .
" Yet the innocent do have something to hide - their privacy , and that is linked to dignity . "
That 's it ?
I care more about stopping people being robbed and attacked on the streets than about whether some anonymous bureaucrat can check my driver 's license record or my health records .
In fact I feel no sense of a loss of a dignity at all in those kind of checks , it 's when I 'm a victim of crime that I feel a loss of dignity .
The dilution of habeas corpus / freedom of speech etc is an entirely different matter of course .
Nick , London
ID cards will be linked to a database , and this , not doubt , will be computer - based .
Computers and software can only do what they are told to do - by humans .
And humans are prone to mistakes .
It would n't even take sabotage , just error , for the system to wrongly accuse someone of a crime , or have them confused with someone who really was a criminal .
The computer would say it was them .
And who would believe they were innocent ?
There will be even worse miscarriages of justice as a result .
Aine , London
I think heightened security measures only make people more jittery .
There was a story this week that a guy got arrested by armed police because someone thought his MP3 player was a gun an contacted police .
All these " report terrorism if you suspect it " posters do little to reassure people in my opinion , and are more likely to divide society and create a generation of people who panic over the slightest thing .
John , London , UK
I refuse to believe that the vast increase of money we now spend on national security compared to pre-9/11 has saved more lives than if it had instead been diverted into safer roads , domestic abuse prevention programmes and closer monitoring of repeat offenders when they 're released .
These days you can be watched along all major A and M category roads , the whole rail network and all airports , from the start of your journey to the end .
And for what purpose ?
To prove after a terrorist event where the bombers started their journey from , or are the CCTV systems used for far more than just that ?
I do not understand why we need so many CCTV cameras , I 've yet to see a concrete justification for them .

Alex , are you suggesting that we spend no more money or resources on terrorism ?
Are you not aware that the risk has actually grown since 9/11 , that this has galvanised elements of society ?
The security services have no doubt prevented many a disaster from occurring which are unpublicised for security and operational reasons that we do n't give them credit for .
Even after a crime or disaster has occurred these CCTV and security resources allow the accomplices , organisations etc to be identified which can lead to prevention of future attacks and dismantling of terrorist organisations .

Looking For A Place To Live ? 7 Ways RottenNeighbor.com Can Help ….
Maybe .
Update :
This is a review of a site that once existed .
RottenNeighbor.com was an interesting concept ( as I ’ve described below ) .
Unfortunately , it has folded and have joined the startup graveyard .
Ah …. life is short for some of these ventures !
If you want to read about the premise of their company , then do read on .
Frankly , they seemed like more of a novelty site .
Love thy neighbor .
Or would you rather rip them instead ?
Real estate is not only about transactions and investments or even about home ownership , it is also about neighborhoods .
I ’ve frequently offered my thoughts on how we can all enjoy and improve the community and environment around us .
But while the recommended way to act neighborly is to settle our differences with our neighbors privately or keep any negative musings ( of where we live ) to ourselves , there is now a new Web 2.0 type offering that allows us to act otherwise by providing an outlet for us to vent , rant and whine about the people who live around us , all in a public forum .
There have been numerous other mentions of this web site around the web quite recently , but allow me to add my .02 .
This new site is called “ RottenNeighbor.com ” and it exists to help you determine if a place is a desirable spot to live in … or not .
What ’s interesting about this site is that it brings to light those characteristics of an area that may not be currently measurable by internet sites like Zillow.com .
In short , RottenNeighbor focuses on the subjective features that could make one property attractive to a homebuyer but a turn off to another .
This could very well be a step towards bringing in subjective opinion into the property valuing equation .
How do they do it ?
By letting you tell it like it is : now you can harp about a home , neighbor or location as much as your heart desires :
A Sampling of What RottenNeighbor.com Gives You
Barking Dogs !
For god sakes man !
How many damn dogs can one neighborhood have !
There must be 4 per ef - en house over here .
I love how they bark in shifts !
Neighbors From Hell
as many as 30 people live here , often 5 or 6 families in 4 illegal units .
the noise never stops , the trash is everywhere , roaches and filth everywhere , dope customers dropping by day and night , daycare operating in the back yard daily .
Loud
These people watch TV the whole night with very loud volume .
Other tenants have to sleep with their windows closed because of noise .
Be careful before renting here .
Crazy Neighbors
Many neighbors on the 3800 Block on 21st Street are crazy and resent those with more money than them .
They are mainly from the East Coast with East Coast pretensions .
They forget that they live in San Francisco … Live and Let Live .
They should be thrown back to the East Coast .
Tsk tsk , dramatic , yes .
But how helpful is it ?
Let ’s see what it has to offer :
Seven Ways That RottenNeighbor.com Can Help You
Here ’s what it can do for you ( which I share with you , tongue - in - cheek ) — it can :
Help you find a nuisance - free zone to live in .
You can now determine if your dream home is in an equally dreamy neighborhood .
Enter a zip code and see if any cringe - worthy complaints are logged against your home - to - be .
Be able to validate the wonders of your new surroundings .
Give you a place to share your views about your community .
You have a long - standing beef with your neighbor ?
Then you no longer need to stew quietly about it or sling mud at them over your fence .
If you live in a great place , tell us about it too !
You can let the world know what you ’re dealing with .
Help you release pent up frustration and anger .
The act of filing an entry in this web site can potentially be helpful for emotional and psychological relief .
You ’ll release that tension , thereby taking some weight off your mind .
Your happier demeanor could actually be a consolation to everyone , and you may even manage to smile at the neighbors more often .
View the latest gripes against the place you already live in .
See what people are saying about your community and feel utterly defensive .
Or agree with the rest wholeheartedly .
See where neighborhoods stand in the public eye .
Inform problematic neighbors about your issues and concerns .
The site sees itself as acting as the messenger between people and their problematic neighbors .
The claim is that “ bad ” neighbors may not usually realize their impact on everyone else until they are informed of their transgressions and find themselves targeted .
Maybe they ’ll change after such a realization ?
Let you take revenge over people you do n’t like .
What stops anyone from dropping a critical line about someone they do n’t like who may live across town ?
In other words , I ’m wondering about the checks and balances on this thing .
Or are we simply leaving it all to the Wisdom of the Crowds , that indescribable force of the net that lets everything get sorted out just so , to result in what is meant to be ?
Game property values .
In a subtle kind of way , this can have a potential effect on property values , if you can somehow rally enough like - minded individuals to share their collective views .
Could this lead the march towards home affordability ?
[ Okay , this is just a snark .
Actually , this whole post is ! ]
The idea behind this site seems to be to use the ubiquitous Web 2.0 or 3.0 concept of the Wisdom Of The Crowds to fill in the gaps of information that are n’t addressed in property valuation sites like Zillow.com and Redfin .
So do n’t be surprised when this concept ( or this actual mashup ) eventually becomes absorbed by a more established real estate related service .
Still , my issues with this site remain , hence I ask :
Some Questions For RottenNeighbor.com
Is the site just “ too negative ” ?
Since it ’s based on a negative premise , how well do you think this ’ll work ?
Would n’t it be better to allow for both praise and scorn to be heaped in approximately equal dosages ?
For the record , the site also accepts compliments and positive feedback , but it ’s just not as common .
Besides , who wants to visit something named “ Rotten Neighbor ” to read someone ’s happy thoughts ?
Are these lawsuits waiting to happen ?
Apparently there is no fact - checking , moderation or filtering going on ( as per the NYTimes ) and people can enter bogus posts .
Privacy and false information issues have been brought up , but a spokesperson lends this perspective :
The entire service is being engineered to help mediate problems , not broadcast them .
Quite often neighbors do n’t even know they ’re rotten until told .
Once informed , many of them temper their behavior .
While the company is not liable for the relative truth of these posts , it ’s setting up a system to identify and remove hateful or slanderous input .
What ?
Where did the company get off that they are “ not liable for the relative truth of their postings ” ?
Are we buying into free speech or slander ?
Without the proper filtering , I can just see this site degenerate into something … well … rotten .
Could they really affect property values ?
Time will tell , but I can imagine that if this service does its job , it could very well be what a Zillow - type site needs , to help refine its property valuation formula .
How can I trust the information on the site ?
As already mentioned , there ’s not much policing of information going on in this site .
You may lodge a complaint against an entry but these concerns are handled on a case by case basis .
So you ’ll need to do additional due diligence beyond what you see here .
My Unsolicited Suggestion
I ’m sure it ’s been considered already but I wonder why such a site does n’t focus on a more balanced , pleasant and generalized reporting of information .
It would be nice to have a service that offered pros and cons of a home ’s “ subjective features ” .
I ’d personally participate to rave about my street , for instance , and work to attract people to a neighborhood rather than just simply turn them away .
Despite some misgivings , I nonetheless find it a semi-amusing pit stop on the web ( inasmuch as Jerry Springer is amusing ) .
Yet I can also see how this web site can come across as offensive , hateful and potentially destructive or dangerous : imagine how altercations with neighbors can escalate due to the online mudslinging .
It can possibly do more harm than good .
I ’d be very interested to see how this site further develops .
Do you think this service can help you or do you find it offensive ?

US President George Bush has handed the environmental movement ( and the judiciary ) a significant slap in the face , overruling a judge 's decision not to allow the US Navy to use sonar during exercises .
The US beak had issued preliminary limitations on sonar use following a lawsuit in which environmental activists said that the gear causes harm to dolphins and whales .
AP reports that the White House announced the presidential exemption on Wednesday , Mr Bush having signed the necessary documents on Tuesday while travelling in the Middle East .
" This exemption will enable the Navy to train effectively and to certify carrier and expeditionary strike groups for deployment in support of worldwide operational and combat activities , which are essential to national security , " according to the White House .
Legal efforts to stop US naval units using sonar have been underway for some time now , spearheaded by environmental pressure group the Natural Resources Defence Council .
The group says that active naval sonar - which is used to detect mines or submarines by " pinging " sound pulses into the sea and listening for the echoes - distresses various forms of marine life , particularly cetaceans .
" The president 's action is an attack on the rule of law , " the NRDC 's Joel Reynolds told AP .
" By exempting the Navy from basic safeguards under both federal and state law , the president is flouting the will of Congress , the decision of the California Coastal Commission and a ruling by the federal court . "
The Bush exemption reportedly allows the USN to continue using mid-frequency active sonar in waters off California , where several key naval bases are located .
This kind of sonar has been in use by navies worldwide since at least the 1960s , while the sonar - effects - on - cetaceans debate is of much more recent origin .
Some have theorised that in fact it is different equipment , low - frequency active sonars - which have come into naval vogue only in recent years - which primarily affects whales and dolphins .
However , the NRDC contends that all sonars cause harm .
The campaign group plans to challenge the presidential exemption in legal filings later this week . ®
Congress will defy Justice Dept. on destroyed CIA tapes ; Harman : ' We 're in Constitutional crisis ' Mike Sheehan and David Edwards
Published : Sunday December 16 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Despite the Justice Department 's objections , a Congressional panel will press ahead with its investigation into destroyed CIA interrogation tapes , according to a key Republican on the panel .
" I think we will issue subpoenas , " said Rep. Pete Hoekstra ( R - MI ) , the House Intelligence Committee 's ranking Republican , on Fox News Sunday ( video below ) .
" And once these witness appear in front of the committee , then I think we 'll have to make the decision as to whether we 're going to provide them with immunity or not .
But our investigation should move forward . "
As RAW STORY reported earlier , the Justice Department has refused outright to hand over any information about interrogation tapes destroyed by the CIA two years ago .
" The CIA did not tell us about the existence of these tapes , " Hoekstra argued .
" They did not tell us that they were going to be destroyed .
... [ T ] here 's a Constitutional responsibility for them to keep Congress informed and they have not and we need to hold them accountable . "
Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) , a top Democrat on the panel , says , " I am worried .
It smells like the cover - up of the cover - up .
...
Congress does absolutely need to exercise its Constitutional responsibility .
We 're an independent branch of government and we can do this very well . "
Of White House stonewalling on the investigation , Harman says , " We have a system of checks and balances and it 's broken .
We 're in Constitutional crisis because of the arrogant view of some in this administration that they can decide what the policy is , write the legal opinions to justify that policy and be accountable to no one . "
A transcript of the Congressmembers ' appearance on Fox News Sunday follows the video .
# WALLACE : joining us now to discuss the controversy over those CIA interrogation tapes are two key members of Congress on intelligence matters .
Republican Pete Hoekstra and Democrat Jane Harman , who comes to us from New York .
Welcome back , both of you , to " Fox News Sunday . "
HOEKSTRA : Thank you .
Good to be here .
WALLACE : On Friday , the Justice Department moved to block Congressional investigations of the destruction of these CIA tapes saying that it would jeopardize its own probe .
Congressman Hoekstra , does that mean your committee is going to stand down ?
HOEKSTRA : No , I do n't think so .
We want to hold the community accountable for what 's happened with these tapes .
I think we will issue subpoenas .
Once these witness appear in front of the committee , we 'll have to make the decision whether to provide them with immunity or not but our investigation should move forward .
WALLACE : You 're going to defy the letter you got from the Justice Department .
HOEKSTRA : I think so .
Obviously , I need to talk with the chairman of the committee about that , but that directionally is where I 'd like to go .
WALLACE : Why ?
HOEKSTRA : Because I think it 's important for Congress to hold this community accountable .
This community did not tell -- the CIA did not tell us about the existence of these tapes .
They did not tell us that they were going to be destroyed .
They need -- there 's a Constitutional responsibility for them to keep Congress informed and they have not and we need to hold them accountable .
The parts of this investigation that are being handled by justice , that 's a different issue , but we need to hold them accountable because they did not respond and they did not perform the way we expected them to .
WALLACE : Congresswoman Harman , are you confident that justice can investigate this matter , espeCIAlly given the fact that justice provided some advice over the course of these years to the CIA offiCIAls themselves , or would you like to see an independent prosecutor ?
HARMAN : Well , I 'd like to see Congress do its job .
I agree with Peter .
Congress and the Justice Department have conducted parallel inquiries many times in the past .
Recently we both were looking at leaks when I was ranking member on the intelligence committee .
We 're an independent branch of government and , oh , by the way , part of this is that Congress , specifically , i , warned them not to destroy the videotapes .
I sent them a letter in 2003 , and they did it anyway and they did n't tell us .
So I am worried .
It smells like the cover - up of the cover -up .
I 'm also worried about the CIA being the partner here , the inspector general of the CIA , I read a couple months ago , was being investigated by one of the counsel at the CIA .
Congress does absolutely need to exercise its Constitutional responsibility .
We 're an independent branch of government and we can do this very well .
WALLACE : Congresswoman Harman , as you point out , you did back in 2003 , when you became the ranking member , Democratic member of House intelligence , warn the CIA after you were informed about these tapes not to destroy them .
Over the course of the last few days , CIA director Hayden has said the reason was because they wanted to protect the identities of the CIA interrogators on the tape from retaliation from terrorists if these tapes should ever leak out .
Do you buy that explanation ?
HARMAN : No , I do n't .
Why did they do the tapes in the first place ?
at least I do n't know what the answer to that question is .
But , secondly , the CIA 's pretty good at keeping secrets .
If there was a reason to do the tapes in the first place and if they were warned not just by me , but apparently by someone in the White House or others not to destroy them , espeCIAlly because in 2005 , Congress , the courts and others were -- and the 9/11 commission were asking for evidence of this type , I can't imagine that that answer will hold up .
WALLACE : So let me ask you about that , Congresswoman Harman .
Do you think that they were destroyed , these tapes were destroyed back in 2005 to obstruct the investigations and prosecutions that were going on at that time ?
HARMAN : We do n't know that .
That 's , again , why there has to be a fair investigation by Congress among others .
I 'm not ruling out an outside commission , but I do n't think we need it now .
I think Congress is very capable .
If we run into problems , maybe we have to consider it .
You heard Pete Hoekstra , on a bipartisan basis , the House intelligence committee wants to get into this and does n't want to back down from the attorney general who may be doing something that wo n't give the public confidence that it was a full and fair investigation .
WALLACE : Congress man Hoekstra , Hayden appeared this week before your committee .
Are you satisfied that over the years the CIA acted in good faith ?
HOEKSTRA : No , I 'm not .
There are certain statements that might have been misleading to Congress as to exactly what existed .
I think you 've got a systemic problem here .
I think the community is incomPetent .
It is arrogant .
And it has developed -- it 's become political .
This -- you know , you take a look at wmd in iraq .
They were wrong .
The two nies on iran .
They were wrong .
The whole fiasco with joe wilson .
And now --
WALLACE : The valerie plame thing .
HOEKSTRA : It was handled terribly .
And now the tapes .
So you 've got a community that 's incomPetent .
They are arrogant and they are political , and they do n't believe that they are accountable to anybody .
They do n't believe that they 're accountable to the president .
They 've clearly demonstrated through the tapes case that they do n't believe they are accountable to Congress .
And when we are at war , that is a terrible position for the intelligence community to be .
If they had done what they are supposed to do on the tapes , keep us informed , listen to the kind of recommendations that my colleague Jane Harman made to them , we would n't even be having this discussion today .
But because of their arrogance and their willingness to move independent , that 's it .
WALLACE : I have to ask you to follow up , Congressman Hoekstra , do you have full confidence in director Hayden ?
HOEKSTRA : I -- when you say that the community is incomPetent , I 'm telling you I do n't have confidence in the community .
You know , I have high confidence that the community continues to be broken and is not giving us as policymakers the information that we need to make good decisions .
WALLACE : Let me just follow up .
Including CIA director Hayden .
HOEKSTRA : I 'm talking about the leadership in general .
These are all the same people that have been there for the last five or six years .
The only fresh blood in the community is Mike McConnell .
WALLACE : Director of national intelligence .
HOEKSTRA : Who is the director of national intelligence .
And I think that we 're going to hold Mike Hayden accountable because some of these misleading statements to Congress occurred on his watch .
HARMAN : this --
WALLACE : Congresswoman ?
HARMAN : Yeah , I would distinguish the workforce of the community from the leadership of the community .
Peter and I have been all over the world talking to very capable people who are on -- in austere locations , away from their families , trying to get it right and I frankly think that the recent nie on iran was the best work product they 've produced .
The leadership in my view becomes political and that 's wrong .
Remember , there was a purge going on in 2005 by porter goss as the CIA director and his top staff of people , members of the community that they thought were leaning Democratic .
I think that that is outrageous .
We need the best intelligence we can field .
Then we need wise policymakers .
That part has been broken for many years and we 've all suvrtd from that .
WALLACE : At the heart of all this is the debate and the controversy over water boarding .
The tapes reportedly show that this technique was used on two key al qaeda operatives , abu Zubaydah and abd Al - Rahim Al - Nashiri .
And they say water boarding broke Zubaydah in just three minutes .
HARMAN : It allowed us to achieve the goal that saved american lives .
Now enough time has passed that it's an unnecessary technique and should n't be used .
WALLACE : Was water boarding wrong ?
did n't it save lives ?
and to some degree , are n't we judging 2002 action from the luxury of 2007 hindsight ?
HARMAN : Well , let 's start with the fact that we do want interrogations to get the truth .
My information is that extreme interrogations often do not get the truth .
I buy John McCain 's line .
I think he has the most authenticity of any member of Congress on this subject .
He says water boarding is torture and it does n't work .
I 'm pleased that we 're now moving the separate CIA program under the -- I hope we will do this -- the army field manual .
I think for many reasons that Peter has said , the CIA has lost its credibility to run separate programs .
And by the way , when we 're talking about leadership , it is the White House that believes the Constitution starts with Article II , the power of the executive .
It ignores Article I , the Congress , and Article III , the courts .
We have a system of checks and balances and it's broken .
We 're in Constitutional crisis because of the arrogant view of some in this administration that they can decide what the policy is , write the legal opinions to justify that policy and be accountable to no one .
WALLACE : I have to ask you , Congressman Hoekstra , when you have a CIA member who says they broke al - Zubaydah in 35 seconds , and that this created intelligence that saved lives , was it so bad ?
HOEKSTRA : I think we ought to lead in our toolbox of interrogation methods everything that is legal under the Constitution and under the law to make sure that we get the information that we need to keep america safe and the last thing we ought to do is telegraph to al qaeda or other terrorist organizations exactly what may happen if and when they are captured .
I do n't want to give them our playbook .
WALLACE : We have to leave it there .
We want to thank you both for coming in today and talking with us .
HOEKSTRA : Thank you , Chris . #
Hillary Clinton has resisted calls from Barack Obama to follow him in releasing personal tax returns , arguing that Senate and presidential disclosure rules already have required her to make public large amounts of personal financial information .
But the New York senator 's tax returns likely would provide information not available in those filings .
The returns probably would show at least some of the hundreds of thousands of dollars of income earned in recent years by Bill Clinton that is n't required to be reported on Mrs ....
“ I was pointing to the words on the page and trying to explain what a word was , but I ’d watch him and realize that he did n’t have any idea what I was talking about , ” he says .
“ This black - ink thing here is called a letter  I realized this was all very abstract . ”
Mr. Marggraff likes to go to bed with one or more problems on his mind .
“ Typically , I ’ll fall asleep chewing on it and then I ’ll wake up at 4 in the morning with some sort of solution , ” he says .
That ’s a common theme in innovation , according to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi , a psychologist at the Claremont Graduate University in California .
“ Cognitive accounts of what happens during incubation assume that some kind of information processing keeps going on even when we are not aware of it , even while we are asleep , ” he writes in “ Creativity : Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention . ”
This time , Mr. Marggraff awoke at 4 in the morning determined to “ flatten out ” the globe so he could use the Atlasphere ’s near - touch technology on a single page and , ultimately , within a specially designed book to help children learn how to read .
Though some would call this an epiphany , it took years of trial and error to make the LeapPad a reality .
“ There ’s an aha moment followed by a ton of work to figure out what it is that ’s actually going to work , ” agrees Douglas K. van Duyne , co-founder of Naviscent , a Web usability consulting firm .
“ It goes back to that old saw that invention is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration .
The idea of epiphany is a dreamer ’s paradise where people want to believe that things are easier than they are .
It takes a huge amount of determination and effort to follow through . ”
Businesses want to believe that a brilliant mind or a brilliant idea can make or break their innovation efforts , Mr. Berkun says .
The myth of epiphany has a long history because it ’s appealing to believe that there is a short , simple reason that things happen .
The myth has staying power because there is a tiny core of truth within it .
“ But as soon as you dig into what happened five minutes before that magic moment , or a day , or a week , or a month , ” he says , “ you realize that there is a much more complicated story in the background . "

The emerging story of CES so far is the seeming implosion of HD DVD .
After the defection of Warners to rival Blu-ray camp , the format – backed by Microsoft and Toshiba – is left with just Universal and Paramount as the only major studios to support the hi def disc .
The HD DVD camp turned a crisis into a disaster when it cancelled its scheduled press conference at the show and then – perhaps unsurprisingly – cancelled all media interviews at the show .
It 's left observers with the impression that the HD DVD group is in disarray and on the verge of collapse .
Blu-ray , on the other hand , is only to eager to parade spokespeople talking up its own format .
Whatever happens next its clear that consumers are the ones who are suffering .
Have the hundreds of thousands of people who invested in HD DVD been left high and dry ?
Many independent film firms are also concerned because many supported HD DVD as it was cheaper than Blu ray to get licensing .
It 's doubly embarrassing for Toshiba because they are one of the main CES sponsors - their banners hang rather forlornly around the show site .
I 'm speaking to Blu-ray supporters shortly and am trying hard to get anyone from HD DVD to speak .
The fat lady is n't singing quite yet - but she 's warming up in her dressing room .
Lou Dobbs ' commentary appears weekly on CNN.com .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Diehard GOP faithful , the dwindling number of Bush loyalists and political pundits of every stripe and medium seem obsessed these days with defining or discerning the " legacy of George W. Bush . "
Lou Dobbs says President Bush has diminished a great nation and may diminish it further .
Frankly , I spend more time worrying about whether or not the United States can survive the remaining 15 months of his ebbing presidency .
There is little mystery about what future historians will consider to be the legacy of the 43rd president of the United States .
Those historians are certain to describe the first presidential administration of the 21st century with terms such as dissipation and perversion .
Bush campaigned for the Republican Party 's nomination eight years ago , styling himself as a compassionate conservative .
He 's amply demonstrated that he is neither .
Although many conservatives refuse to accept the reality , George W. Bush is a one - world neo-liberal who drove budget and trade deficits to record heights while embracing faith - based economic policies that perversely require only blind allegiance to free markets and free trade , without regard for consequence .
This president pursues a war without demanding of his generals either success or victory and accepts the sacrifice of our brave young men and women in uniform while asking nothing of our people or the nation at a time of war .
Sadly , this president has diminished a great nation and may diminish it further .
President Bush has pressed hard for the Security and Prosperity Partnership , the first step toward a North American Union that will threaten our sovereignty .
This administration has permitted American businesses to hire illegal aliens , encouraged the invasion of 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens and has given Mexico and corporate America dominion over our borders and our immigration policy .
Were it not for an outraged public , the Bush administration would have been happy to cede control of our ports to a Dubai government - owned company .
The assault on our national sovereignty continues :
At a time when public approval of the White House and Congress is near historic lows , the president is urging the Senate to act favorably on our accession to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .
One hundred fifty - five nations have ratified the Law of the Sea Treaty , which essentially codifies into law detailed rules about freedom of the seas and the extent of territorial waters .
The treaty also establishes an international bureaucracy to regulate deep - sea mining .
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently heard arguments on the 1982 Law of the Sea Treaty , which President Ronald Reagan rejected but President Bill Clinton submitted to the Senate in 1994 .
A vote is likely in the weeks ahead , and this Democratic - controlled Senate is the same institution whose leadership sought passage of the disastrous comprehensive immigration overhaul legislation .
And just as this administration trotted out an Army general to support the Dubai Ports World fiasco and a Marine Corps general to support the administration 's immigration proposal , it 's now pressured the U.S. Navy to support this treaty .
Bush says the treaty " will secure U.S. sovereign rights over extensive marine areas , including the valuable natural resources they contain . "
The president could not be more wrong .
This treaty will submit the United States to international tribunals largely adverse to our interests , and the dispute resolution mechanisms are stacked against the United States .
Sen. Jim DeMint , R - South Carolina , astutely argues that nearly all the signatories " have voted against the United States over half the time [ at the United Nations ] . "
This administration can do nothing straightforwardly and perverts language at every turn .
Take , for example , the words of Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte arguing in support of the treaty .
" As a non-party , " he argues , " We are not currently in a position to maximize U.S. sovereign rights over the shelf in the Arctic or elsewhere . "
Negroponte 's tortured reasoning is entirely consistent with this administration 's intellectual performance over almost two terms in office , but it serves neither the truth nor the national interest .
The Law of the Sea Treaty would undermine our national sovereignty and act as a back door for global environmental activists to direct U.S. policy .
It would hold the United States to yet another unaccountable international bureaucracy and constrain our national prerogatives .
Aside from that , the treaty is wholly unnecessary .
The U.S. Navy already enjoys international navigation rights by customary practice .
Our elected officials in both political parties and the national media should worry less about the legacy of this lame - duck president and far more about the future of a great nation and people debilitated by his ruinous leadership .

A federal judge recently got so infuriated by the conduct of two highly regarded trial attorneys that he overturned a jury ’s $ 51 million verdict , then ordered the lawyers to pay the fees and costs of the opposing lawyers , a sum that could total several million dollars .
U.S. District Senior Judge Richard P. Matsch sanctioned attorneys Terrance McMahon and Vera Elson of the firm McDermott , Will and Emery , of Chicago and San Francisco , for “ cavalier and abusive ” misconduct and for having a “ what can I get away with ? ” attitude during a 13 - day patent infringement trial in Denver .
He ruled that the entire trial was “ frivolous ” and the case filed solely to stifle competition rather than to protect a patent .
Neither McMahon nor Elson returned phone calls .
But their firm defended them by stating it “ believes in vigorous and ethical advocacy on behalf of our clients .
While we respect Judge Matsch , we disagree with the conclusions of the opinion and believe that it will be reversed on appeal . ”
The U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals saw it differently and affirmed Matsch ’s decision to overturn the verdict .
News of Matsch ’s ruling swept through the legal community .
“ In 42 years of litigation , I ’ve never seen a judge set aside a verdict , then award fees to opposing counsel , ” said local attorney Robert Miller , of Perkins Coie LLP .
“ There are times when a verdict is set aside , and times when lawyers are sanctioned .
But I ’ve never heard of them happening in one case .
“ Judge Matsch does some things that are out there , but he ’s usually right .
Very infrequently is he reversed on appeal . ”
The case began in 1999 , when Medtronic Navigation Inc. , a Minnesota - based firm with a manufacturing facility in Louisville , sued its competitor , BrainLab Inc. , a multinational German company , claiming it had lost more than $ 100 million because of patent infringement .
Both companies manufacture surgical instruments that guide a surgeon ’s scalpel very precisely in difficult situations such as the removal of a brain tumor .
The guidance technology was the core of the case .
For three years , the two companies could n’t negotiate a settlement .
Medtronics even tried to buy BrainLab but was rebuffed .
So Medtronics fired its lawyers and hired McDermott , Will and Emery to take the case to trial .
After presiding over the 13 - day trial , Matsch wrote that McDermott ’s lawyers not only disregarded his instructions during the trial but argued “ with full awareness that their case was without merit . ”
BrainLab ’s lead attorney , Jay Campbell , said , “ We ’re very pleased with the decision .

A paper submitted to the physics arXiv has been picked up by a number of major news outlets ( e.g. , the Daily Mail ) because the paper suggests that its authors have measured something traveling faster than the speed of light .
Unfortunately , the claim is worse than weak ; it is silly .
I 'll talk about why that is after briefly discussing their research .
The paper in question has no data at all so ; although it asserts that it has measured superluminal velocities , it offers nothing to back that up .
It also has very little in the way of experimental detail , so we can't determine with certainty what they are measuring , making it very difficult to evaluate their claims .
We 'll take as close a look as we can , given these limitations .
The researchers make use of the property called total internal reflection ( brief discussion ) .
When light is above a certain angle of incidence on an interface between two materials — say , at the face of a prism — it can be totally reflected , provided it is arriving at this interface from the higher refractive index material .
However , near the boundary , something called an evanescent wave forms that does not propagate like normal light ( technically it does not propagate at all ) and quickly decays away to nothing .
If you take a second prism and place it very close to the interface where total internal reflection occurred , then some light from this evanescent wave will leak across the interface and exit the second prism .
The prisms have to be no further than the wavelength of light involved for this to work .
Now the interesting questions are : where did the energy in this light come from ?
How fast did it travel across the boundary ?
The first question is interesting because the evanescent field has no energy in it .
This is because the electric and magnetic fields that make up the field are phased in such a way that the product is always zero .
The second question is interesting because the speed of light is not defined in a way that is intuitive to non-physicists .
Suffice it to say that for the evanescent wave , the speed of light is zero , and therefore any measurable speed is faster than the speed of light .
So , how are these authors measuring an excessive speed of light ?
In practical terms , most experiments measure light in terms of what is called the group velocity , which is how fast a pulse propagates along an underlying carrier frequency .
This can , in some circumstances , lead to the pulses traveling faster than the speed of light in the medium they 're in , but not faster than light in vacuum .
Although the setup in the new paper is not entirely clear , they were measuring the arrival time of pulses , which means we 're talking about group velocity rather than the actual speed of light .
Another problem that occurs in these experiments comes from determining when the pulse actually arrived .
If you analyze a pulse of light , you find that it is made up of a huge number of frequencies that , as you move away from the fundamental frequency , get lower and lower in amplitude .
Once you look at the experimental set up in detail , you find that it is triggering on the pre-pulse noise generated by these high frequency components .
Separate from the whole speed of light issue , the answer to the energy question in this experimental setup is interesting .
Once the two prisms are close to each other , the evanescent wave is partially reflected from the second prism back to the first prism .
When this happens , the total electric field and total magnetic field are no longer such that their product is always zero — there is energy in the field .
Furthermore , if you analyze the components of the fields that contain the energy , you find that they do have a non -zero speed of light and it is — you guessed it — the same c that applies everywhere else in the universe .
So although this makes for an interesting physics lecture — or at least I thought it was interesting — it is not new physics and not a breakdown of special relativity .
NATO must prepare for nuclear first strike , report urges
By Bill Van Auken
24 January 2008
A chilling report prepared by a group of top military commanders from the US and its NATO allies declares that the alliance must be prepared to launch a preemptive nuclear first strike because of “ asymmetric threats and global challenges ” posed to the West .
“ The first use of nuclear weapons must remain in the quiver of escalation as the ultimate instrument to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction , in order to avoid truly existential dangers , ” declares the report , which is titled “ Towards a Grand Strategy for an Uncertain World : Renewing Transatlantic Partnership . ”
The authors of the document , which has been submitted to the Pentagon and the NATO command , include Gen. John Shalikashvili ( ret. ) , who was chief of the joint chiefs of staff under the Clinton administration , as well as former chiefs of the armed forces in Britain , France , Germany and the Netherlands .
According to a report published Tuesday in the British Guardian , “ The manifesto has been written following discussions with active commanders and policymakers , many of whom are unable or unwilling to publicly air their views . ”
It is expected to be a key subject of discussion at a NATO summit to be held in Bucharest in April .
The report presents a grim picture of the 21st century , portraying the major Western powers as under siege from real and potential enemies as well as objective changes in the global situation .
It calls attention to population growth and climate change as exacerbating world conflicts and warns that terrorism , proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the struggle for “ scarce resources , ” particularly oil , poses new threats .
It also singles out China , Russia and Iran as actual or potential enemies .
In response to these supposed threats , the report calls for the NATO alliance to adopt a strategy of “ escalation dominance , the use of a full bag of both carrots and sticks — and indeed all instruments of soft and hard power , ranging from the diplomatic protest to nuclear weapons . ”
It warns that “ traditional forms and methods of governments and international organizations , ” particularly the UN , are incapable of proceeding with sufficient speed to maintain such dominance , and therefore a sweeping overhaul of NATO is required to create an adequate instrument for global intervention .
In a tone that recalls nothing so much as the rantings of Dr. Strangelove , the report states , “ Nuclear weapons are the ultimate instrument of an asymmetric response — and at the same time the ultimate tool of escalation . ”
It continues : “ Regrettably , nuclear weapons — and with them the option of first use — are indispensable , since there is simply no realistic prospect of a nuclear - free world .
On the contrary , the risk of further proliferation is imminent and , with it , the danger that nuclear war fighting , albeit limited in scope , might become possible ....
In sum , nuclear weapons remain indispensable , and nuclear escalation continues to remain an element of any modern strategy . ”
The report goes on to describe “ nuclear escalation ” as “ the ultimate step in responding symmetrically , and at the same time the most powerful way of inducing uncertainty in an opponent ’s mind . ”
While the passages on the prospects of a preemptive nuclear strike name no specific targets , there is little doubt that the immediate “ opponent ” in the mind of its authors is Iran .
The document perversely portrays a nuclear first strike as an instrument for preventing nuclear weapons proliferation .
Iran is “ strongly suspected of engaging in a military nuclear programme , ” the report states .
It continues : “ The willingness of the USA and its coalition partners to rid the world of the two terrible regimes of Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq and the Taliban has left a vacuum that Iran is stepping into , with the world unable to contain Iran ’s growing influence in the region . ”
“ As a nuclear power , ” it continues , “ Iran could become immune to international sanctions .
Furthermore , it would dominate the region , which possesses the world ’s largest oil and gas reserves . ”
This last question is clearly the principal concern among the ruling elite in both the US and Europe — that the major powers would face a direct challenge to their control over strategic energy supplies now dominated by the multinational oil companies .
The report essentially reiterates positions already enunciated by the Bush administration in Washington , which has repeatedly stressed that it is keeping “ all options on the table , ” including the use of nuclear weapons , in its global war on terror and its confrontations with so - called “ rogue states . ”
In 2002 , the US administration drafted a Nuclear Posture Review that spelled out the kind of preemptive nuclear first - strike policy put forward in the NATO report .
It declared that the US “ reserves the right to respond with overwhelming force — including the use of nuclear weapons — to the use of [ WMD ] against the United States , our forces abroad , and friends and allies . ”
It went on to assert that the US must develop “ the capabilities to detect and destroy an adversary ’s WMD assets before these weapons are used . ”
In 2006 , investigative journalist Seymour Hersh cited extensive intelligence and military sources in a report that revealed the Bush administration had drafted plans for a preemptive attack on Iran , which included the use of “ tactical nuclear devices ” to obliterate not only the country ’s nuclear program , but also large elements of its security forces and basic infrastructure .
The document submitted to NATO by the former chiefs of staff echoes the twisted logic utilized by the Bush administration in its attempt to justify its policy of preventive war .
“ The early use of military responses is often linked to pre-emption and prevention — both elements of modern strategy , ” it states .
“ Both are applicable throughout a crisis or conflict , and neither is necessarily linked to a specific set of instruments , such as the military .
Pre-emption is the reactive response , when an opponent ’s action is considered imminent ; whereas prevention is a proactive step aimed at denial — and thus at conflict termination — in a situation in which the threat is not yet imminent , but in which evidence indisputably points to the unavoidability of conflict .
Pre-emption is widely seen as a legal act of self - defence under customary international law , whereas the question of the legality of a preventive use of force so far remains unanswered . ”
This is a deliberate and nonsensical falsification .
Under international law , a “ preventive use of force ” is indistinguishable from illegal aggression — a “ war of choice ” waged by a military power to eliminate some perceived future threat that would place it at a strategic disadvantage .
At the Nuremberg trial of the Nazi leadership , such a war was described as the “ supreme international crime . ”
While the ex-defense chiefs ’ report makes the case for NATO playing the role of a “ global security provider , ” independent of and , whenever necessary , in defiance of the United Nations and international law , much of the document consists of a worried critique of the present state of the Atlantic alliance .
It states , for example , that interventions in Bosnia , Kosovo , Afghanistan and Iraq have all been characterized by “ the absence of a properly defined political objective , the absence of an integrated and allied strategy to achieve that objective , and the absence of capabilities to implement the strategy . ”
It adds , “ In addition , nations have commonly imposed too many national caveats on use of their forces .
There exists an unwillingness on the part of nations to transfer authority to the operational commander once in the theatre of operations .
Finally , there is a tendency for nations not to resource operations effectively . ”
These statements appear to directly reflect the bitter divisions that have opened up between Washington and its NATO allies in Afghanistan , where the US has been forced to dispatch thousands more Marines because of the refusal of Germany , France and Italy to send more troops or waive restrictions on the rules of engagement for those they have already sent .
At the same time , the European members have criticized the American military for excessive use of force , which they have blamed for the mounting resistance in the occupied country .
A section of the document proposes far - reaching changes to the NATO command structure in order to enable the military alliance “ to respond at short notice and conduct operations at a high operational tempo . ”
These include changing from consensus decisions within NATO to majority votes in order to prevent dissent from blocking military interventions .
The document also demands the scrapping of all “ national caveats ” limiting the use of European military forces , as in Afghanistan , placing them under a centralized and unrestricted NATO command .
The document calls for NATO to deny any say in its military operations to members of the alliance that do not contribute military forces to carry them out .
It also explicitly advocates that NATO be prepared to carry out military action without United Nations Security Council authorization when “ immediate action is needed to protect large numbers of human beings . ”
In its conclusion , the document declares , “ The lack of cooperation — indeed , at times , the rivalry — between the EU and NATO is something that must be rectified . ”
It insists , “ For the USA to play its role as effectively as possible , the transatlantic bargain between the European countries , Canada and their American ally must be renewed . ”
The reality is that the “ transatlantic bargain ” is coming unraveled as a result of the historic decline in the global position of US capitalism and the relentless turn by the American ruling elite towards militarism .
While the European bourgeoisie has repeatedly subordinated itself to Washington , including in the war against Iraq and the escalating threats against Iran , its interests and those of American capitalism do not coincide .
The struggle between rival capitalist nations for “ scarce resources ” — which is the fundamental source of both of these conflicts — ultimately pits European capitalism against US imperialism .
Then there are China and Russia , which are increasingly asserting their own interests internationally .
Significantly , just the day before the call for NATO preemptive nuclear strikes grabbed international headlines , the chief of staff of the Russian military issued his own similar warning .
“ We do not intend to attack anyone , but we consider it necessary that all our partners in the international community clearly understand that for the defense of our sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Russia and its allies , the armed forces will be employed , including preventively the use of nuclear weapons , ” said General Yuri Bauyevsky .
It is the drive by US imperialism to offset its economic decline in relation to rivals in Europe and Asia by exploiting its military superiority to seize hold of vital natural resources and markets that poses the threat of a world conflagration .
It is in this context that the recommendations of the former defense chiefs in relation to nuclear first strikes and wars of aggression assume their full menacing significance for the future of mankind .
Russia Deploys New Strategic Missiles
By VOA News
16 December 2007
Russian news reports say the military has deployed another batch of intercontinental ballistic missiles .
The announcement Sunday says three new Topol - M truck - mounted missile units have been positioned about 250 kilometers northeast of Moscow , in the Ivanovo region near Teikovo .
A first batch of the mobile missiles were deployed in the area last year .
Analysts say the missile has an effective range of 10,000 kilometers and can carry a more than one - ton payload .
Russian military chiefs have been quoted as saying the mobile Topol missiles are aimed at countering U.S. missile shield plans in central Europe .
Russia opposes U.S. plans for 10 missile interceptors in Poland and guidance radar in the Czech Republic .
Washington says the missile shield will protect the United States and its European allies from potential missile attacks from Iran .
But Moscow insists the U.S. deployment will destabilize central and eastern Europe and lead to a new arms race .
Some information for this report was provided by AP .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
At - risk borrowers with all types of mortgages , not just high - cost subprime loans , could be eligible for help under a new plan involving six big home lenders .
The plan , called Project Lifeline , will be announced Tuesday by the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development , said a person familiar with the plan who confirmed earlier news reports about the plan but spoke on condition of anonymity because it had not yet been made public .
Against a backdrop of surging defaults and administration officials ' prodding of the mortgage industry , the plan will allow seriously overdue homeowners to suspend foreclosures for 30 days while lenders try to work out more affordable loan terms .
On a pilot basis , the plan will involve six of the largest mortgage lenders , in hopes that more lenders will sign on .
The participants are Bank of America Corp. , Citigroup Inc. , Countrywide Financial Corp. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Washington Mutual Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co .
All six are involved in Hope Now , an effort the Bush administration brokered with the mortgage industry late last year to freeze rates on some high - cost subprime mortgages for five years to aid borrowers whose teaser rates are jumping sharply higher .
Since then , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has urged lenders to expand that effort to cover struggling homeowners with conventional mortgages .
The new plan applies to seriously delinquent homeowners , those whose mortgages are 90 days or more past due .
With home prices falling , even some people with good credit have gotten behind on their payments .
Like many subprime borrowers , they signed up for adjustable - rate mortgages that allowed them to make smaller , steady payments for several years until a higher fluctuating interest rate kicked in .
Some borrowed against their rising equity as home prices climbed , assuming they would be able to refinance or sell their homes before the higher payments began .
But as prices have plummeted , many homeowners now owe more than their home is worth , and banks have tightened their lending practices , leaving even people with stellar credit struggling with higher payments .
The Hope Now alliance , which includes lenders , investors and non-profit groups , said last week that it helped nearly 8 % of subprime borrowers in the second half of 2007 — more than its original estimate .
The group said it helped 545,000 subprime borrowers with spotty credit in the second half of last year , compared with its January estimate of 370,000 .
That works out to 7.7 % of 7.1 million subprime loans outstanding as of September .
Among the subprime borrowers aided , 150,000 were helped through permanent - loan modifications , such as lower interest rates , while 395,000 negotiated repayment plans , which often involve a borrower getting back on track even after missing a few payments .
Consumer groups , however , point out that many borrowers still can't keep up , even after loan workouts .
They say many of the borrowers in the Hope Now effort have negotiated short - term loan modifications or repayment plans , which often involve a borrower getting back on track after missing a few payments .
A full - fledged refinancing at a lower rate is preferable , they say .

8 Montserrat Monastery ( Spain )
The Santa María de Montserrat monastery is located in the Montserrat mountain in Catalonia .
The Virgin of Montserrat famous statue is here ; ñegend has it that the Benedictine monks could not move the statue to construct their monastery , choosing to instead build around it .
The statue ’s sanctuary is located at the rear of the chapel , where an altar of gold surrounds the icon , and is now a site of pilgrimage .
The message on the sheet was signed with the letters “ E.L.F. , ” the infamous initials of the Earth Liberation Front , a loosely organized group that has been linked to multiple bold acts of ecoterrorism across the Northwest and elsewhere for two decades .
Banners have claimed E.L.F. responsibility for arsons at other housing developments in the region in recent years , and the fires on Monday came as jurors deliberated in a case involving an arson in 2001 at the University of Washington that was linked to E.L.F .
Image Grey Lundberg of CMI Homes was on the scene on Monday as fires ripped through the houses he built .
Credit ... Stuart Isett for The New York Times
Fred Gutt , a special agent with the F.B.I. ’s Joint Terrorism Task Force in Seattle , said of Monday ’s fires , “ There ’s a claim of E.L.F .
responsibility and , given that , it ’s being investigated as a domestic - terrorism act . ”
“ But the authenticity of the claims still needs to be borne out , ” Mr. Gutt added , noting the elusiveness of the Earth Liberation Front .
“ There ’s no membership rolls .
There ’s no clubhouse .
It ’s more of an ideology .
They ’re organized only to the extent of maybe cells that get together and decide to act on their belief . ”
None of the houses were occupied at the time of the fires , and no one was injured .
Neighbors first reported hearing what sounded like gunfire or explosions early Monday , and firefighting authorities on the scene told reporters that the houses appeared to have had multiple fires set .
The fires stunned the builders and real estate agents promoting the development , who had cast it as reflecting the “ best practices ” of environmentally friendly high - end home construction .
They emphasized features like landscaping that requires little water , sidewalks designed to minimize runoff and reused lumber for construction .

Belgian newspapers
De Morgen and Het Laatste Nieuws reported Friday that “ the Brussels public prosecutor has asked patrol detectives of the Federal Computer Crime Unit to go on Second Life ” to investigate a “ virtual rape ” involving a Belgian user of Second Life .
( Translations from FreeTranslation.com ’s web page translator . )
Website WTFsrsly ( that ’s “ what the f*** , seriously , ” for readers who do n’t speak “ l33t ” ) , appears to have first reported the story outside of Belgium , and makes the following point :
Those who know Second Life a bit probably wonder how this was possible though .
Sure there are modifications that you can make to your Second Life character in order to be able to rape other characters ( these modifications can actually be purchased in - game from other players who develop them ) , but normally such modifications require consent from the other player .
In other words : you can only get raped if you want to .
WTFsrsly is ( while sort of crass ) technically correct , which raises some interesting questions — most importantly , what is “ virtual rape ” anyway ?
The question is n’t as simple as it might seem — and it is at the heart of what makes virtual worlds different from other forms of interaction .
Many would argue that sexually - oriented harassment that takes place in a virtual world is not “ virtual rape . ”
In other words , if someone causes his avatar ‘ Bad Max ’ to regularly say sexually explicit things to his avatar ’s neighbor ‘ Jane Nicegirl ’ he ’s definitely a contemptible sleazeball , he ’s almost certainly in violation of the Terms of Service of his virtual world , he ’s probably guilty of several harassment and stalking crimes , and he might be liable in civil court for intentional infliction of emotional distress .
But , some would argue , no matter what the user has ‘ Bad Max ’ say to ‘ Jane Nicegirl , ’ it does n’t really make sense to call that “ rape . ”
On the other hand , there are objects ( it ’s all code , of course , but “ objects ” are how that code gets represented ) within some virtual worlds that give one user control over another user ’s avatar .
In early text - based virtual worlds , such objects were known as “ voodoo dolls , ” and they have been used to perpetrate something that many would call “ virtual rape . ”
The most famous case of involving a voodoo doll took place in LamdaMOO , a text - based multi-user environment , and was brilliantly covered by Julian Dibble .
The Dibble piece is well worth reading in its entirety , but in sum , a voodoo doll was employed by one user to make it appear that several other users were participating in explicit , violent sexual acts in an extremely public part of the environment .
Voodoo doll - type objects exist in modern virtual worlds too .
In Second Life , for example , scripted collars that allow one user to take control of another user ’s avatar are regularly used by the BDSM crowd in purely consensual online relationships and encounters .
The code that makes these devices work , however , could be built into anything from a teacup to a tennis bracelet .
And in theory , at least , these objects could then be given to an unsuspecting avatar as virtual roofies .
Although software controls in Second Life are supposed to require that an object obtain permission before animating an avatar , it is not difficult to imagine a situation where a combination of skillful scripting and social engineering could lead to one user ’s control of another ( unwilling ) user ’s avatar , particularly if the victim is new to virtual worlds and unfamiliar with the often bewildering array of controls , dialog boxes , and objects .
It is not known what occurred here that lead to the Belgian investigation ( and it may well never be ) but the questions that are raised by the allegation are certain to arise again .
Reader Roundtable
What is “ virtual rape ? ”
Does it even make internal sense as a term ?
Is it control of an avatar against a user ’s will , a textual or graphical depiction of a forced sexual act , or something else completely ?
Can virtual rape occur without even the appearance ( in a graphical world ) or description ( in a text - based world ) of physical contact , or is that “ just ” harassment — essentially the equivalent of an obscene phone call ?
How should crimes perpetrated only in a virtual space be punished ?
Is it just harassment ( of the user ) , no matter what the crime ( against the avatar ) ?
Should there be a sliding scale of punishments — where virtual rape would likely be punished more severely than other types of virtual assault ?
NOT long ago , toppings for pizza were becoming unbearably fancy — hoisin - slathered duck , or fontina and truffles — or just ridiculous ( you ’ve seen the ones with pasta ? ) .
Pizza threatened to become something other than pizza .
Fortunately , that trend has reversed .
Nevertheless , it is still fun to innovate , or to adopt a pizza tradition you were not familiar with .
My friend Ed Schneider , a sometime food writer and brilliant home cook , called me recently with a suggestion that sounded so good I tried it immediately : pan -fried pizza .

Turns out , perhaps not surprisingly , that pizza fritta probably originated in Naples ; you can also find it in Scotland , sometimes stuffed with chips , but enough said about that .
The principles and ingredients are classic , the technique and results strikingly different from what pizza lovers have come to expect .

Later , you hire a consultant to analyse why the cow has dropped dead .
ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM
You have two cows .
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company , using letters of credit opened by your brother - in - law at the bank , then execute debt / equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back , with a tax exemption for five cows .
The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island Company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company .
The annual report says the company owns eight cows , with an option on one more .
You sell one cow to buy a new president of the United States , leaving you with nine cows .

Relevant disclaim : I am Chris Dodd's Internet Director
Well , we scored a nice little victory today , did n't we ?
Make no mistake about it , if it was n't for our efforts , together , retroactive immunity would be well on its way to sailing through the Senate ... largely unnoticed .
But this is only one victory in a larger battle , in an even larger fight .
In a sense , our work has just begun anew .
Because information is just coming out fast and furious , it 's important to note two things as the debate moves to the full Senate .
1. ) Chris Dodd 's hold / pledge to hold any bill that contains retroactive immunity remains operative as long as today 's bill that passed Judiciary is only " most likely " going to be reported to the full Senate .
2. ) Unlike Mukasey , those who would erode the Constitution will need SIXTY votes to pass any amendment that includes retroactive immunity , or any substitute that is immunity by another name .
Senator Dodd 's statement below the fold .
America is on the brink of one of the most momentous demographic shifts in history : the retirement of the baby boomers .
There are about 78 million boomers , born between 1946 and 1964 , and as they begin hitting retirement age - the first wave turns 65 in 2011 - experts anticipate workforce shortages .
While some boomers are expected to keep working , others will leave current jobs for less - stressful careers , seek part - time or consulting positions , or retire .
One way to handle the baby boomers ’ workforce impact , some experts say , is by tapping into the pool of full - time moms re-entering the workforce .
And , according to a report by the Center for Work - Life Policy and the Harvard Business Review , many women who take time off for their families want to re-enter the workforce .
The report , Off - Ramps and On - Ramps : Keeping Women on the Road to Success , says 37 percent of highly qualified women leave the workforce for some period of time , and 93 percent want to go back to work .
“ Many find this more difficult than they anticipated .
Only 74 % succeed in reentering the workforce and only 40 % return to full - time jobs , ” the report says .
“ It would be in [ employers ’ ] best interests to take a look at this group of moms because they ’re going to find a dedicated and smart … group of people who want to work hard , who need the money , and they ’ll be loyal to you if you ’re good to them , ” said Jen Singer , creator and editor of MommaSaid.net , a Web community geared to at - home moms .

A Workforce in Flux
The U.S. Department of Labor ’s Bureau of Labor Statistics says the growth of the labor force will slow in the years ahead , largely due to aging baby boomers and the leveling off of women ’s workforce participation after years of “ remarkable increases . ”
The generation after the boomers - “ baby - busters ” born between 1965 and 1976 - is much smaller , the BLS points out , a size difference that also will contribute to the slowed growth of the labor force .
To confront the slowed growth , some experts say employers will become more flexible to attract more workers .
“ Employers will have no choice but to be more flexible .
They will be offering opportunities for creative scheduling and … opportunities to work at home .
There will be a whole restructuring of the way work gets done , ” said Roberta Chinsky Matuson , principal of Human Resource Solutions in Northampton , Mass .
“ That will help moms who want to reenter the work force , but stay at home and work . ”
Allison O’Kelly , CEO of Mom Corps , an Atlanta - based staffing firm that focuses on placing workers that seek flexible schedules in part - time , contract or project positions , said companies will be more flexible when it benefits them .
She pointed to the accounting and finance industries , which have become more flexible due to employee shortages spurred by regulations .
“ I do n’t think it ’s necessarily because they are more forward - thinking than other industries , they just have a need and will be more creative in the ways they get their staff , ” she said .
Chinsky Matuson said employers also will learn to emphasize results over hours as a measure of productivity .
“ I think companies will have to focus more on results and less on face time . …
It ’s not all about the number of hours you are in the office .
It ’s about if the work gets done , ” she said .
Changing Mindsets
As baby boomers leave the workforce , so will the mindset that ’s often been detrimental to women taking time off after having children , some experts say .
Baby boomers “ were the generation that was supposed to have it all at the same time .
When baby boomers stayed home with kids , they were giving up the ’ cause . ’
So there was an extra stigma for baby boomers returning to work than there is for their younger cohorts , ” said Singer of MommaSaid.net .
“ I do n’t think the Generation X , at least among their peers , face as big a bias as the baby - boomer women . ”
Bonnie D. Monych , author of “ Shift Happens !
Straight Talk about Jobs , Work and Careers , ” and president of The New Workplace Inc. , in Houston , agreed with Singer .
Baby boomers “ had a difficult time understanding women leaving and coming back .
As those people leave , it ’s becoming more acceptable to rotate in and out , ” Monych said .
“ The attitudes are completely different in the new generations .
As we get more and more people from new generations in manager positions , you ’ll see a significant change . ”
Tom Gimbel , CEO of The LaSalle Network , a staffing firm in Chicago , offered a different take .
“ I interview baby boomers all the time who work in corporations …
They say they would take a part - time mom with experience , ” Gimbel said .
“ The problem is everything ca n’t be so flexible to accommodate the back - to - work parent , and they have an over - inflated sense of self - worth .
They ca n’t pull in what they were earning five years ago or what someone who was doing it all along earns . ”
Dr. Heidi Hartmann , president of the Washington - based Institute for Women ’s Policy Research , said she sees another factor contributing to changing mindsets .
“ I think that if anything is changing for younger people it ’s that more men say they want to be involved in child rearing and take some time off for child rearing .
Once it ’s seen as a more gender - neutral phenomenon , then I think we can see a whole change in the attitude in the workplace , ” she said .
“ Taking time off for various reasons is not a sign of lack of commitment .
You have a lot of different interests and you do different things , you travel , pursue art , raise children . ”
KenBlogz : A common complaint from " feminists " is that women only make 70 cents to every dollar that men make .
Your thoughts ?
MonMothma :
My mom said that one time , and I was like " Whatever ! "
So I asked my Assistant Vice Manager about it , and he informed me that that was just a load of superstitious pseudo - science .
He even showed me a pie chart that proved that I earn the same amount as my boyfriend Andy Anderson .
KenBlogz : Ok , then .
What about feminists ' crackpot theories on how women are portrayed so negatively in the media that it oftentimes seems like a joke ?
MonMothma : I take offense to that .
My aunt was one of the firefighters that helped to rescue people during the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks on U.S. Soil .
She was featured in Fox News 's piece , " Surprisingly , Their Tits Did n't Get In The Way . "
She was treated as nothing but a hero .
They even devoted fifteen minutes of the segment to the fact that my aunt 's vagina did n't get infected when she was forced to work in standing water .
In fact , because of her Inferior Musculature , she was able to squeeze into areas that the Men simply could n't fit into .
KenBlogz :
Wow , it sounds like your aunt really knew her place .
MonMothma :
She did , she did .
In order to avoid being labeled a " sexist " by the Militant TamponBurners , I next interviewed Monica 's boyfriend , fellow Wal - Mart employee Andy Anderson .
KenBlogz :
Andy , I 'm doing an article about feminism .
Where do you stand on the issue of Women 's Rights ?
Do they deserve them ?
Adm.Akbar : Absolutely .
It 's just that in this day and age , they already share all the same privileges as men .
It 's like , give it up already !
KenBlogz : I know !
It 's like they 're just looking for excuses to be pissed off all the time !
Adm.Akbar :
You said it , bro !
They need to redirect their anger into a valid issue , like The War on Christmas .
KenBlogz : You 're a real American Prophet .
Wanna meet me at Depressed Dad's [ a local tavern ] around 8 ?
Adm.Akbar : Absolutely !
Hang on a second ...
MONICA !
I'M NOT TAKING YOU TO THE MOVIES TONIGHT .
MonMothma : WHY ?
Adm.Akbar : JESUS CHRIST YOU'RE SMOTHERING ME !
Even though the diagnosis was clear , I was sure that my readers would want a second opinion .
I headed down to X - Treme GameUrz : 4 Teenz & Tweenz to meet a local oddball who professes to be a feminist .
And get this : it 's a guy !!!
I put the Paddy Wagon on Speed Dial , and entered the Lioness 's Den .
The cashier directed me to the hazy back of the establishment , to a young man named Phylliam Diller .
KenBlogz : Good evening , Phylliam .
I'm Kenny Blogginz and I 'm squeezing into my Typing Tites to write an article about feminism .
Just tell me a little tidbit about yourself .
PhylDil : Hello , Kenny .
My name is Phylliam Diller , and I 'm a feminist .
KenBlogz : Why !?!?
PhylDil : I just feel that women are treated very unfairly in our society .
KenBlogz : Our society !?
Whose society would you prefer , sir — Mao Tse Dong 's Communist China !?
PhylDil :
No , they 're pretty sexist , too .
KenBlogz : Just tell me :
What drove you to such depths of insanity ?
PhylDil : Actually , my older sister used to be a waitress , and she was harassed so severely by her male customers that it really opened my eyes to all the gender inequality in America .
KenBlogz : Well , I 'm sorry that Red-Blooded American Men sometimes have needs , after working at their grueling jobs all day .
And I 'm sorry that you hate hard working American Men .
And our Lord .
PhylDil : I did n't even say that !
KenBlogz :
You call yourself a feminist ... I 've got another - ist ending word for you ... and that 's COMMUNIST !
Shame on you , sir , shame .
I guess you can't be a feminist unless you also hate America .
Ronald Reagan is weeping red white and blue tears in the deepest bowels of hell right now .
PhylDil : Please do n't say I hate America .
KenBlogz : Too late , Osama .
As I was leaving X - Treme GameUrz , I bumped into Phylliam 's girlfriend ... let 's call her Valerie Solanas .
I convinced her to sit down with me for an interview .
KenBlogz : Hi Valerie , I'm Kenny Blogginz .
I just got done interviewing your boyfriend about feminism .
He seemed to have some pretty dangerous ideas .
Are you a feminist ?
ValSol : Yes , I am .
KenBlogz : I 'm going to have to stop you right there .
It looks to me like you 're wearing women 's makeup .
And I can't smell you .
ValSol : And ...?
KenBlogz : Nothing .
Please tell me what happened to you as a child that caused you to even consider being a feminist ?
ValSol : Nothing happened to me as a child !
I 'm a feminist because I believe that women should have the same rights that men have .
KenBlogz : But ... that 's not what feminism is about at all !
It 's about killing off all men , save for a select few breeding studs ... and overthrowing the government and " money system " ... and abolishing " male medicine " so that women can live forever ...
ValSol :
What in the flying fuck are you talking about ?
KenBlogz : I just do n't know anymore .
ValSol : Feminism is about women gaining the same rights that men have !
It 's about gender equality — and opening up a spectrum of definitions of both femininity AND masculinity .
Feminism benefits men , too !
KenBlogz :
It 's not about establishing societies of women who would , among other things , cut up men ?
ValSol : Of course not !
I 'd never cut anything up !
KenBlogz :
It 's not about forcibly directing every Red-Blooded American Man into elaborate castration machines ?
ValSol : No ! Absolutely not !
KenBlogz :
It 's not about a radical agenda to destroy the Y chromosome and rename the planet Lesbos ?
ValSol : What ?
No .
KenBlogz :
It 's not about telepathically auditing out body thetans via regression therapy in which their extermination by Xenu with hydrogen bombs is re-experienced ?
ValSol : No , that 's Scientology .
KenBlogz :
It 's not about eroding arbitrary male privilege and empowering women so that they can do things like choose who they have sex with , get an education , control their own reproduction , and have orgasms ?
ValSol :
Well , yes — it is about that .
But those are good things , Kenny .
KenBlogz :
What a fool I 've been !
I mean , when you get raised in a small town ... well , you only hear the American Farmer 's side of certain issues and I ...I 'm sorry .
ValSol :
It 's ok , Kenny .
KenBlogz : [ crying hysterically ]
I thought I was an American Hero ... but I ended up being an American ZERO !!!
WHYYYYY !!???
ValSol : Shh , it 's all right ; you 're an American Hero .
KenBlogz : R-really ?
ValSol : Of course .
It 's never too late to become a feminist !
KenBlogz : Yay !
ValSol :
You wanna come get some ice cream with me and Phylliam ?
KenBlogz : Would I !? [ yes ]
So there it is , Shakers .
I began this article thinking that a woman could never be president , because while on " The Rag " her manicured fingers would always hover scant inches above the enormous red " Nuke Teh Globez " button in the direct center of the desk in the Oval Office .
Now I recognize my follies .
Through the kindness and compassion of Valerie Solanas , Paragon of Understanding and Acceptance , I have come to realize that , like it or not , women are people too .
Good morning , Shakers !
This is Shakesville 's Senior Shakesville Teen Analyst and 18 - year - old Man-Boy of Leisure Kenny Blogginz .
You may remember me from such other Shakesville hits as Dem Younginz and Young ' Publicans .
I 'm the one on the streets , asking all the hard - hitting questions , while you sit back and read from the comfort of your own home .
Shame on you .
Anygay , in this Left - Winged caricature of America , run by Activist Judges and the Gay Mafia , the question that keeps slapping me on the chin is this :
Is feminism really necessary anymore ?
I decided to throw on my Chuck Taylor Sneaker Shoes , pull on my Abercrombie Hoodie Sweater , turn up some Linkin Park jams on my iPod Portable MP3 player , and hit the Streets of America , to find out what My Fellow Teen Americans thought about this outdated , obsolete ideology .
Women are n't paid as much as men , you say ?
Maybe all you Islezbofascists should tell that to Monica Kciurzky , a 17 - year - old employee of Wal - Mart , who has been assured by her manager on numerous occasions that she earns the same hourly wage as her male coworkers .
KenBlogz : Monica !!
WHAAAZUUUUUUUUP ?
I'm Kenny Blogginz .
I 'm writing an important article about feminism for a blog that you 've never heard of .
Why do n't you just tell me a little bit about yourself ?
MonMothma : Hi , Kenny .
My name is Monica Kciurzky .
I 'm 17 years old , and I 've worked here at Wal - Mart for the past 2 years .
I started out disguised as a Senior Greeter , and was eventually promoted to my current position , Vice Stockroom Watercooler Technician Laureate .
KenBlogz : I 'm just going to hold my nose and plunge into the icy waters of my first question .
Do you consider yourself a feminist ?
MonMothma :
Are n't feminists those ladies who burn their bras , do n't shave their legs / armpits / whole bodies , smell like poop , and are all mad because they do n't have boyfriends ?
KenBlogz : Baaaaasically .
MonMothma : Then…NO .
Questions were being asked tonight about the seaworthiness of a cruise liner that had to be evacuated as it began to sink after hitting an iceberg in the Antarctic Ocean .
Two inspections earlier this year found 11 deficiencies with the ship , called the M/S Explorer , which is sinking near the South Shetland Islands , south of Argentina .
All 154 passengers and crew abandoned the 2,400 - tonne vessel , which is listing 30 degrees to starboard , and were transferred to a rescue vessel , the Nord Norge , via life rafts .
One maritime expert said the incident raised concerns about the growing trend to run cruises " in increasingly exotic and remote locations , often in inherently dangerous conditions " .
" There are many questions about the suitability of some ships to operate in such potentially adverse conditions , often well away from adequate search - and - rescue cover , " said Mark Dickinson , assistant general secretary of the maritime union Nautilus UK .
Although all the crew and passengers were evacuated safely , Dickinson raised concern that the ship had old - style open lifeboats despite sailing in Antarctic waters .
" The vessel was not breaking any rules by having such lifeboats rather than the more - closed newer ones .
But you have to question whether a vessel visiting icy waters with elderly passengers aboard was as equipped as it might have been . "
An inspection by the British Maritime and Coastguard Agency ( MCA ) in Greenock , Scotland , in May this year found the MS Explorer had five deficiencies , including missing search and rescue plans and lifeboat maintenance problems .
The ship was held in port until these safety concerns were addressed .
An MCA spokesman , Mark Clarke , said : " These were not huge problems and were all rectified before the vessel sailed .
It would not have been allowed to depart if everything had not been sorted out . "
It is understood that Chilean port state control inspectors also found six deficiencies during an inspection of the ship in Puerto Natales in March .
These included two related to safety of navigation matters .
Classification society Det Norske Veritas issued a passenger safety certificate for the vessel on October 21 , the MCA said .
Susan Hayes of Gap Adventures , which owns the stricken vessel , said : " The ship ran into some ice .
It was submerged ice and the result was a hole about the size of a fist in the side of the hull so it began taking on water ... but quite slowly .
" The passengers are absolutely fine .
They 're all accounted for , no injuries whatsoever . "
Arnvid Hansen , captain of the Nord Norge , which rescued all those on board the stricken liner , told Sky News : " We were the first on the scene .
Most of the passengers had thermal suits and lifejackets on .
Everybody appeared to be in good condition . "
Coastguards in Falmouth , Cornwall , along with services in Virginia , US , and Ushuaia , Argentina , are assisting with the rescue operation .
The MS Explorer was carrying a total of 100 passengers and 54 crew .
As well as those from Britain , the passengers included two Argentines , 10 Australians , two Belgians , 12 Canadians , one Chinese , three Danes , 17 Dutch , one French , one German , two from Hong Kong , four Irish , one Japanese , four Swiss , 14 Americans , one Colombian and one Swede .
A Chilean air force commander , Raul Jorquera , who is based at an airbase on King George Island , said those rescued would be flown to Punta Arenas at the southernmost tip of Chile tomorrow .
The Explorer , built in 1969 , is one of the best - known specialist cruise ships in the world .
It pioneered the tourist market for Antarctic tours , taking in South Atlantic highlights such as the Falkland Islands and South Georgia .
The ship was on a 19 - day circuit of Antarctica and the Falklands that included observing penguins , whales and other regional wildlife .
Its standard two - week trip around the Antarctic costs around £ 4,000 per cabin .
Dubai is popular among tourists and businesses
Fair Trials International said arrests were being made over tiny quantities of drugs and over - the - counter medicines .
British tourist Keith Brown was sentenced to four years in prison after Dubai customs officers found a 0.003g trace of cannabis stuck to his shoe .
Fair Trials , a legal charity , said it has seen a steep rise in such cases .
Golden beaches
Possession of painkillers like codeine and some cold and flu medication could result in a mandatory four - year prison sentence , Fair Trials International said .
In one of the most extreme cases , it reported a man being held after poppy seeds from a bread roll were found on his clothes .
In recent years , chic hotels , skyscrapers and golden beaches have turned Dubai and Abu Dhabi into popular tourist destinations .
Many have no idea what risks they 're taking or their vulnerability to this very strict approach
Catherine Wolthuizen , Fair Trials International chief executive
Businesses too have flocked to the UAE , which promises a high standard of living because of its oil wealth .
However , while it is considered one of the most liberal countries in the Gulf , the Muslim country 's drugs laws are severe .
Last year , 59 Britons were arrested in the UAE on drugs - related charges , according to the Foreign Office .

Catherine Wolthuizen , chief executive of Fair Trials International , said customs authorities were using highly sensitive new equipment to conduct thorough searches on travellers .
" So many people now travel to Dubai and , as we 're seeing , many have no idea what risks they 're taking or their vulnerability to this very strict approach , " she said .
" If they find any amount - no matter how minute - it will be enough to attract a mandatory four - year prison sentence .
" What many travellers may not realise is that they can be deemed to be in possession of such banned substances if they can be detected in their urine or bloodstream , or even in tiny , trace amounts on their person . "
Jet -lag tablets
Keith Brown and his wife had been on their way from London to Ethiopia when they were stopped and searched at Dubai airport .
At first customs officers found nothing , but then a roll - up cigarette was spotted caught in the tread of his shoe .
The 43 - year - old , from Middlesex , was charged with possession of 0.003g of cannabis and was sentenced to four years in prison .
I suppose there 's a sense of disbelief more than anything else
Cat Le-Huy , held in Dubai
British resident Cat Le-Huy was arrested in Dubai for carrying Melatonin jet - lag tablets , which are sold over the counter in the US and Dubai .
Mr Le-Huy told BBC
News he was forced to sign a document in Arabic and was refused a translator .
He said once the tablets were proved to be Melatonin , police took what he described as dirt from his bag and said they were now testing it to see if it was cannabis .
Speaking from inside the prison , he said he knew nothing of any drugs in his bag .
" I suppose there 's a sense of disbelief more than anything else .
I miss my friends and family back in London and I 'm also aware of the other stress this is causing to friends and family .
" As far as my welfare , I 'm being treated relatively well and I have to go through the system and whatever path that takes , I 'll just have to deal with it . "
Bread roll
Aside from illegal substances , travellers have also been held for possession of prescription drugs .
Tracy Wilkinson was held in custody for eight weeks before customs officers accepted the codeine she was carrying had been prescribed by her doctor for back pains .
Meanwhile , a Swiss national is serving a four - year jail term after three poppy seeds from a bread roll he ate at Heathrow airport were found on his clothes .
Fair Trials International has published a full list of banned substances on its website .
The Foreign Office is advising all travellers carrying any prescription drugs to take a doctor 's letter detailing exactly why they need the medicine and the exact dose .
The UAE Embassy in London said it would not comment at this stage .

Once upon a time , the de facto computer interface was the command line .
A prompt with a cursor , and incredible power to take you where you want to go with a few keystrokes .
GUIs evolved to get you where you were going more easily , but the Linux world realized how productive command lines can be , and bash still brings many geeks joy to this day .
The important realization was that for a command line to be productive , it has to have a lot of awesomeness mixed in .
Shortcuts like ~ , - , .. , and things like tab completion take an archaic command line and make it awesome .
The same thing has happened on the web .
At first browsers just had a command line , waiting for you to type http://www.mit.edu/ .
Over time , mouse - oriented navigation became more popular with users .
Still , the original command line approach had a lot of potential , it just needed some more awesome .
The first attempt at an awesome command line was “ Autocomplete ” , which guessed what URL you were typing based on simple prefix matching .
Of course this only works if you know the exact URL you want , and once you ’ve typed enough to uniquely identify it .
The reality is that a lot of users want to search , not type long URLs .
Firefox 2 added better searches to its command line .
By default , if you type in a search term instead of a URL , it acts as an “ I ’m Feeling Lucky ” search .
The location bar input “ ruby ” is a great example of why this is awesome .
In Safari , “ ruby ” goes to Kay Jewelers , via ruby.com .
In Firefox , it goes to the Ruby language website , via Google .
Which did you probably want ?
On top of that , you can easily set up macros called “ keyword searches ” ( ( This is very easy to do .
You right - click on a search field , choose “ Add a keyword for this search ” , type a brief keyword , and voila . ) ) .
I ’ve set up Firefox to accept “ wp Antipode ” as going directly to the wikipedia article on Antipodes , for example .
In the upcoming Firefox 3 , your browser ’s command line finally reaches awesomeness .
They even call it the “ AwesomeBar ” .
As you type , it uses a smart index of your bookmarks and history to give you what you ’re looking for .
It uses titles , URLs , visit frequency , visit recency , and learns from what you click on .
It puts your computer to work for you , like Quicksilver and Spotlight .
In short , it ’s friggin ’ awesome .
With these features , the command line of Firefox 3 makes navigation so much faster and easier , it changes the way I browse .
Meanwhile , Wired ’s Paul Adams , and some in the community , are trying to label this as a misfeature .
He does n’t like that the first time you type “ wir ” you might get history results from thewire .
co.uk as well as wired.com , until you click on wired.com and it learns for next time .
He says , “ it breaks a major commandment of interface design : do n’t radically change the behavior of something everyone ’s used to ” ( ( This has truth to it .
The real commandment is , do not underestimate the high cost of changing the behaviour of something everyone ’s used to .
Make sure if you do so , it ’s awesome .
If Apple followed his version , we ’d have no iPod touch or Mac OS X. ) ) .
I say , suck it up and enjoy the awesomeness .
If you are in doubt about the vehicle with flashing red and blue emergency lights that is attempting to stop you , there are several things you can do :
If in an isolated area , continue to a public place that is well lighted .
While doing this , obey all traffic laws and do not speed up to get there .
If you have a cellular phone , and can use it safely , call the police and let them know that an unmarked vehicle is attempting to stop you .

On the night of July 29 , 2007 , Dibor Roberts , a Senegalese - born American citizen living in Cottonwood , Arizona , was driving home from her job as a nurse 's aide at an assisted living center located in the Village of Oak Creek , an unincorporated community near Sedona .
Along Beaverhead Flat Road , an unlit , unpopulated route through the desert , she suddenly saw flashing lights in her rearview mirror .
Fearful of stopping on a deserted stretch of pavement , especially in light of reports she'd heard of criminals impersonating police , she decided to proceed to a populated area before stopping the car , the nearest such area being Cornville , an unincorporated settlement along the road to Cottonwood .
She slowed her car to acknowledge the flashing lights and continued to drive .
Her decision was n't especially unusual -- in fact , it 's recommended by some police departments .
The Goodyear , Arizona , Police Department offers the following advice on its Website : On Cornville Road , well before the populated area , Sheriff 's Sergeant Jeff Newnum apparently tired of waiting for Roberts to reach a settled area .
While he was , in fact , a police officer , he now proceeded to justify every fear an American may have about rogue cops .
He raced his cruiser in front of Roberts 's car , forcing her off the road .
He then smashed her driver 's - side window with his baton and grabbed a cellphone she was using to check his identity .
Accounts vary at this point .
While police deny it , the press has reported that Newnum dragged Roberts from her vehicle , threw her to the ground , and handcuffed her while driving his knee into her back .
All of this because she was going 15 miles over the speed limit on a deserted rural road .
Roberts 's treatment has been , unsurprisingly , controversial in Arizona 's Verde Valley .
In a sparsely settled area not known for protests of any kind , 30 supporters showed up at her December 31 , 2007 scheduling conference in Judge Janis Sterling 's courtroom in Prescott , the county seat .
This was the second such hearing , since all charges against Roberts had previously been dropped on November 2 , 2007 .
Roberts faces two felonies charges : unlawful flight from a law officer and resisting arrest .
Resisting arrest ?
Well , Sergeant Newnum apparently injured himself while breaking into Roberts 's car .
But Sergeant Newnum does n't stand alone .
Yavapai County Sheriff Steve
Waugh may be many things , but disloyal to his troops is n't one of them .
Amidst mounting protests and public outrage , Waugh held a press conference on January 15 to defend his hot - headed officer 's abuse of a scared woman on a lonely road .
He voiced his full support for Newnum , faulting the sergeant only for cutting off Roberts to force her to the side of the road .
Waugh also implied that Roberts was chemically impaired -- the first time such an allegation has surfaced long months after she was taken into custody , and one that has never surfaced in the form of formal charges .
In other words , smashing Roberts 's car window and dragging her out of a vehicle because he was impatient is A - OK by the good sheriff .
Dibor Roberts now faces felony convictions and prison time all because she was scared by an unexpected confrontation on a dark and deserted road .
As it turned out , she had more reason to be afraid than she knew .
Sergeant Newnum is still roaming the roads of Yavapai County , comfortable in the knowledge that he can abuse innocent people and still enjoy the support of Sheriff Steve Waugh .
And the people of Yavapai County ?
Well , we 're all well - advised to approach any encounter with a Sheriff 's deputy with the idea that we 'll have to fight in self - defense .
Sometimes , vicious thugs do n't impersonate police officers -- theypolice officers .

While thereâ€™s no magic remedy for all our ills , education comes closest to being a panacea , because when you educate , youâ€ ™re crafting the minds that will solve all other challenges .
For example : a dollar spent on education is also a dollar spent on the looming energy crisis .
Teaching cultivates the minds that will one day develop the sustainable , environmentally friendly fuel resources we need to assure the growth of our economy and our independence from unstable foreign suppliers .
A dollar spent on education is a dollar spent on preventing and curing disease , as we develop ever greater knowledge about the causes and treatment of illness and on the steps we can take to live longer , healthier , more productive lives .
Itâ€™s a dollar spent developing the diplomatic skills we need to peacefully navigate our increasingly dangerous world .
A dollar developing the military strategy and technical capability required to the integrity of our national interests .
A dollar spent safeguarding the environment for future generations .
Exploring the mysteries of the solar system and the universe beyond .
A dollar spent on education is a dollar spent shaping the political and economic genius required to innovate solutions to complex problems like immigration .
Cultivating the entrepreneurial foundation for new industries and revitalization in existing ones , assuring that we have ample vocational opportunities here at home .
Itâ€™s a dollar spent creating jobs in America so global corporations arenâ€™t tempted to offshore employment to places like India and China .
Itâ€™s a dollar spent sparking the next golden age of American art and culture .
Literature , dance , music , visual arts â€ “ and on the creation of new art forms that feed the spirit and utilize the new technologies of the brightest society on Earth .
Best of all , a dollar spent on teaching is a dollar spent on learning innovation .
The more we learn , the more we understand how to learn , and as we discover new and better ways to educate , we ensure that our collective learning curve will be ever steeper , providing ever greater rewards .
In other words , when you devote resources to education , youâ€ ™re not spending , youâ€ ™re investing .
The resources you allocate today will generate significant , even massive returns in the future .
In a generation we will be smarter , safer , and healthier , and our world will hopefully be a more peaceful one , ripe with opportunity and possibility .
Our children and grandchildren will look back in gratitude for the commitment we made to their big picture and the patience with which we stayed the course in the only battle that really matters .
There is nothing we cannot learn , and no problem that learning cannot solve , if only weâ€ ™re smart enough and brave enough to bet our futures on the American mind .
After all , it was our intelligence that propelled us to our greatest moments in the past .
Why should tomorrow promise less than yesterday ?
John Yates , the Metropolitan police 's assistant commissioner , has finally admitted what rape survivors have said for years : that " police are contributing to the ' appalling ' conviction rate in rape cases because officers too often fail to take alleged victims seriously enough and settle for mediocrity in their inquiries " ( Rape cases : police admit failing victims , March 4 ) .
Two weeks ago Women Against Rape ( WAR ) held a public trial - The rape of justice : Who 's Guilty ?
- at which 30 women testified .
Among them were the mother of a teenage victim , women raped as children , sex workers , a police employee raped by a colleague , and others whose attacks were recorded as " no crime " .
What emerged was a catalogue of police inefficiency , neglect and hostility : women not believed , evidence - including DNA - lost or uncollected , the investigation of pimps and mobile phone records considered " too expensive " .
In case after case , the women testified , the Crown Prosecution Service had been ill - prepared , inefficient , indifferent or downright unwilling .
The result : violent men are free to attack again .
As late as February 15 Yates , the spokesman on rape for the Association of Chief Police Officers , was still dismissing such refusals of justice as " isolated " ( on the Radio 4 Today programme ) .
Now , you report , he refers to a " proper professional caring service ... available in some parts of the country " .
Where ?
Some of the worst recent complaints are about London 's flagship Sapphire Units , the rape " specialists " .
As addiction specialists say , the first step is admitting you have a problem : a step we have yet to see from the CPS .
The solicitor general , Vera Baird , has only admitted to CPS problems " in the past " .
Now for the second step .
Yates says : " There does n't have to be such an appalling conviction rate .
We can do something about it . "
He suggests that " every area could be encouraged to provide the basic necessities : to do all the medical tests ... "
" Could be encouraged " ?
The sexism in the police is entrenched .
If , as Yates says , forces are " suddenly ' getting it ' " , it is time to move aside those officers at every rank who are , in the words of New York prosecutor Alice Vachss , " collaborators " with rapists .
A petition organised by WAR says : " Police officers , prosecutors and judges who have shown themselves to be sexist , racist , or otherwise prejudiced against victims of sexual violence , or negligent and incompetent in the prosecution of rape cases , should be publicly disciplined , moved off rape cases , or sacked . "
They are paid to enforce the law but instead protect rapists .
Why is this acceptable to the government ?
Many men who get away with rape and domestic violence - Ian Huntley , Anthony Hardy , Levi Bellfield , Pierre Williams - go on to kill women and children .
Unpublished police research shows how often attackers with a record of sexual violence are let go .
( When will this be made public ? )
Two women a week are killed by partners or ex-partners .
John
Yates says we should not have to wait for a " tragic case " before change happens .
But this tragedy has already happened , repeatedly .

Weird Marine Life Antarctica's Deep Sea Menagerie
Move over , Captain Nemo .
Over a mile beneath the icy waters surrounding Antarctica , a team of deep - sea researchers have surfaced some very unusual findings .
THE COLDEST ON RECORD THE COLDEST ON RECORD Average temperatures in the coldest U.S. winters since 1895 , three of which occurred in the 1970s : Degrees Fahrenheit 1978-79 27.28 1935-36 28.62 1898-99 28.76 1909-10 29.07 1904-05 29.48 1928-29 29.63 1977-78 29.69 1916-17 29.92 1917-18 29.92 1911-12 30.25 1976-77 30.66 Source : National Climatic Data Center
The supposed " global cooling " consensus among scientists in the 1970s — frequently offered by global - warming skeptics as proof that climatologists can't make up their minds — is a myth , according to a survey of the scientific literature of the era .
The '70s was an unusually cold decade .
Newsweek , Time , The New York Times and National Geographic published articles at the time speculating on the causes of the unusual cold and about the possibility of a new ice age .
But Thomas Peterson of the National Climatic Data Center surveyed dozens of peer - reviewed scientific articles from 1965 to 1979 and found that only seven supported global cooling , while 44 predicted warming .
Peterson says 20 others were neutral in their assessments of climate trends .
The study reports , " There was no scientific consensus in the 1970s that the Earth was headed into an imminent ice age .
" A review of the literature suggests that , to the contrary , greenhouse warming even then dominated scientists ' thinking about the most important forces shaping Earth 's climate on human time scales . "
" I was surprised that global warming was so dominant in the peer - reviewed literature of the time , " says Peterson , who was also a contributor to the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007 report .
Scientific reports in the past decade , most notably the U.N. panel 's Nobel Prize - winning efforts , have warned that human activities are warming the planet by increasing the release of heat - trapping " greenhouse " gases into the atmosphere .
Skeptics have argued that climate change is cyclical , not fueled by the burning of fossil fuels — coal , oil and natural gas .
Peterson notes in the study that concerns over the frigid 1970s subsequently became representative of scientific division over global warming .
That was an unusually cold decade , especially the later years , across the Northern Hemisphere .
In the USA , the winters of 1977 - 79 were three of the 11 coldest since the recording of temperatures began in the 1890s , according to climate center data .
The winter of 1978 - 79 remains the coldest on record in the USA .
Just as it's hard for people today to think much about global warming in the dead of winter , it was also hard for the public – and the media – to focus on a warming world , while at the same time enduring some of the coldest winters on record .
However , as Peterson notes in the paper , " even cursory review of the news media coverage of the issue reveals that , just as there was no consensus at the time among scientists , so was there also no consensus among journalists . "
Some have doubts about the new survey .
" The paper does not place the late ' 70s in its climatic context , " says Pat Michaels , a senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute in Washington , D.C. " The temperature records we had at the time showed a very sharp cooling from the mid-'40s to the mid-'70s , " Michaels says .
" And scientists attempted to explain that as a consequence of the pollution that was preventing solar radiation from reaching the surface .
" At the time , scientists thought the cooling effect of pollution was greater than the warming effect of carbon dioxide , " Michaels adds .
" They were attempting to explain the dramatic cooling of the ' 70s . "
But Robert Henson , a writer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and author of The Rough Guide to Climate Change , says : " This is an important part of science history , and Peterson and his co-authors have done a great job of excavating it .
" People have long claimed that scientists in the 1970s were convinced a new ice age was imminent .
But in fact , many researchers at the time were already more concerned about the long - term risks of global warming . "
Along with Peterson , the study was also authored written by William Connolly of the British Antarctic Survey and John Fleck of The Albuquerque Journal .
The research will be published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
An analysis of thousands of skulls shows modern humans originated from a single point in Africa and finally lays to rest the idea of multiple origins , British scientists said on Wednesday .
Skeletal remains from the Anne and Bernard Spitzer Hall of Human Origins at the American Museum of Natural History are seen in New York , February 7 , 2007 .
An analysis of thousands of skulls shows modern humans originated from a single point in Africa and finally lays to rest the idea of multiple origins , British scientists said on Wednesday .

Most researchers agree that mankind spread out of Africa starting about 50,000 years ago , quickly establishing Stone Age cultures throughout Europe , Asia and Australia .
But a minority have argued , using skull data , that divergent populations evolved independently in different areas .
The genetic evidence has always strongly supported the single origin theory , and now results from a study of more than 6,000 skulls held around the world in academic collections supports this case .
“ We have combined our genetic data with new measurements of a large sample of skulls to show definitively that modern humans originated from a single area in Sub - Saharan Africa , ” said Andrea Manica of the University of Cambridge ’s Department of Zoology .
Manica and colleagues wrote in the journal Nature that variations in skull size and shape decreased the further a skull was away from Africa , just like variations in DNA .
The decrease reflects the fact that , while the original African population was stable and varied , only a small number of people embarked on each stage of the multi-step migration out of Africa .
This effectively created a series of “ bottlenecks ” , which reduced diversity .
The highest level of variation in skull types was seen in southeastern Africa , the generally accepted cradle of mankind .
The Cambridge work also suggests in - breeding with other early humans , such as Neanderthals , either did not happen or was insignificant .
That is in contrast to recent suggestions that such hybrids may have been fairly common .
“ We ’re not saying there was never a single mating between a homo sapiens and a Neanderthal .
But I can say , very confidently , that whatever the product of that mating was , it did n’t breed back into the population , ” Manica told Reuters .
Chris Stringer , a palaeoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London , said the new research was important for indicating that modern human diversity was derived entirely from Africa rather than coming from inter-mixing elsewhere .
None of this will be written into the history of Afghanistan .
The man with the turban pulling a cart ten times his own size does n't count for much ; neither does the widow sitting in the street with her malnourished babies on display .
These people just live here .
Their children and grandchildren will doubtless give their lives , as have so many before , to fight foreign wars in Afghanistan .
One Afghan legal scholar asked me what the American people thought about Afghanistan .
I said the first thing that came to mind -- Osama bin Laden .
He got a good laugh out of it .
I say they are the de facto government because the combined NGO budget is about ten times that of the Afghan government , and foreign NGO 's have , under the authority of the Bonn Agreement which established the current government here , set up commissions for human rights , judicial , civil service , and constitutional reform .
These high priced consultants , who have no interaction with the common people of Afghanistan , are deeply resented by the common people here , who think they are stealing the international aid money meant for the desperately poor Afghan people .
One professor told me today that the world does not consider Afghan people to be human beings .
The police and military , who earn about $ 40 per month , have not been paid in at least five months , the law professors say .
This does n't bode well for a nation dominated by opium - financed private armies , with an ineffective and distrusted central government .
By comparison , many of the UN and World Bank funded NGO's -- who comprise the de facto government of Afghanistan -- pay their workers between $ 3000 and $ 5000 monthly , easily one hundred times the salary of a law professor , government bureaucrat , or police or military officer .
Today I learned that the law professors at the University of Kabul , who are helping me with my research project , earn between $ 25 to $ 30 per month .
They are not happy about it and realize it 's a low salary .
But they are among the few Afghan government employees who are actually being paid .
Every day I walk through the streets , going whereever I am going , passing by dozens of beggars , some of whom will follow me for blocks , grabbing onto my arm they 'll follow me all across the city until I give them a one Afghan note -- worth two cents -- that 's all they want .
They seem happy with it and run away as if afraid I 'm going to change my mind and take it back .
The results in Afghanistan were no less destabilizing .
While the Afghans may have been liberated from Soviet occupation , instead they suffered fourteen years of civil war .
There is not much to celebrate today , with half the capital , Kabul , in ruins , protected by US and European occupying forces , and warlords with private armies controlling most of the rest of the country .
Twenty four years of war have taken a heavy toll on Afghanistan , a country with no telephone system , few paved roads , an illiterate population , an estimated 5 - 7 million unaccounted - for land mines , and various other problems that rival those of any other place on Earth .
By George Crile , , June 6 2003
In the early summer of 1980 , Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson walked off the floor of the House of Representatives into the Speaker 's Lobby , a rich , wood - paneled room that stretches along the full length of the House floor .
A Teletype at one end spewed out stories from AP , UPI and Reuters .
Wilson was a news junkie , and he reached down and began reading a story datelined from Kabul .
The article described hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing Afghanistan as Soviet helicopter gunships leveled villages , slaughtered livestock , and killed anyone who harbored guerrillas resisting the occupation .
What caught Wilson 's attention , however , was the reporter 's conclusion that the Afghan warriors were refusing to quit .
The article described how they were murdering Russians in the dead of night with knives and pistols , hitting them over the head with shovels and stones .
Against all odds , there was a growing rebellion under way against the Red Army .
It would have been a sobering insight for the Communist rulers if they could have followed what happened in the few minutes after Wilson finished reading the Associated Press dispatch .
The mysterious force in the U.S. government that was destined to hound the Red Army with a seemingly limitless flood of ever more lethal and sophisticated weapons was about to be activated .
No one , however , was paying attention , not even in the American government , when Charlie Wilson picked up a phone and called the Appropriations Committee staffer who dealt with " black appropriations " , the CIA funds .
The man 's name was Jim Van Wagenen , a former college professor and one - time FBI agent .
Wilson had just been named to the Defense Appropriations subcommittee .
He was now part of the band of twelve men in the House responsible for funding CIA operations .
The congressman knew enough about the eccentric workings of the subcommittee to know when a member can act alone to fund a program .
" How much are we giving the Afghans ? " he asked Van Wagenen .
" Five million , " said the staffer .
There was a moment 's silence .
" Double it , " said the Texan .
So far as anyone can tell , no congressman prior to Charlie Wilson had ever moved unsolicited to increase a CIA budget .
From the beginning of the Cold War , Congress had granted that exclusive right to the president .
But as dramatic as the doubling might sound , it had no visible impact on the war .
It was n't reported or debated , and it never even registered on the KGB 's radar screen in Russia .
At best , all it did was provide the mujahideen with a few thousand more Enfield rifles and perhaps some machine guns , so that they could go out and die for their faith in greater numbers .
Wilson 's intervention had not cost the congressman much more than a telephone call to a key staffer and a few additional minutes when the subcommittee met to appropriate the nation 's secret intelligence budget .
It was an impulsive action , a personal gesture to bolster a painfully inadequate U.S. program .
Wilson so easily crossed the line into this covert arena that no one stopped to question his right to be there or worry about the precedent he might be setting .
It would be another two years before he would return to put this precedent to the test .
But this is where he first demonstrated that there could be another power center in the American government , one that could act in a way that was totally unpredictable to drive a U.S. covert policy .
The truth is , there were always two Charlie Wilsons at work in Washington .
But he was moving heaven and earth in those days to allow only one image to surface , and to promote that image so loudly that no one would go looking for the other .
To begin with , he staffed his office almost exclusively with tall , startlingly beautiful women .
They were famous on the Hill , known to all as " Charlie 's Angels " .
And to his colleagues ' amazement , whenever questioned about this practice , Wilson invariably responded with one of his favorite lines : " You can teach them how to type , but you can't teach them to grow tits . "
That was the way he tended to present himself in public , which was tame compared to the way he decorated his condo .
It was almost a caricature of what Hugh Hefner might have designed as the ultimate bachelor 's lair .
Manly hedonism was the theme , down to the last detail : mirrored walls , an emperor 's size bed outfitted with plush down pillows and a royal blue bed cover , an entertainment center featuring a giant television and stereo , and a gleaming tanning bed to maintain his year - round tan .
Finally , the congressman 's most distinctive innovation : the Jacuzzi , not hidden away in the bathroom but so deliberately situated in the center of the bedroom that it forced the unsuspecting eye to draw all the worst possible conclusions about the man who slept in this room .
Particularly when visitors came close and discovered silver handcuffs dangling elegantly from a hook within easy reach of the tub .
The site of these instruments of hedonism invariably left his colleagues and distinguished guests speechless .
It would be an exaggeration to suggest that this was all a false front .
Charlie Wilson , after all , is a bona fide hedonist .
But he is also guilty of concealing his other identity .
It 's only when he 's alone and everyone else is sleeping that the other Charlie Wilson surfaces .
It 's a nightly affair .
Usually at about three or four a .m. he finds himself awake and turns to his library , with its thick volumes of military history .
He 's not like other insomniacs , who simply try to get back to sleep .
He reads like a scholar steeped in his field but also like a man in search of something personal , poring through accounts of the struggles of the world and the men who counted - Roosevelt , Kennedy , and all the great generals .
But invariably , it is to the biographies and speeches and histories of Winston Churchill that Wilson always returns on these night journeys , to read again and again about the man who was cast into the political wilderness , written off as an alcoholic alarmist , and then , when all was lost , rose to the occasion to save his country and his civilization from the darkness of Hitler .
It 's no wonder that Charlie Wilson never shared his sense of personal destiny .
It would n't have made much sense when what he was most noted for at the time was an investigation by a team of federal prosecutors into what precisely he had got up to in the Fantasy Suite hot tub at Caesar 's Palace in Las Vegas with two long - legged showgirls and " an endless supply " of cocaine .
This was not the time even to have whispered of his inner conviction that he and Winston Churchill might have something -- anything -- in common .
Nor did he explain why the painting over his bed , his one steady nightly companion , was like a talisman to him .
The painting -- a lone pilot in the cockpit of a Spitfire , patrolling the night skies of London -- had hung over his boyhood bed in tiny Trinity , Texas , at a time when the Nazis were sweeping across Europe .
Night after night , on the second floor of the white frame house , in the corner room that Charlie shared with his uncle Jack , the boy would sit staring out the window , ever vigilant ; searching the sky for signs of Japanese bombers and fighter planes , whose characteristics were burned upon the memory of this seven - year - old defender of Trinity .
" They are n't coming , Charlie , " his kindly uncle Jack would assure him .
" But if they do , you 'll be the first to see them . "
Peshawar , the capital of Pakistan 's historic North - West Frontier , is the last stop before Afghanistan on the famed Grand Trunk Highway , which originates in New Delhi .
It 's a historic smugglers crossroads , an intrigue - filled city that was home to the British colonial army , which maintained garrisons there and which Rudyard Kipling immortalized in his poems and novels .
By 1982 it had also become the not very secret center of the Afghan resistance .
All the Americans who would later make this passage to Peshawar experienced the same giddy sensation of entering a time warp .
There is a sound in the streets of this city that must be experienced to be understood .
It 's like being inside a beehive -- a whirl of turbans , beards , ox - drawn wagons , brightly painted buses ; motor scooters turned into rickshaws and driven by Pashtun tribesmen .
Every face looks biblical , and everything is in motion on the streets : money changers , rug merchants , horse - drawn carts , men washing their feet and hands at the entrances of mosques , young boys scurrying about with trays of freshly baked Afghan bread and tea .
Peshawar was only thirty miles from the Afghan border and minutes from the sprawling refugee camps .
There were hidden storehouses , and Afghan commanders living behind walled compounds surrounded by armed bodyguards .
This was home to the leaders of the seven mujahideen military parties that the US Central Intelligence Agency and Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence Directorate ( ISI ) had created to organize the war effort .
But no one offered to take Wilson to visit these secret warriors .
He had n't yet earned the right to pass freely into that world .
His schedule on his first trip to Peshawar called for the traditional tour of the U.N. - supported refugee camps , a scene that appalled everyone who came to Peshawar : millions of proud Afghans living in mud huts without running water or the ability to feed themselves .
In the month of his visit twenty thousand more had poured in -- young boys and girls dressed in right tribal clothing ; the women with their faces covered .
They came from the mountains and valleys of a country where their ancestors had lived for centuries , a legendary warrior nation not easy to intimidate and uproot .
All brought horror stories of what had caused them to flee their country .
In particular they talked of helicopter gunships that hovered over their villages , hounding them even as they fled .
It began to dawn on Wilson that there were only Afghans in this part of Pakistan and that he was witnessing an entire nation in flight from the Communists .
This spectacle of mass suffering roused him but he had been to refugee camps before and for him there was something almost impersonal about such a mass of humanity .
What did catch his attention that day was the absence of men -- no teenagers , not even forty or fifty year olds .
He was told they were all fighting in the jihad .
It was at his next stop , the Red Cross hospital on the edge of Peshawar , that he lost his heart to the Afghans .
Scores of young men were laid out on hospital cots .
The doctors sat with Wilson at the bed of a young boy and explained that his hand had been blown off by a Russian butterfly mine designed to look like a toy .
This threw Wilson into a rage .
A young Afghan who had stepped on a land mine explained he was proud of his sacrifice .
" He told me his only regret was that he could n't have his feet grown back so he could go kill Russians . "
Wilson moved from bed to bed , undone by the carnage but increasingly aware why most of them were there .
He spoke to a wounded commander as the effects of an anaesthetic started to kick in .
The man was waving his hand in a circle , speaking in Pashtun , describing the horror of the Russian gunship that had put him there .
Not one of them complained about their lost limbs .
But every one of them described their fury at the Russian gunships .
And to a man , they asked for only one thing -- a weapon to ring down this tool of Satan .
Wilson wanted desperately to give something to these warriors and , before leaving , he donated a pint of his own blood .
His next stop was a meeting with a council of Afghan elders , hundreds of whom were waiting for him in a huge colorful tent , decorated with cotton fabrics that looked like floating Oriental rugs .
As he walked in , Wilson was dazed by the sight of long white beards and turbans , and the men's fierce , unblinking eyes .
The Pakistanis had told them that the congressman had come as a friend offering assistance , and as he entered they shouted , " Allahu Akbar " -- God is Great .
To Wilson it was like a scene out of the Old Testament .
When the elders invited the Texan to speak , he delivered what he thought would be just the right message .
" I told them that they were the most courageous people in the world and I said , ' We 're going to help you .
None of your families will suffer from lack of shelter and food . '
I pledged that their soldiers would not be left to die in agony and that we would give them millions in humanitarian assistance . "
An old man rose to respond .
He told Wilson he could keep his bandages and rice .
What they needed was a weapon to destroy the gunships .
These old men were no different from the young warriors in the hospital .
They were all fixated on the Russian Mi-24 Hind helicopter .
It was at this moment that Charlie Wilson realized he was in the presence of a people who did n't care about sympathy .
They did n't want medicine or charity .
They wanted revenge .
And they got it -- courtesy of Charlie Wilson .
When the last Soviet soldier walked out of Afghanistan on February 15 1989 , there were many who echoed the words of Pakistan 's military leader General Zia ul - Haq : " Charlie did it " .
Not the least of these was the CIA itself , which four years later treated Congressman Wilson to a rare honour inside its headquarters in Langley , Virginia .
On a large screen on the stage of the auditorium was that very quotation , and beneath it the words : " President Zia ul - Haq explaining the defeat of the Russians in Afghanistan . "
Throughout the 1980s the Afghan mujahideen were America 's surrogate soldiers in the brutal guerrilla war that became the Soviet Union 's Vietnam , a defeat that helped trigger the subsequent collapse of the Communist empire .
Afghanistan was a secret war that the CIA fought and won without debates in Congress or protests in the street .
It was not just the CIA 's biggest operation , it was the biggest secret war in history .
In the course of a decade , billions of rounds of ammunition and hundreds of thousands of weapons were smuggled across the border on the backs of camels , mules , and donkeys .
At one point over 300,000 fundamentalist Afghan warriors carried weapons provided by the CIA ; thousands were trained in the art of urban terror .
Before it was over , some 28,000 Soviet soldiers were killed .
It was January of 1989 , just as the Red Army was preparing to withdraw its last soldiers from Afghanistan , when Charlie Wilson called to invite me to join him on a fact - finding tour of the Middle East .
I had produced a CBS 60 Minutes profile of Wilson several months earlier and had no intention of digging further into his role in the Afghan war .
But I quickly accepted the invitation .
The trip began in Kuwait , moved on to Saddam Hussein 's Iraq , and then to Saudi Arabia -- a grand tour that took us to all three of the countries that would soon take center stage in the Gulf War .
For me , the trip was just the beginning of a decade - long odyssey .
There were two surprises on that trip , revelations that opened my eyes to a bigger story : the first was the princely reception given to Wilson wherever he went in the Arab world .
The second was my introduction to Gust Avrakotos , the CIA agent who had worked closely with Wilson ( " As I saw it , " Avrakotos once said , " the tie that bound us together was chasing pussy and killing Communists . " )
Avrakotos recently retired from the Agency and was reunited with his co-conspirator for the first time in several years .
As we moved from Kuwait down to the battlefield of Basra , where hundreds of thousands had died in the closing battles of the Iran - Iraq War , I began talking to Avrakotos , and in short order I realized that the Afghan campaign had been anything but a typical CIA program .
When our commercial flight back to Baghdad was canceled , Avrakotos managed to get us onto a lavish Boeing 707 owned by a Saudi religious leader by telling him about Wilson 's role in the Afghan war .
We shared the flight with a delegation of holy men from the strict Wahhabi sect , some of whom were still sending money and Arab volunteers to the jihad in Afghanistan .
The plane was , in effect , a flying mosque : luxuriously outfitted with solid - gold bathroom fixtures , soft leather seats , and numerous monitors that tracked the direction of Mecca for the plane 's passengers .
In Riyadh , a royal receiving party met us at the airport .
A caravan of brand - new white Mercedes - Benzes , complete with police escort , swept us off to the palace for a meeting with the king 's brother , Saudi defense minister Prince Sultan .
After tea , Wilson delivered his message : he had come to thank the Saudi royal family for its extraordinary generosity in matching the Americans dollar for dollar in Afghanistan .
It became clear that the gratitude went both ways when Wilson was shown to his quarters several hours later -- a preposterously lavish suite with a living room that seemed to be the size of a football field .
" We want you to know , Mr. Congressman , " the prince 's aide said , " that these are larger quarters than we provided for George Bush .
Mr. Bush is only the vice president .
You won the Afghan war . "
Throughout the Muslim world , the victory of the Afghans over the army of a modern superpower was seen as a transformational event .
But back home , no one seemed to be aware that something important had taken place and that the United States had been the moving force behind it .
Any chance of an American appreciation for the Afghan miracle was fast disappearing , as one incredible event after another began to unravel the Soviet eastern bloc .
That August , Lech Walesa and his movement pushed aside the Communists and took power in Poland .
hen in November , the ultimate symbol of Communist oppression , the Berlin Wall , came down .
It was just nine months after the Red Army 's humiliating retreat from Afghanistan , and the dominoes were now falling in central and Eastern Europe .
As Charlie Wilson saw it , his Afghans had played a decisive role in helping to trigger and hasten the collapse of the Communist eastern bloc .
More than a million Afghans had died , and no one had ever thanked them for their sacrifice .
Throughout the war , Wilson had always told his colleagues that Afghanistan was the one morally unambiguous cause that the United States had supported since World War II -- and never once had any member of Congress stood up to protest or question the vast expenditures .
But with the departure of the Soviets , the war was anything but morally unambiguous .
By 1990 the Afghan freedom fighters had suddenly and frighteningly gone back to form , re-emerging as nothing more than feuding warlords obsessed with settling generations - old scores .
The difference was that they were now armed with hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of weapons and explosives of every conceivable type .
The justification for the huge CIA operation had been to halt Soviet aggression , not to take sides in a tribal war -- certainly not to transform the killing capacity of these warriors .
Wilson proposed a billion - dollar U.S. aid package to begin rebuilding Afghanistan and did his best to rally support .
He set off for Moscow to see what could be done to end the surrogate war that continued to rage .
The Russians were pumping an estimated $ 3 billion a year into Afghanistan to prop up the puppet government led by Najibullah , while the CIA , with Saudi matching funds , maintained the enormous flow of weapons to the feuding warlords .
Andre Kozyrev , the future Russian foreign minister , told Charlie that the United States and Russia now had a common interest in stabilizing Afghanistan and particularly in preventing radical Islamic elements from taking power .
The Soviets ' preoccupation , Kozyrev explained , was Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , the mujahideen leader who had so impressed the Afghans ' American champions and whose close ties to Pakistan 's ISI made him the leading recipient of CIA weaponry .
Kozyrev insisted that Gulbuddin 's brand of militant Islam was just as dangerous to America as it was to the Soviet Union -- a point Charlie had heard frequently that year from his own side .
What struck Wilson most on his visit was not Kozyrev 's reasoned appeal , but the discovery that , whatever the sins of the Communist regime , the people of Russia had been liberated .
He witnessed the explosion of religious faith after years of repression , and he attended a daring production of the musical Hair in the union hall of a cigarette factory .
But everywhere , the scarcity of consumer goods shocked and saddened him .
This , he realized , was a defeated nation .
In the second year after the Soviet withdrawal , Wilson delivered another $ 250 million for the CIA to keep its Afghan program intact .
With Saudi matching funds , the mujahideen would receive another half a billion dollars to wage war .
The expectation was that they would join forces for a final push to throw out the Soviet - backed Najibullah regime , restore order , and begin the process of rebuilding .
The Agency even sent word to Wilson that as an act of gratitude for the renewed budget , the mujahideen planned to take Jalalabad by June 1 , Charlie 's birthday .
It did n't happen .
Instead the Najibullah forces held , as the Afghans bickered and disgraced themselves by massacring prisoners .
That year , Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait ; adding insult to injury , Gulbuddin and Abu Sayaf -- the mujahideen leader closest to the Saudis -- both publicly sided with Saddam Hussein against the United States .
Their subsidies , however , continued .
With the news from Afghanistan growing darker , Charlie escaped so deep into drink that he began attending sessions of the congressional chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous .
At best he was operating on automatic pilot , rarely attending the special briefings the Agency put on for him and refusing to meet with the mujahideen when they came to Washington .
It was almost as if he did n't want to see or hear what was happening to his old freedom fighters .
Finally , on April Fools ' Day , 1991 , there was good news from the front -- very good news .
Wilson learned that his favorite commander , Jalaluddin Haqani , had " liberated " Khost .
The first major Afghan city was now in the hands of the freedom fighters , and it was in no small measure due to the introduction of a series of lethal new weaponry provided by Wilson .
Soon after , I accompanied Wilson 's administrative assistant , Charlie Schnabel , to meet up with Haqani and take stock of how the mujahideen were conducting themselves as they began to reclaim their country .
The stories we heard once we reached Pakistan were alarming .
The mujahideen were hijacking the US AID trucks , making regular runs impossible .
At Friday prayers , the mullahs were inflaming their followers with accounts of Western NGO volunteers teaching Afghan women to wash with soap .
An enraged mob had marched on the facility that provided free health care to women , now convinced that the clinic was promoting free sex .
They burned the facility to the ground and trashed seventeen cars -- $ 1.8 million in damage in just one day .
Afghan women working in refugee camps as teachers and nurses were threatened ; one had just been kidnapped and murdered .
In Peshawar , the American consul relayed a particularly horrific account of one of Gulbuddin 's many outrages .
A few months earlier he had sought to " liberate " Khost by shelling the civilian population of the city .
Khost was like a ghost town when we arrived .
The bazaar , which had been full just days before , was empty .
Everyone had fled the liberators .
Nothing moved except armed mujahideen soldiers .
Many of the warriors were said to be radical Arabs who had come to get in on the jihad .
There was little sign of life and few prospects of people returning anytime soon .
Instead of devoting its energies to rebuilding Afghanistan , as they had hoped , the State Department 's Cross Border Humanitarian Aid Program found itself following the liberators in a desperate attempt to persuade them not to murder and pillage .
None of this attracted any real attention in the world press , which had either forgotten about or lost interest in Afghanistan -- in spite of the fact that the CIA and KGB were continuing to mount the largest covert Cold War battle in history .
For all practical purposes , the Cold War was over , and it seemed as if the United States and Russia had come to share roughly the same long - term goals in Afghanistan .
The only logical explanation for why the two superpowers were now funding this mysterious war of the tribes was the force of inertia .
Simply put , neither side wanted to be the first to pull back .
It was almost unthinkable , but Ambassador Robert Oakley now wondered if the US - backed Afghans , no longer menaced by the Red Army , were any different from the Afghans whom the Russians were backing .
In fact , it was the leaders of the Afghan puppet government who were saying all the right things , even paying lip service to democratic change .
The mujahideen , on the other hand , were committing unspeakable atrocities and could n't even put aside their bickering and murderous thoughts long enough to capture Kabul .
Oakley kept coming upon the same signpost " What 's a nice group of kids like us doing in a place like this ? "
Without the Russians around , did we really want to be giving long - range Stingers , satellite - guided mortars , burst transmitters , and hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of ordnance to these men ?
Wilson was surprised that spring to hear that the administration was not putting in a request for more money .
There had been meetings in Wilson 's office and talks with Judge William Webster , the new director of Central Intelligence , about the coming year 's budget , but the Agency was no longer of a single mind .
The Bush administration , however , wanted out of this game -- so the CIA 's seventh floor had no choice but to reflect the opinion of their masters in the White House .
With no request for funds , the Senate Select Committee met and reported out a bill with nothing in it for Afghanistan .
On September 30 , 1991 , the end of the fiscal year , the flow of weapons , ammunition , and supplies that the mujahideen had so dearly loved would stop .
But for Charlie Wilson , there was something fundamentally wrong with his war ending then and there .
He did n't like the idea of the United States going out with a whimper .
The president might want to end the war , but it was n't his war to end .
It had always been Congress 's war , and just because there was disarray at the CIA did n't mean Congress should step back .
That was the essence of the appeal Wilson made to his highly reluctant colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee when they met to consider the annual budget .
Incredibly , he carried the day .
No one knew how to say no to Charlie .
" Where will we get the money ? " the chairman of the Intelligence Committee asked .
" It does n't matter , " Wilson said in his most selfless tone .
" Take it from a Texas defense contract .
Whatever .
The main thing is : this body should not be cutting off the mujahideen . "
" Well , shit .
How about $ 25 million ? " asked the chairman , meaning $ 25 million per quarter , $ 100 million for the year .
" How about $ 50 million ? " Wilson responded .
And $ 50 million a quarter is what they ultimately agreed on .
With the Saudi contribution , that meant another $ 400 million for the mujahideen .
It was only the beginning of the extraordinary maneuvers Wilson had to make to push this bill through a highly reluctant Congress .
By then even his most reliable ally , John Murtha , the chairman of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee , wanted to end the CIA program .
Murtha was appalled at reports of the mujahideen 's drug trafficking , but in the end he stood with Charlie , and his support guaranteed the bill 's passage in the House .
It was passed in the Senate that fall .
The secret appropriation was hidden in the $ 298 billion Defense bill for fiscal year 1992 .
When it was presented for a vote , no one but the interested few noticed the $ 200 million earmarked for the Afghans .
And so , as the mujahideen were poised for their thirteenth year of war , instead of being cut off ; it turned out to be a banner year .
They found themselves with not only a $ 400 million budget but also with a cornucopia of new weaponry sources that opened up when the United States decided to send the Iraqi weapons captured during the Gulf War to the mujahideen .
However disgraceful the mujahideen 's conduct was in the following months , in April 1992 they managed to stop fighting one another long enough to take Kabul .
Once again Charlie felt vindicated .
He had stayed the course and allowed the victory that belonged to the Afghans to occur .
But then everything became ugly .
By August , the interim foreign minister , Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , was outside of the capital , with his artillery shelling the positions of his former comrade in arms , the interim defense minister Ahmad Shah Massoud .
Kabul , which had survived the entire Afghan war relatively intact , was suddenly subjected to intense urban warfare .
Before it was over , close to 40 percent of the housing was destroyed ; the art museum was leveled ; the palace ravaged .
Under normal circumstances , such misuse of American resources should have led to a scandal or at least entered the American consciousness as an issue of concern .
But the anarchy in Kabul was completely overshadowed by the historic events sweeping the world .
In December 1991 , the Soviet Union ceased to exist .
Everywhere across the twelve time zones of the former Soviet Union , statues of Lenin were coming down and freedom was breaking out in a Russia reborn .
People were now referring to the United States as the world 's lone superpower .
For the men who ruled the CIA , Afghanistan was acknowledged as the main catalyst that helped trigger these historic changes .
Flush with the glory of tumbling dominoes and convinced that the Afghan campaign had been the key to it all , the Directorate of Operations led a ceremony on a sunny humid June day in 1993 to recognize the man who had made it possible .
Without Charlie Wilson , Director Woolsey said in his comments , " History might have been hugely different and sadly different " .
It was n't the parade that Charlie had sought , but then no other member of Congress , indeed no outsider , had ever been singled out by the CIA for such an accomplishment .
If that 's where it all had ended for Charlie Wilson -- standing tall at the CIA 's Langley headquarters that day with the fear of nuclear war fast receding and America now the world 's only superpower - then it truly would have been a Cold War fairy tale come true .
But that 's not the way history works .
Inevitably , great events have unintended consequences .
What no one involved anticipated was that it might be dangerous to awaken the dormant dreams and visions of Islam .
Which is , of course , exactly what happened .
There were many early warnings well before Charlie 's award at Langley .
In January of that year , a young Pakistani , Mir Aimal Kasi , walked down the line of cars at the gates of the CIA and calmly murdered two officers before escaping to Pakistan where he was embraced as a folk hero .
A month later a bomb went off in the car park of the World Trade Center .
What emerged from the smoke was a clear indication that some of the veterans of the Afghan campaign now identified America as their enemy .
As early as a year before at Khost , a haunting portrait of the future was already in place : battle - hardened Afghan mujahideen , armed to the teeth and broken down into rival factions -- one of the largest being a collection of Arab and Muslim volunteers from around the world .
Pakistan 's former intelligence chief , Hamid Gul , maintains that over the course of the jihad , up to thirty thousand volunteers from other countries had come into Pakistan to take part in the holy war .
What now seems clear is that , under the umbrella of the CIA 's program , Afghanistan had become a gathering place for militant Muslims from around the world , a virtual Mecca for radical Islamists .
As early as the Gulf War , Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , long the main recipient of CIA weaponry , had articulated his belief that the United States was seeking world domination and control of Muslim oil .
The man Charlie once described as " goodness personified , " Jalaluddin Haqani , had long been a gateway for Saudi volunteers , and for years the CIA had no problem with such associations .
Osama bin Laden was one of those volunteers who could frequently be found in the same area where Charlie had been Haqani 's honored guest .
As the CIA 's favorite commander , Haqani had received bags of money each month from the station in Islamabad .
The presumption at Langley had been that when the United States packed its bags and cut off the Afghans , the jihad would simply burn itself out .
If the Afghans insisted on killing one another , it would be a shame but not America 's problem .
Perhaps that policy would have worked out had it been only weapons that we left behind .
But the more dangerous legacy of the Afghan war is found in the minds and convictions of Muslims around the world .
To them the miracle victory over the Soviets was all the work of Allah -- not the billions of dollars that America and Saudi Arabia poured into the battle , not the ten - year commitment of the CIA that turned an army of primitive tribesmen into technoholy warriors .
The consequence for America of having waged a secret war and never acknowledging or advertising its role was that we set in motion the s pirit of jihad and the belief in our surrogate soldiers that , having brought down one superpower , they could just as easily take on another .
The morning of September 11 , 2001 , broke bright and shining in the nation 's capital .
As was his custom before leaving for work , Charlie Wilson walked out on to his terrace to take in the spectacular view .
Never in history had a nation accumulated such dominance over the rest of the world as the United States had in the decade following the Soviet collapse .
Wilson 's name was all but unknown to most Americans , but as he looked out over the monuments and the historic houses of government , he had every reason to believe that he had played a part in the startling disappearance of America 's greatest enemy .
A call from a friend interrupted his morning ritual : " Do you have your television on ? "
The sight of the World Trade Center in flames stunned him , but like most Americans , he assumed it had to have been a horrendous accident .
Some ten minutes later he was watching when the second plane appeared on screen and flew straight into the second tower .
A sickening realization gripped him : it had to be the work of terrorists , and , if so , he had little doubt that the killers were Muslims .
" I did n't know what to think , but figured if I got downtown I could learn more . "
By then Wilson had retired from Congress and was working as a lobbyist , with Pakistan as one of his main accounts .
At 9:43 am , half an hour after the first attack , he was driving across the Fourteenth Street Bridge with the windows up and news radio blasting so loud that he did n't hear the explosion that rocked the Pentagon less than a mile away .
For five straight nights he watched , until the fires were finally put down and the smoke cleared .
He did n't know what to make of it all at first .
When the photographs of the nineteen hijackers appeared in n ewspapers across the country , he took some comfort in pointing out that they were all Arabs , not Afghans .
" It did n't register with me for a week or two that this thing was all based in my mountains . "
For most Americans , the events of 9/11 were quickly tied to Afghanistan when it was learned that the hijackers had all spent time there .
Much was made of this by the Bush administration , which assailed the Taliban for harboring Osama bin Laden and for allowing Afghanistan to become a breeding ground for international terrorists .
The American public rallied behind the president when he launched his " war on terror " .
But almost everyone seemed confused about who the terrorists were , and all but clueless to explain why they hated the United States so much .
The question is not so difficult to understand if you put yourself in the shoes of the Afghan veterans in the aftermath of the Soviet departure .
Within months , the U.S. government " discovered " what it had known for the past eight years -- that Pakistan was hard at work on the Islamic bomb .
( The dirty little secret of the Afghan war was that Zia had extracted a concession early on from Reagan : Pakistan would work with the CIA against the Soviets in Afghanistan , and in return the United States would provide massive aid but would agree to look the other way on the question of the bomb . )
But with the Russians gone , sanctions were imposed and all military and economic assistance was cut off .
A fleet of F - 16s that Pakistan had already purchased was withheld .
Within a year , the Clinton Administration would move to place Pakistan on the list of state sponsors of terrorism for its support of Kashmiri freedom fighters .
The Pakistan military had long been the surrogates for the CIA , and every Afghan and Arab mujahid came to believe that America had betrayed the Pakistanis .
And when the United States kept its troops ( including large numbers of women ) in Saudi Arabia , not just bin Laden but most Islamists believed that America wanted to seize the Islamic oil fields and was seeking world domination .
By the end of 1993 , in Afghanistan itself there were no roads , no schools , just a destroyed country -- and the United States was washing its hands of any responsibility .
It was in this vacuum that the Taliban and Osama bin Laden would emerge as the dominant players .
It is ironic that a man who had had almost nothing to do with the victory over the Red Army , Osama bin Laden , would come to personify the power of the jihad .
In 1998 , when bin Laden survived $ 100 million worth of cruise missiles targeted at him , it reinforced the belief that Allah had chosen to protect him against the infidels .
It 's not what Charlie Wilson had in mind when he took up the cause of the Afghans .
Nevertheless , in spite of 9/11 and all the horrors that have flowed from it , he steadfastly maintains that it was all worth it and that nothing can diminish what the Afghans accomplished for America and the world with their defeat of the Red Army : " I truly believe that this caused the Berlin Wall to come down a good five , maybe ten , years before it would have otherwise .
Over a million Russian Jews got their freedom and left for Israel ; God knows how many were freed from the gulags .
At least a hundred million Eastern Europeans are breathing free today , to say nothing of the Russian people .
It 's the truth , and all those people who are enjoying those freedoms have no idea of the part played by a million Afghan ghosts .
To this day no one has ever thanked them .
" They removed the threat we all went to sleep with every night , of World War III breaking out .
The countries that used to be in the Warsaw Pact are now in NATO .
These were truly changes of biblical proportion , and the effect the jihad had in accelerating these events is nothing short of miraculous .
" These things happened .
They were glorious and they changed the world .
And the people who deserved the credit are the ones who made the sacrifice .
And then we fucked up the endgame . "
The story of Charlie Wilson and the CIA 's secret war in Afghanistan is an important , missing chapter of our recent past .
Ironically , neither the United States government nor the forces of Islam will want this history to be known .
But the full story of America 's central role in the Afghan jihad needs to be told and understood for any number of reasons .
Clearly it 's not helpful for the world of militant Islam to believe that its power is so great that nothing can stop it .
But the danger exists for us as well .
It may not be welcomed by a government that prefers to see the rising tide of Islamic militancy as having no connection to our policies or our actions .
But the terrible truth is that the group of sleeping lions that the United States roused may well have inspired an entire generation of militant young Muslims to believe that the moment is theirs .

In this case the ' ' values ' ' part is pretty easy : the board typically has a fiduciary responsibility to hire the candidate who will maximize the value of the corporation 's shares .
The question is , which of the available candidates will best accomplish this goal ?
Mr. Hanson proposes using financial markets to answer this question .
The key is to create a derivative security whose value depends on who becomes chief executive .
Suppose there are two candidates , Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones .
The board creates two stock options , one that will deliver one share of company stock if Ms. Jones becomes chief executive , and one that will deliver one share if Mr. Smith gets the job .
They also create two '' money options ' ' ; one delivers one dollar if Mr. Smith becomes chief executive , while the other delivers one dollar if Ms. Jones does .
In a well - functioning speculative market , the Jones money option should sell for a price that is roughly equal to the probability that Ms. Jones will be chosen .
The Jones stock option , on the other hand , should sell for the value of one share of stock if Ms. Jones becomes chief executive , times the probability that Ms. Jones will be chosen .
The ratio of the stock option to the money option should therefore give the value of the company 's stock if Ms. Jones is picked .
Every M.B.A. student is told to '' make choices that maximize shareholder value . ''
What could be a better way to do this than to let shareholders determine the value of each alternative directly ?
The argument above is the simplest account , but one can develop more sophisticated arguments that give essentially the same outcome .
Once you get the idea , the possibilities are endless .
Suppose a company is trying to choose between ad agencies .
The board can simply create an option that pays off in shares conditional on which one is chosen , along with the appropriate money options .
Demario James Atwater By Sara D. Davis , AP HILLSBOROUGH , N.C ( AP ) 
The second suspect charged with murdering the University of North Carolina student body president surrendered peacefully to police early Thursday , authorities said .
Lawrence Alvin Lovette Jr. , 17 , was arrested by Durham patrol and SWAT officers several hours after they surrounded a home where he was hiding , said Durham police Lt. Robert McLaughlin Jr. Authorities had received an anonymous tip that Lovette was in the house , McLaughlin said .

Two charged with killing high - achieving woman Lovette remained in Durham police custody Thursday morning , said Chapel Hill police Lt. Kevin Gunter .
It was n't clear when he would be transferred to their custody or make an initial appearance on the murder charge , he said .
Lovette and Demario James Atwater , 21 , of Durham , are both charged with first - degree murder in Eve Carson 's death .
The 22 - year - old from Athens , Ga. , was found lying on a street about a mile from the Chapel Hill campus on March 5 .
She had been shot several times , including once in the right temple .
Atwater was arrested early Wednesday as he left another home in Durham that police had placed under surveillance after receiving a tip .
He later made an initial court appearance in Hillsborough .
Shackled at the ankles and waist , and with a public defender at his side , Atwater only whispered " yes " when asked if he understood the charges against him .
He appeared to have a wound and a bruise on his right cheek at his court appearance .
Chapel Hill Police Chief Brian Curran said officers had taken him to a hospital as " part of the evidence collection " process .
Atwater was ordered held without bond on a charge of first - degree murder .
His next court date was set for March 24 .
" I hope the arrest can ease the minds of some in the community , " Orange County District Attorney Jim Woodall said .
Curran would not say Wednesday which suspect detectives believe shot and killed Carson .
State records indicate both suspects are currently on parole .
Lovette was given a suspended sentenced in January for misdemeanor larceny and breaking and entering .
Atwater was convicted of felony breaking and entering in 2005 and illegal possession of a firearm in 2007 .
He also received a suspended sentence .
Messages left with the Orange County public defender 's office Wednesday were not returned .
In the days after Carson 's death , police focused their investigation on several ATM and convenience store surveillance photos .
Police believe Lovette was pictured in two photos taken at an ATM machine , driving Carson 's Toyota Highlander with Atwater in the back seat .
Police also believe Atwater was the suspect shown trying to use Carson 's ATM card inside a convenience store .
Curran has previously declined to say when the surveillance photos were taken or the exact location of the ATM machine and convenience store , or if any money was successfully withdrawn from Carson 's account .
Carson was a Morehead - Cain scholar at North Carolina .
The university said Wednesday a third memorial service will be held next week at the Smith Center , the school 's basketball arena .
" Our interests are in seeing justice served and helping our community during this difficult time , " university Chancellor James Moeser said in a statement .
" We are thankful for all of the expressions of support pouring in for the Carolina family and our local community in these past few days .
Those kind thoughts and prayers for Eve Carson 's family and our community have made a difference . "

I personally do n’t have any tattoos .
I just have n’t found that one piece of art that I can live with for the rest of my life .
I do appreciate them however .
So I decided to look for people who were passionate enough about anatomy to actually have a piece tattooed on themselves .
Here are some of the interesting specimens I found .
Enjoy !
It would have been nice to have had the brachial plexus tattooed on my body for those difficult anatomy exams .
Or my arm musculature …

The 18,000 - year - old remains were found in this cave
An Australian team claims the little people were not a new human species , but modern humans with a form of dwarfism caused by poor nutrition .
In 2004 , international researchers announced the discovery of the ancient remains in the Liang Bua Cave .
There has been debate since then over whether the bones are from diseased humans or a new human " cousin " .
The latest theory , published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B , claims the Hobbits were true humans , but did not grow to normal size because of environmental factors .
The conclusions in this paper are not supported by the facts
Professor Peter Brown
Dr Peter Obendorf from the School of Applied Science at RMIT University , Melbourne , and colleagues , believe the little people developed a dwarfism condition because of severe nutritional deficiencies .
Environmental link
Severe iodine deficiency in pregnancy can cause people to grow little more than a metre tall with bone characteristics very similar to those of the Flores hobbits , said Dr Obendorf .
The hobbit skull ( left ) compared with a modern human
He added : " Our research suggests that these fossils are not a new species but rather the remains of human hunter - gatherers that suffered from this condition . "
They came to this conclusion after studying images of skulls of the Flores fossils .
Anatomical features were compared with museum specimens of humans suffering from a condition known as congenital hypothyroidism .
The Australian group did not examine the original fossils .
The hypothesis has been described as " sheer speculation " by some experts , including Professor Peter Brown of the University of New England in Armidale , Australia , one of the original members of the team that discovered the remains .
" The conclusions in this paper are not supported by the facts , " he said .
" The authors have not examined the original fossil , have little and no experience with fossil hominids and depend upon data obtained by others . "
Genetic clue
Dr Jeremy Austin , deputy director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at Adelaide University , said genetic data might provide the " casting vote " in the debate .
It would clarify the evolutionary relationship between the Hobbit ( Homo floresiensis ) and modern humans , he said .
Genetic data has not been forthcoming so far , he admitted , mainly due to poor preservation of the Liang Bua material and extensive contamination by modern human DNA of material recovered from the site .
" Collection of fresh , better preserved , Hobbit remains using strict anti-contamination measures currently is the best hope for testing the status of Homo floresiensis using genetic data , " said Dr Austin .
The little people were nicknamed Hobbits after the fictional creatures in the writings of JRR Tolkien .
They were about a metre tall , with a brain about the size of a chimpanzee's .
Amid all the media - generated hype surrounding John McCain ’s narrow victory in the South Carolina primary  which portrays him rising , phoenix - like , from the ashes of what many considered a failed last hurrah  one anomaly stands out : he did well among antiwar voters .
This seems counterintuitive , at first , especially when one considers that McCain is the candidate of the so - called " surge " and has always been among the biggest warmongers on the block  not only when it comes to Iraq , but even regarding interventions that Republicans opposed , such as in Kosovo .
In that case , you ’ll recall , he urged the Clinton administration to launch a land invasion of the former Yugoslavia : just Google McCain and " boots on the ground , " and you ’ll come up with the one underlying consistent theme of McCain ’s life as a public figure  he always takes the most belligerent foreign policy stance imaginable , no matter what the context .
Iraq war I , the Balkans , Iraq war II , and even when it comes to developing tensions with Russia  here is a U.S. senator who traveled all the way to the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia to personally intervene in the Georgian - Russian dispute over the status of South Ossetia .
Not one inch of sovereign Georgian soil shall be ceded to the Russians , he declared , or words to that effect .
One would have thought the fate of the Free World depended on stopping the South Ossetians from gaining autonomy over their own affairs .
Yet it would be hard to imagine a conflict in which the U.S. has less interest in taking sides .
Part of it was no doubt due to the fact that McCain loves to posture and preen , and this was an opportunity he could hardly resist .
Yet such unseemly  and foolhardy  posturing is n’t just a function of his blustering , overbearing personality : it ’s a matter of ideology , too .
In the McCainiac worldview , there is no corner of the globe that would n’t benefit from American boots on the ground .
If you liked President Bush ’s infamous " fire in the mind " second inaugural address , in which he averred that the proper objective of U.S. foreign policy is " ending tyranny in our world , " then you ’ll love President McCain ’s world - saving neo-Wilsonianism .
Matthew Yglesias , writing on his Atlantic blog , succinctly summarizes the McCainiac mentality when it comes to foreign policy issues :
" For McCain , a certain culture of honor , militarism , and nationalism are their own reward .
The military is to be celebrated and supported not for what it does but for what it is .
Thus , a given military venture does n’t need to have a real purpose or be ‘ worth it ’ in any particular sense .
It is what it is , and what we need to do is keep on doing it for as long as ‘ it ’ takes and it does n’t matter if ‘ it ’ is pointless or futile or even if ‘ it ’ is n’t anything in particular at all .
The war is its own rationale . "
This is really the essence of militarism that Yglesias is describing : an ideological commitment to war as an end in itself , if not a virtuous act then a condition  perhaps the only condition  under which it is possible to demonstrate one ’s commitment to the highest values .
Honor , duty , country , sacrifice  these are the words that are used to evoke and rationalize McCainian militarism .
Yet there is no honor in a foreign policy based on axiomatic aggressiveness .
There is no " duty " to pursue a policy that neither benefits this country , nor those we are ostensibly " liberating , " especially when what is being sacrificed , in the bargain , is the economic and moral health of our republic .
Support for McCain among those who oppose the war is explained by the way the candidate frames his support for the surge in terms of opposing the policies of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld  not because Rummy was the face and voice of the War Party , with his infamous arrogance and inability to concede error , but because he was n’t warlike enough for McCain ’s taste .
In addition , the revival of McCain ’s formerly moribund presidential ambitions has occurred in the context of a curious development : the war has been practically banished as an issue from the primary horse race in both parties .
This has happened , in part , because we ’re told the " surge " has succeeded , but the reality is quite different .
As Andrew Bacevich pointed out recently , the great bonanza that was supposed to follow from the " liberation " of Iraq never materialized .
Quite the contrary :
" A nation - building project launched in the confident expectation that the United States would repeat in Iraq the successes it had achieved in Germany and Japan after 1945 instead compares unfavorably with the U.S. response to Hurricane Katrina . "
Yet the surge has achieved its real objective , which has everything to do with winning the battle for hearts and minds on the home front :
" In only one respect has the surge achieved undeniable success :
It has ensured that U.S. troops wo n’t be coming home anytime soon .
This was one of the main points of the exercise in the first place .
As AEI military analyst Thomas Donnelly has acknowledged with admirable candor , ‘ part of the purpose of the surge was to redefine the Washington narrative , ’ thereby deflecting calls for a complete withdrawal of U.S. combat forces . "
The Bushies know that if they hand off the war to McCain , he ’ll continue and even escalate their policy of confrontation and conquest .
That ’s why he seems to have been anointed by the party establishment as the only viable alternative to Mike Huckabee , whose cornpone populism and outsider status make him anathema to the GOP powers - that - be .
The myth of the surge ’s success is part of the mainstream media ’s narrative of McCain ’s redemption .
He ’s always played to journalists and counted on getting a pass from them , and they stand starry - eyed before his stagy self - regard .
Yet what is it about our ongoing occupation of Iraq  which McCain wants to extend for 100 years  that can rightly be deemed a " success " ?
The country , you ’ll recall , was supposed to be a " model " for other Muslim nations in the region to follow ; its ‘ liberation " was supposed to augur seismic ideological and political changes in the Muslim world and ignite a rebellion against the fanatic authoritarianism of the jihadists .
In reality , it did no such thing .
Bacevich trenchantly argues that the surge advocates confuse the success of a tactic  that is , a temporary maneuver  with confirmation of the War Party ’s strategy .
American casualties may be down , but we are farther away than ever from achieving our announced strategic objectives in Iraq and the region .
The occupation of Iraq is a recruiting bonanza for al - Qaeda and a growing drain on our military and financial resources .
The " global democratic revolution , " whose banner Bush took up in a speech to the National Endowment for Democracy as well as his second inaugural , has not only been delayed , it has been betrayed .
The " democratic " government of Iraq is a regime notorious for its pandemic corruption , its promotion of religious sectarianism , and its rampaging death squads .
With " success " like this , who needs failure ?
Yet , as Bacevich correctly maintains , the " surge " is all about domestic politics  building a pro-war consensus in Washington , rather than nation - building in Iraq  and on that front it has succeeded admirably .
The last sparks of organized antiwar sentiment in the Democratic Party will be stamped out with the defeat of Barack Obama ’s campaign and the final triumph of the old Clinton machine , ensuring that no major party candidate for the White House will represent the majority view of the American people , which is that we ought to get out of Iraq pronto .
We ’ll be faced with a choice between John " One Hundred Years of War " McCain and an increasingly hawkish Hillary Clinton , who has never advocated getting out of Iraq and surely wo n’t start if and when she emerges as her party ’s nominee .
The War Party wins , not by winning the debate but by ensuring that no debate on the war  and our foreign policy of " preemptive " aggression  ever takes place .
Furthermore , as the Democrats fight among themselves over identity politics , a conflict rooted in issues of race , gender , and the personalities of the candidates , the McCain " surge " threatens us with a continuation of Bushism without Bush .
America , a deeply racist country , is not going to put a black man in the White House any time soon ; a woman , too , faces an uphill battle .
We may get McCain by default  and that , in many ways , would be the worst of all possible worlds .
Of all the candidates , only Rudy Giuliani would arguably be more of a catastrophe for the peace of the world .
Fortunately , Rudy ’s natural cowardice forced him to flee the Iowa battlefield , and his $ 2 million spent in New Hampshire , along with many days of personal campaigning , was all for naught ; Ron Paul , the antiwar Republican , has consistently beaten him , most recently in Nevada and South Carolina .
President John McCain  if the prospect does n’t scare you , then it ought to .
Unconstrained by either common sense or Congress , McCain ’s volcanic temper and crusading temperament will soon have us embroiled in multiple conflicts , and not only in the Middle East .

Oh , it brings such blessed relief and now scientists can tell you why -- scratching an itch temporarily shuts off areas in the brain linked with unpleasant feelings and memories .
A visitor walks past a billboard during the third - day of the India fashion week Autumn / Winter 2007 in New Delhi March 23 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Parth Sanyal
“ Our study shows for the first time how scratching may relieve itch , ” Dr. Gil Yosipovitch , a dermatologist at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston - Salem , North Carolina , said in a statement .
Prior studies have shown that pain , including vigorous scratching , inhibit the need to itch .
Yosipovitch and colleagues looked at what goes on in the brain when a person is scratched .
He and colleagues used a technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging to see which areas of the brain are active during scratching .
They scratched 13 healthy people with a soft brush on the lower leg on and off in 30 - second intervals for a total of five minutes .
Scratching reduced activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex -- areas linked with pain aversion and memory .
And the more intensely a person was scratched , the less activity they found in these areas of the brain .
“ It ’s possible that scratching may suppress the emotional components of itch and bring about relief , ” Yosipovitch said .
But they also found why one scratch often begets another .
Scratching increased activity in the secondary somatosensory cortex , a pain center , and in the prefrontal cortex , which is linked with compulsive behavior .
“ This could explain the compulsion to continue scratching , ” Yosipovitch said .
The researchers noted that the study is limited because people were not scratching in response to an actual itch .
But they said understanding what goes on in the brain may lend clues about how to treat people tormented by chronic itch , including people with eczema and many kidney dialysis patients .
The study , which appears online in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology , was paid for by the National Institutes of Health .
Condoms in the Irish Republic are among the most expensive in Europe
Finance Minister Brian Cowen announced the move after pressure from safe sex and crisis pregnancy campaigners .
This reduction should see the price of a 12 pack reduced from 13.20 euro to 12.40 euro and a pack of three condoms down from 4.20 euro to 3.94 euro .
The move has been welcomed by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency .
The agency is the state body responsible for reducing crisis pregnancy in Ireland .
Agency director Caroline Spillane said condoms in Ireland were among the most expensive in Europe and were not free under the medical card scheme .
" In December , the agency submitted a policy paper to the Department of Finance which presented a strong health - related argument for the reduction of VAT on condoms , " she said .
" The Irish Study of Sexual Health and Relationships ( 2006 ) , a nationally representative study , found that one in five people aged between 18 - 24 say that the cost of condoms would discourage their use of them . "
The Irish Pharmaceutical Union ( IPU ) also supported the measure saying the VAT reduction from 21 % to 13.5 % would make condoms more affordable .
" We would now call on the government to reduce the VAT rate on all medicines that are taxed at the rate of 21 % .
These are not luxuries , " said union president Darragh O'Loughlin .
However , Audrey Simpson of the Family Planning Association ( IFPA ) said that while the move was a step in the right direction more should be done .
" It would be better if condoms were sold VAT free .
They are not luxury items , they are essential in reducing rates of sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies , " she said .

Fake Flying Saucers
I have a scanned photo of two USAF flying saucer craft that were built and flown about 1950s through the late 1970s .
I have no knowledge of the origin of the picture except that it appeared in a retiree association newsletter .
The person who furnished the picture did not know who built the vehicles .
- question from Art Moss
US Air Force flying saucers
I must admit that I got quite a chuckle out of this one .
As soon as I saw the photo , I knew that it was a forgery because I had seen it before .
That is to say I 'd seen parts of it before .
Regular visitors to this site may recognize this picture as a heavily modified version of a photo that appeared in a previous article we posted about Scott Crossfield and the D - 558 - 2 Skyrocket , the first plane to fly Mach 2 .
Scott Crossfield poses in front of the D - 558 - 2 , its B - 29 mothership , F - 86 chase planes , and support crew
The undoctored photo is supposed to show NACA test pilot Scott Crossfield posing in front of the D - 558 - 2 Skyrocket along with the crew , mother plane , and chase aircraft that supported his record - setting flight .
It appears obvious that an enterprising graphics artist superimposed these flying saucers onto the Skyrocket photo in an attempt to make these craft seem more credible .
However , we are unaware of any actual saucer - type vehicles comparable to those shown in the edited picture that have ever been tested by the US military .
The US Air Force did conduct some experiments with much smaller saucer shaped vehicles during the 1950s and 1960s , but these craft were closer in size to the automobiles pictured above than to a large aircraft .
Avrocar
Probably one of the best known of these flying saucers was the Avrocar built by Avro Canada for the Air Force and Army .
The Avrocar operated similarly to a hovercraft .
The vehicle made use of a large ducted fan located in the middle of the craft to pull in air from above and push it out along the edges of the lower surface .
Unfortunately , the Avrocar proved unstable and was never able to hover any higher than a few feet off the ground due to control instabilities .
Avrocar in flight
Two of these unique vehicles were built and tested .
The prototype is now owned by the US Army Transportation Museum at Fort Eustis , Virginia , while the second model is in the collection of the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum .

More Evidence ?
A reader recently sent in the photo seen below that appears to be of the same style of flying saucer that originally prompted this article .
The questioner then asked whether this second picture now proves the existence of these infamous vehicles .
Supposed saucer in flight with an F - 86 Sabre
The answer again is a resounding no .
Just as before , a five - minute search of the NASA Dryden Research Aircraft Photo Collection has proven this image to be as obvious of a forgery as the first one was .
Whoever is responsible for this hoax once again manipulated a NASA photo to insert the computer - generated flying saucer into a legitimate picture of the D - 558 - 2 Skyrocket .
The undoctored original photo is shown below .
Actual photo of the D - 558 - 2 Skyrocket in flight with an F - 86 Sabre
The guilty party must have an affinity for classic high - speed research planes of the 1950s since both of the pictures we have received were of the D - 558 - 2 and included its F - 86 Sabre chase planes .

Source of the Photos
We 've finally identified the origin of the modified photos described above as coming from the website usafflyingsaucers.com .
The site purports to provide evidence that the US Air Force built and tested four different disk - shaped aircraft during the 1950s and 1960s .
Illustrating the site are several computer generated drawings , models , and images of the flying discs superimposed into pictures of actual planes .
Both the site and the illustrations appear to be the creation of Michael H. Schratt .
Schratt says that the information presented on the site comes from a writer named Jack D. Pickett .
According to Pickett , he was asked to visit MacDill Air Force Base in Florida in 1967 to write an article on historic aircraft .
Among the planes he says he saw stored at the base were these four saucer - shaped aircraft , and he also claims the base gave him access to hundreds of photos and videos of the craft .
Despite this information , Pickett says the Air Force later decided to prevent him from publishing his article about the planes and they have remained a secret to this day .
While we cannot dismiss his story out of hand and the existence of these flying disks may be confirmed someday , there is presently no evidence to corroborate the tale .
Perhaps more importantly , the pictures created to support these claims ought to be clearly marked as computer generated conceptual images .
It is at best midleading and at worst dishonest to present such pictures without explanation since the reader can easily mistake them for being real .
The same comment applies to the entire site since it makes rather extraordinary statements written as though they are accepted facts when they are really conjecture and hearsay .
The only disclaimer pointing out the conjectural nature of the site appears on one page in very small text that is easy to overlook .
These disclaimers ought to be clearly stated at the top and bottom of every page as well as placed on each image to ensure the reader knows they are not genuine photos .
Note that the site usafflyingsaucers.com expired in January 2006 and is no longer available .
An archive of the old site can be found at WayBackMachine.com .
A brief overview of many of its claims including additional diagrams can also be seen here .

Michael Nola , a poll worker in Claremont , went to two training sessions before election day and was instructed that nonpartisan voters were entitled to cast ballots in the Democratic Party or American Independent Party primaries .
What he never learned in class was that in addition to selecting a candidate , these voters were required to mark a bubble on their ballots indicating which party primary they were voting in .
. . .
It was n’t until midafternoon on election day that he and his fellow poll workers learned of the extra bubble , but by then it was too late .
Many nonpartisan voters had already cast their ballots , including Nola himself .
“ No mention was ever given about the requirement to fill in the dot for either party before choosing a particular candidate , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
“ Both my wife and I lost our votes by this needless oversight . ”
Across Los Angeles County , many nonpartisan voters who cast ballots in the Democratic primary have learned to their dismay that their votes in the presidential contest did not matter .

On Friday , some angry voters called on election officials to let their votes count .
“ I was disenfranchised , and I am furious , ” wrote independent Steve Katinsky in an e-mail .
“ This nonpartisan registered voting disaster makes Florida look like pikers in election screw - ups .
To find out my vote did not count was a sudden and unexpected shock and is completely unacceptable . ”
Dean Logan , acting Los Angeles County registrar , estimates that about 100,000 nonpartisan voters cast ballots without marking a party bubble .
How many of them intended to vote for a presidential candidate is unclear -- some may have wanted to vote only on the propositions on the ballot .
Logan , who said earlier that he would tabulate as many of the uncounted votes as legally possible , said Friday that his office is attempting to determine how many votes went uncounted and hopes to have an estimate early next week .

“ I understand the frustration from the voters ’ standpoint , ” he said .
“ The voter should n’t have to understand all the complexities of running an election .
They should be able to show up and vote and have their ballot counted . ”
California Democratic Party spokesman Bob Mulholland said the uncounted votes were unlikely to affect the division of delegates between Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama .
An analysis of the preliminary results by congressional district indicates that none of the outcomes in Los Angeles County appear close enough to be affected , even if the margins changed by several thousand votes , he said .
But Mulholland also had harsh words for Los Angeles County ’s voting system .
Advertisement
“ It ’s a terrible ballot design , ” he said .
“ It requires the voter to take an extra step .
The purpose of a democracy is to make a person ’s vote easy to count .
If it turns out that they were aware of this problem previously , then somebody should be held accountable . ”
According to the office of Secretary of State Debra Bowen , Los Angeles is the only county in the state that requires decline - to - state voters to fill in an additional bubble on a ballot if they choose to vote in the Democratic or American Independent primary .
It has used similar systems in three previous elections .
It also is the only county in the state not to have the candidates ’ names printed on the ballot , a factor that will make it difficult to determine voters ’ intentions .
Bowen , who oversees elections in California , said she was “ astonished to see a ballot design this poorly thought out ” when she first looked at the Los Angeles County ballot .
She questioned whether it would be possible to count votes for presidential candidates on any of these ballots because the bubbles for the first three candidates in each party were in the same position on the ballot .
Advertisement
“ Logically we know that most of these ballots were Democratic , because the number of American Independent Party voters is very small , ” Bowen said .
“ But in a democracy we do n’t guess what the voter ’s intent was . ”
The bubble issue in Los Angeles overshadowed a variety of voting problems statewide , including complaints from many nonpartisan voters who were denied a Democratic ballot when they went to the polls .
Some independents also reported that they were given the wrong ballot , in some cases a Democratic ballot and in some cases a Republican ballot -- even though the Republican Party did not allow nonpartisans to vote in its primary .
Still other voters went to the polls and found that their recent voter registration had not been recorded or that they had been re-registered without their authorization .

Los Angeles County election officials said they had hoped to avoid problems with the ballot for nonpartisans by educating poll workers and voters about the bubble requirement .
And at many precincts across the county , voting went smoothly .
In places where there were problems , some poll workers faulted voters for not reading their instructions more carefully .
“ If people do not have the common sense to take the time to read the ballot , then it is their own fault if they are confused , ” said poll worker Lilith Marie Haas of Bellflower in an e-mail .
“ The instructions are clearly printed in the sample ballots mailed out to all voters and in the voting booth . ”
But some voters said the instructions were confusing and made it appear as though the party bubble requirement applied just to mail - in voters , not those at the polls .
Advertisement
David Olson , a nonpartisan voter from Los Angeles wrote Logan and urged him to count all the nonpartisan votes cast for president .
“ I believe I have been disenfranchised by a confusing system , ” he said .
“ Requiring an additional step is unfair and deprives many citizens of the right to vote . ”

A common French weed known as Crepis sancta underwent a form of superaccelerated evolution to cope with the difficulties of spreading their seeds in cities .
Scientists studying C. sancta discovered that over a period of just twelve years , the plants went from mostly producing " dispersing " seeds that spread on the wind , to producing " nondispersing " seeds that fall to the ground nearby .
Why would a plant shift its reproductive cycle so radically and quickly ?

Seeds that spread on the wind in cities mostly wind up dead on the concrete , while seeds that fall usually find a spot to grow in the same street plots or concrete cracks where their parents grew .
( You can see the two kinds of seeds at left . )
Because seeds grew up so close to home , the plants evolved super quickly — sort of an urban Galapagos Islands effect .
( One of the ways that Darwin first observed natural selection was on a trip past the tiny , isolated Galapagos Islands , each of which had evolved its own unique types of finches that interbred quickly and in isolation from finches on other islands . )

The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published the researchers ' study today , noting :
The authors took Crepis sancta seeds from several locations in the city of Montpellier , France , and grew the plants in a greenhouse , observing what fraction of seeds produced were of the light , easily dispersed type .
Compared to plants from the countryside , plants from urban patches consistently produced fewer light seeds .
Based on a mathematical model of breeding , the researchers estimate that the current version of urban Crepis sancta took approximately 12 years to evolve .
They report that plants in a fragmented urban setting thus become doubly isolated , as reduced seed dispersal would likely lower gene flow and hence chances of species survival .

The Subprime / Securitization Market Panic

Part One : Subprime Origins
I usually consider the lifting of titles of canonical works of philosophy as highly inappropriate , but I get the feeling that there are enough people out there scratching their heads ( and glancing nervously at their 401 K statements or even job prospects ) about the recent market turmoil that I think I can , in good conscience , use Maimonides ' title as starting point for this discussion .
After all , what does the swindling of financially benighted , sometimes greedy , and even gullible American homeowners have to do with collateral used by mysterious funds which promise outsized returns to the incredibly wealthy ?
And how on earth can developments in these markets cause a bank run ( Northern Rock ) in England , which had n't seen anything similar since the 1860s ?
Moreover , who are those even more shadowy characters lurking on the horizon — Sovereign Wealth Funds and private equity investors to name two — who stand to capitalize on the mess ?
Having followed the developments closely for the last several months , I shall attempt here to provide some answers to these and related questions .
Let 's start is with the American subprime mortgage market .
Not only were developments in this market the ones that , in conjunction with other factors , immediately provoked the crisis ; indeed , the methods used by investors and brokers in this sector are good examples of those which have become so prevalent in global finance generally .
So , by examining the way subprime mortgages were bought and sold , we will see a pattern which will be , roughly speaking , duplicated in other important markets .
In this manner , we will approach the wider phenomenon that has come to be known in the financial press as " securitization . "
And we shall see that it is this type of investing that probably had more to do with the crash than the subprime market by itself : it 's arguable that if the US subprime market did n't set off the crisis , something else would have .
And , by extension , it is likely that , if the US or even global economy can manage to dodge this bubble - bursting bullet , the phenomenon of securitization , if unchecked by serious regulatory reform , will lead to the formation of a bigger bubble somewhere else ( much as the dot.com bubble — with an obliging Federal Reserve looking on — morphed into the bubble we are dealing with now ) .
Mortgage finance has changed radically in the last decade or two .
After the Savings and Loan debacle of the early ' nineties , this might seem entirely appropriate .
Instead of taking out a mortgage from a bank which would retain the loan on its books and , therefore , have to provision reserves to pay its depositors in case of defaults , more and more homebuyers have seen their loans immediately repackaged by their banks — or mortgage companies , which are n't even banks ( and , therefore , are neither regulated like banks , nor required , as banks are , to provision reserves against potential defaults on loans ; according to a recent survey in the Economist , nearly half of all mortgages fall into this category in the US ) .
By repackaging , I mean that the mortgage sellers would bundle together many loans into bonds which could be sold directly to investors .
Thus , even the banks could take such loans off their books ( and so avoid provisioning reserves against them , freeing up that capital for potential profit - seeking investments or fee- generating activities ) .
In this manner , it was hoped , more potential buyers , whom the banks could n't service due to questions about their ability to repay , could gain access to the funds they needed .
In addition , the ability to disperse risk by combining loans of differing levels of creditworthiness seemed to allow for a significant broadening in access to capital for new companies , especially smaller ones .
And all of this seemed to offer the promise of greater economic growth .
Meanwhile , even credit card and other forms of consumer debt were re-shaped along the same lines : and many of these investments may end up being damaged like subprime mortgages , as we shall also see .
But , for the moment , it is enough to notice that the new forms of investment made access to capital and consumer ( especially mortgage ) loans much more accessible ; on the other hand , the risks were diverted from those who traditionally were in a position ( both of a physical and legally - mandated variety ) to effectively monitor repayment of the underlying debts than those who purchased the new securities .
How and why did the banks and finance companies create these financial products in the first place ?
Unprecedented technological improvements in information technology gave finance companies the means to cut up different loans into extremely minute components and attach them to bundles of other loans ( " slicing and dicing , " in the financial jargon ) .
In addition , the deregulation and liberalization of banking and financial services , started in the US and the UK in the late ' seventies , not only continued apace even after the crash of 1987 and the recessions of the early ' nineties ; indeed , it spread throughout the world at an accelerated pace .
Deregulation and liberalization took on myriad forms during this period , but the pertinent aspect for our story concerns the breakdown of the separation between banking and investment activity .
This culminated in the 1999 repeal of the depression - era Glass - Steagall Act by the Democratic Clinton administration .
According to the act , banks had to be very careful not to use depositors ' money to finance profit - making investments other than loans .
After Glass - Steagall was repealed ( and with the aid of other forms of deregulatory legislation and policy ) , banks and financial companies not only gained access to new investment activities , but had to compete against each other to provide more favorable terms to potential clients .
Needless to say , many of these activities provided fee income for the banks and finance companies in the place of income that depended ultimately on the successful repayment of loans ( this is what led to Northern Rock 's collapse ) .
And this , in turn , put additional pressure on traditional incentives regarding the monitoring of creditworthiness .
So we have seen how regulatory and technological changes in the financial industries have led to the creation of new forms of investment , which tended to relax standards of creditworthiness .
How was it that the US subprime mortgage sector became the weakest link in a chain that , after all , involved financial innovation of the sort that pervaded all manner of markets throughout the world ?
Though the relaxation of credit standards fostered by the new forms of investment seems like a factor that could conceivably stand alone in accounting for a major financial meltdown , the subprime / securitization story requires the entrance of a few more major players .
First and foremost , the Federal Reserve reacted to the Asian financial crisis of 1997 / 8 — and to all financial crises subsequent to that one — by providing ample funds to debtors struggling to repay loans taken out while things were going full tilt .
Other central banks in the rich world ( this option was n't made available to the countries directly affected by the Asian crisis , or to the poorer developing countries suffering from knock - on effects of the crisis , by the IMF , World Bank or US Treasury -- and with the major exception of deflation - hobbled Japan ) tended to follow suit .
The emerging pattern went like this : central banks would not attempt to prick -- or even diagnose the existence of — financial bubbles before they burst , but would lower interest rates precipitously after a crash .
Accordingly , the Federal Reserve dropped interest rates an unprecedented 5.5 % between 2001 - 3 while the financial fallout from dot.com crash was redoubled by the terrorist attacks of September 11th , and despite the unprecedented deterioration of the US fiscal position due to President Bush 's wars and simultaneous tax cuts that favored the very wealthy ( something the immortal Alan Greenspan has helpfully criticized recently , just in time to promote his new book , but a mere 5 years too late to be of much use to the rest of us ) .
Though , in consideration of the latter point , such a strategy was potentially objectionable in and of itself , the policy faced another , unexpected obstacle .
Though besieged consumers ( suffering from a continued stagnation of wage growth , and all too willing to substitute wealth effects from investments for income growth ) and the federal government took advantage of the extension of credit , the US corporate sector and several governments ( including many US states ) failed to respond .
For one thing , many companies had spent way too much during the dot.com era on wacky investments in unprofitable ventures and insuring against the Y2 K threat ( the technological upgrades from Y2 K actually gave them the means to avoid new investments in technology for a number of years ) .
In addition , economic recovery from 2002 on can only be described as dysfunctional , particularly where employment was concerned , and many businesses were reluctant to borrow — and invest — due to worries about the health of consumers .
On the other hand , corporate borrowing was becoming all the more unnecessary , given that productivity gains were stellar , and corporate profitability was therefore being restored in spite of worries about the consumer sector .
As for other countries and US states , many of them were under pressure ( after the Asian crisis in the case of nations , and the precipitous loss of tax revenue in the case of US states following the dot.com crash ) to balance their books , and so these investors were n't interested in taking out more debt , no matter how low interest rates went .
All this led to a very peculiar situation , which was summarized nicely by Christian Stracke for the Financial Times : " That imbalance between investors flush with cash and the traditional borrowers not really needing or wanting that cash meant that investors had to look for new markets to invest in .
As the [ asset - backed securities ] market had been taking off �a natural target was the sub - prime - borrowers who in the past had wanted to borrow but who had been locked out of credit markets . "
Asset - backed securities ( ABSs ) are investments of the very type we 've been talking about ( and subprime mortgage loans form parts of asset - backed securites ) , in which different investments are sliced up and recombined .
For now , what 's important to notice is that , enabled by the Fed and other rich - country ( or zone , in the case of the European Central Bank ) central bank cuts , many investors had a lot of cheap money to throw around , and , after the major economic disruptions of terrorism and a crash in the technology sector , were under great pressure to find high - yielding investment opportunities in a hurry .
This was all the more so inasmuch as the very same low - interest environment fostered by the rate cuts made more risky investments all the more enticing where outsized yields were concerned .
And one other thing : many huge , but traditionally conservative investors like pension funds , facing huge potential falls in contributions from both companies and governments at the same time as workforces in developed countries aged , were drawn into the high - yield chase .
Accordingly , fund managers , continuing a development that began in the ' nineties , became more insistent that companies ( many already under greater competitive pressure as enormous productive capacity opened up in far cheaper emerging markets ) meet quarterly targets , even to the detriment of any sustainable long - term growth .
Needless to say , the banks and finance companies were to feel some of this pressure , which only exacerbated the deterioration of credit standards we encountered earlier .
So you have a situation in which a lot of money is sloshing about , impatiently seeking outsized returns to make up for past bubble - losses or future funding shortfalls , all in an atmosphere characterized by extra- low interest rates ( which do n't tend to correlate with the big returns many investors increasingly required ) and a race to the bottom where oversight was concerned .
Among other things , this gave rise to the Yen " carry trade , " in which investors borrowed in low interest bearing currencies ( interest rates had been negative — if you count inflation — or zero in Japan for a long time ) , and invested in assets in countries with far - higher yielding currencies , assuring a hefty return , even in spite of underlying economic fundamentals .
In addition , much of this investment was taking the form of the new investment products we 've discussed .
And with that , we come upon yet another major set of players in the saga .
At this point , many readers may be asking themselves : who bought these new investment products and why ?
Well , hedge funds , for a start .
These funds , which receive almost no oversight from regulatory authorities , invest enormous amounts of money on the behalf of extremely wealthy people ( and , increasingly , pension funds ) , and promise outsized returns for exorbitant fees .
Because of the huge amounts they can invest ( some would call it the power to move markets ) , banks are only too eager to lend to them ; consequently , these funds can top up investors ' capital with borrowed money by that amounts to several times that provided by investors in the first place .
With this wall of cash to use as collateral — or leverage , in the jargon — hedge funds can control huge stakes ( one thing they can do is borrow stocks and bonds , make quick profits on them , and return them to their permanent holders ) with relatively small actual outlays .
Many of these funds specialize in arbitrage , or taking advantage of small price differentials between markets ( by piling into assets similar in all respects except higher yields ) .
Being able to throw so much money so rapidly into markets with sophisticated — and expensive — information technology ( which assists the funds to spot the minute price differentials ) , allows for the prospect of huge returns .
Foreign investors , too , racked up a good deal of these securities , enabled by our ballooning current - account deficits , and attracted by the phenomenal growth in the US housing market which itself contributed in a big way to the trade deficit ( think of all those imported furnishings ) .
And we should n't forget that it was incoming foreign cash that allowed interest rates here to stay low — low enough to encourage a whole lot of mortgages to be taken out in the first place that might not have been otherwise .
This kind of thing eventually created some major distortions in the US economy : a wholly inordinate share of new jobs and growth originating from the housing sector , and an equally lopsided percentage of corporate profits ( which were extremely high ) coming from the financial sector .
And this all on top of the wage stagnation , falling savings rates and gaping increases in income inequality that had been going on more or less uninterruptedly for more than two decades .
By now , many may be wondering : if many of these investors were so sophisticated , how did they end up holding the sub - prime mortgages of people with dodgy collateral , an obvious desire to flip newly - purchased homes back on the market on the assumption that prices would go up indefinitely , or , often enough , not even a job ?
The answer to this is two - fold , involving first , the way the underlying loans in these securities are divided up , and second , the nature of the models used by the big investors .
Another type of security , collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , repackaged sub - prime with other loans in such a way that they could receive top investment ratings ( and hence , be purchased by insurance companies , pension funds and others , who can only purchase securities with highest ratings ; and the higher ratings also allowed these funds to take advantage of lower borrowing costs : using higher rated securities for collateral means you do n't have to put as much cash down ) despite the fact that some of their component loans were tainted by far greater risk than was reflected in the overall ratings !
Investment - grade ratings for component loans also encouraged the creation of yet more CDOs .
To get an idea of how complicated the CDO structure could be , I quote the Financial Times ' Wolfgang Munchau :
Take , for example , a synthetic collateralised debt obligation , one of the most complicated financial instruments ever invented .
It consists of a couple of credit default swaps , credit linked notes , total return swaps , all jointly connected in a wiring diagram that looks as though the structure was about to explode .
Needless to say , many ( most ? ) investors could n't possibly begin to have an accurate idea of what kind of ventures they were financing with these vehicles .
But if this were n't enough , the ratings agencies ( like Fitch , Moody's , etc ) are themselves dependent on fee income from the very companies whose securities they monitor , which raises obvious issues regarding potential conflicts of interest .
Then there are the fancy models employed by the hedge funds and others .
These models do not re-price component securities in a direct way as they move on the markets — this would be cumbersome and prohibitively costly ; instead , they use all sorts of underlying statistical data , often based on past performance over limited periods , to extrapolate the likely trajectory of securities .
But they do not factor in unlikely events like market panics .
So when a panic hits , the model blows out ; and if the component securities fluctuate wildly from the pattern , it is impossible to determine the real value of the securities with any confidence at all ( until they are properly priced , or " marked to market ; " and that takes time : something financial markets , especially panicky ones , do n't take kindly to ) : certainly not enough to put any more money on the markets .
Now these new securities can provide returns only if the underlying loans continue to be paid off .
And once it became clear ( HSBC announced its earnings would be negatively impacted due to its American subsidiary 's exposure to subprime loans in March , and the bad news kept coming in , at an accelerating rate , through the Spring and early Summer ) that foreclosures would rise precipitously as the US economy slowed and interest rates went up , and as a vast pile of variable - rate mortgages were due to reset at much higher rates of interest , investors began to bail .
This was all the more so because the Fed seemed to spend much of the first half of the year in an attempt to prepare investors for a period of higher interest rates , one more appropriate to the lower productivity and higher wage - and - cost readings that started to come in at the beginning of the year : and when falling asset - prices , rather than rising wages and costs , seemed to become revealed as the dominant dynamic force in the economy , things shifted abruptly into reverse .
The hedge funds had to cash out of some of their other positions to pay back investors alarmed by the prospect of underperformance , amounting in further losses , this time on the stock markets .
And the banks found themselves in a double bind : first , they had to raise cash to cover possible losses of opaque entities called conduits and structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) they created to finance the investments of hedge funds , corporations , and themselves .
For a fee , the banks sell short - term corporate bonds and buy higher - yielding and longer �term assets like auto loans , credit card receivables and , you guessed it , mortgages .
These , in turn , serve as a cheap form of collateral for the banks and their clients to make their huge bets on the markets .
Funds placed by the banks in conduits and SIVs do not have to be reported on their balance sheets ( as loans do ) , and , hence , the banks do not have to provide reserves on them on case underlying loans do not get paid off .
In addition , banks are , according to the so - called Basle rules , required to keep a proportion of their securities in cash and high - grade investments to fall back on case of difficulties .
The conduits and SIVs provided a nice way around this , too .
This is fine when things are going well : the money that would be allocated to reserves can instead he lent profitably to the hedge funds , or to finance mergers and acquisitions : activities for which the banks are handsomely rewarded with more fee income .
In addition , however , many of the banks , thinking things could not go wrong , had also entered into agreements ( the so - called " bridge loans " ) with big investors to take back any loans that went bad .
All this led to the great seizure of late August , because the banks had to stop lending .
They had to stop lending to the hedge funds on the one hand , and to each other on the interbank market ( banks borrow from each other for short periods — often overnight — to keep their reserves at legally - required levels ) on the other .
They had to do this because , as mentioned before , they were liable for any bad loans they had agreed to take back from their big clients ( these loans would have to go back on the balance sheet , and these would therefore require those irritating reserve outlays , even as the securities declined in value ) .
And they would have to continue to ramp up reserves as long as they did n't know what they — or their clients — had on their books in the first place .
The central bank interventions of August 17th and September 18th were attempts to fill the gap created by the banks , to buy time and get them lending again .
Part Two : Beyond Subprime
Investors responded to the Fed actions enthusiastically : stock markets worldwide boomed , particularly in emerging markets , which were protected from the original turmoil by the huge piles of US dollars they accumulated from trade surpluses with the US .
A Lehman Brothers economist , in an obscene display of insensitivity or just plain ignorance , even referred to the unusually large Fed cut of a half - a- percentage point on September 18th as " shock - therapy " , a term that had been used to describe huge and devastating interest rate rises in poor — often desperately so — countries following financial crises going back to the 'eighties .
Getting back to the main point , though , the US stock market record - highs of September and early October were driven by the idea that US multinationals ' foreign sales will offset further sub - prime losses and the accompanying slowdown in US domestic demand .
But this may be wishful thinking : investors have and continue to ignore clear warnings about the extent of this problem .
For example , Merrill Lynch announced a markdown of some $ 4.5 billion on mortgage - holdings last month only to revise it to $ 7.9 billion a mere three weeks later .
And , on the consumer side , the Financial Times reports that the Fed cuts so far will do little to alleviate the strain on those trying to pay back subprime debts , because a whopping " 73 per cent of adjustable - rate subprime loans are based on the six - month London interbank lending rate , " not the Federal Funds rate .
And unlike the Federal Funds rate , this rate has not come down much ( indeed , it has recently begun rising ) , reflecting the reluctance banks have shown to lend to each other in spite of the Fed cuts and the associated equity euphoria .
And then there 's the continuing commercial paper ( CP ) problem : with demand for these short - term corporate bonds way down ( potentially tainted ABSs constitute a worrying percentage of these securities ) , conduits and SIVs are having trouble getting buyers to roll these rapidly maturing debts over ( remember , they use proceeds from sales of these securities to fund their longer - term stakes ) ; so there is constant danger that they will need to liquidate more of their positions to pay off investors who want to exit the market .
And since this would only increase the supply of bonds on the market , it would lower sale prices still more in a potentially vicious cycle , or " fire - sale . "
In the few weeks , there has been talk of the establishment of a " super- conduit , " or M - LEC ( Master - Liquidity Enhancement Conduit ) , which would be financed by the major banks themselves ( despite the subprime disaster , the three participating mega - banks are sitting on huge cash piles accumulated while profits were huge and fee income lavish ) .
This fund would provide missing demand for quality bonds : under present conditions , there is so much fear that even untainted securities may be going unsold , and so get markets ( especially for big fee- earners like mergers and acquisitions ) running again .
It is in this sense that market commentators have been emphasizing that the crisis — so far — has been one of confidence , and not the availability of money , or liquidity .
But it is unclear whether or not this initiative has any hope of success .
As Gillian Tett noted in the Financial Times , " the fund will start in a couple of months .
But the troubled SIVs need to sort out their problems right now . "
Market participants simply " cannot afford to wait around for the superfund . "
In addition , it is difficult to put too much faith in a fund that is being established by the same banks ( especially Citibank ) whose practices played no small part in the meltdown .
And will the big banks play fair in separating good from dud loans ?
On November 2d , Reuters reported that another big bank , Merrill Lynch , was accused by an analyst of attempting to delay losses on billions of dollars from troubled assets by sheltering them in hedge funds ( remember , Hedge Funds are n't required to observe the same reporting requirements as regulated financial institutions , which gives them potential leeway to obscure losses ) .
This does not auger well for the prospect of a fair — or orderly — sorting out process .
The authorities themselves ( never mind the financial markets ) seem to be sensing that the superfund is a highly inadequate response to the underlying problems .
Accordingly , on November the 8th , Fed chairman Bernanke put forward a plan to Congress which would involve Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government - sponsored mortgage finance companies .
According to the plan , so - called " jumbo " mortgages ( mortgages up to $ 1 million , up from $ 417,000 ) would be eligible for securitization by Fannie and Freddie , and would be insured by them in return for the Federal government taking on some of the credit risk .
This would presumably aid in the effort to get lenders lending again .
But events continue to extend the growing gap between the financial authorities and the real world .
Now commentators are even mentioning the possibility that insurance products may be as tainted as mortgage - backed ones .
For the ratings agencies have started their downgrading of many securities , including ones whose creditworthiness was considered of a " super- senior " quality , and were therefore popular with banks , insurance companies and mutual funds the world over .
Remember , too , that the prices of these securities are going in the same direction as their ratings : way down .
Eventually , insurers may run short on capital and even lose their privileged ratings .
This would have knock - on effects in a host of other markets .
For example , the Economist notes that " new issues of municipal bonds could slow dramatically , since many of the borrowers rely on the insurers ' top ratings to enhance their own creditworthiness .
Over $ 1 trillion of debt issued by American cities and states — much of it held by retired people through funds — might have to be degraded .
Public - private partnerships in Britain , which are also customers , may be affected . "
Meanwhile , as John Authers noted in his " Short View " daily video clip for the Financial Times on November 8th , credit card and other forms of prime lending activity are way down for the 3rd quarter of the year .
This amplifies his message of the day before that " the credit crisis goes much further than problems with subprime mortgages . "
Those who took comfort during the Summer in the idea that the effects of subprime lending , as a miniscule part of the US credit market , could not much influence the global financial system and large national economies , were misleading themselves .
Accordingly , banks in England , Germany and now Japan are taking losses from their holdings of subprime and other potentially tainted securities , which means the global pool of available capital will dry up all the more .
The Economist again : " A consumer - credit slump , which looks increasingly likely , would clobber securities backed by credit - card and car loans , which are also pooled in CDOs . "
If a general funding slowdown contributes to an greater economic one , credit card holders will experience the same sort of difficulties paying off their debts that mortgage debtors are encountering now , and the types of securities backed by consumer loans will go the way of subprime mortgages .
Meanwhile , financial markets are losing the gains they posted in the wake of the first Fed cut , and volatility is returning with abandon .
On October 31st , as expected , the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by another quarter - point .
But big selloffs occurred later in the week as the banks announced huge losses .
At this point , it is difficult to see where all this is going .
The Federal Reserve Board of Governors meets again on December 11th , and key Fed personnel are making out that it will not necessarily lower rates again , even if subprime problems continue to mount .
But investors have long operated under the assumption that the Fed will always step in to protect them ( and by extension , the economy — not the other way around ) no matter what .
On this point , even the Economist plainly states : " The Fed has validated the impression in financial markets that investors ' expectations drive the central bankers ' decisions �if Wall Street clamours louldly enough for a rate cut — and futures markets price one in with any degree of certainty — the Fed will oblige . "
But there is a problem : US economic growth chalked up a surprising 3.9 % gain in the third quarter , in spite of the continuing turmoil , and October jobs growth surprised on the upside by almost twice as much as analysts had expected .
In addition , the US is facing a winter with oil — now — at more than $ 95 a barrel and the situation in the Middle East extremely touchy to say the least .
Under these conditions , and with the dollar hitting new lows every day ( which can increase inflation , as the real cost of imported goods — especially oil — appreciates ) , the Fed can't be too sanguine about inflation , if only because the falling , but still formidable current - account deficit still requires foreigners to invest in the US .
But if they continue to see their investments here whittled away by inflation and dollar depreciation , they may try to take significant sums elsewhere , or simply spend them on much - needed infrastructure , education , pensions , bad - debt provisioning ( some of these countries , especially China , have notoriously shaky banking systems ) , or even weapons .
The Financial Times '
Authurs has referred to the Fed 's dilemma as nothing less than " an extremely difficult situation . "
Samuel Brittain has also written , in the same newspaper , of the " danger ... that central banks are so assiduous in promoting domestic growth that they will not tolerate a few quarters of lacklustre GDP performance .
In that case , deficits will never be able to contract properly and may become a problem they might not have been to start with . "
This seems to be a polite way of saying something else .
Ever since the early ' nineties , central banks in most rich countries seem to have accepted an uneasy tradeoff : as long as relatively invisible microeconomic ( reduction of protection for workers and so on ) reforms , the negative effects of which tend to fall disproportionately on the less - well off , continued apace , they would attempt to prevent politically unacceptable macroeconomic instability ( resulting in big jumps in unemployment ) , offshoring it to the poor world in the form of currency and debt crises if necessary .
But such policy also encouraged the kind of debt - based consumption , blowouts in income disparities , and huge capital outflows we 've seen in many rich countries in the last few years .
Accordingly , this uneasy tradeoff may be in the process of breaking down .
On the other hand , there is one thing many if these foreigners would be interested in , despite the cloudy economic outlook in the US .
In an astonishing reversal from 1998 , many foreign investors may be beginning to eye a US crisis as a buying opportunity ( especially inasmuch as such a large percentage of US profits are earned outside the US ) , much as Western firms picked up Asian ones at fire - sale prices after the 1998 crisis there .
Many of the interested parties will no doubt be the so - called Sovereign Wealth Funds ( SWFs ) ,
These funds are made up of export earnings of countries ( many of an authoritarian bent ) like Russia , China and the OPEC countries , and managed by their governments .
Thus far , the US has held these funds at a distance , but if the financial situation deteriorates sharply , it is conceivable that only funds as flush with cash as these are , and as unaccountable to shareholders or anyone else , will have the leeway to throw lifelines to some US companies facing a highly uncertain conjuncture .
Much the same can be said of private equity firms , which could take important US firms off the public markets altogether .
Then again , many of these countries , as noted before , have their own weaknesses , and may not be able to withstand a serious US - led global downturn without wrenching changes that will have to be funded somehow , and maybe the SWFs will have to be tapped for that instead .
But the US may , as it has done so often , muddle through again somehow .
Third - quarter productivity came in at a super 4.9 % , with improvements probably concentrated in the resurgent export sector ( which , lightning - fast , by itself made up for big downturns in construction and finance in the impressive third - quarter growth in GDP — despite all the turmoil on the markets ) .
So maybe that less - appreciated ( i.e. other than taxpayer - financed bailouts ) means of socializing financial losses employed in the US , squeezing workers to restore profitability , will work its magic yet again .
But maybe not .
For , as hinted at earlier , financial excesses of the sort documented here tend to follow from incidences of prior financial desperation , and require accordingly desperate outlets to be opened to generate the outsized gains required to offset previous losses and make up for likely future weaknesses ( which tend to be exacerbated by the neglect of underlying problems that tends to characterize booms ) .
And that kind of financial desperation follows in no small part from the kind of assault on living standards and worker security that has characterized the last three decades in the US and UK ( and the last decade or two in other parts of the rich world ) , and has resulted in the truly obscene income disparities , debt - enabled consumption binges and increasingly desperate financing on all levels .
Add to this the kind of hyperactive export - led development that 's been foisted on pivotal parts of the developing world , which has seen the development of domestic consumer markets ( not to mention incomes and social safety - nets ) in these countries lag dangerously behind exports , and the idea that the US consumer will have enough leeway to retrench to anywhere near the level seemingly required to restore international imbalances to a sustainability seems overly optimistic , in spite of optimistic initial signals given off by the productivity figures .
So perhaps the ultimate lesson of the so - called subprime crisis — the problems of which the pundits are only now admitting go far beyond the subprime mortgage market — is that financial crises themselves tend to go far beyond the financial sector , and are dependent in important respects on the insecurity and desperation that are built into all capitalist economies to some degree , but have characterized the new form of globalized capitalism of the last few decades in a particularly alarming and destructive way .

One of the most popular computers from the 1980s , the Commodore 64 , is having a minor renaissance as an electronic musical instrument .
The C64 ’s audio chip is famous for producing an array of warm , familiar 8 - bit beats and blips .
As a result , the trusty C64 has become a popular platform for “ circuit bending ” , which is hardware hackers ’ terminology for taking old technology , applying circuit modifications to output audio or video effects that the original device was n’t necessarily designed to produce .
Now you can own your own circuit bent C64 , without any electronic know - how .
The circuit bending wizards from Bighead Electronics have made this extremely limited edition pre-modded C64 , appropriately called the Bent64 .
The system comes completely loaded Paul Slocum ’s Cynthcart , a custom program which helps the heavily modded Commodore produce a wild cacophony of retro noise as you press keys on the keyboard .
The Bent64 is a ready - to - go electronic musical instrument , capable of cranking out 3 - note polyphonic analog sounds , applying effects with a “ whammy ” tuning knob , and even stereo support if you can wrangle a second sound chip and install it in the provided socket .
The Bent64 can even output a psychedelic light show through a composite video output , so you ’re ready to rave out of the box .
Oh yeah , it ’s still fully functional as a standard C64 with the flip of a switch before you boot up .
So you ’d better brush up on your Commodore BASIC .

Here ’s a little - known and slightly terrifying fact : According to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , more than 60 million people in the United States are infected with a parasite that may migrate into their brains and alter their behavior in a way that  among other things  may leave them more likely to be eaten by cats .
New research into this common parasite 
Toxoplasma gondii  may offer clues to the phenomenon known to the unscientifically - minded as “ crazy cat lady ” syndrome .
The basic facts :
Toxo can infect many species , but it undergoes sexual reproduction only in cat digestive tracts .
Once the parasite reproduces , the cat passes it in its feces , where the next unwitting host picks it up by digesting it ( intentionally or unintentionally ) .
Then the cycle starts again .
In the long run , Toxo must find its way back to a cat ’s stomach to survive .
So the parasite has evolved a complicated system for taking over its hosts ’ brains to increase the likelihood that they ’ll be eaten by cats .
Image Credit ... Reinhard Hunger
How ?
Scientists are still figuring that out .
Research conducted this year by Toxo expert Robert Sapolsky of Stanford , and also by Joanne Webster , professor of parasite epidemiology at Imperial College London , has found that Toxo actually causes rats to become attracted to the smell of cat urine .
In an internal blogpost inside Atlassian , I described a certain problem as being ‘ very hard ’ , to explain why our efforts were better spent elsewhere .
Later , as I was walking across the bridge into work I had a moment to look at that statement through the eyes of a non-engineer .
Atlassian prides itself on hiring really smart people .
What use are they if they can't solve hard problems ?
To that end , here 's a quick lexicon of what computer programmers generally mean when they 're talking about how hard some problem is , starting with the most extreme :
Impossible
The man most commonly regarded as the ' father ' of computer science is the English mathematician , Alan Turing .
Turing did a lot of work in World War II helping the Allies break the German military ciphers .
To reward him , the British Government convicted him of gross indecency after the war ( he was homosexual ) , took away his security clearance and put him on hormone therapy .
His death not long after is generally accepted as suicide .
Anyway .
Turing 's most famous contribution to computer science is the Turing Machine .
This is a theoretical device that is both capable of solving any computational problem that could be represented as an algorithm , and of emulating any other device that solves computational problems .
Anything that can be ( deterministically ) mechanically computed can be computed by a Turing machine .
Anything that performs deterministic mechanical computations is really just a Turing machine .
Engineers speak of computer hardware or programming languages that have this full range of computation as being " Turing complete " .
In this framework , the word ' impossible ' has a definite meaning .
A problem is impossible if its solution can not be computed by a Turing machine .
Admittedly , this is n't a very useful distinction .
On one hand , Turing machines are a mathematical theory .
They 're infinitely fast and have unlimited storage , and you have an unbounded amount of time to write your program for it .
As such , many things that are theoretically possible are practically impossible ( more on that later ) .
On the other hand ( and this trips up engineers all the time ) , it does n't ascribe any value to mostly solving a problem .
No Turing machine can tell you if you 're going to like a book or not , but Amazon makes a lot of money out of coming out with a close - enough guess .
Trivial
At the other end of the scale , we have problems that are trivial .
This definition can be expressed in far fewer words :
I know how to solve this problem .
To a programmer , a problem is trivial if there is a clear solution , and the only thing that needs to be done is to implement it .
The only caveat is that triviality refers to how hard the problem is to solve , not how hard it is to implement the solution .
So there is no necessary relation between a task being trivial , and how long it takes .
To the programmer , once the plans for the bridge have been drawn up , the materials chosen properly and the model tested for how it would survive wind , traffic and earthquakes , actually building the bridge is trivial .
Unfeasible1
A problem is unfeasible if enough of the solution is known to determine that you do n't have the resources to solve it .
You might not have the free developer resources , or the available expertise , or it might just need more hardware than you can ever afford .
The field of cryptography offers us a perfect example of a problem that is both trivial and unfeasible .
The algorithms that encrypt and decrypt data are well - known and published .
Assuming the algorithm works ‘ as advertised ’ , to decrypt some data you just need to write a program that implements that algorithm , and throw enough computing hardware at the problem to run that algorithm with every possible key .
Cryptography works by choosing keys in a way that ensures there 's not enough computing hardware available , practically speaking , to run that trivial program to completion .
Decrypting such data is unfeasible .
Non-Trivial
An ex-Google non-engineer described ' non- trivial ' thus in the Xooglers blog :
It means impossible .
Since no engineer is going to admit something is impossible , they use this word instead .
When an engineer says something is " non-trivial , " it 's the equivalent of an airline pilot calmly telling you that you might encounter " just a bit of turbulence " as he flies you into a cat 5 hurricane .
This quote shows both the difference between the engineer and non-engineer 's conception of non-triviality , and their different definitions of impossible ( Flying through a hurricane is n't necessarily impossible , you just really would n't want to do it ) .
In clear opposition to the meaning of trivial , non-trivial means :
I do not know how to solve this problem completely .
Non-trivial contains dangerous unknowns .
Some part of it is not yet understood , or lies outside the range of things the programmer has done before , or can quickly imagine a workable solution to .
The more experienced the programmer who tells you a problem is non-trivial , the more concerned you should be .
Given time for research and experimentation , a non-trivial problem can be made trivial .
Or it could be determined to be hard .
Hard , and Very Hard .
Hard problems are a class of non-trivial problem2 where some of the unknowns , some of the problems the engineer would have to find a way to overcome , are known to be difficult to find solutions to .
These are problems the engineer has tried to solve in the past , or has seen the resources that other developers have had to throw at similar problems to solve them .
' Hard ' can also be used to describe non-trivial problems with a big potential for ' unknown unknowns ' - things the developer not only does n't know the solution to , but does n't even know what kind of problems he 's likely to face .
Scaling out a web application is hard .
There are any number of thorny problems to do with performance , distribution , data access , caching and so on that take quite a bit of effort to solve , and are often different enough from application to application for there to be no good , general solution .
There are also inevitable thorny problems that you have n't even anticipated , lurking in the wings .
Very Hard is the extreme of hard problems .
You 'll often see both words capitalised for emphasis , even in the middle of a sentence .
Indexing the entire World Wide Web and providing relevant search results in millisecond response times is a Very Hard problem .
Breaking commercial - grade encryption within practical hardware and time limitations is a Very Hard problem .
Peace in the Middle East is a Very Hard problem .
' Very Hard ' is usually reserved for the class of problem that if you solved it , you could change the world .
Or at least build a successful business on top of your solution .
1 The Economist weighs in on “ unfeasible ” vs “ infeasible ” , and declares both are interchangeably correct .
2 Gary Capell pointed out to me in email that , in classic engineering understatement , hard , or even Very Hard problems can sometimes be referred to as ‘ distinctly non-trivial ’ .
The tank , which is 27 m tall standing upright , has no markings and is thought to have fallen from a ship before being washed up on the west of Benbecula .
It was discovered by a dog walker on Poll Na Crann beach - known locally as Stinky Bay - near Griminish .
Stornoway Coastguard is using two numbers on the container to try to find out where the item has come from .
The beach is known as Stinky Bay because of the fermenting seaweed found there .
Alasdair MacEachen , assistant director of environmental services at Comhairle nan Eilean Siar told BBC Scotland : " It 's certainly generated a fair bit of interest with people walking on the beach or just travelling along the road , because you can actually see it from the main road along the west side of Benbecula .
Although it looks as if it 's empty and it's been ruptured , my advice would be not to go too close to it

" It 's a big object so you can't miss it , and it 's not often you see something like that on the beach .
" It would be standing almost 30 m tall and really looks pretty much like a silo .
I think it 's a bulk storage tank of some sort , possibly for storing some liquids . "
Mr MacEachen said they may decide to anchor the container to the beach to stop it from floating out to sea and becoming hazardous to ships , but in the meantime he advised onlookers to keep a safe distance .
" Although it looks as if it 's empty and it's been ruptured , my advice would be not to go too close to it , " he said .
" It 's a fairly light construction so you do n't want it rolling on top of someone , and with that sort of thing you can never tell .
" My advice would be to just observe it from a distance . "
End of the World : 10 Disasters that could end it all at any given second .
1 . Particle Accelerators Physicists have long theorized that particle accelerators could destroy the earth .
When electric fields are used to accelerate protons they could collide at speed fast enough to create black holes or bits of altered matter .
These small black holes would slowly engulf our planet .
The pieces of altered matter , called strangeletes , would destroy any ordinary matter they came in contact with , eventually annihilating the entire planet .
Although most scientists assure that none of the particle accelerators being used at the present are strong enough to bring about these events they are unsure of the abilities of the newest accelerator being built .
Currently , over two - thousand physicists from thirty - four countries , universities and laboratories are aiding in the construction of The Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) located near Geneva , Switzerland .
It is scheduled to begin experimentation in May 2008 .
It is hoped that if black holes are produced they will be small enough to evaporate , but only time will tell .
Video Clip : Clip detailing the construction of the world 's largest particle accelerator near Geneva , Switzerland .
2. Rogue Black Holes
Although the concept of black holes was conceived in 1915 by Einstein ( some may argue earlier ) they were not accepted as fact until Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose proved their existence in 1970 .
From this point on black holes have been looked at with a sense of awe and fear ; a place from which nothing can escape , not even light .
Even scarier is the fact that our galaxy is full of collapsed stars waiting to turn into black holes , some astronomers estimate there are as many as 10 million .
Luckily , most black holes are in orbit around other astronomical masses .
However , if one of these black holes was able to pull itself away from orbit and head towards earth we would be clueless since they are almost impossible to see .
The black hole would n't even have to come very close to earth to wreak havoc , if it even entered our solar system it would distort all planetary orbits causing extreme climate changes , and even expel some planets from the system .
3 . Gamma -Ray Burst Gamma - ray bursts are extremely powerful , estimated to have 10 quadrillion times more energy than our sun .
They are created by the collision of two collapsed stars .
Unfortunately , it is almost impossible to visualize collapsed stars making it even more difficult to predict the location of a gamma-ray burst .
A burst 1,000 light years from the earth ( further away than most of our stars ) would create an explosion as bright as our sun and bring a hasty destruction to earth .
Although our atmosphere and the ozone would provide protection at first it would soon be cooked away by the radiation .
UV rays would kill the photosynthetic plankton in the ocean , which provide most of the earth 's oxygen .
At least one burst can be seen each day when watching our sky with gamma-ray vision ; it can't be too long before there is one closer to home .
Video Clip : Computer generated video illustrating a Gamma - ray burst .
4. Omega Point
This term describes the ultimate maximum level of complexity - consciousness .
Philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin believed that the universe is continuously working towards this point .
The socialization of humankind , including creating more complex forms of communication and information exchange , increases the collective consciousness of the human race .
Just as human beings can self - reflect , one day too the universe will hit the critical Omega Point and the collective consciousness of humankind will be able to reflect upon itself .
This divine center of consciousness will draw together the entire universe and end the world as we know it .
5 . Bubble Nucleation According to the leading cosmological model the universe began as a false vacuum of empty space filled with energy .
This incredibly unstable , high - energy state went through the process of bubble nucleation to reach a more stable , lower - energy state .
This huge release of energy caused the expansion of the universe .
We would like to think that the world we now live in is a stable true vacuum but it is possible that although the universe is at a lower energy level now than it was before , we are living in another false vacuum which could collapse at any moment .
If a low energy bubble nucleates in our false vacuum it would expand at the speed of light , once again changing the universe .
Video Clip : Animation illustrating theoretical low energy bubble nucleation .
6. Divine Intervention
As with all end of the world theories it 's impossible to know if divine intervention is a feasible end of the world scenario .
Despite its lack of scientific evidence it gains validity through strong support .
Christians look to the Book of Revelation , Jews to the Book of Daniel , and Muslims believe that the coming of Mahdi will bring the end .
All religions have a similar story : a divine force will intervene in the world to bring our history to an end and start a new moral order .
Even non-believers have something to worry about since some doomsday groups decide to take these matters into their own hands .
For example , the Aum Shinri Kyo sect that released Sarin nerve gas into a Tokyo subway station in 1995 , killing 12 and injuring more than 5,000 .
Imagine what would happen if these groups got their hands on more powerful weapons .
7 . Solar Activity ( Super - Flares and Decreased Activity )
The sun emits solar flares , also known as coronal mass ejections , towards earth frequently .
These flares are large magnetic outbursts which contain high - speed subatomic particles .
Luckily , earth 's atmosphere and magnetic field protect us from the consequences of these potentially lethal flares .
However , evidence has been found that sun-like stars far from our solar system can briefly increase in brightness by 20 times .
It is hypothesized that these increases are caused by super - flares , which are millions of times more powerful than the common solar flare .
If our sun were to emit one of these super - flares it would literally fry the earth .
On the other hand , if our sun 's activity were to decrease by a mere 1 % ( which has been known to happen to many sun-like stars ) we would be flung back into another ice age .
Video Clip : NASA created video showing a rotating sun with flares .
8. Aliens Attack The Earth
The chance of encountering intelligent extraterrestrial life becomes greater every day .
As of January 8 , 2008 , 217 planets have been discovered outside of our solar system and 2 - 3 new ones are found each month .
Famous astronomer Carl Sagan believed there to be billions upon billions of planets in the universe .
With such high numbers it is hard , if not impossible , to believe that there is no intelligent life in the universe besides human and that an alien invasion and destruction of Earth is impossible .
It is theorized that it would not be a conflict between humans and aliens that would cause lead to our end but that the aliens would exploit Earth for her resources or merely disrupt the planet by mistake .
9 . Global War Although , tensions between world groups wax and wane causing the public to frequently go from worrying about a global war to forgetting about it , global war is a constant threat .
It is believed that there are at least 20,000 active nuclear weapons in the world .
A malicious use of these weapons or even an accidental nuclear exchange or misfire could be disastrous for the planet .
Even more worrisome should be the treat of biological warfare .
Using killer germs is cheap , they are also easy to produce and conceal .
Even scarier , they can become impossible to control .
10 . Ecosystem Collapse
Our biodiversity is vanishing .
At least 30,000 new species become extinct each year , a higher rate than ever before in history .
Every single organism on the planet is integrally intertwined with the life of others .
To make our life easier in the here and now we are slashing and burning forests , slaughtering animals , transporting organisms from their original ecosystem to others , and introducing synthetic materials into the environment , just to name a few .
We are already upsetting the checks and balances of the global ecosystem but have not yet seen a devastating consequence such as the extinction of pollinating insects leading to widespread crop failure and the eventual starvation of humans .
Ecologist use the imagery of a " marginal tree , " that once cut will throw our planet into chaos to explain the unpredictability of a cataclysmic ecological collapse .

Kosovo 's declaration met protests in Belgrade and in parts of Kosovo
Bush on Kosovo
Moscow said the comments were made by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during a telephone conversation with his US counterpart Condoleezza Rice .
US President George W Bush earlier defended his move to recognise Kosovo .
In Kosovo on Tuesday , Serbs opposed to independence attacked two border crossings in the Serb - dominated north of the territory , local police said .
At least one border post was burned down .
Nato peacekeepers were sent to help police at the Jarinje and Banja crossings .
No casualties were reported among the border officers on duty there , who are reported to have evacuated their posts .
On Monday , Serbia withdrew its envoy to Washington in protest at the US stance .
Belgrade says Kosovo's Sunday declaration violates international law .
The UN Security Council is divided over how to respond to Kosovo 's move , and it has failed to agree on any action .
Russia and China supported Serbian President Boris Tadic when he made an impassioned appeal to the Council at Tuesday 's meeting .
But Britain 's representative said that with no prospect of agreement between Belgrade and Pristina the only way forward was supervised independence for Kosovo .
Britain , France , Germany and Italy have all recognised the new state but others have not .
' Threat to stability '
" We confirmed our principled position on the unacceptability of unilateral actions by Pristina declaring its independence , " the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement , following talks between Mr Lavrov and Ms Rice .
STANCE ON RECOGNITION For : Germany , Italy , France , UK , Austria , US , Turkey , Albania , Afghanistan Against : Russia , Spain , Romania , Slovakia , Cyprus
" We underlined the dangerous consequences of such a step , which threatens the destruction of world order and international stability which have developed over decades , " the statement said .
It added that the telephone conversation was initiated by Washington .
The Russian warning came just hours after President Bush said the US would soon establish full diplomatic relations with Kosovo .
Bush backs Kosovo
Speaking during a visit to Tanzania , President Bush said history would prove Kosovo 's independence to be " a correct move " .
KOSOVO PROFILE

In pictures : Celebrations Anger mounts in Mitrovica
He said there was " a disagreement but we believe as many other nations do that history will prove this to be the correct move " .
The president said the US supported Kosovo 's independence because " we believe it will bring peace " .
In a letter to Kosovo 's President Fatmir Sejdiu , Mr Bush offered friendship to Kosovo , and said he supported " your embrace of multi-ethnicity as a principle of good governance " .
On Monday , the Serbian parliament passed a resolution condemning Kosovo 's declaration of independence .
The resolution also formally annulled the acts of the government in Pristina , saying Belgrade 's sovereignty over Kosovo was guaranteed by the UN and international law .
In a separate move , Serbia recalled its ambassadors to the US , France and Turkey because those countries had recognised Kosovo 's independence .
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has threatened to withdraw envoys from other countries which backed the territory 's secession .
At a meeting in Brussels , the European Union set aside differences over the recognition of Kosovo 's independence , by stressing that the breakaway Serbian province was not a precedent for separatists elsewhere .
All 27 EU foreign ministers agreed to leave recognition up to each member state .
Spain and several other member states have withheld recognition because of concerns about separatist movements within their own borders .
Protest rallies
Serbia 's interior ministry has filed criminal charges against Kosovo Albanian leaders instrumental in proclaiming independence , accusing them of proclaiming a " false state " on Serbian territory .
HAVE YOUR SAY Kosovo has declared independence from Serbia , legally or illegally it is not for me to say which Peter , UK
In Belgrade , about 10,000 students marched in protest at the independence declaration , and Serb enclaves inside Kosovo also saw big anti-independence rallies .
In Kosovo 's divided city of Mitrovica , three cars were damaged in Tuesday 's grenade attack near the office of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe .
The incident was the latest in a string of hand - grenade attacks on property of international missions in Kosovo and government offices .
Serbian security forces were driven out of Kosovo in 1999 after a Nato bombing campaign aimed at halting the violent repression of ethnic Albanian separatists .
The province has been under UN administration and Nato protection since then .
Mr Leggat was freed from the toilet thanks to a cleaner
David Leggat , 55 , was unable to raise the alarm after becoming stuck in the toilets at Kittybrewster and Woodside Bowling Club in Aberdeen .
Mr Leggat had no mobile phone or food , and used tap water for refreshment and for heat .
He was only released when cleaner Cathy Scollay arrived and heard his cries for help .
She told BBC Scotland : " He said , ' I have been locked in for four days . ' "
Mrs Scollay added : " I went in to work as normal and a voice shouted out .
I could not take it in .
" The handle had broken .
He was a bit shaky , and was as white as a sheet . "
Mr Leggat was said to be none the worse , despite his ordeal .
“ I like them both , ” said Ann Powers , 63 , a coordinator for special - education programs in Fort Dodge , Iowa .
“ I just think he is too inexperienced and she ’s dealt with more in the last 20 years . ”
Billie Stimoff , a 72 - year - old retiree from Kodak , Tenn. , said , “ It ’s time to see what a woman can do because men sure have made a mess of things . ”
The national telephone poll was conducted Feb. 20 - 24 with 1,115 registered voters , including 427 Democratic primary voters and 327 Republican primary voters .
The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all voters , plus or minus five percentage points for Democratic voters and plus or minus five percentage points for Republican voters .
The poll showed Republicans settling in with their likely nominee .
Eight in ten said they would be satisfied if Mr. McCain wins their party ’s nomination , although just 3 in 10 said they would be very satisfied .
Nearly 9 in 10 said he was prepared for the presidency and more than 8 in 10 said they had confidence in his ability to deal with an international crisis , while a remarkable 96 percent said he would likely make an effective commander in chief .
But misgivings remain among those who describe themselves as conservative Republicans , with a majority of those voters saying his positions on the issues are not conservative enough .
On the Democratic side , primary voters indicated they saw few substantive differences between their candidates on issues like the war in Iraq and health care .
Most Democratic voters have confidence in both candidates to handle the economy , the war in Iraq and an international crisis .
And large numbers think it is likely that either candidate would make an effective commander - in - chief .
Mr. Obama ’s advantages are more apparent on other measures .
Nearly 6 in 10 say he has the best chance of beating Mr. McCain , double the numbers who believed Mrs. Clinton was more electable .
He is also viewed by more Democratic voters as someone who can bring about “ real change ” in the way things are done in Washington and is willing to compromise with Republicans “ the right amount ” to get things done .
Democratic voters are also more likely to say Mr. Obama cares a lot about them , inspires them and can unite the country .
Sixty - three percent of Democratic voters said he cares a lot about them , while fewer than half think Mrs. Clinton does .
Nearly seven in 10 say he inspires them about the future of the country ; 54 percent say Mrs. Clinton does .
Three - quarters say he would be able to unite the country as president ; 53 percent say Mrs. Clinton would .
The Democratic flirtations McCain does n’t want to talk about
A couple of weeks ago , the NYT ’s Elisabeth Bumiller asked John McCain about his contradictory stories regarding joining John Kerry ’s 2004 Democratic ticket .
McCain claimed he “ never even considered such a thing , ” which is clearly false .
When Bumiller pressed him on the issue , McCain ’s infamous temper did n’t exactly erupt , but he certainly made his displeasure clear .
The incident seems to have prompted Bumiller to take a closer look at the two major flirtations McCain has had with the Democratic Party , neither of which has generated much attention during this year ’s campaign .
Senator John McCain never fails to call himself a conservative Republican as he campaigns as his party ’s presumptive presidential nominee .
He often adds that he was a “ foot soldier ” in the Reagan revolution and that he believes in the bedrock conservative principles of small government , low taxes and the rights of the unborn .
What Mr. McCain almost never mentions are two extraordinary moments in his political past that are at odds with the candidate of the present :
His discussions in 2001 with Democrats about leaving the Republican Party , and his conversations in 2004 with Senator John Kerry about becoming Mr. Kerry ’s running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket .
Regular readers may recall that I ’ve followed both stories with great interest , in part because I ( wrongly ) believed McCain ’s on - again , off - again romance with Democrats would become a problem for the senator in the Republican primaries .
That did n’t exactly work out — McCain ’s rivals never pushed the matter , and reporters did n’t bring it up .
But in light of McCain ’s mini-tantrum on his campaign plane earlier this month , Bumiller does a good job summarizing what transpired .
The questions now are , does this matter , and if so , how ?
On the possible 2001 switch …
Democrats were stunned one Saturday in late March when , by their account , John Weaver , Mr. McCain ’s longtime political strategist , reached out to Thomas J. Downey , a former Democratic congressman from Long Island who had become a lobbyist with powerful connections on Capitol Hill .
In Mr. Downey ’s telling , Mr. Weaver posed a question to him over lunch that left him stunned .
“ He says , ‘ John McCain is wondering why nobody ’s ever approached him about switching parties , or becoming an independent and allying himself with the Democrats , ’ ” Mr. Downey said in a recent interview .
“ My reaction was , ‘ When I leave this lunch , your boss will be called by anybody you want him to be called by in the United States Senate . ’ “
… and on the 2004 Democratic ticket .
[ L]ess than three years later , Mr. McCain was once again in talks with the Democrats , this time over whether he would be Mr. Kerry ’s running mate .
In an interview with a blog last year , Mr. Kerry said that the initial idea had come from Mr. McCain ’s side , as had happened in 2001 .
Mr. Kerry , reacting to reports in The Hill newspaper last year about Mr. Weaver ’s 2001 approach to Mr. Downey , said he saw a pattern .
“ It does n’t surprise me completely because his people similarly approached me to engage in a discussion about his potentially being on the ticket as vice president , ” Mr. Kerry told Jonathan Singer of MyDD.com , a prominent liberal blog , in remarks that are available in an audio version online and that Mr. Kerry ’s staff said last week were accurate .
“ So his people were active — let ’s put it that way . ”
Two former Kerry strategists said last week that Mr. Weaver went to Mr. Kerry ’s house in Georgetown a short time after Mr. Kerry won the Democratic nomination in March and asked that Mr. Kerry consider Mr. McCain as his running mate .
( Mr. Weaver said in his e-mail message that the idea had come from Mr. Kerry . )
I ’m pretty skeptical about the McCain camp ’s version of events , in large part because the Dems involved in the events have no reason to lie .
( In contrast , McCain has already been caught lying , rather blatantly , about considering Kerry ’s offer . )
As for the ’08 implications , one can reasonably argue that the issue helps McCain .
As the argument goes , he ’s such a “ maverick , ” and his “ independent ” streak is so strong , he reached across the aisle in a major way during Bush ’s first term .
But I have a different take .
Far from showing McCain to be open - minded , I find these events to be a reminder of just how shallow McCain ’s principles really are .
When the winds were blowing in one direction , he was prepared to leave his party .
When the winds shifted , he attached himself to the president he found offensive .
It ’s hardly a compelling selling point .
WASHINGTON --
The Senate rejected an attempt by a number of Democrats to strip from surveillance legislation a provision that would bar lawsuits against phone companies alleged to have helped the government 's warrantless spying , handing President Bush a small initial victory .
In an effort to secure support in the House for the immunity provision , the White House yesterday gave some House lawmakers access to long - sought documents outlining the post - Sept. 11 requests to telecommunications companies and other related documents ....

Lester added const to just about everything that it was possible to do , and in the process uncovered lots of questionable practices in the code .
Similarly , Nicholas Clark and Dave Mitchell nailed down many , many , many memory leaks .
Much of the work done to the internals results in a much more robust engine .
Far likelier err , less likely , to leak , or , heavens forbid , dump core .
If you have long running processes that chew through datasets and / or use closures heavily , that is a good reason to upgrade .
For new developments , there are a number of additions at the syntax level that make writing Perlish code even better .
Things like Mark - Jason Dominus 's book on Higher Order Perl makes heavy use of constructs such as closures that tend to leak in 5.8 .
If this style of programming becomes more widespread ( and I hope it does , because it allows one to leverage the power of the language in extraordinary ways ) then 5.10 will be a better fit .
Years ago , having been bitten by nasty things in 5.6 , I asked Does 5.8.0 suck ?.
As it turns out , it did n't .
I think that 5.10 wo n't suck , either .
One big thing that has changed then is that far more people are smoking all sorts of weird combinations of build configurations on a number of different platforms , and many corrections are being made as a result of that .
Things that otherwise would have forced a 5.10.1 to be pushed out in short order .
update : clarified the " no more foo " additions , as per dmorgo's comment .

( CNN ) --
The Bush administration said Monday it notified Congress of plans to sell $ 20 billion in sophisticated arms to Saudi Arabia .
The deal includes the proposed sale of 900 " joint direct attack munitions " worth close to $ 120 million , said U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack .
Arriving in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , for talks with King Abdullah , Bush delivered a proposed weapons sale that is part of a U.S. strategy to beef up security of its Persian Gulf allies to counter threats posed by Iran 's rising influence in the region .
Sen. Joseph Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said the committee would examine the deal .
" We need to be convinced that the sale makes sense militarily and ensure that it in no way harms our security or those of our allies , " the Democrat from Delaware said in a news release .
" We must also make certain that the administration does not just try to use a few arms sales to substitute for the comprehensive , coherent strategy we need for the region . "
Bush 's Mideast tour includes visits to Israel , the West Bank , Bahrain , Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates .

Also on Monday , top Iranian officials heaped scorn on Bush 's visit to the Middle East , with one of them saying the American leader was attempting to stir up " Iranophobia , " a state - run Iranian news agency reported Monday .
Iran 's Islamic Republic News Agency noted the comments of Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki and Ala'eddin Boroujerdi , head of the Iranian parliament 's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission .
Bush , in a speech Sunday in Abu Dhabi , labeled Iran as the " world 's leading sponsor of terror " and asked allies to join the United States in confronting Iran " before it 's too late . "
But Mottaki -- who made his remarks to Al - Jazeera news network Sunday -- said the United States " was the main cause of extremism in the region as it has been supporting terrorist and extremist groups during the past six years . "
Watch excerpt from Bush 's speech »
He said Bush was trying to foment tensions in the Persian Gulf over the Strait of Hormuz incident on January 6 .
The U.S. military described a confrontation between U.S. ships and Iranian boats , but Mottaki called the American version of the story fabricated , the Islamic Republic News Agency said .
The report paraphrased Mottaki as saying that " fanning the fuel of Iranophobia was the objective of Bush 's visit to the region . "
In the IRNA report , Boroujerdi said referring to Iran as a threat wo n't affect Teheran 's ties with its neighbors .
Mottaki touted growing bilateral cooperation between Iran and its neighbors and said that U.S. officials can't " understand the historical , religious and cultural commonalties between Iran and other regional countries , " said the IRNA report .
The report paraphrased Boroujerdi as saying Bush 's talk about Iran " is the saber - rattling of a defeated man . "
" Bush would achieve no results from his visit to the region given Iran 's current cooperation with the regional states as well as Tehran 's firm decision to safeguard regional security with the help of the regional countries , " the lawmaker said .
Boroujerdi indicated that Bush embarked on the trip to shore up support for his unpopular policies and that his visit to the West Bank and the Persian Gulf " was just a political propaganda campaign as he knew his policies in the region were futile . "

This warehouse is being built to house the books and journals that no one wants .
With the British Library 's UK collection growing at a rate of 12.5 k m of shelf space a year , is the notion of the copyright library really sustainable ?
Stuart Jeffries reports
We used to build cathedrals .
Now we build warehouses .
One of the most extraordinary examples of our costly new dalliance with warehouse technology is rising on an industrial estate in West Yorkshire .
As I drive past Leeds United 's training ground and past HM Prison Wealstun , an epic grey corrugated temple looms ominously .
It dominates the landscape around Boston Spa , just as Ely Cathedral commands the Fens or as Chartres Cathedral surmounts the countryside for miles around .
All it needs is a spire .
The warehouse is extraordinary because , unlike all those monstrous Tesco and Amazon depositories that litter the fringes of the motorways of the Midlands , it is being meticulously constructed to house things that no one wants .
When it is complete next year , this warehouse will be state - of - the - art , containing 262 linear kilometres of high - density , fully automated storage in a low - oxygen environment .
It will house books , journals and magazines that many of us have forgotten about or have never heard of in the first place .
Chris Fletcher , the warehouse 's project manager for the past 11 months , is extremely proud of it .
" Normal atmosphere consists 20 % oxygen .
This will regulate oxygen in the warehouse to between 15.8 and 16.2 % , with a mean of 16 % , which will ensure minimal damage to the books in store .
The air - conditioning will ensure 52.5 % humidity plus or minus 5 % .
It will ensure a steady state temperature .
The whole building will be sealed to protect the contents .
It will , " he says puffing his chest a little , " comply with British Standard 5454 .
Amazing , is n't it ? "
It certainly is .
We 're standing in hard hats and wellies inside the warehouse , which at present is a huge shell .
It reminds me of visiting an empty power station in south London before they started filling it with art galleries and calling it Tate Modern : the scale induces awe .
This will be the £ 20 million new depository at the British Library 's Yorkshire complex in Boston Spa near Leeds .
It is where , before this century reaches its teens , copies of books spared a quick death at the pulping plant - thanks to the grace of the provisions of the 1911 Copyright Act and later government legislation - will go to serve their life sentences in a secure environment .
" We need this warehouse , " says Steve Morris , the British Library 's head of finance , " not just because it is cheaper than existing rented warehouses we use in London , but also because we are statutorily obliged to house more and more material .
Seven million items , many of them books , will go there .
The death of the book has been grossly exaggerated , you see . "
Indeed , the problem for our great libraries is that books wo n't stop coming .
The British Library 's UK national collection is currently expanding at the rate of 12.5 kilometres of shelf space a year , and somewhere has to be found to put it all .
In 1911 , the notion of the copyright library was born , when Parliament decided that the British Library along with five others in Great Britain and Ireland would be entitled to receive a free copy of every item published .
But , while the other five - the Bodleian at Oxford , Cambridge University Library , Trinity College Library in Dublin , and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales - have a right to claim any book published in the UK , in practice not all are .
Cambridge University Library , for example , estimates that only between 70 % and 80 % of everything published in the UK are deposited there ( they can also request anything within one year of publication ) .
By contrast , the British Library must receive a copy of everything published in the UK each year .
The British Library , you see , strives to live up to its self - imposed title of " the world 's knowledge " .
That knowledge , though , is an odd thing .
Along with the Magna Carta and the Gutenberg Bible , it includes Everybody Poos , by Taro Gomi ( to help kids over toilet phobias ) .
Not to mention Wayne Rooney 's autobiography , Jordan 's novel and a book called Do Ants Have Arseholes And 101 Other Bloody Ridiculous Questions .
The MPs who in 1911 established the legal deposit principle for the five greatest libraries in the British Isles probably did n't realise the full consequences of their decision .
Peter Fox , head librarian at Cambridge University Library , reckons between 60,000 and 100,000 books are published each year , and anticipates no decline any time soon .
What 's more , the British Library commissioned research into publishing trends up to 2020 and found that the annual UK output of monographs , currently standing at 150,000 a year , is set to increase by 100 % between now and 2020 .
You might think that the evolution of publishing into cyberspace might soothe the headaches of those librarians charged with deciding where all this stuff can be housed , but you would be wrong .
True , the British Library reckons that by 2020 25 % of newspapers will be published solely in e-format with virtually none published solely in print , and that by the same year 40 % of UK monographs will be in e-format only , but current library policy is to acquire a printed format of a publication even when it exists in electronic form , partly because there is n't yet sufficient confidence in digital formats to justify doing otherwise .
Think about it : CD - ROMs used to be the future .
Now they join VCRs , Walkmans and 8 - track machines in the technological dustbin .
Indeed , the CD - ROM became outmoded so quickly that it is difficult to transfer material from them to more modern digital formats .
Who knows which current digital formats will go the way of CD - ROMs in future ?
" PDFs seem pretty good , but who knows ? "
Fox says .
So , for a few more decades , at the very least , our great libraries will not give up on the printed form .
As a result , their employees will have to worry about where to put them , as well as how to conserve their extant , priceless collections as well as possible .
What , in these challenging times for our libraries , will wind up in this vast new warehouse ?
Books that no one reads , magazines that have never been opened , abstruse journals with even pottier titles than the ones satirised on Have I Got News For You .
If Potato Farmers ' Weekly , Nylon Jumpsuit Enthusiasts ' Quarterly or Postcard Collectors '
Digest exist , then they will surely find a place to languish in optimum conservation conditions in this postmodern temple .
They will be kept in plastic totes that can be removed from their stacks .
If , for example , someone is doing a PhD on the evolution of TV listings in the late 20th century , a tote containing TV Quicks from June 1997 would be lifted from their shelves , the magazines disinterred from their plastic tomb , and , most likely , put on the daily shuttle to the Library 's reading room in St Pancras , London , 250 miles away .
But , no doubt , only after some of the eight British Library staff who will work in the depository have raised their eyebrows at the thought of someone actually wanting to read this stuff .
" We 're essentially relocating nil to low use material from rented warehouses in London to a cheaper facility where the material will be kept in conditions that ensure it is kept as pristine as possible , " says Dawn Olney , head of collection storage at the British Library , and thus one of the key people responsible for the mind - bending logistical problems of deciding what - of the Library 's collection of 13 million books , 920,000 journal and newspaper titles , 57 million patents , three million sound recordings , not to mention publications that exist only in cyberspace - should go where .
Ca n't you just decide that Barbara Cartland 's 95th novel is rubbish and so store it in a pit for all eternity ?
" It does n't work like that , " Olney giggles .
" We have to use objective criteria .
We divide the material into metres and if there are no uses per metre per year , it is categorised nil use .
If it 's zero to three uses per metre per year , it 's low use .
Three to five uses is medium use and will be kept at St Pancras .
More ephemeral material of low appeal now will go north . "
Please tell me my book is n't nil use , I bleat .
Sensibly ,
Olney wo n't be drawn .
" It 's actually quite surprising what is low use .
We 'll be shipping north lots of periodicals like Time Out and those sorts of magazines .
We 'll have magazines like Country Life , which are very valuable but low use .
All those magazines with CDs we 'll be sending up north - with the CDs attached .
" What we found when we moved to St Pancras is that some material you 'd expect to be low use is high use , such as car manuals and travel guides . "
But surely nil-use books are n't doomed to languish in Boston Spa 's book mausoleum for ever .
" Of course not .
What 's nil use one year may not be in following years .
It 's a very flexible system . "
The British Library is n't the only one of our great libraries building new warehouses on an industrial estate in the face of unprecedented supply - side problems .
In September , the University of Oxford was given planning permission to build a £ 29 m book depository for the Bodleian , Britain 's second largest library .
Objectors claimed that the site at Osney Mead would be subject to flooding and that the thumping great building would spoil views of the city 's dreaming spires .
But Sarah Thomas , the Bodleian 's head librarian , argues that the new building gives her library the chance to house all its modern collections in a secure , modern depository , rather than continue struggling in their current buildings .
" We are simply getting to the point where we cannot fulfill the purpose for which we were created in these buildings , " Thomas says .
By " these buildings " , she means some of Oxford 's most beautiful examples of architecture , that , from the Bodleian 's inception in 1602 , have housed the second greatest collection of books in Britain .
Buildings such as the Old Schools Quadrangle , the Radcliffe Camera ( Britain 's first circular library ) , Hawksmoor 's lovely 18th - century Clarendon Building , as well as nine other libraries dotted around the city .
She also means Giles Gilbert Scott 's New Bodleian Library , across Broad Street from the library 's loveliest old buildings , which was supposed to satisfy the library 's need for expansion for ever .
That need has arisen again and again since the Bodleian was founded in 1602 , and particular since 1610 when Thomas Bodley made his historic agreement with the Stationers ' Company in London ( a guild given a monopoly over printing in England in the 16th century ) to place a copy of every book registered with them in his new library .
This agreement was the precursor of today 's legal deposit system ( as the copyright system is more accurately called ) .
When the New Bodleian opened , it was at the cutting edge of library design .
Scott 's ziggurat consisted of 11 storeys of books stacks , three of them underground .
A tunnel under Broad Street connected new and old buildings with a pedestrian walkway and a mechanical book conveyor known as " the bicycle chain " .
But the New Bodleian is now regarded as a fire hazard and a conservation nightmare .
One report described it as " 130 % full " .
Hundreds of thousands of less frequently used books are stored in Wiltshire , and in a salt mine in Cheshire .
" This is one of the greatest libraries in the world , but we can't just operate as a books warehouse , we must be a national and international centre for the study of the books , " says Sarah Thomas .
She wants the New Bodleian to be gutted ( once they 've got the books out first , of course ) and then used as a centre for scholars and as a conservation studio .
As a library , it is finished .
" With all due respect , " says Peter Fox , librarian of Cambridge University Library , " in hindsight it 's clear the Bodleian made a terrible mistake before the war when it built the New Bodleian in the city centre .
At that time , both Oxford and Cambridge desperately needed to expand , but Cambridge could n't expand in the city centre , so we built a new university library outside it .
It turns out we were lucky . "
The location of Scott 's new building meant that the University Library could expand - and indeed has been expanding - to house more and more .
On his desk , he has a model of the development of the University Library , phased wings dropping neatly into place over time as the need dictates .
We 're standing on the 14th floor of Giles Gilbert Scott 's university library tower , which teems with low - use , probably utterly forgotten but rather lovely first editions of 20s novels I 've never heard of .
I pull out at random a copy of Harold Bindloss 's Sour Grapes , a 1926 romantic adventure set , singularly , in Manitoba and along the Solway Firth .
I put it back , and pull out instead Patsy 's Brother , by Harriette R Campbell , the sequel , as you know , to the Little Great Girl , which was published in the Books For Girls series in the same year .
It looks like a delightful girly romp : if only I had been an eight - year - old girl in 1926 .
It may be the first time in 80 years that these volumes have received such close attention .
Fox then takes me to the latest extension of the library where we find new paperback books housed in rather beautiful stacks , all moving easily on manually - operated tracks .
We remove a box , designed to repel acid ( paperback books need to be kept this way if their shelf life is to consist of more than a few years ) .
Inside , we find not only a marvellous new book about the Port of Ayr , but also a book called Momentum In Football , featuring a foreword by Sven - Göran Eriksson .
Would n't it be great if you could just sell this stuff on eBay or recycle it sensibly ?
Would n't it be wonderful if you could digitise such books and pulp the hard copy ?
Think of all the shelf space you 'd save .
" Trust me , it is n't as simple as that , " Peter Fox replies .
I visit the British Library 's digitisation studio in St Pancras to be disabused of my barmy idea that transferring books and journals into cyberspace would be a cheap and painless solution to the problem of where to store the ever - growing mountains of printed material .
There , the British Library is working with Microsoft on a project to digitise 25 million pages of 19th - century literature - 100,000 books from the Library 's collections .
It is a semi- automated process during which 1,000 to 1,200 pages can be scanned an hour , 50,000 a day , or one million a month .
Why were 19th - century books chosen for the British Library - Microsoft project ?
" One key reason is copyright , " says Neil Fitzgerald , digitisation project manager .
" Nineteenth - century material is generally outside copyright restrictions .
The publishers of more recent books may well think there is money to be made by digitising certain books themselves and publishing them , rather than allowing us to put books free online . "
That said , more and more of the British Library 's collections are available on the internet .
Rare historic manuscripts such as William Caxton 's two editions of Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales can be consulted online if you go to bl.uk and follow the links .
Soon Sir Thomas Malory 's stories about King Arthur , known as the Winchester Manuscript , later printed by William Caxton as Le Morte D'Arthur , will be available online , too .
The money for such projects tends to come from private investors .
For instance , Google and the University of Oxford recently came to an agreement to digitise one million of the Bodleian 's books printed before 1885 , and to make them freely available online through Google and the OU 's websites .
Google has similar agreements with Harvard University , Stanford University , Michigan University and the New York Public Library .
One can search these digitised texts for keywords online .
" These developments are quite exciting in terms of access , " says Rory McLeod , digital preservation manager at the British Library .
" Originally our collections were for the cognoscenti who could make it to Bloomsbury .
Now , increasingly , they 're for everybody , wherever they are in the world . "
But , as we sit in the British Library cafe in the shadow of the beautiful King 's Library ( the collection of George III 's books ) , McLeod nearly gags on his americano when I suggest he should digitise everything and , apart from some particularly lovely manuscripts and books , make a huge bonfire of the rest of the stuff , or at least of every autobiography by a footballer under 30 .
" It 's been estimated that €3bn are lost across Europe entirely due to bad management of digital files in libraries , " he says and then asks challengingly : " Would we have enough confidence to throw everything away ?
Would you ? "
The other question is whether legal deposit libraries are sustainable in an era when , one might think , unprecedented levels of trash are published and cash - strapped organisations such as the British Library are responsible for the costs of housing them .
" I think the legal deposit system is a good one , and we should keep with it , " Rory McLeod says .
" After all , what is trash today could become fundamental for tomorrow 's historians .
Even Katie Price 's novels or ephemeral stocking fillers could become essential raw material for understanding our society . "
Russia 's Father Frost is similar to Western Europe 's Santa Claus
The ad for Eto electrical stores stated Father Frost , Russia 's version of Father Christmas , did not exist .
The Federal anti-Monopoly Service said the ad had broken rules for advertisers not to discredit parents and teachers .
It said that declaring that Father Frost did not exist implied that parents were not telling the truth , so undermining childrens ' trust in them .
The ad " induces negative relations between children and parents " , Andrei Kashevarov , the service 's deputy director , told Rossiiskaya Gazeta .
The advertiser , Eto , defended its commercial , saying it was aimed at adults .
And America has many domestic enemies .
Most are members of the " Phony Outrage Base " – pundits who pretend to get angry for ratings , politicians to pretend to get angry for votes , voters who pretend to get angry because they hate themselves and need an outlet to spew their hate .
Over the past few weeks , our domestic enemies , in the form of political pundits , have been railing against John McCain , the probable Republican nominee .
Normally I 'd say , " Hey , they 're turning inward .
That 's a good thing . "
Unfortunately , our enemies are n't stupid .
Rush Limbaugh recently devoted his entire three - hour program to blasting McCain .
Ann Coulter appeared on Hannity and Colmes last week and said she 'd campaign for Hillary Clinton if McCain was the nominee .
Laura Ingraham says she does n't trust McCain .
Michael Reagan , son of the former president , said McCain speaks down to conservatives .
The list goes on , and on .
Go to Human Events Online and try to find a positive article about McCain .
Seriously , go ahead .
Now , let 's ask the question .
What do all of these pundits have in common ?
Give up ?
They all make money by giving their conservative opinion .
Most of those I mentioned came into their own during the Clinton years .
They opportunistically defined themselves as conservatives in the Goldwater - Reagan mold , and Bill Clinton as the devil .
There is no Republican to rally around this year , the way they did George W. Bush .
But of the three left ( no offense Dr. Paul , but I do n't consider you " left " in the Republican race ) , McCain is the most likely to get things done in office .
They would be the wrong things and compromised things , but still , they 'd be things .
Should this happen , the talk radio audience would finally wake up because talk radio would have nothing to talk about .
It would cease to be what it is .
Many would realize , no , Sean Hannity is n't a " great American , " he 's a brat who hates his audience enough to lie to them daily .
If you think Sean Hannity does n't hate you , you probably hate yourself .
If McCain is the president , congressional Republicans will join with him , because that 's what Republicans do , they get in line .
And McCain is a conservative , one of the most conservative members of the Senate .
Sure , he was against the Bush tax cuts , but that 's because he does n't hate the middle and working classes of America , and realized we were in a war .
He wants to save our environment , and that 's because he does n't hate the earth .
He supported immigration reform because he thinks rounding up illegal aliens and dumping them back in Mexico is something Stalin would have done .
Doing nothing – which , it seems , the majority of Republicans are now intent on doing – is something Jimmy Carter would have done .
And for the record , it seems at odd with reality that Republicans would be against environmentalism .
So I have my own theory on that .
The reason Republicans do n't believe in global warming is because they have to pander to their base .
No , not the " Phony Outrage Base , " but close .
This is the base consisting of Evangelicals who home - school their kids because public schools teach evolution .
The ones who believe God made the world in seven crazy nights 5,000 years ago , and put dinosaur bones in the ground to test our faith ... and the sun revolves around the earth .
The ones who believe it would be impossible for humans to kill the earth since we are n't God .
Who would Limbaugh rail against if the Republican president and the Republican congress did things he did n't favor ?
He would be against everyone .
His radio show would be the same as Alex Jones 's : Conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory , all to no purpose , with almost no audience to speak of .
Rush Limbaugh would have to make a new career out of being a 9/11 Truther .

To say that 2008 has not been kind to the HD DVD format is a bit of an understatement .
As the Consumer Electronics Show began , Warner Bros. announced that it would drop support for HD DVD during the first half of 2008 .
Shortly thereafter , HD DVD experienced its worst - ever week of sales .
Today , HD DVD was dealt a couple of big body blows : Netflix announced that it would stop renting movies in the HD DVD format and Best Buy has decided to exclusively recommend Blu-ray players to consumers .
Netflix customers who have HD DVD selected as an option for rentals got a surprising e-mail from the mail - rental giant this morning .
In it , Netflix announced that it would be phasing out support for the format by no longer ordering new HD DVD movies and by not replacing current inventory .
" As you may have heard , most of the major movie studios have recently decided to release their high - definition movies exclusively in the Blu- ray format , " reads the e-mail .
" In order to provide the best selection of high - definition titles for our members , we have decided to go exclusively with Blu-ray as well . "
Customers who have HD DVDs in their saved queues will have them switched to standard - definition DVDs beginning at the end of this month .
Sometime during the second half of the year , Netflix will purge customers ' queues of HD DVD altogether in favor of vanilla DVDs .
Best Buy is jumping on the HD DVD dogpile as well .
Today , the big box consumer electronics retailer announced that it would recommend Blu-ray over HD DVD .
Like Warner Bros. , Best Buy 's rationale for the move is that consumers will ultimately benefit if there 's only one viable HD format to choose from .
" Because we believe that Blu-ray is fast emerging as that single format , we have decided to focus on Blu-ray products , " said Brian Dunn , Best Buy president and CEO in a statement .
" Our decision to shine a spotlight on Blu-ray Disc players and other Blu-ray products is a strong signal to our customers that we believe Blu-ray is the right format choice for them . "
Best Buy did throw HD DVD a bone , saying that it will continue to stock HD DVD products for " customers who desire to purchase these products . "
With blue - clad salespeople aggressively pushing Blu-ray players to consumers looking for something pretty to watch on their HDTVs , the number of such customers is likely to decline .
As the top consumer electronics chain in the US , the significance of Best Buy 's decision to throw its weight behind Blu-ray can't be denied .
Not only will Blu-ray players be featured prominently in the stores , Best Buy 's considerable promotional and advertising might will be backing it as well .
The HD DVD Promotions Group issued a brief statement in response to the news .
" We have long held the belief that HD DVD is the best format for consumers based on quality and value , and with more than 1 million HD DVD players on the market , it 's unfortunate to see Netflix make the decision to only stock Blu-ray titles going forward , " said the group .
" While the Best Buy announcement says they will recommend Blu-ray , at least they will continue to carry HD DVD and offer consumers a choice at retail . "
There was one small glimmer of good news for HD DVD 's backers today .
Data leaked by the NPD Group shows that the hardware sales gap between the two camps closed during the week ending January 26 , according to TWICE ( This Week in Consumer Electronics ) .
Blu -ray 's hardware share reportedly fell from 90 percent a couple of weeks ago to 65 percent .
Deep discounts on HD DVD players likely helped , as some Toshiba players have dropped under $ 120 .
Given the recent HD news , however , sales upticks for HD DVD are certain to become increasingly infrequent .
Now that Blockbuster and Netflix are both backing Blu-ray exclusively , consumers are going to have a hard time finding a place to rent HD DVDs .
With Best Buy in the Blu-ray camp , consumers are going to be less likely to buy HD DVD players .
The opera may not be over , but we can hear the fat lady warming up off stage ... anyone want to buy my Xbox 360 HD DVD player ?

Health reporter , BBC News
Cake maker Mr Kipling 's at it , and so is a growing section of the food industry .
Mushrooms have a protein which tastes just like oil
Transforming the constitution of food , or " reformulating " as it is known , is increasingly seen as a key plank in the campaign against obesity .
If we can't give up the cakes , the cakes will have to change , the thinking goes .
Industry is starting to move relatively quickly on this front : keen to respond to changing consumer demands for " healthier " products and to protect itself from allegations of fuelling fatness .
At one end of the spectrum , companies are quite simply cutting the amount of unhealthy saturated fats in their food : Walker 's Crisps for instance was lauded for starting to cook its crisps in sunseed oil instead of standard cooking fat , slashing the saturated content .
But at the other end , researchers are formulating products which the body processes in quite different ways , taking longer to digest and so keeping you full for longer .
Plus and minus
Taking fat or sugar out of food is not necessarily as straightforward as it sounds .
The product may simply not sit together properly - it is hard for instance to make ice cream bind without sugar , or pastry and chocolate without certain quantities of fat .
REFORMULATED PRODUCTS INCLUDE : Cakes Chips Butter Crisps Soft drinks
Cheeses
Obesity ' not individuals ' fault '
And rather than making it healthy , you could actually make it positively dangerous , the Food Standards Agency warns .
Taking too much saturated fat out of meat pies for example can affect the way the water reacts with the meat , and increase the risk of food poisoning .
The same is true of cake mixture .
Take too much fat out of cheese and it wo n't do the things that consumers like it to do , such as bubble , melt and go brown .
Worst of all , it may end up not tasting like cheese , and researchers are agreed that if these products are to work , and genuinely reduce the nation 's waistlines , they must be virtually indistinguishable from that which they are supposed to emulate .
Tastes like butter
Premier Foods , which makes Mr Kipling new reduced fat cakes , has its own laboratory working out the science behind reformatting foods .
But the public sector is also heavily involved .
The Formulation Engineering Research Centre at the University of Birmingham has been looking at how you replicate the taste and texture of fats .
One particularly promising avenue is the mushroom .
It produces hydrophobins , air cells which protect the fungus from water , but which appear to have the same material properties as oil .
And yet they have no calories .
Because there are no legal constraints around using mushroom extract in food - it is already widely available - this is an ingredient which could be " applied across the whole board very soon " , said Professor Ian Norton .
" It would be suited to anything that is fabricated - mayonnaises , sauces , ice - creams , anything which has a fat content - the texture and taste would be the same and the calorie content dramatically reduced . "
Little by little
But one of the long recognised problems of low - fat foods is how they are used : the fewer the calories , the more you can eat , the mantra goes for some .
Others add so much sugar that the calorie content is ultimately not far off that which they were meant to replace .
Scientists are therefore looking into creating foods that actually change the way the stomach empties .
Adding components used in some acid reflux remedies is one option , as these appear to provide a barrier which slows the rate of digestion down .
But there may be limits to how much the consumer will stomach .
Alongside the increasing demand for healthier options is a renewed emphasis on the " natural " .
This is thought to explain a rise in butter sales in recent years over those of margarine , seen by many as a " chemical " product .
Reformulated food is in any case not the only answer to Britain 's obesity woes .
" There 's also a very important psychological issue too , " says Professor Norton .
" Changing the food is only one part of it , you 've got to change the whole range of attitudes towards food too . "
The people who question the government 's version of 9/11 are n't credible , right ?
Well , let 's see for ourselves :
9/11 COMMISSIONERS
The co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission ( Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton ) said that the CIA ( and likely the White House ) " obstructed our investigation " .
9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton says " I do n't believe for a minute we got everything right " , that the Commission was set up to fail , that people should keep asking questions about 9/11 , that the 9/11 debate should continue , and that the 9/11 Commission report was only " the first draft " of history .
9/11 Commissioner Bob Kerrey said that " There are ample reasons to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in our version . . .
We did n't have access . . . . "
9/11 Commissioner Timothy Roemer said " We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting "
Former 9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland resigned from the Commission , stating : " It is a national scandal " ; " This investigation is now compromised " ; and " One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9 - 11 issue is so important to America .
But this White House wants to cover it up " .
9/11 Commissioner John Lehman said that “ We purposely put together a staff that had – in a way - conflicts of interest " .
The Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission ( John Farmer ) who led the 9/11 staff 's inquiry , said " I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described ....
The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years ....
This is not spin .
This is not true . "
CONGRESS
According to the Co-Chair of the Congressional Inquiry into 9/11 and former Head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , Bob Graham , a U.S. government informant was the landlord to two of the hijackers for over a year ( but the White House refused to let the 9/11 inquiry interview him ) .

REPLACING carbon - rich fossil fuels with more environmentally friendly alternatives should slow global warming .
As part of that drive , both America and Europe have embraced biofuels — liquids derived from plants that can be used to power cars and other vehicles .
By their very nature , biofuels cannot be carbon - free because carbon is essential to life on Earth .
Burning biofuels does indeed release carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas .
The attraction is that the volume of gas released exactly matches that taken up by the plant when it was growing .
So overall ( and with the huge proviso that you do not count the fossil fuel used to farm the stuff ) biofuels are carbon - neutral .
In America the Department of Energy has set a target for 30 % of the 2004 gasoline demand for vehicles to be met by biofuels by 2030 .
The European Union wants 25 % of transport fuels to be derived from biofuels by the same date .
At present , the most widely used substance is ethanol , which can be made from sugar cane , sugar beet and maize ( or corn , as it is called in America ) .
But ethanol does not pack a particularly powerful punch .
It is also susceptible to absorbing water , further diluting its oomph .
It takes days to ferment the stuff .
A biofuel that did not suffer from these limitations would be welcome .
That is what a team led by James Dumesic of the University of Wisconsin - Madison claims to have developed .
The researchers think they have devised a biofuel that has a 40 % higher energy density than ethanol , that repels water and that can be made relatively speedily .
One of the most frustrating aspects of biofuels is the stark contrast between what exists in nature and what you can put in the tank .
Plants are rich in carbohydrates , a group of organic compounds based on carbon and water , itself a combination of hydrogen and oxygen .
These carbohydrates take the form of chains of thousands of sugar units ; each unit contains six carbon atoms and a similar number of oxygen atoms .
An ideal fuel , on the other hand , should lack oxygen .
Its molecules should also be small , that is , they should contain few carbon atoms .
Creating an efficient fuel from plants thus presents a headache .
To date , scientists have approached the problem by taking one of two routes .
The chemists have tinkered with heat and metal catalysts to refine their materials .
Biologists , meanwhile , have recruited enzymes and microbes to do the job .
The team led by Dr Dumesic combined the two methods .
It was thus able to break down long carbohydrate chains to form small , useable molecules while simultaneously removing the oxygen and maintaining the energy content of the biofuel .
The researchers began by using enzymes to snip the carbohydrates into fragments that were then rearranged to form a sugar called fructose , which is found in fruits .
They doused the fructose in acid , which catalysed a chemical reaction expelling oxygen atoms as water molecules .
The researchers immediately added a second catalyst and some hydrogen , which eliminated more oxygen .
The result was a fuel called “ 2,5 - dimethylfuran ” .
The process is written up in this week 's issue of Nature .
The new biofuel can be made directly from fructose , which is present in fruits such as apples , pears , berries and melons as well as some root vegetables .
It can also be manufactured from the large polymer chains found in cereals , grasses and trees .
Perhaps the most promising method , from a biochemical point of view , would be to use glucose , a sugar common in food .
The resulting biofuel is not only energy - rich and water repellent but it also has a higher boiling point than ethanol .
Keeping it liquid in a vehicle 's fuel tank should therefore be straightforward .
But this biofuel shares a disadvantage with ethanol : its raw material is food .
Ideally , biofuels would be made from waste farm products rather than crops .
That way , the chaff could be used to produce biofuel for transport and the wheat could be used for people .
Unfortunately for science , nature conspires against this .
Plants have evolved chemical and structural properties that make it difficult to break them down .
One possibility would be to use genetic modification to create plants that are more amenable to such manipulation .
Another is to use existing chemical or biological techniques , or to combine the approaches , rather as Dr Dumesic and his colleagues have done .
Whichever works best , the second generation of biofuels is coming down the pipeline .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
In 1999 , best - selling author Paulo Coelho , who wrote " The Alchemist , " was failing in Russia .
That year he sold only about 1,000 books , and his Russian publisher dropped him .
But after he found another , Coelho took a radical step .
On his own Web site , launched in 1996 , he posted a digital Russian copy of " The Alchemist . "
With no additional promotion , print sales picked up immediately .
Within a year he sold 10,000 copies ; the next year around 100,000 .
By 2002 he was selling a total of a million copies of multiple titles .
Today , Coelho 's sales in Russian are over 10 million and growing .
" I 'm convinced it was putting it up for free on the Internet that made the difference , " he said in an interview at this year 's World Economic Forum in Davos .
Coelho , whose fiction explores universal themes of spiritual aspiration and brotherhood in unpretentious language , has been a star of the Forum for 11 years .
( For an account of Davos 2008 see this column . )
Before this year 's Davos , both Coelho and I attended a wonderful conference in Munich called Digital , Life , Design .
Onstage there he told the surprising story of his embrace of free Internet distribution .
In Davos I sat down with him to learn more .
Coelho explained why he thinks giving books away online leads to selling more copies in print : " It 's very difficult to read a book on your computer .
People start printing out their own copies .
But if they like the book , after reading 30 - 40 pages they just go out and buy it . "
Intrigued by his growing sales in Russia , Coelho used the Bittorrent site - a favorite for illicit distribution of media - to seek out and download online translations of his books as well as audio versions .
By 2006 he was hosting an entire sub - site he called The Pirate Coelho , with links to books in many languages .
While he did not play up his own role , he did quietly include a link on his official site .
" So you gather together all the stolen digital versions ? " I asked him .
" You say steal ? " he replied .
" No .
I think it 's a way of sharing . "
His agent , Monica Antunes , who joined in the interview , chimed in unashamedly , " We do n't own the translation rights to all those editions . "
By last year Coelho 's total print sales worldwide surpassed 100 million books .
" Once we did the Pirate Coelho there was a significant boost , " he says .
For all this , he kept quiet with his many publishers in countries around the world .
" Sharing " is typically not the word they use to describe such activities .
Coelho says the publishers have periodically taken action to remove books from the Pirate Coelho .
" They think it is against me .
They do n't know it is in my favor .
They will know it after your article , " he says .
" Publishing is in a kind of Jurassic age , " Coelho continues .
" Publishers see free downloads as threatening the sales of the book .
But this should make them rethink their entire business model . "
Now Coelho is a convert to the Internet way of doing things .
His online e-mail newsletter , published since 2000 , has 200,000 subscribers .
In 2006 he started blogging .
Last year he joined MySpace and Facebook to interact more actively with readers .
" MySpace is an addiction , " he says ruefully .
He also makes available an extensive archive of rights - free photos on the Flickr photo - sharing site .
None of Coelho 's books has ever been made into a movie .
But now he is using the Internet to let his readers make one for him , based on his latest book , The " Witch of Portobello . "
It tells the story of its protagonist from the point of view of multiple people who knew her at various times in her peripatetic life .
Now Coelho and Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) have created a competition , inviting anyone worldwide to submit a segment as they envision it .
Coelho plans to knit together 15 winners and release the film .
He spends about three hours online every day , interacting with readers who send him over 1,000 e-mails and messages daily .
A fulltime staff of six helps manage his manifold Net activities , and the entire operation costs him $ 15,000 each month , which he pays out of his own pocket .
" I do n't understand why publishers do n't understand that this new medium is not killing books , " Coelho says .
" I 'm doing it mostly because the joy of a writer is to be read .
But at the end of the day , you will sell more books . "
Americans Suck Dick For Gas Money
Vlad Kalashnikov ( Email ) on March 20 , 2008
VLAD'S DAILY GLOAT
I was preparing to begin today 's Daily Gloat about retarded maniac George Bush telling the United States of Dumbfucks that the war in Iraq is " worth it , " but then a reader with a French - sounding name , Gilles , linked me to the funniest story of the year :
An American woman in Arizona is reported to offer a guy a blowjob for gas money !
A Maricopa County Sheriff ’s Office spokesman says 43 - year - old Kelli Still appeared at the home of an acquaintance near University Drive and Ellsworth Road .
Deputies claim Still intended to barter oral sex for gas money .
Instead , Still is accused of using a pair of scissors to stab Michael Hamilton several times .
When deputies arrived , both Still and Hamilton were bloody .
Still was eventually booked in the 4th Avenue Jail on aggravated assault charges .
What happened to the country that is the " world 's only superpower " ?
In just a couple of years you went from " world 's policemen " to " world 's clowns " to your new role as " world 's train station whores . "
For guys like me , or French people like Gilles , or just about anybody on this planet who hates your dumbfuck guts , you give us free comedy entertainment every day .
And if I am eating a business lunch and I decide , " I think I want my dick sucked now , " then I know that I only need to call up some American woman , offer her gas money , which for people who earn money in real currencies like the Euro or Ruble , gasoline is not all that expensive , so that means a blowjob from an American woman is also just pocket change for us .
AMERICAN MOVIE STARS TEACH FRIGHTENED PUBLIC HOW TO EARN GAS MONEY
Really , do n't you Americans even have one drop of dignity ?
It hurts to live in an empire that is collapsing , but jesus christ man , you have to have just one little tiny milligram of dignity .
No , that 's asking too much of you pigs .
The story is the perfect snapshot of America today : sucking a dick for a tank of gasoline , then she attacked the john with some scissors because that is all Americans know how to do : either on their knees sucking a dick , or with a knife trying to kill you .
What a bunch of fucking animals , we should sterilize you freaks .
The end of this story is perfect : the dick - sucker is now in jail , and the whole world is laughing at her , just like we laugh at the loser America .

I thought it was funny when the bloodthirsty retard George Bush told his retarded countrymen that the 5 - year war in Iraq is " worth it , " and the man is not attacked by angry mobs and set on fire .
No mobs , because Americans are too passive , too brainwashed , too peasant - like to argue with a bloodthirsty son of an oligarch .
That is good for me , good for Russia , good for France , good for the entire world that does not want your fucking presence .
Thank you for continuing your self - destruction in Iraq , dumbfuckers !
That means you will keep going down the toilet , piece by piece , into the sewer of history where you belong .
I only wonder how long the smell you made will linger .

Business was booming .
Smartypants
Software was selling licenses for their fancy new web portal software about as fast as they could generate license keys .
Developers were working later and later into the night , and the tech support staff could hardly catch their breath between calls .
Management knew they had a big problem on their hands , though they acknowledged that having too many customers is a good problem .
There was one bad problem , though — they were turning dozens of customers down who wanted to purchase a Java version of the portal software .
So amid all the chaos , they began working on the new version of the software .
They began a hiring frenzy .
With all the cash they had rolling in , however , they could afford to hire the best in the field .
By offering salaries well above the average , they attracted a gaggle of developers and began scheduling interviews .
Most of the applicants had solid experience with ASP , but only a half dozen had any meaningful Java experience .
Since Danny L. was the stronger of two members of the existing staff who had worked with Java before , he assumed the lead role and was included in the technical portion of the interviews .
And , sadly , none of them were strong enough to help them out .
Smartypants was looking for candidates that could work well under pressure and with minimal supervision .
And they had to be ready to hit the ground running , working on day one .
Danny was under some intense stress with the long hours , meetings , and interviews .
On a Thursday night , he stopped by a bar and treated himself to a beer .
And another .
And ... an indeterminate number more .
Waking up with a hangover the next morning , he decided he'd be better off staying in .
After all , he was pulling 10 - 12 hour days ; he needed a long weekend .
Feeling refreshed on Monday morning , he was happy to learn that an interview conducted on Friday resulted in a new Java guy , " Jon " .
Danny was happy to be relieved of some of the burden of developing the Java version .
Even better , he had no meetings or interviews scheduled for the day .
He could meet Jon and then have a full day with no interruptions .
As the team lead , Danny wanted to meet Jon .
He sent an email requesting that Jon stop by his desk at some point , and not five minutes later he arrived .
" Hi , Danny , I'm Jon. Pleased to meet you ! "
Everything about Jon was professional .
He dressed well , spoke confidently and politely , and always had a smile on his face .
Danny casually asked Jon some things he would 've asked during the interview — past jobs , projects , experience , etc .
Jon answered each question perfectly .
His past work had been on large and small projects , all of which sounded pretty difficult , requiring advanced technical knowledge .
Danny did n't want to grill him , though ; Jon had already passed his interview , after all .
Danny sent Jon back to his desk with a few weeks ' worth of work , telling Jon that he'd be back to check on him and make sure he was settled in .
Jon smiled , reiterated his excitement about the work , shook Danny 's hand firmly , and left .
After a few hours of responding to emails and coding , Danny decided to check on Jon .
He wandered the labyrinthine system of cubicles , but could n't find him .
Danny returned to his desk and sent Jon an email to find out where he sat .
" I 'm in office 407 , the one in the corner , " he responded .
They gave him an office ?
Danny thought .
In fact , it was the exact office that had been promised to Danny .
When Danny saw his boss later , he asked about the office .
" Well , we think that Jon 's a really sharp guy .
In fact , you might be reporting to him soon ! "
Danny was surprised — all this praise seemed premature .
While Jon had done some impressive - sounding work at past jobs , he had yet to prove himself at Smartypants .
Danny told himself that he was just being petty .
Jon was going to prove himself sooner or later .
He 'd been steadily reporting that everything was going great , and that he was almost done with his work .
When Danny stopped by to review Jon 's code and give him his next assignment , Jon mentioned that a few things might not work .
" I was having problems with just a few minor things .
Can you lend me a hand ? "
Jon 's problems seemed pretty simple to Danny , and spoke cautiously to avoid insulting Jon 's intelligence .
After working through some of the issues , Danny promised to email Jon some pseudocode to resolve his problems .
" Try this , " Danny wrote ,
if authobject is null create authobject call authobject.
authenticate method with username , password call authobject .
hasrole for " admin "
Jon replied to the email the next day .
" Thanks , I think that we 're moving in the right direction , " he began .
" But it still does n't work exactly .
I 'm getting an error about ' authobject ' is null or not an object .
I 'm getting errors about ' is , ' ' authobject , ' ' with username , ' and a bunch of others .
I think this might have made things worse .
I 've checked it all in if you can take a look . "
It did n't take long for Jon to get fired .
He 'd changed one file , adding Danny 's pseudocode and checking it in .
Later that day , Danny went to talk to the other developer on his team , who would sit in on interviews that Danny could n't attend .
" Craig , it seems like we dramatically overestimated Jon 's technical skills .
Did you go through some of the technical questions on our checklist ? "
" Me ?!
I thought you hired him !
I was going to ask you the same thing ! "
Craig went on to explain that he'd been sick on Friday and taken the day off as well .
With no one around to conduct the interview , Jon had chatted up the secretary while she tried to find someone to interview him .
He was charming , well dressed , smart , and would , by her estimation , fit in well with the staff .
She sent a glowing email to Danny 's bosses , who turned around and made an offer to Jon .
Hedonist Philosopher Epicurus Was Right About Happiness ( Mostly )
“ If a little is not enough for you , nothing is . ” – Epicurus
Philosophers down the ages have been keen to tell the rest of us how to live and how to be happy .
Certainly their advice comes to us with the lustre of intellectual achievement ; it is both high - brow and high - powered , but can we understand any of it and how does it fare against modern psychological research ?
One philosopher who dispensed clear advice about how to live a happy life was Epicurus , a Greek who lived in the third century B.C. .
In a new article in the Journal of Happiness Studies , Bergsma , Poot and Liefbroer ( in press ) explain Epicurus ’ guide to the good life and then compare it with some of the huge body of work in psychology looking at satisfaction with life .
Especially now as we launch ourselves into a New Year it is worth thinking about what both philosophy and psychology have to teach us about how to live the good life .
Epicurean hedonism
Epicurus was a hedonist , but not in the popular modern sense .
Now we tend to associate hedonism with excessive pleasure - seeking or with refined sensual pleasure .
What Epicurus meant , though , was something more subtle ; he certainly did n’t think the road to happiness was paved with luxury or material wealth .
What he emphasised was the idea of being ‘ untroubled ’ .
Epicurus thought pleasure and pain were at the centre of human morality .
His view was that pleasure and pain are so important to human existence that all our actions are governed by seeking pleasure and trying to avoid pain .
Epicurus also saw the absence of pain as a pleasure in itself .
Of course there is both bodily or physical pain and there is psychological pain .
Epicurus emphasised the idea of being ‘ untroubled ’ over the positive experiences of pleasure .
He thought the good life could be achieved through satisfaction that both body and mind are at peace .
Self - help , Epicurean style
So far so good for the abstract philosophical concepts , but what about practicalities ?
How exactly did Epicurus think we could bring peace to both mind and body ?
In order to keep the body content and the mind free from fears , he advocated a ‘ four - part cure ’ :
1 . Do n’t fear the gods ( or fate , or blind chance )
Surprisingly , Epicurus ’ approach to the gods fits in well even in our godless times .
For Epicurus the gods were already in a state of bliss and therefore are n’t bothered with human activities .
We therefore have nothing to fear from them and should also expect nothing from them .
If you are not a religious person , then perhaps this edict is better thought of as : do n’t fear fate or blind chance , because neither of them care about us .
Practically , then , it is up to each of us to create order in our lives , because the gods ( or fate or chance ) will not do it for us .
We must meet our own needs and manage threats that inevitably arise .
2 . Do n’t worry about death
Easier said than done maybe but Epicurus had a rational approach to death .
He saw it as the end of sense experience , as a point of transition which should not concern us .
While we are alive death is not important as it does not yet exist ; in other words , we ’re still alive !
Equally when we ’re dead , we can no longer experience anything so it ’s still not important ( Epicurus did n’t believe in life after death or the soul ’s immortality ) .
3 . What is good is easy to get
This is a controversial one but could n’t be more relevant in today ’s consumer culture .
Here Epicurus makes an important distinction between what is necessary and what is unnecessary .
Necessary and natural things include the basics of life like food and shelter .
Unnecessary and unnatural things include fame , excessive wealth or honours .
Even within the natural things Epicurus made a distinction between the necessary and the unnecessary .
For example bread will satisfy hunger just as well as lobster .
Unfortunately getting a taste for lobster might well prove a recipe for future unhappiness , say when you ca n’t afford it any more .
Bread , though , will usually remain in most people ’s price range .
That said , Epicurus was n’t totally against the odd indulgence .
Indeed he thought that someone who could enjoy the simple pleasures of life would enjoy extravagance even more when it came along .
Generally , however , he was very much in favour of moderation .
Epicurus thought the beauty of learning to love the simple life was that it is much more durable .
When you do n’t get the promotion , ca n’t repay the mortgage or lose it all in a game of cards , it ’s much easier to shrug it off .
The more you have ( or want ) , the more you have to lose ( or fail to get ) .
4 . What is terrible is easy to endure
Epicurus thought that even physical pain could be endured by using the mind .
Focussing on pleasure , both that experienced in the past and that to come in the future , can help distract us from current bodily discomfort .
Apart from this four - part cure there were a number of other important strands to Epicurus ’ philosophy .
Philosophy
Unsurprisingly Epicurus thought the study of philosophy was central to happiness .
Philosophy can help us deal with both our fear of death and our fear of the gods .
Friendship
Epicurus thought friendship was one of the most important aspects of the good life .
Not only does it give us many benefits , it also benefits our friends as well .
In contrast , Epicurus advised against getting married .
He was n’t that impressed with sex either saying we should count ourselves lucky if sex did n’t cause anyone any harm ( ! ) .
Prudence
Here in the UK the word ‘ prudence ’ is a cliche thanks to its overuse by former Chancellor and current Prime Minister , Gordon Brown .
But actually the idea of prudence was highly valued by Epicurus .
Prudence for Epicurus is an excellent way of making decisions .
All decisions can be seen as leading to pleasure or pain .
Thinking ahead , planning for the future with these possible outcomes in mind will help lead to a pleasurable life .
Security
Here Epicurus was concerned with how best to secure peace of mind for ourselves when our neighbours provide a threat , at both the individual and societal levels .
Epicurus advised that the best solution was to lead a private life without engaging in politics , business or law .
Instead , Epicurus advised surrounding oneself with like - minded friends with whom social contracts could ensure a quiet life .
Epicurus himself chose to live in a commune .
Modern psychology ’s view of Epicurean self - help
So , was Epicurus right ?
We can get an idea by comparing his advice with what modern psychology has observed from a huge body of research on life satisfaction ( Bergsma , Poot & Liefbroer , in press ) .
Before piling on the praise , let ’s look at the negative points .
While doing so , though , it ’s worth remembering that Epicurus ’ advice is more than two millennia old .
Needless to say , society has changed more than a bit since then .
1. Epicurus was wrong about the detached life and commune living
The reason Epicurus counselled against getting involved in society was that he thought it was a source of stress and unhappiness .
Historically , argue Bergsma and colleagues , the time in which Epicurus lived was politically volatile and his advice made sense in that context .
Nowadays , though , in relatively peaceful societies , this is less relevant .
Modern research shows there is a correlation between higher levels of happiness and those who are more involved in society .
Epicurus ’ advice was probably more relevant in his own time than it is now .
Bergsma and colleagues also argue that living in a commune , where essentially one size is supposed to fit all , will not suit many people .
2. Epicurus was wrong about avoiding marriage
Generally speaking married people , and people who live together as if they ’re married , are happier .
This is a gross generalisation and needs to be acknowledged as such .
For example , nowadays in many societies people are much more likely to divorce , and divorce is often very bad for happiness .
Even taking this into account , though , Bergsma and colleagues argue that people are more happy if they give marriage a try and fail , than if they never tried .
The worst that can be said of marriage is , on average , it does n’t make us any less happy .
3 . Pleasure is not the opposite of pain
Modern psychology has revealed that pleasure is n’t the absence of pain , rather positive and negative affect are independent .
Positive emotions have so many other positive knock - on effects that Epicurus is probably wrong to downplay them in favour of the absence of pain .
To take just one example , positive affect increases activity and sociability which are both highly likely to lead to greater happiness in the long - term .
What Epicurus got right
Epicurus was , though , right about a lot , including :
1 . Using cognitive strategies to deal with death and pain
Some things in life we ca n’t change – the fact that we will die is one of them , for some people pain and / or disease is another .
Epicurus advised that we should deal with these through acceptance and adjusting our attitude .
This clearly chimes with modern cognitive - behavioural therapy which focuses on changing psychological responses to inevitable stressors .
2. Friendships matter more than status or money
Social bonds are highly correlated with happiness , whereas having more money does n’t necessarily equal higher happiness .
See this study I reported recently .
3 . Happiness comes from moderate varied pleasure
Recent experimental evidence has shown that varied enjoyable day - to - day activities lead to increased levels of happiness ( Sheldon & Lyubomirsky , 2006 )
Well done Epicurus !
Altogether I do n’t think that ’s too bad a showing for two - thousand - year - old advice !
I would argue that Epicurus ’ only serious blunder was thinking that pleasure is the opposite of pain and that pain should be avoided at all costs .
The advice about avoiding marriage and leading a detached life were probably historically accurate but now redundant pieces of advice .
On the other hand the importance of friendship , varied activities and cognitive strategies were all pretty much on the spot .
When you consider that his main aim was helping people avoid unnecessary unhappiness , he actually did rather well .

------------------------------Posted by Bev Harris on Tuesday , February 5 , 2008 - 9:40 pm : I just interviewed a gentleman in Boulder , Colorado who provided a detailed report .
He was one of the caucus officials ( chairman ?
captain ?
not sure of the lingo ) .
They hand counted the ballots and the two elderly ladies counted them wrong .
He corrected them .
He carefully wrote down the correct information .
While he was doing this , one of the elderly ladies was grabbing at the envelope ; she ultimately did take the envelope and hurry away with it .
She then dropped the envelope and as she was picking it up , thegentleman I interviewed ( who does have a name , which I 'll release withhis permission when he signs an affidavit ) -- anyway , he witnessed hertake a ballot ( which he had NOT seen fall out of the envelope ) and putit into the envelope .
He noticed that , while all the ballots werefolded , this one was not folded .
She stated that she was bringing the envelope to where the Republicanswere putting all the ballots together .
He asked her where this wouldbe , so he could go there too .
She said she might " stop at her home " onthe way .
He called me initially , quite shaken , trying to learn where the Boulder County Republicans were convening .
I do not know .
The miscounts were against Ron Paul .
The extra ballot inserted was forRomney .
He expressed amazement that these two seemingly nice elderlyladies were involved in cheating , both on the count and , the one lady , with the ballot stuffing .
I should mention that the attendance in hisprecinct was low , and even a few ballots would skew the count .
As we know , in Iowa it was quite a delay before we could get precinctresults from the caucus .
I am unsure as to how promptly Colorado willrelease precinct results , or even IF they will .------------------------------------------------------------Use this link to go directly to full article :
Things you might not know about Bruce Schneier
Uh-oh !
Could foul - mouthed Sally Kern ’s secret be out of the bag ?
The Oklahoma lawmaker ’s homophobic remarks have been the talk of the town recently , especially her assertion that gay folk are infiltrating schools to indoctrinate children .
And , sensing a critical national spotlight , Kern made a very suspicious change to her official government homepage .
If you compare a March 4th cache and today ’s version , you ’ll notice that Kern and / or her staff deleted a biographical sentence mentioning her two adult sons , Jesse and Nathan .
Obviously our warning bells went off , so we did a little digging and found something quite queer .
Consider comment seventeen on this Tulsa World article : “ How come no - one asks this “ supposed ” christian woman .. about her own GAY son ?
The one she basically has dis - owned … ahh so christian . ”
What ?!
Kern and her Baptist preacher hubbie had a homo ?
And they disowned him ?
That ’s some Alan Keyes shit …
A little more digital detective work dug up numerous postings naming Jesse as the outcast offspring .
One even recalls Jesse ’s time at Oklahoma Baptist University , where he was apparently “ the biggest queen on campus ” :
I find it hilarious that Salacious Sally is such a bigot .
Her son Jesse was the biggest queen on the campus of OBU in the mid-90’s .
Twice he almost was expelled for making inappropriate advances in the library toilets .
When he was n’t cruising the toilets he was in the glee club and a piano major … there ’s your sign .
Another comment , punches holes through Kern ’s religious extremism and suggests Jesse ’s homosexuality pushed Sally Kern over the edge :
Jesse Kern , Sally ’s son , was raised in a strict Baptist environment .
If your claims are true then you must blame her and her husband for his turning out that way .
Most gays are n’t out there breaking the law and engaging in public sex acts and solicitation .
Jesse chose criminal behavior to act out on his desires .
…
I see in this foolish woman much anger and resentment .
Her beliefs are challenged within herself , because if she stands by them then she must accept her part in her son being a homosexual .
She is n’t strong enough to do that .
Instead , she has created a paranoid delusion that there is some vast conspiracy of gays infiltrating schools and governments to turn others gay and force their lifestyles on everyone .
Her subconscious has created this great gay evil so she does n’t have to blame herself and she says her son as a victim .
Had the gays infiltrated Jesse ’s school and indoctrinated him then ?
Funny , how he attended Baptist schools .
His attendence [ sic ] at Oklahoma Baptist University was marred by his repeated censure for cruising the school ’s toilets .
Had he been able to live his life openly he would not have had to engage in such actions .
Woof .
Those are some allegations !
And potentially disastrous for “ family friendly ” Kern .
It also makes you wonder how Kern and her ilk sleep at night – and whether they understand the concept of “ hell ” .
Jon Carroll
A while back I expressed some doubt about whether Mother Jones could be an effective magazine with two editors .
I have been in co-editing situations , and the dynamic often makes the process of putting out the magazine more about power than content .
It was suggested to me that because the co-editors ( Monika Bauerlein and Clara Jeffery ) were women , the collaboration might be smoother .
Again , my experience ( which I would , of course , make no generalizations from ) is that women are not immune from quarrels over authority and control , although women do work collaboratively on specific projects much better than men .
Anyway , that was all theory .
Now we have had a look at the practice , and oh boy , was I wrong .
Mother Jones right now is as good as I 've ever seen it .
I 'm not sure what they 're doing right , but they should keep at it .
( Full disclosure : I once wrote an article for Mother Jones , but that was five editors ago .
I do n't recognize any of the names on the masthead except Adam Hochschild , and I think Hochschild is to Mother Jones as Colonel Sanders is to KFC , and his name and image will appear in the magazine long after his physical body has returned to the deep black earth . )
The editors seem aware of Mother Jones ' historical problem :
Its urgent sense of mission has led to too many issues of the magazine bathed in High Seriousness , very ideologically pure but not very useful for general readers .
A mass - market magazine is popular journalism , and being entertaining is not the same thing as being bought out by the soulless devils of capitalism .
The current version of Mother Jones is almost rollicking .
A lot of the information is packaged in bite - size data pockets , useful koans to use in meditating on corruption , scandal and greed .
In the current issue ( September - October ; stick figure on a blackboard cover ) has a two - page bushel o' factoids written by Dave Gilson about the credit crunch .
It includes such interesting tidbits as :
The average U.S. household owes $ 9,658 on its credit cards .
Sixty percent of Americans have been in credit card debt for more than one year .
People who pay off their credit cards bills in full every month are known in the industry as " 30 - day - wonders " or " deadbeats . "
A " preferred customer " is one with " a taste for credit " who 's " willing to make minimum monthly payments - forever . "
And my favorite : Americans owe $ 850 billion in credit card debt .
The world 's 54 poorest countries owe $ 412 billion in foreign debt .
Another feature is called " Heckuva Job " and presents profiles of current administration officials who have landed on their feet despite well - publicized failings and misdeeds .
Then there 's Mother Jones ' annual campus activism roundup , which includes this paragraph :
" It was a brilliant way to get attention from the nostalgic lefty press : reviving Students for the Democratic Society .
Since being reconstituted last year , ' New SDS ' has opened chapters in 148 colleges and 50 high schools .
It 's got some new tricks , such as SDSwiki - because there 's nothing like a wiki to prevent the kind of infighting and petty bickering that doomed its predecessor . "
Mordant satirical humor !
In Mother Jones !
Life is good !
The center of the magazine still belongs to the kind of investigative reporting that Mother Jones has done so well for so long .
The cover story , by Jennifer Gonnerman , is summed up in its subhead : " Eight states are sending mentally retarded and emotionally troubled kids to a facility that punishes them with painful electric shocks .
How many times do you have to zap a child before it 's torture ? "
The article is about a place called the Judge Rotenberg Center in Massachusetts , which does indeed administer punitive electric shocks to the children in its care .
The story includes a link to Mother Jones online ( motherjones.com ) , which provides a bunch of primary documents and interviews supporting the facts in the story .
Would that every print publication used its Web presence that way .
The Mother Jones Web site is a lot more than a digitized magazine ; it 's a really splendid collection of breaking news and blogs , much in the manner of the Huffington Post but without the HP 's reliance on provocative personalities .
It 's a really good site ; please go visit it and get its click rate up .
Other stories in the magazine include a look at Hillary Clinton 's prayer circle ( very real ; too real ) ; an extremely good essay by Ted Genoways on fake news found in places other than Fox News ; and a brilliant photo essay about the effects of global warming on the small arctic village of Shishmaref .
Subscriptions are a low , low $ 24 per annum .

Mr. Millan ’s sexism is laughable ; his ethology is outdated .
The notion of the “ alpha pack leader ” dominating all other pack members is derived from studies of captive packs of unrelated wolves and thus bears no relationship to the social structure of natural packs , according to L. David Mech , one of the world ’s leading wolf experts .
In the wild , the alpha wolves are merely the breeding pair , and the pack is generally comprised of their juvenile offspring and pups .
“ The typical wolf pack , ” Dr. Mech wrote in The Canadian Journal of Zoology in 1999 , “ is a family , with the adult parents guiding the activities of a group in a division - of - labor system . ”
In a natural wolf pack , “ dominance contests with other wolves are rare , if they exist at all , ” he writes .
That ’s a far cry from the dominance model that Mr. Millan attributes to the innate need of dogs by way of wolves .
Unlike their wolf forebears , dogs exist in human society .
They have been selectively bred for 15,000 or more years to live with people .
Studies have shown that almost from birth they are attentive to people , and that most are eager to please , given proper instruction and encouragement .
But sometimes the relationship goes very wrong , and it is time to call on a professional .
Aggression is perhaps the most significant of the behavioral problems that may afflict more than 20 percent of the nation ’s 65 million dogs , because it can lead to injury and death .
Mr. Millan often treats aggression by forcing the dog to exercise extensively on a treadmill , by asserting his authority over the dog by rolling it on its back in the “ alpha rollover , ” and through other forms of intimidation , including exposure to his pack of dogs .
Forcefully rolling a big dog on its back was once recommended as a way to establish dominance , but it is now recognized as a good way to get bitten .
People are advised not to try it .
In fact , many animal behaviorists believe that in the long run meeting aggression with aggression breeds more aggression .
More important , aggression often has underlying medical causes that might not be readily apparent — hip dysplasia or some other hidden physical ailment that causes the dog to bite out of pain ; hereditary forms of sudden rage that require a medical history and genealogy to diagnose ; inadequate blood flow to the brain or a congenital brain malformation that produces aggression and can only be uncovered through a medical examination .
Veterinary behaviorists , having found that many aggressive dogs suffer from low levels of serotonin , have had success in treating such dogs with fluoxetine ( the drug better known as Prozac ) .
Properly treating aggression , phobias , anxiety and fears from the start can literally save time and money .
Mr. Millan ’s quick fix might make for good television and might even produce lasting results in some cases .
But it flies in the face of what professional animal behaviorists — either trained and certified veterinarians or ethologists — have learned about normal and abnormal behavior in dogs .

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict apparently does not disturb and even encourages Arab internet users from consuming kosher Hebrew porn .
Operators of a number of porn sites report that between two and 10 % of their users arrive from Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia , Tunisia , Jordan , Egypt , and the Palestinian Authority .
Some websites even go as far as offering services in Arabic .
Nir Shahar , who manages the Israeli porn website , ' Ratuv ' ( wet ) , said that his company produced porn movies that have typical Israeli themes featuring female soldiers , female Mossad agents and policewomen .
It turns out there is a high demand for such content even in countries that are defined as " enemy sates . "
The most popular video clip among Arabs , " Code name : Deep investigation , " is described as " a parody dealing with the Vanunu affair with agents investigating the affair using erotic means . "
In the past several months we see an increase in traffic from countries that have no diplomatic ties with Israel including Iran , Iraq , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Egypt , " Shahar said .
Due to the demand , Shahar added an Arabic version of the site .
" We received many thank you messages from Arab surfers .
Many of whom asked if the female soldiers really serve in the IDF , " he said .
Looking at photos
" We get hundreds of hits from surfers that live in countries where porn is prohibited , " said Gil Naftali owner and operator of another Hebrew sex site , SexV .
" We do n't have an Arabic version because users log in to watch photos and video clips that require no explanations . "
According to site statistics , last month there were over 2,000 hits from Riad , the capital of Saudi Arabia .
The average time a Saudi surfer spends on SexV is 17:23 minutes .
Data also shows that 10 percent of the visitors to the most popular sex site in Israel , Domina , are Arabic speakers .
" That is because we offer content in their language , " said Tzahi who operates the site .
Nothing seems to stop the porn- consuming Saudi , not even technical difficulties : " In many places Israel is blocked , at times the entire suffix " .co.il " is blocked .
Users connect through proxy servers and reach us that way , " he said .
The motive behind these initiatives is purely economical , and by means the desire to connect people through the international language of porn .
" Israeli and Arab surfers do not communicate on the website .
Ideology ?
No , it 's purely business , " Tzahi laughed .
" Porn will not bring about peace but at least we get some money out of our enemies ' pockets . "
HOUSTON  Crude oil closed above $ 100 a barrel for the first time on Tuesday afternoon , vaulting through a longstanding psychological barrier amid persistent concern about whether production can keep up with rising global demand .
The day ’s price rise of more than 4 percent capped a weeklong run-up that began when President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela threatened to cut off oil exports to the United States over a legal struggle with ExxonMobil .
Just as Mr. Chávez appeared to back off from his threats , an explosion at a Texas refinery on Monday reminded traders and hedge fund managers of the gasoline shortages and price increases that accompanied similar refinery failures last year .
Even though the Alon USA refinery at Big Spring , Tex. , was relatively small and American inventories are considered adequate , traders and hedge funds took the explosion as a buying signal .
“ With this credit crisis going on , everyone is on edge and the slightest disruption in crude oil or its products takes prices right up , ” said Michael Rose , director of the energy trading desk at Angus Jackson in Fort Lauderdale , Fla .
“ Prices are going to go higher before they go lower . ”
Americans have been visiting national parks and other natural reserves less and less since 1987 , new research confirms .
Outdoor pursuits , ranging from camping to hunting , have entered a persistent and growing decline .
" Folks are going out into nature much less and decreasingly every year , " says conservation ecologist Patricia Zaradic of the Environmental Leadership Program and co-author of the report published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA .
" It would take 80 million more visits this year to get the per capita number back up to the level it was in 1987 . "
Zaradic and her colleague conservation biologist Oliver Pergams of the University of Illinois at Chicago analyzed trends in visits to national parks and forests , state parks , surveys on camping and the number of licenses for activities such as hunting or fishing .
All peaked between 1981 and 1991 after 50 years of steady increase and have been declining at roughly 1 percent per year since for an overall drop of as much as 25 percent .
Even a slight increase in the frequency of hiking and backpacking trips did nothing to offset the overall decline .
" The average American backpacked once every 12.5 years in the past and [ is ] now backpacking once every 10 years , " Zaradic notes .
Similar data on park visits in Japan and Spain showed the same trend .
" It looks like , clearly from the Japan data , that this may be an international problem , " she says .
The conservationists believe that the electronic world has supplanted the natural world as the leading diversion .
Their statistical analysis shows that the increase in video games , movie rentals and other electronic entertainment most closely matches the decrease in camping and park visits , as opposed to income , vacation time , park overcrowding , foreign travel or other potential causes .
But Richard Louv , chairman of the Santa Fe , N.Mex. –based Children and Nature Network and author of Last Child in the Woods , ascribes the change more to increasing school and work pressure on children and parents as well as the rising cost of park visits .
Plus , he says , there 's the fear factor .
" You did n't have the concept of stranger danger [ in the past ] , " Louv says .
" If you are raising a generation under protective house arrest , will they have a joyful experience in nature ? "
Without such an experience , Louv , Pergams and Zaradic agree that the value of nature might be lost on such children and adults .
" If we are n't out in nature , we are n't aware of our human footprint in nature .
Then it takes natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina to recognize global warming , " Zaradic says .
" You do n't see the subtle signs , you have to wait for something to hit us over the head . "
Pergams and Zaradic plan to tackle the fear issue next .
" If fear is a factor , what kinds of fear ? "
Pergams asks .
" Fear of the unknown , fear of animals , fear of getting lost , fear of crime , fear of disease , all kinds of different fears that might come into play and to what extent they might play into the decline . "
In addition , they hope to compare the results of children 's exposure to " virtual " nature online or on television with the real thing .
The solution may be as simple as getting kids into the woods or other natural areas in the company of parents , grandparents or other relatives .
" This is n't a bitter pill , " Louv says .
" In order to give kids some semblance of unorganized activity in nature , we 're probably going to have to organize a lot of it .
It 's a paradox we 'll have to deal with with a sense of humor . "
Biologist Edward O. Wilson argues that humans are hardwired for biophilia , or a love of wild plants and animals , and that putting them back in touch with the environment could resurrect that feeling .
" We undervalue the playing in the mud kind of experience , " Zaradic says .
" Which , it turns out , provides a lot of education . "
Putting more nature back into humanity 's urban environments might not hurt either .
" Green urbanism is about efficiency , saving energy .
That 's important but ultimately it 's kind of boring , " Louv says .
" Biophilic design is the idea that when we design nature into our cities really interesting things begin to happen . "
Former Gov. Don E. Siegelman of Alabama was sentenced to seven years and four months in prison yesterday by a federal judge in Montgomery for his part in a bribery scheme connected to his effort to establish a state lottery .
Mr. Siegelman was also ordered to pay more than $ 200,000 in fines and restitution .
Richard Scrushy , the former chief executive of HealthSouth , who had also been convicted in the bribery scheme , was sentenced to just under seven years in prison .

Mr. Siegelman , a Democrat elected in 1998 , insisted that the prosecution had been politically motivated , even connecting it to the White House through a lawyers ’ affidavit that surfaced earlier this month .
“ Nothing of value is free .
It is very easy , Mr. Chairman , to convince people that it is in their best interest to give away somebody else ’s property for nothing , but even the most guileless among us know that this is a cave of illusion where commonsense is lured and then quietly strangled . ”
The emails also go to politicians and academics , as well as to lots of other journalists .
The stories they contain are usually interesting .
Whenever I get an email from the institute , several of my Guardian colleagues receive one too and regularly forward their copies to me - sometimes with a note suggesting that I might like to check out the story and write about it .
If the note happens to come from a more senior colleague , I 'm left feeling that I really ought to write about it .
One example last week was a couple of paragraphs translated by the institute , in which a former doctor in the Iraqi army claimed that Saddam Hussein had personally given orders to amputate the ears of military deserters .
The organisation that makes these translations and sends them out is the Middle East Media Research Institute ( Memri ) , based in Washington but with recently - opened offices in London , Berlin and Jerusalem .
Its work is subsidised by US taxpayers because as an " independent , non-partisan , non-profit " organisation , it has tax - deductible status under American law .
Memri's purpose , according to its website , is to bridge the language gap between the west - where few speak Arabic - and the Middle East , by " providing timely translations of Arabic , Farsi , and Hebrew media " .
Despite these high - minded statements , several things make me uneasy whenever I 'm asked to look at a story circulated by Memri .
First of all , it 's a rather mysterious organisation .
Its website does not give the names of any people to contact , not even an office address .
The reason for this secrecy , according to a former employee , is that " they do n't want suicide bombers walking through the door on Monday morning " ( Washington Times , June 20 ) .
This strikes me as a somewhat over - the - top precaution for an institute that simply wants to break down east - west language barriers .
The second thing that makes me uneasy is that the stories selected by Memri for translation follow a familiar pattern : either they reflect badly on the character of Arabs or they in some way further the political agenda of Israel .
I am not alone in this unease .
Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American - Islamic Relations told the Washington Times : " Memri 's intent is to find the worst possible quotes from the Muslim world and disseminate them as widely as possible . "
Memri might , of course , argue that it is seeking to encourage moderation by highlighting the blatant examples of intolerance and extremism .
But if so , one would expect it - for the sake of non-partisanship - t o publicise extremist articles in the Hebrew media too .
Although Memri claims that it does provide translations from Hebrew media , I can't recall receiving any .
Evidence from Memri's website also casts doubt on its non-partisan status .
Besides supporting liberal democracy , civil society , and the free market , the institute also emphasises " the continuing relevance of Zionism to the Jewish people and to the state of Israel " .
That is what its website used to say , but the words about Zionism have now been deleted .
The original page , however , can still be found in internet archives .
The reason for Memri's air of secrecy becomes clearer when we look at the people behind it .
The co-founder and president of Memri , and the registered owner of its website , is an Israeli called Yigal Carmon .
Mr - or rather , Colonel - Carmon spent 22 years in Israeli military intelligence and later served as counter - terrorism adviser to two Israeli prime ministers , Yitzhak Shamir and Yitzhak Rabin .
Retrieving another now - deleted page from the archives of Memri 's website also throws up a list of its staff .
Of the six people named , three - including Col Carmon - are described as having worked for Israeli intelligence .
Among the other three , one served in the Israeli army 's Northern Command Ordnance Corps , one has an academic background , and the sixth is a former stand - up comedian .
Col Carmon 's co-founder at Memri is Meyrav Wurmser , who is also director of the centre for Middle East policy at the Indianapolis - based Hudson Institute , which bills itself as " America 's premier source of applied research on enduring policy challenges " .
The ubiquitous Richard Perle , chairman of the Pentagon 's defence policy board , recently joined Hudson 's board of trustees .
Ms Wurmser is the author of an academic paper entitled Can Israel Survive Post - Zionism ?
in which she argues that leftwing Israeli intellectuals pose " more than a passing threat " to the state of Israel , undermining its soul and reducing its will for self - defence .
In addition , Ms Wurmser is a highly qualified , internationally recognised , inspiring and knowledgeable speaker on the Middle East whose presence would make any " event , radio or television show a unique one " - according to Benador Associates , a public relations company which touts her services .
Nobody , so far as I know , disputes the general accuracy of Memri 's translations but there are other reasons to be concerned about its output .
The email it circulated last week about Saddam Hussein ordering people 's ears to be cut off was an extract from a longer article in the pan -Arab newspaper , al - Hayat , by Adil Awadh who claimed to have first - hand knowledge of it .
It was the sort of tale about Iraqi brutality that newspapers would happily reprint without checking , especially in the current atmosphere of war fever .
It may well be true , but it needs to be treated with a little circumspection .
Mr Awadh is not exactly an independent figure .
He is , or at least was , a member of the Iraqi National Accord , an exiled Iraqi opposition group backed by the US - and neither al - Hayat nor Memri mentioned this .
Also , Mr Awadh 's allegation first came to light some four years ago , when he had a strong personal reason for making it .
According to a Washington Post report in 1998 , the amputation claim formed part of his application for political asylum in the United States .
At the time , he was one of six Iraqis under arrest in the US as suspected terrorists or Iraqi intelligence agents , and he was trying to show that the Americans had made a mistake .
Earlier this year , Memri scored two significant propaganda successes against Saudi Arabia .
The first was its translation of an article from al - Riyadh newspaper in which a columnist wrote that Jews use the blood of Christian or Muslim children in pastries for the Purim religious festival .
The writer , a university teacher , was apparently relying on an anti-semitic myth that dates back to the middle ages .
What this demonstrated , more than anything , was the ignorance of many Arabs - even those highly educated - about Judaism and Israel , and their readiness to believe such ridiculous stories .
But Memri claimed al - Riyadh was a Saudi " government newspaper " - in fact it 's privately owned - implying that the article had some form of official approval .
Al - Riyadh 's editor said he had not seen the article before publication because he had been abroad .
He apologised without hesitation and sacked his columnist , but by then the damage had been done .
Memri's next success came a month later when Saudi Arabia 's ambassador to London wrote a poem entitled The Martyrs - about a young woman suicide bomber - which was published in al - Hayat newspaper .
Memri sent out translated extracts from the poem , which it described as " praising suicide bombers " .
Whether that was the poem 's real message is a matter of interpretation .
It could , perhaps more plausibly , be read as condemning the political ineffectiveness of Arab leaders , but Memri 's interpretation was reported , almost without question , by the western media .
These incidents involving Saudi Arabia should not be viewed in isolation .
They are part of building a case against the kingdom and persuading the United States to treat it as an enemy , rather than an ally .
It 's a campaign that the Israeli government and American neo-conservatives have been pushing since early this year - one aspect of which was the bizarre anti-Saudi briefing at the Pentagon , hosted last month by Richard Perle .
To anyone who reads Arabic newspapers regularly , it should be obvious that the items highlighted by Memri are those that suit its agenda and are not representative of the newspapers ' content as a whole .
The danger is that many of the senators , congressmen and " opinion formers " who do n't read Arabic but receive Memri 's emails may get the idea that these extreme examples are not only truly representative but also reflect the policies of Arab governments .
Memri's Col Carmon seems eager to encourage them in that belief .
In Washington last April , in testimony to the House committee on international relations , he portrayed the Arab media as part of a wide - scale system of government - sponsored indoctrination .
" The controlled media of the Arab governments conveys hatred of the west , and in particular , of the United States , " he said .
" Prior to September 11 , one could frequently find articles which openly supported , or even called for , terrorist attacks against the United States ...
" The United States is sometimes compared to Nazi Germany , President Bush to Hitler , Guantanamo to Auschwitz , " he said .
In the case of the al - Jazeera satellite channel , he added , " the overwhelming majority of guests and callers are typically anti-American and anti-semitic " .
Unfortunately , it is on the basis of such sweeping generalisations that much of American foreign policy is built these days .
As far as relations between the west and the Arab world are concerned , language is a barrier that perpetuates ignorance and can easily foster misunderstanding .
All it takes is a small but active group of Israelis to exploit that barrier for their own ends and start changing western perceptions of Arabs for the worse .
It is not difficult to see what Arabs might do to counter that .
A group of Arab media companies could get together and publish translations of articles that more accurately reflect the content of their newspapers .
It would certainly not be beyond their means .
But , as usual , they may prefer to sit back and grumble about the machinations of Israeli intelligence veterans .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and Clarifications column , Wednesday August 21 2002
In an article headed Atrocity stories regain currency , page 13 , August 8 , and in an article headed Selective Memri on the Guardian website , we referred to Dr Adil Awadh , an Iraqi doctor who alleged that Saddam Hussein had ordered doctors to amputate the ears of soldiers who deserted .
Dr Awadh has asked us to make it clear that he has no connection with Memri ( Middle East Media Research Institute ) , and that he did not authorise its translation of parts of an article by him .
He is no longer a member of the Iraqi National Accord ( INA ) .
He is an independent member of the Iraqi National Congress ( INC ) .
His reference to orders by Saddam Hussein to cut off the ears of deserters has been supported by evidence from other sources .

Abstract
We consider the problem of providing formal support for working with abstract syntax involving variable binders .
Gabbay and Pitts have shown in their work on Fraenkel - Mostowski ( FM ) set theory how to address this through first - class names : in this paper we present a dependent type theory for programming and reasoning with such names .
Our development is based on a categorical axiomatisation of names , with freshness as its central notion .
An associated adjunction captures constructions known from FM theory : the freshness quantifier И , name - binding , and unique choice of fresh names .
The Schanuel topos — the category underlying FM set theory — is an instance of this axiomatisation .
Working from the categorical structure , we define a dependent type theory which it models .
This uses bunches to integrate the monoidal structure corresponding to freshness , from which we define novel multiplicative dependent products Π* and sums Σ* as well as a propositions - as - types generalisation H of the freshness quantifier .

THE annual round of price negotiations between the world 's leading iron - ore producers — Vale of Brazil and Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton , both Anglo - Australian firms — is drawing towards resolution .
With demand , particularly from China , outstripping supply , Vale has forced prices higher by some 65 % compared with last year in deals with steelmakers from Japan , South Korea and Europe .
This will set a benchmark both for Vale 's deals with other countries ' steelmakers and for prices of iron ore supplied by Rio and BHP .
These firms have yet to strike deals of their own .
Inevitably , steelmakers will pass on these price rises to customers .

CRS warns about uselessness of FBI - employed food - purchase surveillance Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday January 2 , 2008

In separate report , UK - based privacy watchdog says US ' endemic surveillance ' is among world 's worst Congressional researchers warned last month that attempts to identify potential terrorists based on food purchases could easily be based on inaccurate information and waste government time and resources .
It 's unclear if reports that the FBI had been doing precisely that led to the Congressional Research Service admonition .
But a 41 - page CRS report outlines several ways in which data mining falls short as a terror - preventing tactic .
The data - mining mismanagement identified by CRS serves as one of myriad reasons a UK - based privacy watchdog has ranked the United States alongside China , Russia and Singapore among the top surveillance societies on the globe .
In its report , CRS warned that the government was pushing forward with data - mining efforts ostensibly to prosecute the War on Terror , despite concerns about inaccurate and incomplete information that could " make data mining an ill - suited tool " for predicting terrorist activity .
In the case of shopper 's club cards , data that grocery stores use to target coupons and advertisements at customers might be useless when applied to national security investigations because of recordkeeping errors , inaccurate information or duplicate records , CRS warns .
If a government agency were to use that information to target individuals based on food purchases associated with particular religious observances though , an outcome based on inaccurate information could be , at the least , a waste of resources by the government agency , and an unpleasant experience for the misidentified individual .
However , according to Jeff Stein in Congressional Quarterly , the FBI " sifted through " grocery store data around San Francisco in 2005 and 2006 .
" The idea , " Stein writes , " was that a spike in , say , falafel sales , combined with other data , would lead to Iranian secret agents in the south San Francisco - San Jose area . "
The FBI , for its part , issued a vague non-denial denial pronouncing the story " too ridiculous to be true . "
Effort wasted examining grocery store receipts was not the only problem identified by CRS in its survey of government data - mining efforts , including the " Total Information Awareness " program ( which was later renamed the " Terrorism Information Awareness " program in an " Orwellian " twist to placate critics ) .
Such routine access to privately collected data on Americans , not to mention the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program and Congress 's attempts to scuttle oversight of possible abuses as it rewrites the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , has the US listed as an " endemic surveillance society " in Privacy International 's latest survey .
As Kim Zetter notes at Wired 's Threat Level blog :
In terms of statutory protections and privacy enforcement , the US is the worst ranking country in the democratic world .
In terms of overall privacy protection the United States has performed very poorly , being out - ranked by both India and the Philippines and falling into the " black " category , denoting endemic surveillance .

Prices for black market roses are reported to be rising
The Saudi Gazette quoted shop workers as saying that officials had warned them to remove all red items including flowers and wrapping paper .
Black market prices for roses were already rising , the paper said .
Saudi authorities consider Valentine 's Day , along with a host of other annual celebrations , as un-Islamic .
In addition to the prohibition on celebrating non-Islamic festivals , the authorities consider Valentine 's Day as encouraging relations between men and women outside wedlock - punishable by law in the conservative kingdom .
The Saudi Gazette reported that some people placed orders with florists days or weeks before Valentine 's Day in anticipation of the ban , which is a regular occurrence .
" Sometimes we deliver the bouquets in the middle of the night or early morning , to avoid suspicion , " one florist said .
Others were planning to travel to the more religiously liberal neighbouring countries , Bahrain or the United Arab Emirates , to celebrate .
Saudi Arabian authorities impose a strict Islamic code that prevents men and women from mixing .
( ifoAppleStore ) Gary Allen , author of ifoAppleStore and frequent AppleInsider contributor , made the pilgrimage on Wednesday to the site of Apple 's latest flagship retail store — soon to be Manhattan 's largest — and filed the following in - depth report , complete with revealing photos from the shop 's interior .
" The store is in full view and completely ready for the grand opening .
The store occupies three floors , each about 40 feet wide , and the ground floor about 85 feet deep ( the second and third floors are about 50 feet deep ) .
Most spectacularly , the front 35 - feet of the store spans three - stories , occupied by the most complex and immense glass staircase ever built , spiral or otherwise .
The outside of the store is completely devoid of the usual Apple architectural branding , except for a black metal , cut - out logo hanging from a post , just like the SoHo store .
But the huge windows on the ground floor allow a view into the store from both the adjacent sidewalk and from any point in the surrounding neighborhood .
There are double - door entrancees on both the 14th St. and 9th Ave. sides of the building , nearest the corner .
Inside , the usual features are present : stone flooring , back - lit wall graphics , white ceiling , and wood display tables .
The ground floor is simply computer display space , while software , book and accessory shelving is visible on the second floor .
The third floor has ceiling lights in a circular pattern , indicating that a Creative Bar is just beneath it .
No doubt the Genius Bar is up there , too .
The spiral glass staircase uses a very thick and well - reinforced circular core , upon which the outer sidewalls are attached .
From there , the treads and landings are attached , .
The staircase rises 14 treads to a landing , then another 11 treads to the second floor .
It duplicates this pattern to the third floor .
An elevator is around an adjacent corner , just out of view .
Interestingly , the location of the elevator is just forward of the second and third levels , so a glass bridge was constructed on those levels to connect the floor to the elevator lobby .
Apple is calling this store the largest in New York City , although if you tally up the retail floor square - footage ( 7,200 s.f. ) , it seems like it has less display space than Fifth Avenue or SoHo .
The footage is less because the second and third levels do n't occupy the entire footprint of the building , just the rear 50 feet or so .
For the record — it 's cold !
There were flurries while I took these photos , and even with gloves , several layers of clothes and a heavy jacket , I was freezing .
The press event is at 11 a.m. on Thursday , so I 'll be back out documenting whatever happens at the store . "
Additional photos are available via ifo's photo gallery .
Gary will also be continuously updating his 14th Street Grand Opening Report through Friday 's 6:00 p.m. opening .
The exact address of the store is 401 W 14th Street .
Apple has promised complimentary commemorative T - shirts and " other special surprises while they last " to customers attending the grand opening .
Update : Apple in a press release issued Thursday at noon Eastern time said : " The Apple Store West 14th Street is Appleâs first three - story store with two floors dedicated to products and a third dedicated to services , including a 46 - foot Genius Bar and specially designed areas for workshops and personal training .
The Apple Store West 14th Street also introduces Pro Labs where customers can receive free , in - depth training on Appleâs industry - leading pro applications including Final Cut Pro .
The knowledgeable staff at the Apple Store West 14th Street includes more than 175 highly trained Mac Specialists , Mac Geniuses and Creatives who are ready to share their expertise in video editing , digital photography , music production and more .
The team of Creatives at West 14th Street will begin leading free multi-session Pro Lab series in January , offering personalized instruction and hands - on experience for customers who want to take their music , video and photography skills to the next level . "
The follow up film to “ The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe ” , “ Prince Caspian ” has just put the first trailer online , and holy crap it looks wonderful .
I ’m one of those people who thought Narnia was a wonderful experience , and Prince Caspian looks like it may surpass it .
At least I hope so .
Thanks to Rama for the heads up .
From HaskellWiki
( DRAFT ; Work in Progress )
Functional programmers often appeal to equational reasoning to justify various decisions made in both design and implementation .
This page introduces the Haskell Equational Reasoning Assistant ( HERA ) , an architecture that provides both a GUI level and a batch level Haskell rewrite engine inside a single tool .
The interactive interface is used to create and edit non-trivial translations that can be used to extend the batch level API ; the batch level API can be used to implement powerful , context sensitive rewrites that can be provided to the interactive interface .
You can get the development version of HERA with the command : darcs get http://code.haskell.org/HERA
The Interactive Interface
Ajax applications use a web browser interface , and provide a dynamic interactive experience beyond traditional CGI scripts , with user interactions causing localized updates to the displayed web pages , rather than complete page reloads [ 2 ] .
An Ajax engine implemented in Javascript turns user interactions into asynchronous HTTP requests , sending them to the Ajax - compliant web server .
The engine then comprehends the responses to the asynchronous requests , and uses Javascript to redraw only the parts of the interface that need updating .
HERA is a classical Ajax application consisting of two components : a client - side Ajax engine running inside the browser customized for HERA ; and a server - side Haskell application which provides the rewrite engine , and interacts with the Javascript Ajax engine via a simple web server , also written in Haskell .
There are three main panels in the interface :
The Code panel contains the pretty - printed selectable code fragment , and a list of individual rewrites that have recently been applied .
The Ajax engine on the client side is configured to understand the nesting of Haskell expressions , allowing the user to select only valid candidate sub-expressions , using the algorithm described in a previous paper [ 4 ] .
In the screenshot in Figure 1 above , the right hand side of a let expression has been selected ; a case expression .
The Dictionary panel contains a comprehensive list of possible rewrites .
When the user clicks on a rewrite name , the rewrite is applied to the currently selected sub-expression in the code window , or the whole code fragment , if no sub-expression is selected .
The Ajax engine asks for a specific rewrite to be applied to a specific sub-expression , using a specific strategy .
The server application honors the request , and the engine accepts the new rendition of the code panel after the rewrite has been applied .
The Oracle panel gives context sensitive suggestions of possible rewrites to apply .
Any time the user selects a sub-expression , and before a possible rewrite has been chosen , the Ajax engine fires an asynchronous HTTP request to HERA server , explaining what selection is being considered .
A Haskell thread inside the server is then tasked with attempting every reasonable candidate rewrite in the internal rewrite dictionary on the selected sub-expression , sending a list of matching rewrites back to Ajax engine to display in the Oracle panel .
In practice this background search takes a fraction of a second , and includes the rewrite the user actually wants to use almost every time .
In our experience , only during the eureka steps of rewriting does the user actually need to hunt through the dictionary .
In the screenshot in Figure 1 , the Case of known constructor has been offered to the user as a possible candidate , and examination of the code reveals that the case selected is a case of known constructor candidate .
The interface also has a strategy pull down menu in the top bar , which allows the user to choose between a basic range of Stratego [ 1 ] like rewrite strategies , from highly focused rewriting through to applying a generic rewrite everywhere applicable using a depth - first strategy .

PHP 6 is just around the corner , but for developers who just can’t wait , there ’s good news — many of the features originally planned for PHP 6 have been back - ported to PHP 5.3 , a final stable release of which is due in the first half of this year .
This news might also be welcomed by those that wish to use some of the new features , but whose hosting providers will not be upgrading to version 6 for some time — hosting providers have traditionally delayed major version updates while acceptance testing is performed ( read : the stability has been proven elsewhere first ) .
Many hosting companies will probably delay upgrading their service offerings until version 6.1 to be released .
A minor upgrade from 5.2.x to 5.3 , however , will be less of a hurdle for most hosting companies .
This article introduces the new features , gives examples of where they might be useful , and provides demo code to get you up and running with the minimum of fuss .
It does n’t cover topics such as installing PHP 5.3 — the latest development release of which is currently available .
If you ’d like to play along with the code in this article , you should install PHP 5.3 , then download the code archive .
An article on installing PHP 5.3 can be
found on the Melbourne PHP Users Group web site .
Namespaces
Before the days of object oriented PHP , many application developers made use of verbose function names in order to avoid namespace clashes .
WordPress , for example , implements functions such as wp_update_post and wp_create_user .
The wp_ prefix denotes that the function pertains to the WordPress application , and reduces the chance of it clashing with any existing functions .
In an object oriented world , namespace clashes are less likely .
Consider the following example code snippet , which is based on a fictional blogging application :
<? php
class User {
public function set ( $ attribute , $ value ) { ... }
public function save ( ) { ... }
}
$ user = new User ( ) ;
$ user -> set ( ' fullname ' , ' Ben Balbo ' ) ;
$ user -> save ( ) ;
In this example , the save method will not clash with any other method , as it is contained within the User class .
There ’s still a potential issue though : the User class might already be defined by some other part of the system if , for example , the blogging application runs within a content management system .
The solution to this issue is to use the new namespaces keyword .
Taking the above code again , consider the following sample files :
<? php
namespace MyCompany :: Blog ;
class User {
public function set ( $ attribute , $ value ) {
$ this ->$ attribute = $ value ;
}
public function save ( ) {
echo '< p>
Blog user ' .
$ this -> fullname . ' saved </p >';
}
}
<? php
$ user = new MyCompany : : Blog : : User ( ) ;
$ user -> set ( ‘ fullname ’ , ‘ Ben Balbo ’ ) ;
$ user -> save ( ) ;
On the surface , the advantages offered by namespacing our function might not be immediately obvious — after all , we ’ve simply changed MyCompany_Blog_User to MyCompany : : Blog :: User .
However , we can now create a User class for the CMS using a different namespace :
<? php
namespace MyCompany :: CMS ;
class User {
public function set ( $ attribute , $ value ) {
$ this ->$ attribute = $ value ;
}
public function save ( ) {
echo ‘< p>CMS user ‘ . $ this -> fullname . ‘ saved </p>’;
}
}
We can now use the classes MyCompany : : Blog : : User and MyCompany : : CMS :: User .
The use Keyword
Addressing classes using the full namespace still results in lengthy calls , and if you ’re using lots of classes from the MyCompany : : Blog namespace , you might not want to retype the whole path to the class every time .
This is where the use keyword comes in handy .
Your application will most likely use a number of different classes at any given time .
Say , for example , the user creates a new post :
<? php
use MyCompany : : Blog ;
$ user = new Blog : : User ( ) ;
$ post = new Blog : : Post ( ) ;
$ post ->setUser ( $ user ) ;
$ post ->setTitle ( $ title ) ;
$ post ->setBody ( $ body ) ;
$ post -> save ( ) ;
The use keyword is not restricted to defining namespaces in which to work .
You can also use it to import single classes to your file , like so :
<? php
use MyCompany : : Blog :: User ;
$ user = new User ( ) ;
Namespace Aliases
Earlier , I pointed out that one advantage of namespacing is the ability to define more than one class with the same name in different namespaces .
There will obviously be instances where those two classes are utilized by the same script .
We could just import the namespaces , however , we also have the option of importing just the classes .
To do so , we can use namespace aliasing to identify each class , like so :
<? php
use MyCompany : : Blog :: User as BlogUser ;
use MyCompany :: CMS :: User as CMSUser ;
$ bloguser = new BlogUser ( ) ;
$ bloguser -> set ( ‘ fullname ’ , ‘ John Doe ’ ) ;
$ bloguser - > save ( ) ;
$ cmsuser = new CMSUser ( ) ;
$ cmsuser ->set ( ‘ fullname ’ , ‘ John Doe ’ ) ;
$ cmsuser -> save ( ) ;
Class Constants
Constants are now able to be defined at the class level !
Note that class constants are available when you ’re importing namespaces , but you cannot import the constant itself .
Here ’s an example of how we might use them :
<? php
namespace MyCompany ;
class Blog {
const VERSION = ‘ 1.0.0 ’;
}
<? php
echo ‘< p> Blog bersion ‘ .
MyCompany :: Blog:: VERSION . ‘</p>’;
use MyCompany : : Blog ;
echo ‘< p> Blog version ‘ .
Blog:: VERSION . ‘</p>’;
use MyCompany : : Blog:: VERSION as Foo ;
echo ‘< p> Blog version ‘ .
Foo .
‘</p>’;
This will result in the following output :
Blog bersion 1.0.0
Blog version 1.0.0
Blog version Foo
Namespaced Functions
The use of static class methods has deprecated the use of functions in the object oriented world in which we now live .
However , if you do need to add a function to your package , it too will be subject to namespacing !
Here ’s an example :
<? php
namespace bundle ;
function foo ( ) { echo '< p > This is the bundled foo </ p >'; }
foo( ) ; //
This prints ' This is the bundled foo '
<? php
function foo ( ) { echo ‘< p > This is the global foo </ p >’; }
require ( ‘ lib/bundle.class.php ’ ) ;
bundle ::foo( ) ; //
This prints ‘ This is the bundled foo ’
foo( ) ; //
This prints ‘ This is the global foo ’
The Global Namespace
The global namespace is an important consideration when you ’re dealing with functions .
In the previous example , you ’ll notice that there ’s no direct way of calling the global foo function from within the bundle code .
The default method of resolving calls to functions is to use the current namespace .
If the function cannot be found , it will look for an internal function by that name .
It will not look in other namespaces automatically .
To call the global foo function from within the bundle namespace , we need to target the global namespace directly .
We do this by using a double colon :
<? php
namespace bundle ;
function foo ( ) { echo '< p > This is the bundled foo </ p >' ; }
foo( ) ; //
This prints ' This is the bundled foo '
::foo( ) ; //
This prints ' This is the global foo '
Autoloading Namespaced Classes
If you ’re defining the magic __autoload function to include class definition files on demand , then you ’re probably making use of a directory that includes all your class files .
Before we could use namespaces , this approach would suffice , as each class would be required to have a unique name .
Now , though , it ’s possible to have multiple classes with the same name .
Luckily , the __autoload function will be passed the fully namespaced reference to the class .
So in the examples above , you might expect a call such as :
__autoload ( ' MyCompany : : Blog:: User ' ) ;
You can now perform a string replace operation on this parameter to convert the double colons to another character .
The most obvious substitute would be a directory separator character :
function __autoload( $ classname ) {
$ classname = strtolower ( $ classname ) ;
$ classname = str_replace ( '::' , DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR , $ classname ) ;
require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ) . '/' . $ classname . '.class.php ' ) ;
}
This would take the expected call above and include the file ./classes/mycompany/blog/user.class.php .
Late Static Binding
Late static binding provides the ability for a parent class to use a static method that has been overridden in a child class .
You might imagine this would be the default behaviour , but consider the following example :
<? php
class ParentClass {
static public function say ( $ str ) {
self :: do_print( $ str ) ;
}
static public function do_print ( $ str ) {
echo " < p > Parent says $ str < / p > " ;
}
}
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
static public function do_print ( $ str ) {
echo " < p > Child says $ str < / p > " ;
}
}
ChildClass :: say( ' Hello ' ) ;
You would probably expect this to return " Child says Hello " .
While I understand why you might expect this , you ’ll be disappointed to see it return " Parent says Hello " .
The reason for this is that references to self : : and __CLASS__ resolve to the class in which these references are used .
PHP 5.3 now includes a static : : reference that resolves to the static class called at runtime :
static public function say ( $ str ) {
static :: do_print( $ str ) ;
}
With the addition of the static : : reference , the script will return the string " Child says Hello " .
__callstatic
Until now , PHP has supported a number of magic methods in classes that you ’ll already be familiar with , such as __set , __get and __call .
PHP 5.3 introduces the __callstatic method , which acts exactly like the call method , but it operates in a static context .
In other words , the method acts on unrecognized static calls directly on the class .
The following example illustrates the concept :
<? php
class Factory {
static function GetDatabaseHandle ( ) {
echo '< p> Returns a database handle </p>';
}
static function __callstatic ( $ methodname , $ args ) {
echo '< p>
Unknown static method < strong >' .
$ methodname . '< / strong >' .
' called with parameters : </p>';
echo '< pre > ' . print_r ( $ args , true ) . '< / pre >';
}
}
Factory :: GetDatabaseHandle ( ) ;
Factory : : CreateUser ( ) ;
Factory :: CreateBlogPost ( ' Author ' , ' Post Title ' , ' Post Body ' ) ;
Variable Static Calls
When is a static member or method not static ?
When it ’s dynamically referenced , of course !
Once again , this is an enhancement that brings object functionality to your classes .
In addition to having variable variables and variable method calls , you can now also have variable static calls .
Taking the factory class defined in the previous section , we could achieve the same results by invoking the following code :
$ classname = ' Factory ' ;
$ methodname = ' CreateUser ' ;
$ classname : : $ methodname ( ) ;
$ methodname = ' CreateBlogPost ' ;
$ author = ' Author ' ;
$ posttitle = ' Post Title ' ;
$ postbody = ' Post Body ' ;
$ classname : : $ methodname ( $ author , $ posttitle , $ postbody ) ;
You can create dynamic namespaces like so :
<? php
require_once ( ' lib/autoload.php ' ) ;
$ class = ' MyCompany : : Blog : : User ' ;
$ user = new $ class ( ) ;
$ user -> set ( ' fullname ' , ' Ben Balbo ' ) ;
$ user -> save ( ) ;
These little touches can make your code more readable and allow you full flexibility in an object oriented sense .
MySQL Native Driver
Until version 5.3 of PHP , any interaction with MySQL usually occurred in conjunction with libmysql — a MySQL database client library .
PHP 5.3 ’s native MySQL driver has been designed from the ground up for PHP and the ZEND engine , which brings about a number of advantages .
Most obviously , the native driver is specific to PHP , and has therefore been optimised for the ZEND engine .
This produces a client with a smaller footprint and faster execution times .
Secondly , the native driver makes use of the ZEND engine ’s memory management and , unlike libmysql , it will obey the memory limit settings in PHP .
The native driver has been licensed under the PHP license to avoid licensing issues .
Additional OpenSSL Functions
If you ’ve ever had to perform any OpenSSL - related actions in your scripts , ( such as generating a Diffie Hellman key or encrypting content ) you ’ll either have performed this operation in user - land , or passed the request to a system call .
A patch to the OpenSSL functionality in PHP 5.3 provides the extra functions required to perform these actions through the OpenSSL library , which not only makes your life easier and your applications faster , but allows you to reuse the proven code that comes with OpenSSL .
This will be great news for anyone that ’s currently working with OpenID .
Improved Command Line Parameter Support
Hopefully , you ’ll be aware of the fact that PHP is more than just a scripting language for the Web .
The command line version of PHP runs outside of the web server ’s environment and is useful for automating system and application processes .
For example , the getopt function of PHP has been around for a while , but has been limited to a number of system types ; most commonly , it did n’t function under a Windows operating system environment .
As of PHP 5.3 , the getopt function is no longer system dependent .
Hooray !
XSLT Profiling
XSLT is a complex beast , and most users of this templating mechanism will be familiar with xsltproc ’s profiling option .
As of PHP 5.3 , you can profile the transforms from within your PHP scripts .
This snippet from the example code that accompanies this article gives you an idea of how we might use it :
$ doc = new DOMDocument ( ) ;
$ xsl = new XSLTProcessor ( ) ;
$ doc->load ( './lib/collection.xsl ' ) ;
$ xsl->importStyleSheet ( $doc ) ;
$ doc->load ( './lib/collection.xml ' ) ;
$ xsl->setProfiling ( " /tmp/xslt-profiling.txt " ) ;
echo $ xsl->transformToXML ( $doc ) ;
echo '< h2 > Profile report</h2 >';
echo '< pre > ' . file_get_contents ( '/tmp/xslt-profiling.txt ' ) . '< / pre >';
The information produced by the profile will look something like this :
number match name mode Calls Tot 100us Avg
0 collection 1 4 4
1 cd 2 1 0
Total 3 5
New Error Levels
PHP is certainly a language that has a few , er , quirks .
For example , why does n’t E_ALL include all error levels ?
Well now it does !
Yes , PHP 5.3 now includes E_STRICT as part of E_ALL .
Furthermore , while E_STRICT used to report on both the usage of functionality that might become deprecated in the near future , and on bad programming practices such as defining an abstract static method , in PHP 5.3 , these two errors are split into E_DEPRECATED and E_STRICT respectively , which makes a lot more sense .
Other Minor Improvements
There ’s a handful of other improvements coming in PHP 5.3 that either do n’t warrant an entire section in this article , or were untestable at the time this article was written , such as :
Sqlite3 support via the ext / sqlite extension
extension SPL ’s DirectoryIterator , which now implements ArrayAccess
, which now implements
Two news functions : array_replace and array_replace_recursive .
While these functions were undefined when tested under PHP 5.3.0 , the C code that implements them suggests that they will contain similar functionality to array_merge .
One exception , however , is that the array_replace function will only update values in the first array where the keys match in both arrays .
Any keys that are present in the second array but do n’t appear in the first will be ignored .
Summary
PHP 5.3 contains much functionality that was originally slated for inclusion in PHP 6 , which takes it from being a minor upgrade to a significant release that every PHP developer should start thinking about .
We touched on most of the features in this article , and looked at some code that demonstrates how you might go about using these new features .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Every day , five U.S. soldiers try to kill themselves .
Before the Iraq war began , that figure was less than one suicide attempt a day .
The dramatic increase is revealed in new U.S. Army figures , which show 2,100 soldiers tried to commit suicide in 2007 .
" Suicide attempts are rising and have risen over the last five years , " said Col. Elspeth Cameron - Ritchie , an Army psychiatrist .
Concern over the rate of suicide attempts prompted Sen. Jim Webb , D - Virginia , to introduce legislation Thursday to improve the military 's suicide - prevention programs .
" Our troops and their families are under unprecedented levels of stress due to the pace and frequency of more than five years of deployments , " Webb said in a written statement .
Watch CNN Senior Pentagon Correspondent Jamie McIntyre on the reasons for the increase in suicides »
Sen . Patty Murray , D - Washington , took to the Senate floor Thursday , urging more help for military members , especially for those returning from war .
" Our brave service members who face deployment after deployment without the rest , recovery and treatment they need are at the breaking point , " Murray said .
She said Congress has given " hundreds of millions of dollars " to the military to improve its ability to provide mental health treatment , but said it will take more than money to resolve the problem .
" It takes leadership and it takes a change in the culture of war , " she said .
She said some soldiers had reported receiving nothing more than an 800 number to call for help .
" Many soldiers need a real person to talk to , " she said .
" And they need psychiatrists and they need psychologists . "
According to Army statistics , the incidence of U.S. Army soldiers attempting suicide or inflicting injuries on themselves has skyrocketed in the nearly five years since the start of the Iraq war .
Last year 's 2,100 attempted suicides -- an average of more than 5 per day -- compares with about 350 suicide attempts in 2002 , the year before the war in Iraq began , according to the Army .
The figures also show the number of suicides by active - duty troops in 2007 may reach an all - time high when the statistics are finalized in March , Army officials said .
The Army lists 89 soldier deaths in 2007 as suicides and is investigating 32 more as possible suicides .
Suicide rates already were up in 2006 with 102 deaths , compared with 87 in 2005 .
Cameron - Ritchie , the Army psychiatrist , said suicide attempts are usually related to problems with intimate relationships , but they are also related to problems with work , finances and the law .
" The really tough area here is stigma .
We know that soldiers do n't want to go seek care .
They 're tough , they 're strong , they do n't want to go see a behavioral health - care provider , " Cameron - Ritchie said .
Multiple deployments and long deployments appear to exact a toll on relationships , thereby boosting the number of suicide attempts , she said .
Traditionally , the suicide rate among military members has been lower than age - and gender - matched civilians .
But in recent years the rate has crept up from 12 per 100,000 among the military to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2006 , she said .
That 's still less than the civilian figure of about 20 per 100,000 , she said .
The " typical " soldier who commits suicide is a member of an infantry unit who uses a firearm to carry out the act , according to the Army .
Post - traumatic stress disorder also may be a factor in suicide attempts , Cameron - Ritchie said , because it can result in broken relationships and often leads to drug and alcohol abuse .
" The real central issue is relationships .
Relationships , relationships , relationships , " said U.S. Army Chaplain Lt. Col. Ran Dolinger .
" People look at PTSD , they look at length of deployments ... but it's that broken relationship that really makes the difference . "
To reduce suicides , the Army said it is targeting soldiers who are or have been in Iraq for long periods and teaching them to notice signs that can lead to suicide .
That training came too late for Army Specialist Tim Bowman .
The 23 - year - old killed himself in 2005 after returning from Iraq .
" As my family was preparing for a 2005 Thanksgiving meal , our son Timothy was lying on the floor , slowly bleeding to death from a self - inflicted gunshot wound , " said his father , Mike Bowman , in testimony to a House Veterans ' Affairs committee hearing in December .
" His war was now over . "
He said veterans return home to find an " understaffed , under - funded , under - equipped " Veterans Affairs mental health system .
" Many just give up trying , " he said .

A girl in a newsboy cap and a white t- shirt with rolled - up sleeves is leaning against the back wall at Meow Mix and telling her friend , “ Some femme … just some femme .
I met her at a party three weeks ago , but now she ’s like e-mailing me and I ’m just like , chill out , bitch ! ”
Her chest is smooth and flat :
She ’s either had top surgery — a double mastectomy — or , more likely , she binds her breasts .
She thrusts her forearm in front of her face as if she ’s rapping as she says , “ Some of these chicks , it ’s like you top them once and then they ’re all up in your face .
It ’s like , did I get you off ?
Yes .
Am I your new best friend ?
No .
You know what I ’m saying , bro ? ”
Her friend nods and keeps her eyes on the blonde go - go dancer in tiny white shorts undulating on a tabletop .
“ Bois like us , ” she says , “ we ’ve got to stick together . ”
There was a point at which lesbianism seemed as much like a fringe political party as it did a sexual identity :
What better way to declare “ a woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle ” than to be a woman without a man , a woman with other women .
“ Lesbianism is a women ’s liberation plot , ” was how the group Radicalesbians put it when they famously commandeered the mike at now ’s Second Congress to Unite Women in 1970 .
It was the ultimate in dismantling the dominant paradigm , rejecting male domination , and all the rest of it , and sex seemed kind of secondary .
But in the contemporary young gay women ’s world , what you like and what you do and who you do it with are who you are .
In “ the scene , ” the back - and - forth migratory ladies ’ pipeline that runs between San Francisco and New York City , sexual practices and preferences are parceled out and labeled like cuts of meat .
Within the scene , “ lesbian ” is an almost empty term , and “ identifying ” requires a great deal more specificity and reduction , like : “ I ’m a high femme , ” or “ I ’m a butch top , ” or , most recently and frequently , “ I ’m a boi . ”
It is tempting to pronounce the syllable “ bwah , ” as in “ framboise , ” but actually you just say it “ boy , ” the way , in a different lesbian era , you pronounced womyn “ woman . ”
Throwing a y in woman was a linguistic attempt , however goofy , to overthrow the patriarchy , to identify the female gender as something independent , self - sustaining , and reformed .
Being a boi is not about that .
Boihood has nothing to do with earth mothers or sisterhood or herbal tea , and everything to do with being young , hip , “ sex positive , ” a little masculine , and ready to rock .
It ’s no coincidence that the word is boi and not some version of man .
Men have to deal with responsibilities , money , wives , careers , car insurance .
Boys just get to have fun and , if they ’re lucky , sex .
“ I never really wanted to grow up , which is what a lot of the boi identity is about , ” says Lissa Doty , who is 37 but looks more like 24 .
She wears a baggy T - shirt and jeans and she has gelled her bleached hair into a stiff fin , like the raised spine of a Komodo dragon .
“ I want to go out and have a good time !
I want to be able to go out to the bar at night and go to parties and go to the amusement park and play .
That sense of play — that ’s a big difference from being a butch .
To me , butch is like adult .
If you ’re a butch , you ’re a grown - up : You ’re the man of the house . ”
Lissa is smart , well read , and well educated , and she is a courier for FedEx because , she says , “ I want to have a job where at the end of the day I walk away and I do n’t have to think about it . ”
When Lissa came out in the eighties , militant feminism and , to a certain extent , lesbian separatism were at the forefront of dyke culture .
“ There was this whole movement of womyn ’s land and womyn building houses on womyn’s land and insulating themselves from the rest of the world , ” she says , smirking .
“ It was a whole different world from where we are now .
It used to be if you flirted with somebody , that was it :
You were set for life ; U - Haul ’s waiting out back .
I do n’t know if it ’s the whole boi thing or if it ’s a little sexual revolution that ’s happened where you can go home and have a one - night stand just like the gay boys .
Before , things were more serious :
If you flirted with somebody , you better be getting her number and buying that house and getting those dogs .
Otherwise , lesbian community is coming down on you .
Now it ’s more … playful . ”
Being a boi means different things to different people — it ’s a fluid identity , and that ’s the whole point .
Some women who call themselves bois are playing off “ boy ” in the gay - male S/M sense of the term , as in Daddy / Boy :
The boy or boi is the submissive and , in the case of lesbians , has sex with dominant butches ( tops ) .
Some of the people who identify as bois are female - to - male transsexuals in various stages of the transition process , ranging from having had top surgery and taking testosterone ( “ T ” ) to simply adopting the pronoun he .
Some , like Lissa , date other bois and think of themselves as “ fags , ” while others only date femmes .
And others simply think being a boi means that they are young and cool and probably promiscuous .
What all bois have in common is a lack of interest in embodying any kind of girliness , but they are too irreverent to adopt the heavy - duty , highly circumscribed butch role .
To them , butch is an identity of the past , a relic from a world of Budweiser and motorcycles gone by .
“ Guzzling beer and eating hot dogs and , like , football - watching guys — that ’s what those women are , you know ?
Except they ’re women , ” says Sienna , a graceful boi in her mid-twenties with close - cropped kinky hair and a face that flashes back and forth between beautiful and handsome depending on her expression .
She is a sometime runway model for Hermès and Miguel Adrover , but tonight she looks like a standard - issue Brooklyn hipster in her sneakers and cords .
“ A lot of butch women just think , I ’m big , I ’m butch .
They feel like because they ’re some big hunk of meat with abs , that ’s all it takes .
I just find other bois to be more open - minded and a little more educated and artsier , like they wo n’t be put in a box , ” she says .
“ And I think non-monogamy is a part of it . ”
Sienna lives and paints at the dUMBA Queer Performing Arts collective in Brooklyn , a place they describe on the Internet as “ run by a loose - knit collective , usually made up of visual artists , media artists , writers , songsters , dance fanatics , flirty bohemians , political and cultural activists , and otherwise socially boisterous girls and boys . ”
They have sex parties and art shows , and above the bathroom door , instead of GIRLS or BOYS , it says TRANNIES .

Friends & Lovers
BY AMY SOHN
Gay women in New York quickly discover just how many degrees of sexual separation lie between their ex-girlfriends and their latest hookup . ( August 18 , 2003 )
Lesbian Bars
Search our database to find a place to hang .
In San Francisco , where Sienna lived a few years back , she dated “ black women who drove Harleys and were college - educated and loved punk rock .
That ’s really hard to find out here . ”
She ’s never been interested in girly girls .
“ I ’m not into all that princess shit , ” she says .
“ I ’m from Alaska , where women are all just pretty tough , and I grew up hunting with all these like 60 - or 70 - year - old women .
So to come down to New York City and see all these women who are identifying as butch and acting with all this bravado does n’t mean jack shit to me .
To me , a boi is someone who does n’t have so much to prove .
We ’re not in the clean , pressed , buttoned - up world — you ’d never see a boi cop .
Basically we threw the term around in San Francisco , and the last couple years I ’ve heard it more here .
It ’s new . ”
So new that most people — most lesbians — over the age of 30 have no idea what a boi is .
Deb Schwartz is a 37 - year - old West Village butch who has been out for fifteen years and has , at various points , worked as an activist for groups like Fed - Up Queers and ACT UP and as an editor at Out magazine .
“ It ’s just wild to me that there ’s this whole phenomenon out there that is completely news to me , ” she says .
“ Here I am , a bulldagger of a certain age , and when I first heard the term — recently — I had a conversation with an equally butch friend of mine and she was completely in the dark , too .
What ’s new is seeing these kids who really seem to be striving for a certain kind of juvenilia , not just masculinity .
They really want to be kids .
This hit me when I saw this girl — this boi , I guess — barreling out of a store in Chelsea in huge , oversize jeans , a backpack , and a baseball cap pulled down low .
And she was running as if she were late for the school bus …
Her whole aura was so completely rough - and - tumble 8 - year - old that I would n’t have been surprised if she had a slingshot in one pocket and a frog in the other . ”
Most bois are in their twenties and have come of age in a time when women ’s and gay rights seem like more of a given and less of an urgent struggle than they did to lesbians ten or twenty or more years older .
So it makes sense that they — like young women in general — have the luxury to prioritize play and pleasure in a different way , and that worrying about things like male privilege seems old - school and uncool .
But there are other criticisms bois hurl at the butches and femmes who came before them ( and co-exist with them still ) .
“ I ’m so against the whole butch - femme dichotomy , ” says Jules Rosskam , a good - looking 24 - year - old boi who is a documentary filmmaker ( her latest is about female - to - male transsexuals who have given birth ) and the associate producer of Brooklyn - based Dyke TV .
Rosskam started taking testosterone several months ago and will correct you if you refer to her as “ she ” ( which creates an interesting reality :
One of the three people in charge of Dyke TV is a he ) .
Jules is “ absolutely positive ” about getting top surgery .
“ It ’s just a question of getting $ 7,500 , ” she says .
“ I have the money technically , but it ’s tied up .
I just have to get my dad ’s permission to use it . ”
Despite the hormones and the impending surgery , Jules thinks that the idea that there are two distinct genders and nothing in between is constricting , unsophisticated , and outdated .
She dates whoever she feels like dating , and she does n’t much care for the question : “ I just feel really defensive ; I do n’t like when people feel the need to put people into categories like that .
It ’s like when you ask me , Do you date femme women ?
What does that even mean ?
Who are you even talking about ? ”
There is , however , a particular camp of bois who date femmes exclusively and follow a locker - room code of ethics referenced by the phrase “ bros before hos ” or “ bros before bitches , ” which is to say they put the similarly masculine - identified women they hang out with in a different , higher category than the feminine women they have sex with .
Kelly , a boi in her late twenties , recently sent an e-mail to a fellow boi , an Internet acquaintance , regarding a femme they both know from the scene , that reads : “ I hope she ’s not a big deal , that you ’re just riding her or whatever .
Do you want me to keep an eye on her ?
Bros up bitches down . ”
This school of bois tends to adhere to almost cartoonishly unreconstructed fifties gender roles , but , obviously , they reposition themselves as the ones who wear the pants .
Alix , a Williamsburg boi , said she wanted to meet at an East Village gay bar called Starlight for an interview on a Sunday night .
After she did n’t show up , Alix sent an e-mail explaining her reasoning : “ I did n’t see you but I ’d be lying if I said I was there .
It was raining and I need to know what I ’m getting if I ’m going out in the rain for some chick and she better be slammin’ .
And anyway , I should be the one calling the shots . ”
Sarah * , a 28 - year - old who moved here from San Francisco a little under a year ago to work in market analysis , says she has met “ maybe 30 ” femmes over the Internet — on Craig ’s List and Nerve and through the Village Voice personals — and occasionally she ’ll say “ boi seeks girl ” instead of “ butch seeks femme ” just to mix it up , and because it ’s the cooler term .
But she ’s not crazy about all its implications .
“ I ’m not entirely comfortable because so many people I ’ve met consider boi to mean transgendered or faggot , ” by which she means butch - with - butch or boi - with - boi .
“ I definitely do not want my name attached to those definitions .
I do n’t understand the faggot culture … I think it ’s disgusting , ” she says , and her face crumples with distaste and confusion , and then she laughs .
Sarah has smooth , icy pale skin and green eyes .
Her black hair has little patches of silver and is cut very short .
She is wearing big jeans and a pinstripe shirt with rolled - up sleeves under a navy - blue vest , and she sits with her legs wide apart and her big arms crossed over her chest , making her body a sculpture of toughness .
“ What I like about women is femininity , ” she says .
“ I ’m interested in women who look like women , who have womanly gestures and smell and feel , and I do n’t understand the appeal or the sense of two faggot dykes riding each other , ” she says , and cracks up .
“ Femme - on - femme is stupid to me , too .
It ’s air .
It ’s air on air .
It just seems like Cinemax fluff … long nails , you know .
One thing I hear a lot of people say about lesbianism and gayness in general is that it ’s narcissistic .
I ’ve heard so many people say that — and not just my mother .
But in a butch - femme dynamic , it ’s not mirror images . ”
Sarah ’s current dating M.O. is fairly lupine , an agenda that ’s easy to advance with the help of the Internet , the sexual glutton ’s new best friend .
But her ultimate aspirations are quite a bit more conventional :
One day she wants to give up this swinging bachelor ’s life .
“ I ’ve got this model of a household that ’s probably sick to a lot of people that makes perfect sense to me , ” she says .
“ What I want is to have a job , and have a life , and I want a partner with a job and a life to come home to , and a high standard of living , and I want us to have kids that go to school and do their homework and go on trips with their parents . ”
She smiles for a minute with the self - satisfaction of an athlete about to cream his opponent .
“ And , you know , at the end of a hard day , I would like to come home from work and have my wife suck my cock . ”
The question for many women is why , given the chance to redraw the map of gender relations , anyone would choose to be that wife .
Why is there such a thing as a femme ?
The most obvious answer is that it ’s not actually a choice ; that desire follows a logic all its own and nobody can really make rational sense of why they like whatever it is they like .
But the more complicated explanation is really another question :
Is there something subversive about playing the role of the doting wife when your husband is a woman ?
Deborah is a pretty Jewish girl with long , curly brown hair and big hoop earrings who says she “ never feels more proud than when I ’m on a butch ’s arm . ”
She wears a jean skirt and a striped top and eyeliner .
“ I do n’t go out of my apartment without makeup on unless I ’m going to the gym , and even then I ’ve got my sunglasses on , ” she says .
Her apartment is small but has the spectacular advantage of facing Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker ’s back garden .
“ I love Sex and the City , ” Deborah says .
“ I have a horrible mold problem in this place , but I do n’t want to move and give up facing the Parkers . ”
Deborah is 34 and has been out as a femme dyke for fourteen years .
“ Everyone I ’d ever seen was a goddamn bull dyke and I was like , I ’m not that !
That ’s not me !
After I met my first femme friend , I was like , Oh : I can be exactly who I am .
And then I got a huge crush on a gentleman butch .
Old - school .
Shaved head .
Hot .
I thought my heart was going to stop . ”
For Deborah , anything remotely short of butch - femme seems silly , icky , neutered .
“ One of my really good friends was like , ‘ If I was going to be with a girl , I would want to be with a girl like you , Deb , ’ ” she continues .
“ And I ’m like , ‘ You ’re sweet , but a lot of the girls who are totally like me would n’t ever in a million years sleep with you . ’
Ever .
I do n’t want to fuck myself .
What kind of balance is that ?
And the whole b-o - i business , I ’m like , what the fuck ?
What does that mean ?
In one respect I thought it meant a little bit butch of center , slightly more andro , with this whole tweezed - eyebrow business that makes me want to puke . ”
She laughs the laugh of the fed - up .
“ It ’s gotten to the point where I see men on the street and go , Damn .
If that were a woman ?
That ’s how far I ’ve been pushed in this city : I look at pictures of Johnny Depp longingly and think ,
If only you did n’t have a penis . ”
New York is to San Francisco in the lesbian scene as New York is to Los Angeles in the entertainment scene :
You can make a real go of it in Manhattan , but the unrivaled epicenter is California .
On a warm night , Diana Cage , 34 , the editor of the lesbian magazine On Our Backs ( the title is a sexed - up play on the feminist publication Off Our Backs ) , and her friend Kim * are having dinner at an Italian restaurant around the corner from a San Francisco dyke bar ( the San Francisco dyke bar ) called the Lex .
Kim is feeling anxious about the evening , because later on , Clara* , the boi she is seeing , is supposed to meet up with them at the bar , and things have been very touch - and - go .
“ Clara ’s biggest fear when we started dating was that I was going to try and fuck her .
She ’s obsessed with operating sexually as a male , ” says Kim , a pretty , punky 24 - year - old who resembles the actress Rachel Griffiths .
“ I find bois the most attractive .
I like the young , andro look , but I ’ve dated across the board — butches , femmes , trannies — and that really bothers Clara .
All her girlfriends in the past have been pretty much straight . ”
Kim offers a rueful little laugh .
“ It also threatens her that I ’m not totally vapid and vain … Her big relief was when she found out I wear a thong . ”
“ For bois it ’s like in high school , ” says Diana .
“ The girlfriend is not a person , she ’s something that everybody ’s intimidated by , and they ’re all worried about how they look and maybe if they have a girlfriend that ’s not cool and will their friends approve ? ”
Kim , looking increasingly forlorn , pushes her pasta around her plate .
“ This all ties into their kind of approach to women in general — they are so very predatory about it .
It makes me kind of uncomfortable .
Clara wo n’t just touch on it , like :
That girl ’s hot .
She will talk and talk and talk about how she wants to get them home and fuck them . ”
She looks at Diana , concerned .
“ I ’m nervous to see her now because I ’m not dressed up … and then , all of a sudden , it ’s like I ’ve come full circle .
It ’s like I ’m trying to please a guy . ”

US Court shuts down leaked doc emporium Nick Juliano

Print This Email This UPDATE : Wikileaks fighting on but court decision sets ' troubling precedent Wikileaks , the Web site that has revealed countless government secrets , has been forced offline by a California judge .
The site , which allows whistleblowers to post documents anonymously , is being sued by a Swiss banking group implicated in money laundering in documents obtained by Wikileaks .
The BBC reports :
However , the main site was taken offline after the court ordered that Dynadot , which controls the site 's domain name , should remove all traces of wikileaks from its servers .
The court also ordered that Dynadot should " prevent the domain name from resolving to the wikileaks.org website or any other website or server other than a blank park page , until further order of this Court . "
Other orders included that the domain name be locked " to prevent transfer of the domain name to a different domain registrar " to prevent changes being made to the site .
Versions of Wikileaks from Great Britain and other countries are still accessible .
In taking Wikileaks offline , the US joins China and Thailand in censoring the watchdog site .
In its report on the injunction , Wikileaks compares the case to the New York Times being ordered not to publish the Pentagon Papers .
Vice President Dick Cheney may be ordered to answer questions about a 2006 encounter he had at a Beaver Creek mall with a citizen who told him that he disagreed with the Iraq war .
Steven Howards , who was arrested for allegedly assaulting Cheney after voicing his objections , asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Craig Shaffer today to order Cheney to undergo a deposition about the exchange .
Howards , who contends he merely patted Cheney ’s arm when he made the anti-war statement , is suing the Secret Service agents who arrested him for violating his civil rights .
A criminal charge of harassment against Howards was dropped by Eagle County prosecutors .
Shaffer did not rule on Howards ’ motion but hinted he was leaning toward allowing Cheney to be deposed because he was a direct witness .
James Gilligan , an attorney for the vice president , argued that deposing Cheney would distract from his official duties and that there were other witnesses who could testify instead .
He also argued that allowing a vice president to be deposed in this case may open the door for other high - ranking government officials to be forced to testify .
Shaffer said that Cheney is “ uniquely positioned relative to the events in question , ” and the judge seemed to dismiss the argument that Cheney did n’t have time to leave his official duties for a deposition .
“ You ’re telling me a two - hour deposition would distract the vice president ? ” Shaffer asked Gilligan .
Shaffer also said that a deposition could be conducted privately with a court reporter reading a series of questions to Cheney and that a spectacle could be avoided .
Howards ’ attorney , David Lane , said he would like the opportunity to cross-examine Cheney because he wants to ask whether it is possible that the Secret Service agents changed their stories about the encounter under pressure from the vice president .
In videotaped depositions taken last year , U.S. Secret Service agents who witnessed the encounter between Howards and Cheney gave conflicting accounts of what occurred , Lane said .
“ They are accusing one another under oath of filing false reports , ” Lane said .
Also today , Shaffer declined to release the videotape of the agents and White House employee depositions for security and privacy reasons .
Lane said he plans to appeal Shaffer ’s ruling regarding the release of the deposition videotapes because he believes the public has a right to see them .

A Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747-400 will make a historic flight later this month from London 's Heathrow Airport to Amsterdam .
Although no passengers will be on board , the contents of the plane 's fuel tanks will have everyone in the airline industry watching .
The trip will be the first time a commercial aircraft has flown on biofuel .
Airline industry officials , environmentalists and energy companies all have a huge interest in the future of air travel as it pertains to fuel consumption , carbon emissions and global warming .
From the business perspective , the airlines are under great financial pressure because of soaring fuel costs ; the price of crude oil is consistently flirting with $ 100 per barrel .
On the environmental side of things , aircraft represent up to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions produced by the U.S. transportation sector , according to the Environmental Protection Agency .
Additionally , according to the Federal Aviation Administration , greenhouse gas emissions from domestic aircraft are expected to increase 60 percent by 2025 .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that increases in air transportation over the next 50 years will result in a threefold increase in aircraft CO { - 2} emissions and a 13 percent increase in ozone .
Environmental advocates say that the Virgin test flight has the potential to be a crucial benchmark in the industry 's efforts to develop a biofuel that would help eliminate the industry 's dependence on jet fuel and help reduce global carbon emissions .
Sir Richard Branson , the charismatic founder of Virgin Atlantic who also pioneered the discount carrier Virgin America based in Burlingame , announced the biofuel experiment in 2007 , and analysts said it could be feasible by the end of 2008 .
Virgin said last week it is about 10 months ahead of the anticipated date .
" This breakthrough will help Virgin Atlantic fly its planes using clean fuel sooner than expected , " Branson said in a statement .
" The demonstration flight will give us crucial knowledge that we can use to dramatically reduce our carbon footprint . "
To get it done , Virgin Atlantic is teaming with Boeing and GE Aviation , maker of the engines that power the airplane .
The airline said the GE Aviation CF6 engines used during the flight will not require modifications to burn biofuel , nor will the biofuel have negative effects on the engines .
The fuel used in the flight will be a blend of 80 percent conventional jet fuel , which is essentially kerosene , and 20 percent biofuel .
Although the exact type of biofuel to be used has not been disclosed , the airline said it is a form that does not compete with food and freshwater resources .
Branson did note that Virgin Atlantic 's British parent company , Virgin Group , pledged to invest all profits from its transportation companies toward developing clean energy , " and with this breakthrough , we are well down the path to achieving our goals . "
Jet aircraft use a petroleum - based fuel generally referred to as Jet A or Jet A - 1 .
For the sake of safety , commercial jet fuel must meet technical and operational specifications .
In the United States , all aircraft engines must be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration for use , and FAA approval is specific to the fuel that is used with each particular aircraft engine and engine type .
So , as it stands , no other type of fuel can currently be used in America , according to the Air Transport Association , the trade association for the nation 's major airlines .
In other words , it will be years before alternative fuels can replace commercial jet fuel .
" There will be extensive testing before this reaches the commercial market , " said former industry executive Henry Harteveldt , an airline industry analyst with Forrester Research in San Francisco .
Harteveldt added that , despite the fact that Virgin Atlantic , Boeing and GE " have lent a lot of credibility " to the matter , there is some cynicism afoot .
" People are saying , ' How real is this ? ' "
In September , Boeing , Air New Zealand and Rolls - Royce announced an agreement to conduct a biofuel demonstration flight in the second half of 2008 .
That flight , too , will be of a Boeing 747-400 equipped with Rolls - Royce engines .
The search for an alternative to present - day jet fuel extends beyond the commercial airline industry .
On Dec. 17 , the 104th anniversary of the Wright Brothers ' first powered flight , the Air Force said it flew an aircraft for the first time ever coast to coast using a synthetic fuel blend .
A C -17 Globemaster III transport aircraft took off from McChord Air Force Base in Washington State , with its four Pratt and Whitney F117 - 100 turbofan engines burning a mix of 50 percent traditional jet propulsion - 8 aviation fuel and 50 percent Fischer - Tropsch Kerosene , a synthetic aviation fuel derived from natural gas .
It is produced in a process called the Fischer - Tropsch method , which is named after the German chemists who invented it in the 1920s , Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch .
Hours later , the aircraft touched down at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey .
Officials said the flight was without incident .
Air Force Secretary Michael
Wynne said , " I have established the goal of having the entire ( Air Force ) fleet certified to fly on a synthetic fuel blend by about 2011 . "
That would go a long way toward reducing U.S. dependence on foreign sources of energy , Wynne said , because the conversion process can convert many types of carbon - based materials , such as coal , of which the United States has an abundant supply , to synthetic aviation fuel .
Environmentalists object to that idea , said Deron Lovaas , transportation analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington , D.C. , because " it is the path of least resistance to make synthetic fuel from other fossil fuels . "
Lovaas and others argue that liquid coal - coal that has been converted to liquid fuel - releases almost double the global warming emissions per gallon as regular gasoline .
The preferred path is toward something sustainable , he said .
Lovaas said of the Virgin Atlantic test , " Here we are with this futuristic experiment with a source of biofuel .
What Branson and the others are doing deserve our praise . "
Meanwhile , California Attorney General Jerry Brown , four other states and three environmental groups filed petitions in December with the Environmental Protection Agency saying it should curb carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted from airplanes , arguing it has a mandate under the Clean Air Act to set emission standards for aircraft .
" Global warming is such a big challenge that wherever we can reduce greenhouse gases , we must do so .
The EPA has abdicated its responsibility in this area for years , and it wo n't do its job until it 's legally required to do so , " Brown said .
The agency has 180 days in which to respond to the petitions , dated Dec. 5 .

Symbolic Programming vs. Software Engineering -- Fun vs. Professionalism -- Are These the Same Question ?
Brian Harvey
University of California , Berkeley
I was asked to talk about " the role of Logo - like learning of programming in computer science education . "
The trouble is that I 'm not sure I know what " Logo - like " means .
It 's an interesting word ; as soon as we hear it , we all feel as if we know more or less what the person who says it means .
We do n't have the same urge to interrupt that we would if someone said , for example , " recursion - like . "
But do we really understand each other ?
It gets a little fuzzy , for me , when I think about it in more detail .
What is a Logo - Like Language ?
Let me give a couple of examples .
First , I notice that in the conference announcement , the programming language ISETL is considered to be Logo - like .
But in 1976 , Seymour Papert dismissed APL , which is in many ways similar in spirit to ISETL , by referring to " languages of the BASIC / APL / FORTRAN family " [ Pap76 ] .
Logo , APL , and ISETL are all interactive languages that support recursive functions and are designed around mathematical ideas rather than around computer hardware capabilities .
Logo is different from the other two in that its mathematics is meant to appeal to young kids , while both APL and ISETL present a more conventional , adult mathematics .
What has changed to make APL non-Logo - like in 1976 but ISETL Logo - like in 1993 ?
As a second example , I 'm not sure that my own work , even when I use Logo , is really " Logo - like . "
In Seymour 's new book he characterizes the spirit of Logo as a promotion of Concrete Operational thinking from an interim stage of development , one that should be discarded as soon as possible , to a mode of thinking that is at least as valuable as Formal or abstract reasoning , even in adulthood .
[ Pap93 ]
When I read that , I was reminded of the history of the Logo IF notation .
The early dialects of Logo , up to the MIT Logo for the Apple and its Terrapin descendents , use a BASIC - like IF - THEN notation :
IF :X < 0 THEN PRINT " NEGATIVE
I was part of the design team for Apple Logo , the first LCSI product , and I was , as much as anyone , responsible for the shift to the notation in which IF is a procedure with two arguments , a true - or - false value and a list of instructions :
IF :X < 0 [ PRINT " NEGATIVE ]
Our argument was that Logo should have a single , uniform rule for evaluating expressions :
Every expression consists of the name of a procedure , followed by some number of expressions that provide the arguments .
Logo evaluates those subexpressions , then invokes the named procedure with their values as its argument values .
The advantage of the uniform notation is that it paves the way to user - defined control structures like
WHILE [ : X < 0 ] [ PRINT :X MAKE " X :X+5 ]
But there 's no question that the LCSI syntax requires some explanation for beginning Logo programmers .
By making this change , have we put general rules -- abstract thinking -- above the concrete specificity of IF / THEN ?
Was this a non-Logo - like change ?
LCSI is Seymour 's company , and they still use the newer IF syntax .
What is Logo - Like Learning ?
Both of these examples raise the question of what constitutes a Logo - like language .
I was asked to address a somewhat different question , about Logo - like learning .
But I 'm just as confused about what that means .
Let me describe two of my own experiences as a teacher , and let 's ask to what extent each of them is " Logo - like . "
The experience I enjoyed most , and of which I 'm proudest , was running a computer lab at the Lincoln - Sudbury Regional High School , in Massachusetts , from 1979 to 1982 .
It was never completely clear what I was supposed to teach .
The principal , who came from a business background , talked about " data processing . "
Some of the other teachers had picked up on the recently invented phrase " computer literacy . "
Computer science as a high school subject did n't really exist yet ; I was myself most interested in computer programming , especially systems programming .
The students , too , had a broad range of interests and expectations when they signed up for a computer course .
At first I tried offering different courses for students with different levels of interest , but I soon learned that most students did n't really know what they wanted until they had some experience within the courses .
( Remember that personal computers had just barely been invented , and most students had no idea what it meant to use a computer , or to program one . )
I ended up using a self - paced structure , in which there was one course for everyone , but each student could design his or her own curriculum within broad limits .
Logo programming was one of the options .
Every beginner was required to learn a little Logo and a little word processing ; beyond that , anything was allowed .
We had a Unix - based timesharing system .
At that time , Unix provided programming languages and application software far in advance of anything available on personal computers , such as the Apple II and the Atari 800 .
Partly because of Unix , and partly because I was spending much of my own time on system software development , the kids soon got the idea that the adult programming language was C , and so that 's what all of the really interested students used .
C is about as far from a Logo - like language as you can get !
The C programmer deals very directly with issues of data representation within a computer , such as word length and memory allocation .
On the other hand , what felt " Logo - like " about this situation was that the kids were engaged entirely in real work , using the computer for their own goals and not jumping through assigned hoops .
( Some students took on the task of helping with the school 's administrative computing ; this work was somewhat less self - directed , but even more real , than the student - initiated projects . )
A lot of effort went into video games , using the limited character - based graphics of the VT - 100 terminals .
One student wrote an EMACS - like text editor , called JOVE , that 's still widely used at Unix sites .
Not all students took to programming , but many more learned to use the word processing facility for their papers for other classes .
( One year I had three or four students who were also taking a chemistry class , in which the teacher had said they could bring one page of notes into the final exam .
These students collaborated on designing and printing a page , using the smallest available font , to cram in all their notes ! )
One reason that Logo itself was n't popular among these students was the technical limitations of the facility .
Graphics terminals were very expensive in those days .
We did have a few Atari 800 computers that we used as graphics terminals ( Atari Logo had n't been invented yet ) , but they could only handle 40 - column text , so they were n't good for much other than graphics .
The Logo interpreter we cobbled together for Unix was very slow .
There was no hardcopy graphics capability .
We did also have some Terrapin floor turtles , but they were unreliable .
Another Logo - like aspect , however , was the social interaction in the lab .
There was no formal class time ; people would come and go to use the machine or just to hang out .
An organization of students took responsibility for running the lab , and its members were given keys to the room so that they could use the machine without supervision evenings and weekends .
( Nothing was ever stolen , and there was very little breakage . )
Kids set up their own working partnerships ; more experienced kids taught newcomers .
Most of my effort went into this meta- curriculum rather than into teaching programming .
It did n't always go smoothly ; there were fights , violations of privacy , and the like .
But we all saw these problems as community problems , not just as something for me , the teacher , to deal with .
( To make this focus on community sound a bit more serious , and perhaps more " Logo - like , " let me discuss it in Piagetian terms for one paragraph .
By high school age , kids are supposed to be at the highest stage of cognitive development , the Formal Operational stage .
In a certain sense , there is nothing more for them to learn , cognitively .
On the other hand , high school kids are still far from the top of the scale in moral development .
So it makes sense that issues of community and responsibility should be central to their education . )
To sum up , my high school computer lab felt to me very much a Logo - like learning environment , although Logo itself was a minor component , and although many of its characteristics are ones that Seymour Papert lists as non-Logo - like : the equipment was concentrated in one room , the curricular focus was on computing rather than on math or other areas , and the style of work was primarily the formal , abstract , goal - directed style that Seymour criticizes as male - oriented .
I currently teach undergraduates at the University of California at Berkeley .
Our introductory computer science course was developed at MIT [ Abe85 ] ; one of the developers is Hal Abelson , a Logo old - timer who led the first microcomputer Logo development projects for the TI 99/4 and the Apple II .
The course uses Scheme , a dialect of Lisp that 's similar to Logo in many ways .
( At Berkeley we 've even modified Scheme to add the Logo word and sentence primitives , so that our students can write Logo - like language processing programs . )
Is this course Logo - like ?
How I feel about that question depends on my standard of comparison .
In a recent paper [ Har91 ]
I compare the Abelson and Sussman course with more traditional , Pascal - based , software engineering courses ; by that standard , our course feels very Logo - like indeed .
The traditional course is full of commandments about programming style , telling students what they should and should n't do .
The traditional course must spend a lot of time on programming language syntax ; our ( dare I say ) Logo - like language has a simple syntax that takes hardly any instructional time .
Students work on programming projects that are designed to illuminate big ideas in computer science : ideas that help the students write programs , rather than abstract theoretical ones .
But compared to my high school experience , this course does n't feel Logo - like at all .
The style is very different , first of all .
I give lectures to groups of 300 students .
Then the students go to the computer lab to do their assigned projects , but I 'm generally not in the lab with them .
( We do have teaching assistants in the lab at scheduled hours . )
The projects are assigned , rather than student - initiated .
In the six years I 've been at Berkeley , I 've taken some small steps toward a learning environment that feels slightly more Logo - like .
For example , we used to assign weekly homework with exercises from the textbook .
Now I assign the exercises , but do n't collect them , so that it 's clear to the students that the exercises are for their own benefit and not for evaluation purposes .
I 've instituted cooperative learning , redesigning the programming projects to be done by groups rather than by individual students .
These are very tiny steps to be discussing at a Logo conference !
But they go very much against the grain of the context within which I teach .
The introductory course is part of a curriculum ladder , and later courses depend on " covering " the curriculum .
The students , in these bad economic times , tend to be much more worried about competing for jobs than about learning .
The irony in all this , as we'd expect from our Logo experience , is that the students who end up doing best , even in the job market , are the ones who can find the courage to forget about jobs and grades and jumping through hoops , and treat my course as if it were a more Logo - like environment , getting excited about the new ideas and pushing beyond the required work to invent and explore new programming techniques .
When I was an undergraduate myself , I was lucky enough to fall in with the gang at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab , which was for me the perfect prototype of a Logo - like environment even before there was Logo .
On the one hand , everyone was engaged in real work , pushing the state of the art in computing , but on the other hand , nobody felt any pressure about it .
It was all for fun ; you could try anything , and if it did n't work out , you just tried something else .
( But do n't forget that the hacker spirit at that lab is also the prototype of the style of work that Papert and Turkle call androcentric . )
How are the Two Related ?
After this long preamble , I think I 'm ready to talk about the question in the title of this paper .
There are two different ways of looking at a computer science lab that both seem connected somehow to the Logo - like scale .
The more obvious one is about style of work ; as I 've been saying , from that perspective , my high school lab felt extremely Logo - like , and my university course does n't .
This is the question that I 've inadequately represented as " Fun vs. Professionalism " in my title .
The other is the more technical question about curriculum and programming language .
There is a very sharp distinction between the software engineering approach and what I think of as the artificial intelligence approach .
In the software engineering approach , students are being trained primarily to be disciplined in their programming style , so that their code can easily fit in with other people 's code .
The curriculum is full of rules ; the programming language used is always one with strong typing and similar restrictive rules .
Software engineers talk about object oriented programming , for example , primarily as an advance in information hiding :
An OOP language is one in which procedures as well as data have very tightly limited scopes .
The AI approach replaces this moralistic tone with the cultivation of a sense of wonder at the ways in which thinking harder about programming can pay off in increased expressiveness .
In this approach , there is n't one correct way to program , but rather a world full of programming styles and structures , each one appropriate for certain kinds of problems .
On this view , for example , object oriented programming is about a metaphor , expressing a kind of parallelism in which each datum has its own intelligence , rather than about discipline .
This division , the one I 've called " Symbolic Programming vs. Software Engineering , " is fundamentally about the philosophy of computer science .
It seems quite different from the question about style of work , but I think I can find some similarities .
One difference between a Logo microworld and an ordinary piece of educational software is that in the Logo version , the program itself is available for inspection and modification , not a black box .
In the study of computer science , a programming language is itself a microworld .
That 's why the Lisp tradition of introducing even beginners to the workings of the Lisp interpreter is Logo - like :
By examining and modifying the interpreter , we turn the Lisp microworld into a glass box instead of a black box .
A crucial part of a Logo classroom is that the learners have permission to explore using their own individual styles .
There is n't just one right way to program .
Similarly , in the symbolic programming approach to teaching computer science , there is no orthodoxy about top - down structured programming .
Top - down is one fine approach , but so is tool - building without a specific goal in view .
Symbolic languages , and languages with relaxed attitudes toward data types , allow for programming projects about sentence generation , carrying on conversations , the automated psychotherapist , and so on .
These projects are very much in the Logo tradition , and in contrast with the heavy emphasis on numeric computation that 's typical of the software engineering languages .
Logo - Like Languages Revisited
Finding these examples in which the technical details of a programming language and a curriculum seem to be connected with working in the Logo spirit gives me the courage to return to the question of languages and hope that in so doing I 'm still addressing the question that was given to me .
In my 1982 Byte article , I listed several characteristics that seemed to make Logo special . [ Har82 ]
Let me go through the list and comment on where we stand in programming languages today .
Procedural .
We seem to have won this battle .
Even BASIC , in its modern dialects , allows a modular program structure .
In fact , procedural languages are now the right wing of language design , in contrast with newer approaches such as functional , object - oriented , and logic programming .
Some recent versions of Logo address the issue of parallelism , although that newer Logo technology is not yet , I think , widely understood among the people actually using Logo in schools .
The issue today that corresponds to the one about procedural programming languages a decade ago is that many people do n't want to deal with languages at all .
Instead , modern software provides a graphical user interface , with mice , buttons , menus , and so on .
Even Logo has not ignored this trend ; LogoWriter on the Macintosh is full of immediate - mode graphical controls for things like moving and turning the turtle by hand .
I think the battle we have to fight is to maintain the position that immediate - mode control is n't enough , because it does n't allow for the abstraction of regularities and patterns of work .
There must be a way to create control structures that can carry out the same operations that can be performed graphically .
Interactive .
This is a crucial issue , and the terms of the debate have changed dramatically in recent years .
Originally , there was a clear - cut distinction between interactive languages such as Logo , Lisp , and BASIC , and non-interactive languages like C and Pascal .
The style of work in the non-interactive languages was awful .
Programmers had to write their programs in an environment entirely separate from the language itself , then go through a compilation process , and finally run the program , often with no runtime support for debugging or modifying the program .
Their excuse was that a compiled program runs much faster than an interpreted one , and indeed the Logo interpreters of that time were unpleasantly slow .
The characteristics of the underlying languages have not changed .
But today 's Pascal or C programmer works with an integrated development system .
There is a text editor that understands the syntax of the particular language , so that it can check the form of a program as you write it .
There is interactive debugging , generally using a window system effectively so that the debugging information is visually separate from the output of the program itself .
You still can't walk up to a C compiler and ask it to print 2+2 , and yet today 's C programmers are likely to complain that a Logo programmer suffers from an insufficiently interactive working environment !
For myself , I still find interaction with the actual programming language more powerful than these auxiliary interactive tools , but I 'm not sure whether that 's just because I 'm accustomed to an old - fashioned style of work .
It can certainly be argued that commercially available versions of Logo have moved backward in their provisions for debugging support ; Apple Logo allowed the user to enable an automatic PAUSE in case of an error , but LogoWriter does n't .
Recursive .
In the early Logo work , learning about recursion was a crucial step in intellectual development .
Ideas like the little person model of procedure invocation were invented mainly to help in understanding recursion .
In one sense , this battle seems to be behind us ; every modern programming language allows recursion .
But the conventional wisdom in computer science education is that recursion is too costly for ordinary use ; students are taught to prefer iterative language mechanisms .
Meanwhile , except for drawing fractals , Logo users rarely use recursion in a way that could n't be handled by conventional iterative language constructs .
( Indeed , part of my technical work has been the introduction of iterative constructs to Logo . )
I think it 's still worth remembering that recursion is a single mechanism with remarkable expressive power .
For example , these days it 's easier to draw a circle in a canned drawing program than in Logo , because the canned program has a dedicated circle feature ; but the drawing program can't use its circle feature to draw spirals or stars .
List Processing .
Logo is still out in front on this point .
Even other dialects of Lisp do n't make the manipulation of words and sentences as convenient as it is in Logo .
If you want to conjugate a verb or take the plural of a noun , Logo is the language of choice .
On the other hand , I think it 's still true that most actual Logo users consider list processing to be arcane and difficult .
LogoWriter fans often prefer to manipulate text by carrying out a sequence of text editing commands on the representation of the text on the screen , rather than apply recursive functions to the text taken as data .
My hope is that a good collection of higher - order functions like MAP and FILTER can make list processing seem more palatable .
Untyped .
This is probably where you 'll find the most heated arguments between symbolic programming enthusiasts and software engineers .
The lack of type declarations in Logo , and in Lisp generally , makes programming enormously easier to learn ; the software engineers , though , think it 's sinful .
The real argument for typed variables is that the compiler can produce more efficient programs , but the theoretical argument is that restricting a variable to a particular type makes for more disciplined programming .
( It also makes for ludicrous user interfaces , in cases where the natural thing is to read numbers until the user says something like " DONE " to indicate the end of the numbers .
Instead , the typed languages make the user type something like " 9999 " or " - 1 " to indicate the end . )
Some computer scientists will say that the advent of object oriented programming has settled this question in favor of strong typing , but the example of Object Logo shows that that is n't so .
Extensible .
We are beginning to win this battle when it comes to application software .
Many large programs these days include a " scripting language , " such as Hypertalk as the scripting language for Hypercard .
But mainstream programming languages are not generally viewed as bases for building language extensions , except in the sense that you can write a full interpreter or compiler from scratch .
This property is still very important in Logo practice , because it 's the technical basis for microworlds .
Any Logo programmer ( not just the implementors at the software companies ) can develop an extended Logo with extra primitives for some microworld .
Interesting Applications .
New applications are invented very fast these days .
Logo is in the lead in some cases ( robotics , with Lego - Logo ) , hustling to catch up in others ( MIDI support recently added to Object Logo ) , and not really in the running for some ( real - time animation , unless you have a massively parallel computer on which to run * Logo ) .
The proliferation of special - purpose software tuned to each of these application areas raises the question of whether we can reasonably expect any general - purpose programming language to be a good match in every case .
In the old days , the appeal of Logo programming was n't so much the act of programming itself as the results you could tease out of a computer ; today you can get more spectacular results without programming at all .
This is why there has been a vast decrease in the amount of time spent on programming in schools in the past few years ; students are using application programs instead .
Is this good or bad ?
In a way the issue is similar to the one that we argued about when Sprites were introduced in TI Logo : " It 's too easy to get pretty pictures on the screen in immediate mode , so kids wo n't learn to think procedurally . "
User -Friendly .
In the old days we made a big fuss about things like the text of error messages and the names of primitives .
This tradition is still alive in Logo ; the switch from OUTPUT to REPORT in LogoWriter is an example .
But a new generation of computer users accustomed to point - and - click interfaces would question the user - friendliness of any Logo environment .
I think we have to admit that Logo syntax , although better than Pascal , is still far from transparent .
Can we develop more compelling notations without sacrificing the essence of programming ?
I guess this is what Boxer is about , in part .
No Threshold , No Ceiling .
We are starting to see a division of the Logo using community .
Products like LogoWriter are deliberately aimed at the young kids who make up most of Logo 's actual audience .
Object Logo is a high - end version for more advanced programmers .
I 've found it necessary to implement my own version , Berkeley Logo , just so that there will be a more or less unchanging interpreter for the language used in my books .
In principle I suppose this is a good thing , because it allows us to extend the limits of Logo usability in both directions .
But I wonder whether Logo 's rather small audience can support so many separate development teams .
To sum up , some of the technical issues that seemed important a decade ago in distinguishing Logo from other languages are no longer at issue , such as procedural organization and recursion .
Others burn as brightly as ever : list processing and untyped variables .
Most interestingly , others have changed into different issues , especially the ones about user interfaces , such as the definition of interactiveness .

Spc. Ciara Durkin
Senator Kennedy , Senator Kerry , and U.S. Rep. William Delahunt have contacted the Department of Defense to help the family get answers .
An excerpt from Senator Kerry 's letter to Robert Gates :
As you can imagine , the confusion and potential misreporting around Specialist Durkin 's death have added to what is already an extraordinarily painful time for her mother , her siblings and her extended family , here in Massachusetts and in Ireland .
The Durkin family desperately needs answers to the following questions :
Why has the Army not responded to the Durkin family 's request for an independent autopsy ?
Why , after not responding to the family 's request for an independent autopsy , did the Army fail to contact the Durkin family with the Army 's autopsy results ?
The family was told to be available to receive a phone call between 1 and 3 PM on October 1 and the Army never called .
Why has the Army refused to make Specialist Durkin 's will and paperwork available to her family so they can respect her wishes as they plan her funeral and burial ?
The family was originally told that Durkin was killed in action , but officials changed their story over the weekend .
Now the family has been told that her death was the result of " non-combat - related causes . "
An article from the Boston Globe :
Durkin's family says
Army officials have told them she was found with a single bullet in her head , lying near the church where she worshipped on the secure Bagram Airfield .
The Army has not publicly disclosed whether a weapon was found near her body .
The Massachusetts National Guard initially reported that Durkin was killed in action , though a Guard spokesman later said the term meant only that Durkin was serving in Afghanistan at the time .
Ciara 's family speculated that she may have been a victim of a hate crime :
" Ciara was a lesbian , and that 's bound to come out , " Canavan said .
" It is possible that someone over there found that out , and , you know , maybe they were very homophobic . "
This reminds me of the controversy and confusion surrounding the death of Pat Tillman .
Families of dead soldiers are already suffering from the tragic loss of their loved ones , and these secret military investigations only add to their distress .
Why does it take Congressional intervention to force the military to produce some answers ?
Why does it seem so difficult for the DoD to determine what really happened to National Guard Spc. Ciara Durkin ?
And why does the family have to plan her funeral without being given her will ?
Update : Some commenters have suggested that Ciara may have discovered financial irregularities , and this article I just found in the Patriot Ledger seems to confirm that line of thinking .
The article also says her family reported her safety concerns to the Army three weeks ago :
GI to her family : Ask many questions if I die ; ‘ I made some enemies , ’ Durkin said
Personally , he 's never had a problem :
Rep. Barney Frank was on his cell when President Bush passed by and joked , " Tell him I said hello . "
Later , the openly gay congressman told him it was his boyfriend on the line , reports Matthew Huisman of the Boston University - Washington News Service .
" Oh , okay , I hope he appreciates how open - minded I am , " Bush said .
No , we do n't actually .
It makes everything you 've said and done publicly worse .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

February 2008
The fiery reaction to the release of Arc had an unexpected consequence : it made me realize I had a design philosophy .
The main complaint of the more articulate critics was that Arc seemed so flimsy .
After years of working on it , all I had to show for myself were a few thousand lines of macros ?
Why had n't I worked on more substantial problems ?
As I was mulling over these remarks it struck me how familiar they seemed .
This was exactly the kind of thing people said at first about Viaweb , and Y Combinator , and most of my essays .
When we launched Viaweb , it seemed laughable to VCs and e-commerce " experts . "
We were just a couple guys in an apartment , which did not seem cool in 1995 the way it does now .
And the thing we 'd built , as far as they could tell , was n't even software .
Software , to them , equalled big , honking Windows apps .
Since Viaweb was the first web - based app they 'd seen , it seemed to be nothing more than a website .
They were even more contemptuous when they discovered that Viaweb did n't process credit card transactions ( we did n't for the whole first year ) .
Transaction processing seemed to them what e-commerce was all about .
It sounded serious and difficult .
And yet , mysteriously , Viaweb ended up crushing all its competitors .
The initial reaction to Y Combinator was almost identical .
It seemed laughably lightweight .
Startup funding meant series A rounds : millions of dollars given to a small number of startups founded by people with established credentials after months of serious , businesslike meetings , on terms described in a document a foot thick .
Y Combinator seemed inconsequential .
It 's too early to say yet whether Y Combinator will turn out like Viaweb , but judging from the number of imitations , a lot of people seem to think we 're on to something .
I can't measure whether my essays are successful , except in page views , but the reaction to them is at least different from when I started .
At first the default reaction of the Slashdot trolls was ( translated into articulate terms ) : " Who is this guy and what authority does he have to write about these topics ?
I have n't read the essay , but there 's no way anything so short and written in such an informal style could have anything useful to say about such and such topic , when people with degrees in the subject have already written many thick books about it . "
Now there 's a new generation of trolls on a new generation of sites , but they have at least started to omit the initial " Who is this guy ? "
Now people are saying the same things about Arc that they said at first about Viaweb and Y Combinator and most of my essays .
Why the pattern ?
The answer , I realized , is that my m.o. for all four has been the same .
Here it is : I like to find ( a ) simple solutions ( b ) to overlooked problems ( c ) that actually need to be solved , and ( d ) deliver them as informally as possible , ( e ) starting with a very crude version 1 , then ( f ) iterating rapidly .
When I first laid out these principles explicitly , I noticed something striking : this is practically a recipe for generating a contemptuous initial reaction .
Though simple solutions are better , they do n't seem as impressive as complex ones .
Overlooked problems are by definition problems that most people think do n't matter .
Delivering solutions in an informal way means that instead of judging something by the way it 's presented , people have to actually understand it , which is more work .
And starting with a crude version 1 means your initial effort is always small and incomplete .
I 'd noticed , of course , that people never seemed to grasp new ideas at first .
I thought it was just because most people were stupid .
Now I see there 's more to it than that .
Like a contrarian investment fund , someone following this strategy will almost always be doing things that seem wrong to the average person .
As with contrarian investment strategies , that 's exactly the point .
This technique is successful ( in the long term ) because it gives you all the advantages other people forgo by trying to seem legit .
If you work on overlooked problems , you 're more likely to discover new things , because you have less competition .
If you deliver solutions informally , you ( a ) save all the effort you would have had to expend to make them look impressive , and ( b ) avoid the danger of fooling yourself as well as your audience .
And if you release a crude version 1 then iterate , your solution can benefit from the imagination of nature , which , as Feynman pointed out , is more powerful than your own .
In the case of Viaweb , the simple solution was to make the software run on the server .
The overlooked problem was to generate web sites automatically ; in 1995 , online stores were all made by hand by human designers , but we knew this would n't scale .
The part that actually mattered was graphic design , not transaction processing .
The informal delivery mechanism was me , showing up in jeans and a t - shirt at some retailer 's office .
And the crude version 1 was , if I remember correctly , less than 10,000 lines of code when we launched .
The power of this technique extends beyond startups and programming languages and essays .
It probably extends to any kind of creative work .
Certainly it can be used in painting : this is exactly what Cezanne and Klee did .
At Y Combinator we bet money on it , in the sense that we encourage the startups we fund to work this way .
There are always new ideas right under your nose .
So look for simple things that other people have overlooked — things people will later claim were " obvious " — especially when they 've been led astray by obsolete conventions , or by trying to do things that are superficially impressive .
Figure out what the real problem is , and make sure you solve that .
Do n't worry about trying to look corporate ; the product is what wins in the long term .
And launch as soon as you can , so you start learning from users what you should have been making .
Reddit is a classic example of this approach .
When Reddit first launched , it seemed like there was nothing to it .
To the graphically unsophisticated its deliberately minimal design seemed like no design at all .
But Reddit solved the real problem , which was to tell people what was new and otherwise stay out of the way .
As a result it became massively successful .
Now that conventional ideas have caught up with it , it seems obvious .
People look at Reddit and think the founders were lucky .
Like all such things , it was harder than it looked .
The Reddits pushed so hard against the current that they reversed it ; now it looks like they 're merely floating downstream .
So when you look at something like Reddit and think " I wish I could think of an idea like that , " remember : ideas like that are all around you .
But you ignore them because they look wrong .
10 . Regular expressions are everywhere
Here 's a short list of programming languages and tools that support regular expressions .
The links are to their regex documentation .
9 . Regular expression mastery can help you stand out from the crowd
Regular expressions might be everywhere , but many experienced programmers are intimidated by them .
Knowing how to use regular expressions effectively is a valuable skill that can quickly make your peers take notice .
8 . Wielding regular expressions can make you feel like a mighty wizard
Regular expressions can be difficult to master , but doing so is that much more rewarding as a result .
Writing a line of cryptic letters and symbols that does what might otherwise take hundreds of lines of code can feel pretty cool .
7 . If your search is simple , regular expression syntax is simple
Want to match the word " cat " ?
The regex is simply cat .
^cat matches " cat " at the beginning of the string , cat$ matches at the end , and cat|dog matches " cat " or " dog " .
Most regex syntax is very simple once you get the hang of it .
6. Regular expressions are portable
That 's a bold lie , yet it 's usually true for people who stick to the basics or intentionally write their regexes in a portable way .
The majority of regex syntax works the same in a wide variety of programming languages and tools .
5. Regular expressions can help you write short code
This can be especially helpful in JavaScript , where keeping code length down is important for people with slow Internet connections .
And although regexes can be hard to read , I 'd rather spend a minute stepping through the logic of a regex than doing the same thing with a page full of code .
Of course , like with most things in life it 's important to find a good balance .
4. Regular expressions save time
Even for newcomers who still struggle with the syntax , regular expressions are often the fastest way to get the job done .
3. Regular expressions are fast
Although typical backtracking regex engines have so - called pathological cases which can take a very long time , regexes written with performance in mind will be fast enough for your needs in almost all cases .
To ensure that 's true , it 's a good idea to at least get a feel for the basics of regex performance optimization .
2. Regular expressions can match just about anything
In other words , regular expressions are powerful .
A regular expression guru can find many appropriate uses for regexes where the untrained user might not think to look .
As the authors of Programming Perl wrote , " if you take ' text ' in the widest possible sense , perhaps 90 % of what you do is 90 % text processing . "
1. Regular expressions are fun
Like any good challenge , regexes can be a lot of fun .
Tools like RegexPal can help remove a lot of the guesswork , so you can concentrate on solving problems .
… Feel free to add your own reasons why you think regexes are awesome ^2 or the worst idea since unicycles .
ANN Coulter suffered a serious embarrassment over the weekend when her credit card was declined in Palm Beach .
According to our spy , the nutty arch - conservative was caught at 9:45 p.m. Saturday night in the 10 Items or Less line at the local Publix when her card was rejected .
“ She was embarrassed but did n’t make a scene , ” our witness said .
“ She just paid with cash and ran out of there .
But at least she ’s eating . ”
Researchers found that energy used during active games was still much lower than if playing sports .
But with the growing problem of childhood obesity , the authors of the report say any form of exercise should be encouraged .
Experts still warn they are no substitute for playing real sports .
Tim Cable , Professor in Exercise Physiology , said : " Children spend a lot of time playing computer games and it can be very difficult to persuade them to put down their consoles and do something else .
" More active computer games could be a useful way of increasing their activity levels and getting them interested in playing some of the sports for real . "

" Some say the world will end in fire , Some say in ice , " wrote the poet Robert Frost .
Astronomers , it turns out , are in the former camp .
A new calculation predicts that Earth will be swallowed up by the sun in 7.6 billion years , capping off a longstanding debate over whether the sun 's gravitational pull will have weakened enough for Earth to escape final destruction or not .
Other theorists have predicted that our planet will fry as the sun expands in its old age .
But the time estimates have varied by a couple billion years .
" Although people have looked at these problems before , we would claim this is the best attempt that 's been made to date , and probably the most reliable , " said astronomer Robert Smith , emeritus reader at the U.K. 's University of Sussex , who made the new calculations with astronomer Klaus - Peter Schroeder of the University of Guanajuato in Mexico .
" What we 've done is to refine existing models and to put the best calculations we can at each point in the model . "
If 7.6 billion years does n't sound like an urgent death sentence , do n't relax yet .
Regardless of whether Earth will ultimately be vaporized , as the sun heats up , our planet will become too hot to live on before then .
" After a billion years or so you 've got an Earth with no atmosphere , no water and a surface temperature of hundreds of degrees , way above the boiling point of water , " Smith told SPACE.com .
" The Earth will become dry basically .
It will become completely impossible for life of any kind to exist .
It 's a pretty gloomy forecast . "
Nonetheless , scientists are curious about the ultimate fate of our planet after we are gone ( like all previous hominids and more than 99 % of all species that have lived on Earth , humans will probably go extinct , and it will likely happen sooner than a billion years ) .
Smith 's earlier studies found that Earth would narrowly escape being engorged .
As the sun ages and expands into a red giant star , it will shed its outer gaseous layers , thus losing mass and weakening its gravitational pull .
Previous calculations found that this let - up would allow the Earth 's orbit to shift outward , enabling the planet to slip free of the smoldering sun .
But this scenario does n't account for tidal forces , and the drag of the sun 's outer layers .
As the Earth orbits the sun , its smaller gravitational pull is n't completely negligible — it actually causes the side of the sun closest to our planet to hoard more mass and bulge out toward us .
" Just as the Earth is pulling on the sun 's bulge , it 's pulling on the Earth , and that causes the Earth to slow in its orbit , " Smith said .
" It will spiral back and finally end up inside the sun . "
In addition , the gas that the sun expels will also drag Earth inward toward its demise .
Smith 's previous calculations had ignored these effects .
" We did n't think it mattered , but it turns out it does , " he said .
" You might say our previous models had a gap . "
There may even be hope for Earth .
Some scientists have proposed a scheme for down the road to use the gravity of a passing asteroid to budge Earth out of the way of the sun toward cooler territory , assuming there is life around at the time that is intelligent enough to engineer this solution .
" It sounds like science fiction , but there 's a group of people who have quite seriously suggested that it might be possible , " Smith said .
" If it 's done right , that would just keep the Earth moving fast enough to keep it out of harm 's way .
Maybe life could go on for as much as 7 billion years . "
Smith 's findings have been accepted for publication in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .

I think this brings us up to seven or eight “ number threes ” killed in the al - Qaeda hierachy since 2001 .
Must be a hell of a corporate flow chart they have .
I wonder what country the next guy will be situated in when our government decides to “ promote ” him .
Somehow I think it will end up being whatever country the president ’s taking the most criticism on that particular day .
Update : According to the updated version of CNN ’s story on the death of al - Qaeda “ number three ” Abu Laith al - Libi :
In October , the U.S. military ’s anti-terror Combined Joint Task Force - 82 announced rewards ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 200,000 for al - Libi and 11 other mid-level Taliban and al Qaeda leaders .
The military distributed posters and billboards with pictures and names of the insurgents around eastern Afghanistan .
Al - Libi and the others were described at the time by CJTF - 82 spokesman Maj .
Chris Belcher as “ mid - level bad guys . ” ( emphasis mine )
Translation : “ Mid - level ” is not generally a classification for a high - value target , which means there ’s pretty much no difference between al - Qaeda ’s recently deceased “ number three man ” and a couple dozen other schmucks running around out there on the AF / PAK border except that the military and the press happened to have a photo and a name for this guy .
“ Meat and potatoes ” are the foundation of most American cooking and of many European cuisines as well .
The spud is so rooted in Western cooking that it ’s sometimes hard to believe the vegetable was totally unknown in Europe just a few hundred years ago .
In the mid 16th century , Spanish conquistadors in South America discovered that the Incas ate a white tuber they called “ papa . ”
( Perhaps it was the “ father ” of their diet . )
The Incas used the plum - sized vegetables in hundreds of ways , baking them in hot ash , eating them raw or dried , and even pounding them into a flour .
The Spaniards thought the tuber was a form of truffle , since the Incas found them underground .
Pedro Cieca , an officer of Juan Pizarro , shipped a load of the spuds back to Spain .
From there , they were sent to the Pope for inspection , and eventually to a Belgian botanist for classification .
The botanist called the vegetable taratoufli , “ little truffle , ” a word recognizable in the present German word for potato , kartoffel .
But the Spaniards found the spud similar to the sweet potato , called patata after the African batata , and christened the new vegetable by the same name .
The English for a time also called both vegetables by the same name : potato .
Within twenty years of their arrival in Europe , potatoes were being grown , sold , and eaten in Spain , though far less than the sweet potato .
After Sir Walter Raleigh planted potatoes on his Irish estate , spud farms began to sprout up all around the Emerald Isle .
But in England and Scotland , the potato remained unpopular for two hundred years , defamed as “ Ireland ’s lazy root . ”
In the late 17th century , the German monarch Frederick William decided that the potato could solve his nation ’s food shortage , and he decreed that all peasants should plant spuds .
Those who refused to would have their noses and ears cut off .
It ’s unknown how many farmers lost their features because of the bog apple , but Frederick ’s decree may help explain why potatoes have become so popular in Germany .
The English , with considerably less encouragement to plant the spud , did not become large - scale potato eaters until the latter half of the 18th century .
The Scots , meanwhile , continued to resist the spud , with some Presbyterian clergymen declaring that since the vegetable was not mentioned in the Bible it could not be fit for human consumption .
France was the last European nation to accept the potato .
A soldier who had spent considerable time in Germany returned to his homeland to convince fellow Frenchmen that the potato was both edible and delicious , despite medical advice that the vegetable was “ toxic and the cause of many illnesses . ”
The first potato to reach the shores of North America arrived around 1622 , imported by Virginia colonists as a food .
The first potato cultivation did n’t begin in America until 1719 , when Irish immigrants planted spud fields in New Hampshire .
Thomas Jefferson , by the way , was the first American to serve french fries with beefsteak , a combination now as institutionalized in America as the Declaration of Independence .
And it was the German immigrants you can either thank or blame for potato salad .
Of all the foodstuffs indigenous to the Americas , none is as useful as the potato .
Potatoes are easy to cultivate and can be stored for long periods of time .
To give you an idea of the fecundity of the potato , in 1968 , an English farmer reported that just six seed potatoes had yielded a whopping 1,190 pounds of spuds .
The potato is also one of the most versatile vegetables .
You can do almost anything to the spud and still it insists on remaining edible .
Potatoes can be home - fried , french - fried , deep - fried , mashed , hash - browned , baked , boiled , oven - roasted , or made into chips , sticks , salad , pancakes .
They can be coal - roasted as mickies , or powdered into instant potatoes , well , you get the idea .
Spuds can also team up deliciously with many other foods , and the list of dishes featuring the potato is virtually endless .
Potatoes O’Brien joins diced , fried spuds with onions , green peppers , and pimientos .
For potatoes Lyonnaise , boil potato slices , then brown and add onions .
Dumplings are made from grated spuds and baking soda , while potato knishes wrap mashed potatoes and onions in a pastry dough .
Popular potato soups include vichyssoise , made from onions , leeks , potatoes , cream , and consomme , and usually served cold .
For scalloped potatoes , spread alternate layers of thin - sliced potatoes and onions in a casserole dish , add milk , and bake .
Speaking of thin - sliced spuds , the well - known Saratoga chips were invented , not surprisingly , in Saratoga , New York , when a guesthouse chef appropriately named George Crumb lost his patience with a guest who insisted on thin french fries .
Crumb cut a potato into paper - thin slices , dropped them in oil , and - presto ! - another American institution was founded .
In 1969 , Australian Paul Tully set a record for potato chip devouring by consuming thirty two - ounce bags in twenty - four - and - a - half minutes , without a drink .
And while we ’re on the subject , the record for potato gobbling is three pounds in four minutes and forty - five seconds , set in Worcestershire , England in 1976 .
We have no idea if the spuds were peeled or unpeeled , or served with or without Worcestershire sauce .
To settle an oft - heard dispute : no , the sweet potato and the yam are not the same vegetable .
The yam is in fact almost never seen in this country , no matter what food packagers claim to the contrary !
More than one American tourist has been known to ask his confused French waiter for french fries .
The French actually call them pommes ( rites , and the French word for potato is pomme de terre , literally “ earth apple . ”
The French have also contributed “ pommes soufflés ” , or souffled potatoes , to our gastronomic repertoire .
The delicacy was reportedly created by the personal chef of Louis XIV .
In this case , necessity was definitely the mother of invention .
One afternoon , the king left the palace to inspect his army , then engaged in warfare with the Dutch .
On the return voyage to the palace , the Sun King ’s coach was delayed by a downpour that made the roads impassable .
When his master did not appear at the expected hour , the Royal Chef began to panic .
The Great Monarch was a most fastidious diner , who insisted that his repasts be served the instant he arrived at the royal dinner table .
The cook had prepared a huge batch of the king ’s beloved pommes frites , but as the hours passed and still Louis failed to appear , the fries began to frazzle and turn cold and soggy .
Suddenly , a herald announced the entrance of the king .
The agitated chef , in dismay , grabbed the deep - fat fryer and submerged the wilted french fries in sizzling oil , shaking the fryer madly from side to side .
Et voila , a dish fit for a king was born .
The potatoes emerged from this second bath in deep hot oil all puffed up , golden brown and heavenly delicious .
To make pommes soufflies is a culinary feat .
It is said that the heat of the oils must be perfect .
Consult a good cookbook and try it .
You , too , might achieve gastronomic immortality .
According to another tale , however , the origin of souffled potatoes is considerably less regal .
A 19th century French chef was charged with preparing a banquet to celebrate the opening of a new railroad line .
While preparing the repast at one of the new stations , the chef was notified that the train carrying a coachload of dignitaries to the banquet would be delayed .
So he took his half - cooked french fries out of the oil and began preparing a fresh batch .
Then he was notified that the train was pulling into the station , on time after all .
Frantic , the chef plunged the half - cooked potatoes back into the fat , and the soggy fries puffed into crisp ovals , pommes soufflies !
The sweet potato and the yam are not the same vegetable .
The yam , in fact , is rarely grown in the United States .
Today , Americans consume literally billions of spuds each year , production usually hovers around 34 billion pounds , with the most well - known varieties hailing from Idaho , Maine , and Long Island .
Potatoes remain , pound for pound , one of the cheapest foodstuffs available , perhaps because they can be grown so easily .
If you believe some mothers , they ’ll even grow behind the dirty ears of little boys .
1. Mobs , Messiahs , and Markets : Surviving the Public Spectacle in Finance and Politics
In Mobs , Messiahs , and Markets , Bonner and freelance journalist Lila Rajiva use literary economics to offer broader insights into mass behavior and its devastating effects on society .
Why is it , they ask , that perfectly sane and responsible individuals can get together , and by some bizarre alchemy turn into an irrational mob ?
What makes them trust charlatans and demagogues who manipulate their worst instincts ?
Why do they abandon good sense , good behavior and good taste when an empty slogan is waved in front of them .
Why is the road to hell paved with so many sterling intentions ?
Why is there a fool on every corner and a knave in every public office ?
2. The Shock Doctrine : The Rise of Disaster Capitalism
The author ’s thesis is simply stated : that neoliberal economic programs have repeatedly been implemented without the consent of the governed by creating and / or taking advantage of various forms of national shock therapy .
Ms. Klein asserts that in country after country , Friedman and his Chicago School followers have foisted their tripartite economic prescription - privatization , deregulation , and cutbacks in social welfare spending - on an unsuspecting populace through decidedly non-democratic means .
In the early years , the primary vehicle was dictatorial military force and accompanying fear of arrest , torture , disappearance , or death .
Over time , new organizations such as the IMF and the World Bank were employed instead , using or creating impossible debt burdens to force governments to accept privatization of state - owned industries and services , complete removal of trade barriers and tariffs , forced acceptance of private foreign investment , and widespread layoffs .
3. The Other America
Few works of contemporary non-fiction have had more lasting impact on the social consciousness of the overall society from which it arose than “ The Other America “ , Michael Harrington ’s now classic tome on the egregious conditions under which what we would now call the “ underclass ” lived in mid-20th century American society .
With an uncommon verve and uncanny precision , Harrington painstakingly detailed the disgusting and shocking realities of life for those many millions of Americans of both color and ethnicity living lives of desperate poverty in the midst of the affluent society .
Millions of readers , myself included , were shocked to discover the extent to which this world coexisted with our own , and many of the social action programs that arose in the 1960s and thereafter used this book as a kind of reference guide to the realities of poverty in contemporary society .
4. Hegemony or Survival : America ’s Quest for Global Dominance ( The American Empire Project )
In this highly readable , heavily footnoted critique of American foreign policy from the late 1950s to the present , Chomsky ( whose 9 - 11 was a bestseller last year ) argues that current U.S. policies in Afghanistan and Iraq are not a specific response to September 11 , but simply the continuation of a consistent half - century of foreign policy - an “ imperial grand strategy ” - in which the United States has attempted to “ maintain its hegemony through the threat or use of military force . ”
Such an analysis is bound to be met with skepticism or antagonism in post - September 11 America , but Chomsky builds his arguments carefully , substantiates claims with appropriate documentation and answers expected counterclaims .
Chomsky is also deeply critical of inconsistency in making the charge of “ terrorism . ”
Using the official U.S. legal code definition of terrorism , he argues that it is an exact description of U.S. foreign policy ( especially regarding Cuba , Central America , Vietnam and much of the Middle East ) , although the term is rarely used in this way in the U.S. media , he notes , even when the World Court in 1986 condemned Washington for “ unlawful use of force ” ( ” international terrorism , in lay terms ” Chomsky argues ) in Nicaragua .
Claiming that the U.S. is a rogue nation in its foreign policies and its “ contempt for international law , ” Chomsky brings together many themes he has mined in the past , making this cogent and provocative book an important addition to an ongoing public discussion about U.S. policy .
5. Empire of Debt : The Rise of an Epic Financial Crisis
Many Americans have resisted the notion that their country is an imperial power .
The idea seems to contradict the values of the Republic and its Founding Fathers .
But in Empire of Debt , prominent financial analysts Bill Bonner and Addison Wiggin argue passionately that not only is the United States an empire , but it is also one whose end is coming soon .
Bonner and Wiggin are the brains behind www.dailyreckoning.com, an iconoclastic and irreverent market advisory service that has long raised concerns about American indebtedness and warned of a looming dollar crisis .
In Empire of Debt , a sequel to their earlier doom - and - gloom book Financial Reckoning Day , they elaborate on their argument that the U.S. economy is about to implode .
6. Superpatriotism
Superpatriots , writes Michael Parenti , are those people who place national pride and American supremacy above every other public consideration , those who follow leaders uncritically , especially in their war policies abroad .
Superpatriotism is the nationalistic hype propagated by officialdom , the media , and various flag - waving groups .
Parenti demonstrates how superpatriotism attaches itself to religion , sports , the military , the schools and big business .
He questions whether its top politico - economic propagators are themselves really patriotic , given how they evade taxes , export our jobs , pollute our land and plunder the public treasury .
With incisive probing and a humorous touch , Parenti addresses such urgent questions as :
What does it mean to love one ’s country ?
Why is it so important to be Number One ?
What determines America ’s “ greatness ? ”
He examines how US leaders and the corporate media fan the flames of fear to win support for huge arms budgets , global aggrandizement , and the suppression of political dissent at home and abroad .
7. A Demon of Our Own Design : Markets , Hedge Funds , and the Perils of Financial Innovation
Why do markets keep crashing and why are financial crises greater than ever before ?
As the risk manager to some of the leading firms on Wall Street–from Morgan Stanley to Salomon and Citigroup–and a member of some of the world ’s largest hedge funds , from Moore Capital to Ziff Brothers and FrontPoint Partners , Rick Bookstaber has seen the ghost inside the machine and vividly shows us a world that is even riskier than we think .
The very things done to make markets safer , have , in fact , created a world that is far more dangerous .
From the 1987 crash to Citigroup closing the Salomon Arb unit , from staggering losses at UBS to the demise of Long - Term Capital Management , Bookstaber gives readers a front row seat to the management decisions made by some of the most powerful financial figures in the world that led to catastrophe , and describes the impact of his own activities on markets and market crashes .
Much of the innovation of the last 30 years has wreaked havoc on the markets and cost trillions of dollars .
A Demon of Our Own Design tells the story of man ’s attempt to manage market risk and what it has wrought .
In the process of showing what we have done , Bookstaber shines a light on what the future holds for a world where capital and power have moved from Wall Street institutions to elite and highly leveraged hedge funds .
8. How to Rig an Election : Confessions of a Republican Operative
This book confirms everything you suspected was true about how politicians get elected in the country .
It has the tone of a P.J. O’Rourke novel , hilarious and all too real at the same time because it happened .
I laughed all the way through it , and then watched Hardball with Chris Matthews in a whole new light once I was done .
One reviewer asked “ who has ever heard of this guy ? ” and that is exactly the point !
These nameless , faceless operatives and consultants are legion in both political parties and they are the ones who actually decide what candidates say , do , wear , etc .
Raymond was a very high level player at the Republican National Committee , chief of staff to a republican congressman and ran numerous campaigns at the national level , he saw it all from the inside and it ’s not pretty .
A great read , I highly recommend .
9. Peddling Prosperity : Economic Sense and Nonsense in the Age of Diminished Expectations
In “ Peddling Prosperity “ , P. Krugman describes with clear and simple words what America ’s economic problems have been in the last 25 years .
He presents theory , ideas , Government policies ( or lack of ) and individual stories - history , in fact - with such penetrating views that , while reading , one wishes the book could go on forever .
We can only hope that he will repeat this achievement in the next book .
10 . Battle For The Soul Of Capitalism
Jack Bogle , often called the “ concience of the industry , ” has written a powerful book on a subject that concerns every American– ” capitalism . ”
As founder and retired CEO of the second largest mutual fund company in the world , Mr. Bogle understands capitalism .
He has the unusual ability ( for a businessman ) to write beautifully , logically and understandably for the average reader .
“ The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism ” is the result .
The thrust of Mr. Bogle ’s message ( documented over and over ) is that corporations are now controlled by their managers – not by their owners ( shareholders ) .
( The average CEO compensation has soared to 280 times that of the average worker . )
Mr. Bogle deftly lays out the problem , but more importantly , he gives us the solution that will return capitalism to its owners and value creation .
I could not put the book down .

Tax dodgers around Europe take note -- Germany is ready to hand over data to other countries .
Develop Lisp applications using the Cusp Eclipse plug-in
Lisp is n't just for artificial intelligence anymore --
Try it and you may think of Java and C programming differently
Cusp , an Eclipse development environment for Lisp
Cusp is a development environment for the Common Lisp programming language .
Using Lisp , you can develop all sorts of applications , including Web applications .
Lisp is the second oldest programming language still used widely today ( after Fortran ) and is known as the first functional language .
The creation of Lisp began in the late 1950s and was first implemented in 1958 by the MIT Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) Project .
Its strength is in the processing of lists : AI and symbol mathematics .
In fact , Lisp is short for " list processor , " which was the need under which this programming language was created , as you 'll see in the following paragraphs ( see Related topics for Lisp historical information ) .
You 'll notice that Lisp is not at all like other general programming languages .
For example , in most general programming languages , you perform multiplication just as you would on paper : int times = 5 * 5 ;.
With Lisp , the following would produce 75 : (* 5 5 3 ) .
The maximum in this list : ( MAX 9 8 7 6 20 ) returns 20 .
Notice that the phrase " first functional language " here is apt , as everything is based on functions .
Each function can have a variable number of parameters .
The processing of these lists using recursion and Lisp functions like car and cdr is the power of list processing using Lisp .
Given Lisp 's age , you can find many development environments for it .
However , also inherent to old programming languages , the tool support is mostly text - based and not intuitive for newcomers .
Thus , one reason to try Cusp is that it has an intuitive GUI for newcomers to learn and develop Lisp in , rather than a text - based " try- to - remember - all - of - these - commands " type of interface .
It also has the advantage of the superb project management features inherent in the Eclipse GUI framework .
Before going on , you 'll need to download the latest Eclipse classic bundle from Eclipse.org .
Then you 'll learn how to install and set up Cusp .
Installing Cusp
You should now have a zipped - up archive of the Eclipse classic bundle .
Un-archive it and run eclipse.exe .

Click Install all .
At the end of the installation , you 'll be asked to restart Eclipse ; click Yes .
You 've installed the Eclipse Cusp plug - in .
Next , you 'll set up a Lisp project .
Setting up a Lisp project
Before Lisp development can begin , you need to set up a new Lisp project .
You can do so by going to File > New > Project .
Expand the Lisp folder , click Lisp Project , and click Next .
Choose a name for the new project , my_new_lisp_project , as shown below , then click Finish .
Figure 5 . Naming your new Lisp project
After clicking Finish , your new project gets created and the Lisp perspective opens , as shown below .
Figure 6 . The Lisp perspective
Behold the Lisp perspective .
The Lisp Navigator window shows your open project , along with its associated files .
The Outline window shows an outline of the currently open file .
The top - right window , showing main.lisp , is the Lisp development window .
The bottom - right window , REPL , is the command - line Lisp interpreter , where you can run Lisp commands .
In the event you close Eclipse and reopen it , you 'll need to load your projects . asd file , as shown below .
Figure 7 .
Loading your ASD file
Note that you need to right click the my_new_lisp_project.asd file under the my_new_lisp_project folder and select Load asd .
What this essentially does is compile your Lisp project in the REPL window , allowing you to enter Lisp commands that can use your new code .
Next , you 'll try out some Lisp development using Cusp .
Lisp development using Cusp
First , you 'll define a simple custom function and test it , as well .
Open the main.
lisp file and , using the defun ( define function ) command , and add the following :
... ( defun first_howdy_function ( ) " howdy ho " )
Save the file .
To export the function from within the package , type the following code in defpackage .
lisp :
... ;;
Exported symbols go here first_howdy_function ) )
The function can be used from outside the package .
To test your new function , type the following in the lower window of REPL : ( my_new_lisp_project:first_howdy_function ) .
Note that for the scope you 're in , this is the same as entering ( my_new_lisp_project::first_howdy_function ) .
This is what you would have to type if you did n't export the function in defpackage .
lisp .
Click Send and check out the output .
The output from entering either of the above commands is as follows :
COMMON -LISP -USER > ( my_new_lisp_project:first_howdy_function ) " howdy ho "
There you have it : your first Lisp Howdy function .
Try an echo function with an input to it :
... ( defun first_echo_function ( echoval ) echoval )
As with the last function , export it in defpackage .lisp .
You 'll test this first_echo_function by typing the following in the lower portion of the REPL window : ( my_new_lisp_project:first_echo_function ' ( " howd " " y h " " o " ) ) .
Note that the ' ( " howd " " y h " " o " ) portion is the syntax for defining a list .
First , the single quote must precede the parentheses , then the list elements are defined within the parentheses .
The output is shown below :
COMMON -LISP -USER > ( my_new_lisp_project:first_echo_function ' ( " howd " " y h " " o " ) ) ( " howd " " y h " " o " )
You 'll create a method to process each list element individually , which is the true power of Lisp .
Define it as follows :
( defmethod concat2 ( ( str1 string ) ( str2 string ) ) ( concatenate ' string str1 str2 ) )
Note that the above method actually defines a type string .
Up to now , you 've been using Lisp as a largely typeless language .
Though the double quotes implicitly types data as strings , the above method explicitly types both the input and output to the concat2 function as strings .
This method also uses the built - in concatenate function to combine two strings and return them as a single string .
To test concat2 , export it , then type ( my_new_lisp_project:concat2 " howd " " y ho " ) .
Its output is as follows :
Listing 7 .
The output of concatenating two strings
COMMON -LISP -USER > ( my_new_lisp_project:concat2 " howd " " y ho " ) " howdy ho "
There you have it .
The strings " howd " and " y ho " become " howdy ho . "
Now you 'll create a more generalized concatenation function using the two functions Lisp is famous for : car and cdr .
Listing 1 . Concatenating three elements in a list
( defun concat3 ( args_list ) ( concat2 ( car args_list ) ( concat2 ( car ( cdr args_list ) ) ( car ( cdr ( cdr args_list ) ) ) ) ) )
Note that this function still uses the concat2 function , but takes as its input a parameter list .
Take note of how each section of the concatenation is retrieved from args_list .
The car takes the first element from the list .
The cdr returns the list minus the first element .
You can see how you 'd get the first element by just calling the car function on the list .
Obtaining the second element requires calling the cdr on the list , then the car on the new list .
The third element is taken by calling the cdr on the list twice and calling car on the final list .
The output of the above function after exporting it is as follows :
COMMON -LISP -USER > ( my_new_lisp_project:concat3 ' ( " howd " " y h " " o " ) ) " howdy ho "
And there you go .
The three strings were concatenated correctly to produce " howdy ho . "
Next , you 'll create a recursive function .
Recursion using Lisp
The last function you 're going to create is going to take some recursion , where the true power of list processing using Lisp lies .
Iteration is possible ( looping through each item one by one ) , but unlike general languages like the Java language , recursion is by far the easiest way to process lists in Lisp .
You 'll know exactly what recursion is by the end of this section .
Begin by creating a recursive concat function .
Listing 2 . Recursive concatenation ( unlimited parameters )
1 ( defun concat_recursive ( args_list ) 2 ( if ( equal ( cdr args_list ) nil ) 3 ( car args_list ) 4 ( concat2 ( car args_list ) 5 ( concat_recursive ( cdr args_list ) ) ) ) )
Recursion can be a difficult concept to tackle , so lets walk through this one :
Assume an arbitrary argument list is passed to the above function .
If there is only one element in the list ( the ( cdr args_list ) portion on line 2 returns nil ) , return the single element ( the ( car args_list ) on line 3 ) .
portion on line 2 returns nil ) , return the single element ( the on line 3 ) .
If there is more than one element in the list ( meaning the ( cdr args_list ) portion on line 2 did not return nil ) , return the result of concatenating ( using concat2 ) the first element of the list ( see line 4 ) and the result of recursively calling concat_recursive using the result of ( cdr args_list ) as parameters ( see line 5 ) .
When passing the following list as a parameter , ' ( " ho " " wd " " y " " h " " o " ) , the following is a walk - through of the output :
The first time line 2 is reached , the if statement is false , and concat2 is called with " ho " and ( concat_recursive ' ( " wd " " y " " h " " o " ) ) .
statement is false , and is called with and .
The second time line 2 is reached , the if statement is again false , and concat2 is called with " wd " and ( concat_recursive '( " y " " h " " o " ) ) .
statement is again false , and is called with and .
The third time line 2 is reached , the if statement is again false , and concat2 is called with " y " and ( concat_recursive ' ( " h " " o " ) ) .
statement is again false , and is called with and .
The fourth time line 2 is reached , the if statement is again false , and concat2 is called with " h " and ( concat_recursive ' ( " o " ) ) .
statement is again false , and is called with and .
The fifth time is the magical time when the recursion ends .
This is because this time , the if statement on line 2 is now true , and " o " is simply returned .
The recursion unwinds as follows :
Fourth time : " h " and " o " are concatenated and returned .
Third time : " y " and " ho " are concatenated and returned .
Second time : " wd " and " y ho " are concatenated and returned .
First time : " ho " and " wdy ho " are concatenated and returned as the final result .
statement on line 2 is now true , and is simply returned .
The recursion unwinds as follows :
And there you have it — " howdy ho " ultimately gets returned , as shown below :
COMMON -LISP -USER > ( my_new_lisp_project:concat_recursive ' ( " ho " " wd " " y " " h " " o " ) ) " howdy ho "
You have added recursion to your Cusp development arsenal .
Try out the debugger next .
Debugging using Cusp
Think of input conditions that will cause concat_recursive to fail , so that the debugger might come in handy .
One is that you could send a number mixed in with the strings to see what happens .
Remember that the concatenation using concat2 requires two strings , so a number will cause this function to break within the recursion .
Type the following command : ( my_new_lisp_project:concat_recursive ' ( " ho " " wd " " y " 55 " h " " o " ) ) .
Note the number 55 without being enclosed in double quotes is not a string and will cause the debugger to appear , as shown below .
Figure 8 .
Triggering the debugger
Notice the main error triggering the debugger is that concat2 cannot be called on the list : ( 55 " ho " ) .
Also notice that the " h " and " o " were already concatenated before the error got triggered .
In the debugger window , you can also see the ==Backtrace== , shown in Figure 8 .
Each of the lines underneath it ( 0 - 19 , in this case ) give a detailed trace from when you click Send to the occurring fault .
Here , you can also see and follow the recursion leading up to the numeric 55 that triggered the fault .
What now ?
You have three options in the above case to exit the debugger , and to modify and validate your input to the function :
You can abort the command and return to the regular REPL window ; you can close the connection ( via testing , it 's found you 'll need to reboot Eclipse to restart the Lisp processor if you choose this option ) ; or you can simply abort the debugger and return to the regular REPL window .
The best option to exit the debugger is always to abort the command and return to the regular REPL window .
There you have it .
You 've implemented a recursive function in Lisp .
Summary
You completed this Lisp development using the Cusp Eclipse plug - in successfully .
You should now know why Lisp is so powerful .
Through simple recursive statements , you can power process lists of symbols and data easily .
Cusp complements the capabilities of Lisp with the help of the built - in Cusp debugger , a solid GUI with project management capabilities , an interactive Lisp editor , and the command - line interface to the Lisp processor where you can enter commands and test your code .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
The main Sunni Arab political bloc quit the Iraqi cabinet on Wednesday , plunging the government into crisis on a day when suicide bombers killed more than 70 people with massive strikes in the capital .
The Sunni Accordance Front said its five cabinet members and Deputy Prime Minister Salam al - Zobaie would resign from Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s government .
“ This is probably the most serious political crisis we have faced since the passage of the constitution .
If unresolved the implications are grave , ” the remaining deputy prime minister , Barhim Salih , a Kurd , told Reuters .
Maliki spoke to U.S. President George W. Bush by video link and reassured him “ dialogue with our brothers in the Accordance Front will not stop ” despite the boycott , Maliki ’s office said .
White House spokesman Tony Snow said after the call :
“ The president emphasized that the Iraqi people and the American people need to see action , not just words ... on the political front , ” Snow told reporters in Washington .
The Iraqi government said 1,653 civilians were killed in July , a third more than the previous month , despite a fall in the number of deaths among U.S. troops .
Fifty of Wednesday ’s dead were killed when a suicide bomber in a fuel truck packed with explosives targeted motorists at a petrol station , police said .
Another suicide bomber killed 20 people outside a popular ice cream shop across town .
Another bomber killed three in southern Doura district .
The Accordance Front said it was quitting Maliki ’s coalition because he had failed to meet about a dozen demands , including granting the Sunni bloc a greater say in security matters .
Those standing down include the ministers of culture , women , planning , and higher education , and the junior foreign affairs minister .
Their withdrawal may have little practical effect on a government already paralyzed by infighting .
The Shi’ite bloc of radical cleric Moqtada al - Sadr withdrew in April .
But the withdrawal was a blow to reconciliation efforts : luring the large Sunni bloc into government had been hailed as a major achievement when Maliki took power last year .
The United States had hoped the inclusion of Sunni Arabs in the Shi’ite - dominated government would reduce sectarian violence .
But laws aimed at reconciliation have not been passed .
Washington acknowledged the setback .
“ Democracy is hard , ” said U.S. embassy spokesman Phil Reeker .
“ Is it frustrating ?
Yes .
It ’s frustrating for us , it ’s frustrating for them , it ’s frustrating for the Iraqi people . ”

Haidar al - Ibadi , a parliamentarian close to Maliki , told Reuters the Front was trying to persuade the Americans to withdraw support for the prime minister .
“ They are sending a message to Washington that Nuri al - Maliki is no longer accepted , and trying to bring the political process to square one .
They will not be successful . ”
The Sunni Front ’s deputy president , Tareq al - Hashemi , will remain in office for now , as will Sunni Arab Defence Minister Abdel Qader Jassim .
The Front ’s 44 members also remain in the 275 - seat parliament , which is on recess until September .

TALKS PLANNED
Salih , the Kurdish deputy prime minister , told Reuters plans were under way for a summit of Iraq ’s main factions in the next few days , seeking a new , more stable accord .
“ The crisis is grave and its implications should not be underestimated , but I hope it offers an opportunity to address the causes of political instability afflicting this country . ”
Hashemi told reporters the Front was still open to talks and could return to government “ if they introduce reforms ” .
Political setbacks in Iraq could also hurt Bush , who faces a showdown in Congress next month when his Iraq commander reports on progress after sending 30,000 extra troops this year .
The military reported that four more soldiers had been killed on Tuesday , July ’s last day , taking the month ’s toll to 78 , the lowest since last November .
“ The surge has done what we wanted it to do in terms of bringing down the violence , ” said the U.S. embassy ’s Reeker .
“ The hardest part is taking advantage of these security gains to move the political process forward . ”
But deaths among Iraqi civilians , which had fallen by more than a third in June , rose back to the level of previous months .
NASA 's Deep Impact Begins Hunt for Alien Worlds

NASA 's Deep Impact spacecraft is aiming its largest telescope at five stars in a search for alien ( exosolar ) planets as it enters its extended mission , called Epoxi .
Deep Impact made history when the mission team directed an impactor from the spacecraft into comet Tempel 1 on July 4 , 2005 .
NASA recently extended the mission , redirecting the spacecraft for a flyby of comet Hartley 2 on Oct. 11 , 2010 .
As it cruises toward the comet , Deep Impact will observe five nearby stars with " transiting exosolar planets , " so named because the planet transits , or passes in front of , its star .
The Epoxi team , led by University of Maryland astronomer Michael A'Hearn , directed the spacecraft to begin these observations Jan. 22 .
The planets were discovered earlier and are giant planets with massive atmospheres , like Jupiter in our solar system .
They orbit their stars much closer than Earth does the sun , so they are hot and belong to the class of exosolar planets nicknamed " Hot Jupiters .
" However , these giant planets may not be alone .
If there are other worlds around these stars , they might also transit the star and be discovered by the spacecraft .
Deep Impact can even find planets that do n't transit , using a timing technique .
Gravity from the unseen planets will pull on the transiting planets , altering their orbits and the timing of their transits .
"
We 're on the hunt for planets down to the size of Earth , orbiting some of our closest neighboring stars , " said Epoxi Deputy Principal Investigator Drake Deming of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. Epoxi is a combination of the names for the two extended mission components : the exosolar planet observations , called Extrasolar Planet Observations and Characterization ( Epoch ) , and the flyby of comet Hartley 2 , called the Deep Impact Extended Investigation ( Dixi ) .
Goddard leads the Epoch component .
More than 200 exosolar planets have been discovered to date .
Most of these are detected indirectly , by the gravitational pull they exert on their parent star .
Directly observing exosolar planets by detecting the light reflected from them is very difficult , because a star 's brilliance obscures light coming from any planets orbiting it .
However , sometimes the orbit of an exosolar world is aligned so that it eclipses its star as seen from Earth .
In these rare cases , called transits , light from that planet can be seen directly .
" When the planet appears next to its star , your telescope captures their combined light .
When the planet passes behind its star , your telescope only sees light from the star .
By subtracting light from just the star from the combined light , you are left with light from the planet , " said Deming , who is leading the search for exosolar worlds with Deep Impact .
" We can analyze this light to discover what the atmospheres of these planets are like .
" Deep Impact will also look back to observe Earth in visible and infrared wavelengths , allowing comparisons with future discoveries of Earth - like planets around other stars .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , manages Epoxi for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
The University of Maryland is the Principal Investigator institution .
NASA Goddard leads the mission 's exosolar planet observations .
The spacecraft was built for NASA by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. , Boulder , Colo .

ZonkerWilliam recommends a bulletin from the American Institute of Physics , which discusses a study noting that recent spacecraft , such as NEAR , appear to display velocity anomalies much like those seen in Pioneer 10 ( which were observed beginning ten years ago ) .
The anomalies amount to up to 13 mm / sec. , with a measurement accuracy of 0.1 mm/sec .
Quoting :
A multi-national team of biologists has concluded that developmental evolution is deterministic and orderly , rather than random , based on a study of different species of roundworms .
The findings are reported in the latest issue of the journal Current Biology .
The researchers were interested in how development evolves in organs which themselves do not change .
To do so , they examined the vulva — the female 's copulatory and egg - laying organ — in nearly 50 species of roundworms .
Because the vulva does not significantly change across species , one might predict that there would be little variation in vulva development .
However , the researchers found an astonishing amount of developmental variation .
They then reasoned that this variation , since it did not affect the final adult vulva , should have evolved in a stochastic , or random , fashion .
In executing the study , the research team analyzed more than 40 characteristics of vulva development , including cell death , cell division patterns , and related aspects of gonad development .
They plotted the evolution of these traits on a new phylogenetic tree , which illustrates how species are related to one another and provides a map as to how evolutionary changes are occurring .
Their results showed an even greater number of evolutionary changes in vulva development than the researchers had expected .
In addition , they found that evolutionary changes among these species were unidirectional in nearly all instances .
For example , they concluded that the number of cell divisions needed in vulva development declined over time — instead of randomly increasing and decreasing .
In addition , the team noted that the number of rings used to form the vulva consistently declined during the evolutionary process .
These results demonstrate that , even where we might expect evolution to be random , it is not .
The leading author is Karin Kiontke , a post - doctoral fellow in New York University ’s Department of Biology .
The research team included NYU Biology Professor David Fitch as well as researchers from the University of Paris , the Israel Institute of Technology , and the Max - Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Germany .
The study was supported , in part , by a grant from the National Science Foundation .

@ Derrick :
For many people , it 's not an issue of willpower , but of training — many people ( myself included ) simply have trouble finding the line between " hungry " and " not hungry " , so they eat until they 're full .
Thus , one needs to train oneself on what a healthy portion is , and learn to trust their eyes — and , when all else fails , kitchen scales — instead of their gut .
Now , when you first start dieting , then willpower is a biggie .
You 're essentially dropping your food intake by a significant degree , and you are going to feel hungry ( at least until you get used to it ) .
I 'll agree , though , that these glasses are snake oil .
Nice looking , but likely wo n't make a bit of difference in what or how much you eat .
It 's amazing how much useless ( and sometimes dangerous — i.e. diet pills ) crap exists to take advantage of fat people ...
Do n’t remember the recession of 1957 - 58 ?
Most people do n’t .
It was a garden - variety slump  painful to those who lived through it , but short - lived and leaving few lasting scars .
Today it is remembered only by the few experts who crunch the numbers in the study of macroeconomic history .
My parents ’ recession is not my problem , and our next recession will not concern our children when they reach adulthood .
What worry me are the problems that we will bequeath to our children .
Long before I was born , Franklin D. Roosevelt established a compact among the generations .
Families had long cared for their elderly members , but Roosevelt federalized that responsibility in the form of the Social Security system .
Social Security is sometimes viewed as a pension plan , but it is mostly pay - as - you - go .
The working - age population taxes itself to support its parents , in the hope and expectation that its children will do the same .
On the day of my birth in 1958 , the payroll tax to pay for this program , including both the employer and employee shares , was 4.5 percent .
Around the time I started grade school , Lyndon B. Johnson expanded the generational compact to include health care for the elderly .
The Medicare system increased the payroll tax , but only modestly at first .
Health care technology was far more primitive back then and , as a result , less expensive .
By 1968 , when , like my younger son today , I was in third grade , the payroll tax for both programs had risen to 8.8 percent .
Today , the payroll tax for these programs is 15.3 percent , far higher than the programs ’ creators ever imagined .
More worrisome is that this 15.3 percent is nowhere near enough to maintain solvency in the future .
When my generation of baby boomers retires in large numbers and starts claiming benefits , spending on these programs will far outstrip revenue at the current tax rate .

Two problems are working in concert .
The first is demographic .
Because people are having fewer children and living longer than past generations , the number of working - age people supporting each elderly person has fallen and will continue to fall .
( But I am doing my part to fix this : I have three children . )
HPV , which can cause cancer , was found to be the most common STD
The study , by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , found an even higher prevalence of STDs among black girls .
Researchers analysed data from a nationally representative sample of 838 US girls aged 14 to 19 .
A virus that causes cervical cancer - HPV - was the most common , followed by chlamydia , trichomoniasis and herpes .
The CDC says the study is the first in its kind to examine the prevalence of common sexually transmitted diseases among adolescent girls .
It found that nearly half of the African - American girls surveyed had at least one STD , while the rate was 20 % among white and Mexican - American teenagers .
Human papillomavirus , or HPV , affected 18 % of the girls surveyed , chlamydia 4 % , trichomoniasis 2.5 % , and herpes simplex virus 2 % .
Screening recommended
The CDC's Devin Fenton said it was a serious issue because the diseases could lead to infertility and cervical cancer .
" Screening , vaccination and other prevention strategies for sexually active women are among our highest public health priorities , " he said .
The CDC is recommending annual chlamydia screening for all sexually active women under 25 , and HPV vaccines for girls aged 11 to 12 , followed by booster injections .
John Douglas , the CDC 's head of STD prevention , says screenings are underused because teenagers often do not think they are at risk .
Analysts say some doctors are also reluctant to discuss screening with teenage patients because of confidentiality concerns , knowing parents would have to be told of the results .
Widening the scope of what is already a massive scandal involving hundreds of wealthy German tax cheats sheltering millions in discreet bank accounts in Liechtenstein , the German government said on Monday , Feb. 25 , it would provide information to foreign countries whose nationals are involved in the tax evasion affair .
" We are going to respond to requests in this regard , " German finance ministry spokesman , Thorsten Albig told reporters , adding that Germany would not charge foreign governments for the information .
Scandinavians , Britons involved in tax affair ?
Germany 's intelligence service is reported to have paid 4.2 million euros ( $ 6.22 million ) to an informant , a former employee of Liechtenstein banking group LGT , for an incriminating list containing the names of hundreds of people who evaded taxes by parking their money in secret bank accounts in the tiny Alpine principality of Liechtenstein .
Albig said Berlin bought the information because investigators believed that " it could lead to the return of hundreds of thousands of dollars . "
It 's not just Liechtenstein 's scenic beauty that attracts the rich and famous
The list is believed to contain the names of more than 700 wealthy Germans as well as well - heeled tax cheats from other nations .
The disclosure has prompted a massive investigation in Germany and frayed ties between Berlin and Liechtenstein capital , Vaduz .
Germany 's Handelsblatt business daily reported that Finland , Sweden and Norway had signaled interest in getting their hands on the list of bank clients .
Joining the German crackdown on tax evaders , the British government 's tax agency said on Monday it too had paid for information on secret Liechtenstein bank accounts held by British citizens .
Media reports said Britain paid a whistleblower 100,000 pounds ( 132,931 euros , $ 196,000 ) for details of Liechtenstein accounts held by 100 wealthy Britons .
Unpaid taxes in the affair could amount to as much as 100 million pounds , reports said .
The Financial Times reported that Britain had refused two years ago to pay the whistleblower but changed its mind after Germany shelled out money to get similar information .
The tax scandal also made waves across the Atlantic as a senior US lawmaker said last
week he would launch an investigation into American citizens also believed to have hid assets at LGT .
High - profile victim
The investigation into the tax evasion scandal , considered one of the biggest in German history , began earlier this month with raids on the home and offices of Klaus Zumwinkel , the high - profile boss of Deutsche Post , Europe 's largest postal service , who is suspected of having dodged taxes to the tune of 1 million euros .
Zumwinkel has since resigned his post .
Zumwinkel 's fall from grace was rapid
Ever since , German authorities have been conducting raids across the country on private individuals for allegedly hiding money in accounts Liechtenstein 's biggest private bank , the LGT Group , which specializes in setting up foundations and is owned by Liechtenstein 's royal family .
The affair has angered ordinary Germans and sparked a heated debate about the ethics and accountability of the country 's highly - paid business elite .
Anger over " stolen information "
Equally , the German government 's payment for the incriminating information , which was allegedly stolen from the Liechtenstein bank by the former LGT employee , has come under intense scrutiny .
On Monday , the LGT Bank voiced anger at how the " stolen information " was being shared around European capitals .
" Apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" LGT regards such methods as being extremely offensive . "
The affair has also raised questions about banking secrecy laws enjoyed by some European nations .
Liechtenstein is one of only three countries on the OECD 's tax - haven black - list , alongside Andorra and Monaco .
Germany has vowed to broaden efforts to crack down on tax evasion to countries such as Switzerland , Luxembourg and Austria as well .
Switzerland and Luxembourg have distanced themselves from the charges .
Both of the countries prohibit revealing bank information to the outside world except in criminal matters .
The GelSpray Liquid Bandage is a major advance in the management and care of combat casualty and civilian wounds .
Much like epoxy is dispensed in household kits , the dressing is applied with a dual syringe that releases two polymer ingredients .
These polymers react rapidly upon mixing to form a gel - based dressing that frontline combat soldiers can apply to their own wounds .
The dressing conforms to the wound geometry , adheres to intact skin but not directly to the injured tissue , and resists abrasion .n.
The Center for Military Biomaterials Research ( CeMBR ) , part of the New Jersey Center for Biomaterials at Rutgers University , has enabled the development of a breakthrough spray - on dressing for injuries .
The trademarked GelSpray Liquid Bandage by BioCure Inc. , a medical device company in Norcross , Ga. , received clearance for marketing from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) Feb .
1 .
While created for the military , the GelSpray technology has potential uses in civilian health care .
Future versions of the liquid bandage may be suitable for use by civilian rescue teams to treat traumatic wounds and burns , as well as in the treatment of diabetic ulcers , ostomies and post - op wounds .
Future products based on the GelSpray technology platform will include active ingredients to treat infection and pain , and control severe bleeding .
Rutgers ’ Center for Military Biomaterials Research was created to link academia , industry and the military to fulfill urgent military medical care needs .
Its mission is to familiarize the biomedical research community with the unique needs of combat casualty care and to foster the development of innovative medical technologies to treat injured soldiers .
The center is supported with funding from the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command ( USAMRMC ) and its Telemedicine and Advanced Technologies Research Center at Fort Detrick , Md .
“ In this case , it was the mission of our center to collaborate with industry to conduct research that resulted in a new product , ” said Joachim Kohn , the principal investigator at CeMBR and Board of Governors Professor of Chemistry at Rutgers .
In the collaboration with BioCure , the Rutgers center supported the research part of the product development effort with funding from the USAMRMC .
Kohn explained that the close collaboration among BioCure , the U.S. Army and Rutgers moved the project rapidly from concept to FDA market clearance .
“ The process took about three and a half years – a truly remarkable achievement , ” Kohn added .
The GelSpray Liquid Bandage was designed in consultation with the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research , part of the USAMRMC , while the Rutgers center provided technical guidance based on knowledge of military product specification requirements , regulatory issues and polymer chemistry ..

Based on the statistical chances of George W. Bush defeating not one but TWO taller candidates , we can only conclude once and for all that he stole both elections .
“ There are a lot of guys out here doing stuff they should n’t have been doing , ” Mr. Guest said .
Still , some civil rights advocates complain that the definition of a gang member is vague .
Gang researchers find that most active members usually cycle out of their gangs within about a year .
Even active participants might only be marginal members , drifting in and out of gangs , said Kevin Pranis , a co-author of “ Gang Wars , ” a recent report on antigang tactics written by the Justice Police Institute , a nonprofit research group .

Harsh penalties could actually reinforce gang membership by locking peripheral gangsters in jail with more hardened criminals , he said .
Suburban Salisbury , population 30,000 , is about as far from the traditional ganglands of Los Angeles , Chicago or even Durham as you can get .
But it has had an outsize voice in pushing for tougher antigang measures since a 13 - year - old black girl was inadvertently killed there in a gang shootout after a dance party in March .
I arrived in Salisbury at midnight , figuring that gang members would be more visible after dark , and found a local hangout with the help of a cabdriver .
Striking up a conversation with young gang members in the middle of the night in an unfamiliar town is always a tricky proposition , but the one advantage I figured I had was that I am African - American .
Brown skin can be a kind of camouflage in my profession , especially if you do a lot of reporting in minority neighborhoods , as I do .
Blending in visually sometimes helps me observe without being observed .
But even when my appearance has been helpful , the benefits rarely survive the first words out of my mouth , which usually signal — by accent or content — that I ’m not from around wherever I am .
“ What ’s The New York Times doing down here ? ” asked an incredulous black man .
He and about a dozen other men were standing in front of a clapboard house in Salisbury .
I observed several drug sales there within minutes of arriving .

Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with al - Qaeda , the Pentagon finally admits , a fact understood by many well before the United States invaded Iraq , an invasion at least in part predicated on that neocon spawned lie .
It comes five years and a million plus lives too late : “ An exhaustive review of more than 600,000 Iraqi documents captured after the 2003 United States invasion of Iraq has found no evidence Saddam Hussein ’s regime had any operational links with al Qaeda ’s terrorist network , ” reports McClatchy Newspapers .
At the time , some of us declared this fallacy to be nothing less than a bad joke , but we were drummed out by a massive tidal wave of absurd noise unleashed by the corporate media , taking its marching orders from the neocons .
In addition to the fairy tale about al - Qaeda , we endured another debunked fallacy — that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction .
Recall Bush ’s hare - brained speech in Cincinnati in October , 2002 , when he ominously warned “ America must not ignore the threat gathering against us .
Facing clear evidence of peril , we cannot wait for the final proof — the smoking gun — that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud , ” another gossamer lie cooked up by his coterie of neocon advisers , more appropriately described as his puppet masters .
“ President Bush and his aides used Saddam ’s alleged relationship with al Qaida , along with Iraq ’s supposed weapons of mass destruction , as arguments for invading Iraq after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , ” McClatchy continues .
Then - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld claimed in September 2002 that the United States had “ bulletproof ” evidence of cooperation between the radical Islamist terror group and Saddam ’s secular dictatorship .
Then - Secretary of State Colin Powell cited multiple linkages between Saddam and al Qaida in a watershed February 2003 speech to the United Nations Security Council to build international support for the invasion .
Almost every one of the examples Powell cited turned out to be based on bogus or misinterpreted intelligence .
As recently as last July , Bush tried to tie al Qaida to the ongoing violence in Iraq .
“ The same people that attacked us on September the 11th is a crowd that is now bombing people , killing innocent men , women and children , many of whom are Muslims , ” he said .
" Then - Secretary of State Colin Powell cited multiple linkages between Saddam and al Qaida in a watershed February 2003 speech to the United Nations Security Council to build international support for the invasion .
Almost every one of the examples Powell cited turned out to be based on bogus or misinterpreted intelligence . "
Or put another way , Powell was repeating neocon lies .
Powell and the neocons did not cite “ bogus or misinterpreted intelligence , ” they were in fact telling big fat whopper lies .
As Joseph Goebbels knew , the “ stupid thick - headedness ” of the people , easily frightened into submission by the specter of fantastical demons , made Hitler ’s Big Lie possible .
Hitler wrote in his autobiography , Mein Kampf , that the Big Lie is so “ colossal ” that no one would believe that someone “ could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously . ”
Indeed , the truth was distorted with infamy , not only in the lead - up to the invasion and mass murder spree in Iraq but in regard to the events surrounding September 11 , 2001 , as well .
In effect , the Pentagon ’s admission that the neocons had lied — it is euphemistically called “ bogus or misinterpreted intelligence ” by the conniving corporate media — is a slap in the face , not that most Americans , somnolent at best , feel the sting as the back hand retracts .
No longer do they care what the government does in their name , as their name is obviously mud .
As well , the people , suckers by the millions , are unable to grasp the well documented fact that government is a serial killer — not simply killing Iraqis or in the not too distant past Vietnamese , but their own people , who are basically on the same level as countless — and uncounted — victims in far away places most Americans cannot find on a map .
It is not a stretch to conclude that a large degree of the popular belief about our so - called enemies is little more than an implausible myth of gigantic proportion .
For instance , numerous scholars and researchers have demonstrated that al - Qaeda was created by the CIA — but most people either do not know this or refuse to believe it , preferring instead to buy the ludicrous fantasy that Osama bin Laden and his supposed gaggle of dour cave dwelling Muslim terrorists not only came into existence all on their own without the assistance of government and intelligence agencies , but also managed to have NORAD stand down and were able to perform impossible aeronautic feats with humongous airliners .
Now that the Pentagon has fessed up to the fact Saddam and Osama did not collaborate — and remember , the neocons told us these two characters plotted to attack America , and that ’s why the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq — maybe the CIA can fess up to its lies and misdeeds .
A motley assemblage of religious fanatics were used by Zbigniew Brzezinski , acting as Jimmy Carter ’s national security advisor , and his successors to attack the Soviet presence in Afghanistan .
For those a bit sketchy on history , allow me to repeat a few key points at the risk of redundancy — both what would later become known as al - Qaeda and the Taliban emerged from the Mujihadeen in Afghanistan , a motley assemblage of religious fanatics used by Zbigniew Brzezinski , acting as Jimmy Carter ’s national security advisor , and his successors to attack the Soviet presence in that remote corner of the world .
Brzezinski and the CIA teamed up with the brutal Pakistan military dictator General Zia ul - Haq to spread Wahabi fundamentalism far and wide in Central Asia and the Middle East .
In fact , the United States preferred demented religious fanatics over the less mentally unstable .
Norm Dixon writes :
Washington ’s favored mujaheddin faction was one of the most extreme , led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar .
The West ’s distaste for terrorism did not apply to this unsavory “ freedom fighter ” .
Hekmatyar was notorious in the 1970s for throwing acid in the faces of women who refused to wear the veil .
After the mujaheddin took Kabul in 1992 , Hekmatyar ’s forces rained US - supplied missiles and rockets on that city — killing at least 2000 civilians — until the new government agreed to give him the post of prime minister .
Osama bin Laden was a close associate of Hekmatyar and his faction .
As Dixon notes , between 1978 and 1992 , the United States spent at least US $ 6 billion — some estimates range as high as $ 20 billion – for arms , training and funds to keep the murderous mujaheddin factions going like a rabid Energizer bunny .
During the mid-1980s , according to journalist Ahmed Rashid , the CIA “ committed … support to a long - standing ISI proposal to recruit from around the world to join the Afghan jihad .
At least 100,000 Islamic militants flocked to Pakistan between 1982 and 1992 ( some 60,000 attended fundamentalist schools in Pakistan without necessarily taking part in the fighting ) . ”
Some of the more promising candidates were sent to the CIA ’s spy training camp in Virginia , where they were taught “ sabotage skills ” of the sort that would come in handy during the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania .
After these events , the word “ al - Qaeda ” would appear increasingly in the corporate media .
“ Al Qaeda ( the Base ) , bin Laden ’s organization , was established in 1987 - 88 to run the camps and other business enterprises .
It is a tightly - run capitalist holding company — albeit one that integrates the operations of a mercenary force and related logistical services with ‘ legitimate ’ business operations , ” writes Dixon , who seems to think Osama bin Laden , as a CIA - ISI operative , went off the reservation after the Soviets were evicted from Afghanistan .
Of course , such defections — especially by key personnel involved in multi-billion dollar operations — are the improbable exception and not the rule .
The drug and gun-running KLA teamed up with al - Qaeda in the Balkans .
So useful was al - Qaeda , they were employed elsewhere , most notably in the Balkans .
“ In a cruel irony , while the Islamic jihad — featured by the Bush Administration as ‘ a threat to America ’ — is blamed for the terrorist assaults on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , these same Islamic organizations constitute a key instrument of US military - intelligence operations in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union , ” Michel Chossudovsky wrote on September 12 , 2001 .
As it turns out , Osama bin Laden ’s CIA sponsored operation , Maktab al - Khidamat , was instrumental in running Jihadists into Bosnia out of its Brooklyn , New York branch , known as the Al - Kifah Refugee Center , a fact reported by the Associated Press .
Indeed , al - Qaeda served as “ a key instrument of US military - intelligence operations ” in the United States as well , although such a band of fanatics and demonstrable mental cases would be unable to pull of an operation of the sort that occurred on September 11 , 2001 .
“ Planning the attacks was a master deed , in technical and organizational terms , ” notes Andreas von Bülow , the former state - secretary in the German Federal Ministry of Defense .
“ To hijack four big airliners within a few minutes and fly them into targets within a single hour and doing so on complicated flight routes !
That is unthinkable , without backing from the secret apparatuses of state and industry . ”
For more detail on how the CIA and Pentagon ran the operations of September 11 , see the video included here , The Underlying Politics of 9/11 .
As should be expected , there is more – much more – to the story and it would take several thick books to spell it all out in detail .
Now that the Pentagon report on the Big Lie concerning the once purported Osama - Saddam link is in the process of undergoing a “ painful ” declassification review , it is time for the same to happen in regard to the events surrounding September 11 , 2001 .
Let ’s begin with a new investigation — this time conducted by people not associated with the Bush crime family .
Of course , this will not happen , not without a fundamental change in the government , in fact a radical change within the government .
Dare I say practically the entire government would need to be replaced for this to happen ?
It is an unlikely prospect , especially considering a large number of people believe a man such as Barack Obama represents change .
Incidentally or not , Obama has enlisted the help of the above mentioned Zbigniew Brzezinski , the man who dreamed up al - Qaeda .
In the meantime , I ’m going to wish for a pony .

Problem drinkers who took a craving - curbing drug whenever they felt the desire to imbibe reported fewer heavy drinking days each month than drinkers who took a look - alike placebo pill , but both groups reported marked reductions in heavy drinking days .
These findings come from a study of 403 heavy drinkers in Finland , who took either a placebo or the drug nalmefene on an “ as needed basis . ”
“ It has a robust and sustained effect in reducing harmful heavy drinking in a large study population , ” said researcher Sakari Karhuvaara .
“ Alcohol problems have huge negative impacts on the well - being of individuals and families and cause enormous costs to society due to lost working days , accidents , treatment of alcohol - related disease , etcetera . ”
Before the study , patients assigned to nalmefene treatment reported 15.5 average heavy drinking days each month .
They were directed to take the drug whenever they felt a looming urge to drink .
During the first three months of treatment , the average number of heavy drinking days was 8.6 to 9.3 for the people in the nalmefene group .
The drinkers assigned to the placebo group had somewhat less dramatic reductions .
They averaged 16.2 heavy drinking days a month before the study and 10.6 to 12.0 during the trial .
Researchers double - checked participant - reported alcohol consumption changes with tests that measured alcohol - use biomarkers in the blood .

In the United States , abstinence has been the traditional goal of the treatment of alcohol dependence , but in the last 20 years , there has been a movement to consider harm reduction or drinking reduction as a goal equal to abstinence .
“ Alcohol dependence is nowadays recognized as a chronic , recurring disorder where relapses almost inevitably occur during and after the treatment , ” Karhuvaara said .
So focusing on harm reduction in the short term is often much more feasible than complete abstinence , he added .
Karhuvaara is a physician and health researcher who was once an employee of Biotie Therapies Corp. , the manufacturer of nalmefene .
The drug maker supported the new study .
“ There are fair amounts of good data ( showing ) that the more drinks you have a day , the more likely you are to have health or social consequences , ” said alcohol researcher Raymond Anton .
“ The thinking is that if you can reduce heavy drinking days or the number of drinks per drinking day , you might actually alleviate some suffering , even though you do n’t cause the person to be abstinent . ”
Not everyone who seeks alcohol treatment is ready to consider a lifetime without alcohol , so an abstinence goal can be a barrier for some people considering help .
Many health professionals are convinced that a harm reduction approach can draw more people into treatment , said Anton , director of the Center for Drug and Alcohol Programs at the Medical University of South Carolina .
Anton did not participate in the Finnish study , but he has conducted nalmefene research in the United States .

The Finnish researchers note some side effects among people in the nalmefene group , including nausea , abdominal discomfort , as well as energy and sleep difficulties .
However , most study participants remained in the trial and continued using the drug .
“ I wish they ’d done an analysis to see if the people who suffered those side effects were the same people who drank less .
Perhaps some of the reduction in drinking may have been because they did n’t feel so good , rather than because the drug just took away an urge to drink , ” Anton said .
Patients must take most medications for alcohol treatment daily .
Nalmefene — taken “ as needed ” — fits into the harm reduction treatment approach .
The drug is an opioid antagonist that works to block the effects of endorphins .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved nalmefene for use in alcohol treatment ; the drug is primarily available in investigational studies .
Karhuvaara said his study also suggests that “ practically any doctor ” could successfully administer nalmefene in a wide variety of medical settings .
“ It is an attempt to get the drug out of the sole use of addiction specialists and into the hands of primary providers , ” Anton said .

The strike would be the second work stoppage on Broadway in less than five years ; the musicians ’ strike in 2003 , which lasted for four days , was the first time since 1975 that Broadway was shut down by a labor dispute .
Many in the industry saw this confrontation coming .
In past negotiations , the league , which is made up of both producers and the theater owners to whom they pay rent , has been weakened by its natural divisions .
But the league has determined that this would be the year they made major changes to rules they find frustrating , and early in the talks , it seemed ready to lock the stagehands out to force the issue .
The talks , which have been going on since before the union ’s contract expired in July , broke down over the issue of work rules .
The stagehands contract has strict rules governing how many stage hands must be called to work , what kind of tasks they can perform and how long the work - calls last .
Union officials have said the rules are in place for safety and to keep stagehands from being exploited by their employers .
League members , which say the rules inevitably lead to long periods of time when stagehands are on the clock with nothing to do , have been pushing for more flexibility in deciding when and how many stagehands are needed and have offered a package of raises in return for more control .
James J. Claffey , the president of the union , has said that the stagehands would be willing to make changes to the rules in return for benefits of equal value .
But there is no way to tell how much work the stagehands would actually have under the rules the producers are proposing , Mr. Claffey said , and so it ’s difficult to gauge the value of what the league has been offering in return .
Asked for her measure of success in Tuesday ’s four primaries , Clinton was both blunt and vague .
Clinton : ' I 'm just getting warmed up '
BEAUMONT , Texas —
A pugnacious Hillary Clinton refused to handicap tomorrow ’s critical primary elections , unbowed by suggestions that she abandon the presidential race if she does n’t win in delegate - rich Ohio and Texas .
Asked for her measure of success in Tuesday ’s four primaries , Clinton was both blunt and vague .
Advertisement
“ Winning .
Winning .
That ’s my measurement of success , ” she said during a press conference in Toledo , Ohio , before flying to Texas .
Clinton declined to explain whether that means winning the popular vote in all — or even in just one — of the four states in contention : Texas , Ohio , Rhode Island and Vermont .
Nor did she say whether it meant winning enough delegates to justify a continued bid .
Asked specifically what she would do in the event that she won narrowly in Ohio but remained behind in the delegate count , Clinton also would n’t say .
“ I am not a political pundit .
I will leave that to all of you , ” she said .
“ I think I know what ’s happening , and I believe we are going to do well tomorrow , and I believe that ’s going to be a very significant message to the country .
And then we move on to Pennsylvania and the states beyond .
So , I ’m just getting warmed up . ”
She started her day before dawn at a Chrysler Jeep plant in Toledo , shaking workers ’ hands and asking for their votes at the factory turnstile .
She followed that with a series of satellite interviews , mostly with Texas reporters , in which she repeated the themes that have dominated her rallies over the past week : that she ’ll work for universal health care ; make the best commander in chief ; and that voters should view the presidential election as a hiring decision on who can best lead the country .
She also sharpened her attack on the Obama campaign for the apparent contradiction between Obama ’s speeches criticizing NAFTA and news reports that one of his advisers met privately with Canadian government officials and expressed a position at odds with the candidate ’s tougher stance — a discrepancy that she said spoke to her rival ’s credibility .
“ Apparently , what seems to have occurred is that the Obama campaign had Sen. Obama in Ohio making speeches against NAFTA and having his chief economic adviser making it clear in Canada that he does n’t really mean it .
I think that raises real questions of credibility , ” she said .
“ You know where I stand .
I ’ve said that NAFTA has problems .
I ’ve said exactly what we ’ll do to fix it . ”
After speaking to supporters at the University of Toledo , Clinton flew to this oil refinery city about an hour north of Houston , meeting with a modest crowd of mostly middle - aged and older supporters in an airport hangar .
She emphasized , along with a litany of bread - and - butter themes , the need for supporters not only to vote in the primary but to attend party caucuses in what has been called the “ Texas two - step ” contest .
“ I know there are a lot of hard - working people here in Beaumont … and I know how important it is to have a president who understands it ’s time to put the American people first again , ” she said to loud applause .
She also delivered a line that was as popular here as it was with Ohio crowds : “ The world will breathe a sigh of relief when President Bush leaves office . ”
The mood on her campaign seemed more upbeat , and in addition to what Clinton aides are calling “ NAFTA - gate , ” it ’s easy to trace the source .
It dates back to Thursday ’s announcement that the campaign had raised $ 35 million in February , a remarkable sum for a presidential candidate who may not be in the race past tomorrow .
Even as the campaign faces a dire , must - win scenario , there is optimism among Clinton backers , perhaps even a slight spring in their steps , and much of it comes from the $ 35 million figure .
“ I think Sen. Clinton has been raising funds simply because a lot of people are finally realizing that she is definitely discussing matters in a way that we the people need , ” said volunteer Lole J. Charles , 63 , a former adult educator who now works as a bookkeeper and Spanish / English translator out of her San Antonio home .
It ’s an odd piece of inspiration , hardly the kind of thing that stirs voters ’ souls .
And not long after the February haul was announced , the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama countered that he had raised even more .
Still , after 11 straight losses , at least it 's something for staffers , supporters and volunteers to hang their hopes on .
It was n’t just the dollar amount that had the campaign crowing .
It was also the inspirational e-mail testimonials that accompanied donations .
The campaign released e-mails from nine supporters who sent , along with their donations , messages such as this one , from “ Al ” of Apollo , Pa. : “ Just made my $ 10.44 cont. to Hillary
My fifth of this wonderful effort to elect Hillary as our first Woman President .
Join me in this vital mission to save our Great Country .
I am 90 and on SS but this is a mission that has become a great part of my life . ”
Part of the election eve optimism is rooted in the theory that working - class Hispanic voters are n’t necessarily reflected in polls , said Texas state Sen.
Carlos Uresti .
And , he said , those voters are loyal to Clinton .
Uresti said these blue - collar supporters usually are n’t home when pollsters call .
“ My constituents are working a job , two and a half jobs … ” he said .
“ I do n’t think they ’re getting incorporated into the polling data . ”
Rallies , too , can be deceptive , he said , referring to Obama ’s gatherings , which have typically been much larger than those of Clinton .
Obama draws much of his support from college students and young people , Uresti said , while “ we ’re relying on a lot of our veterans , our senior citizens , [ and ] they ’re not as mobile , they ca n’t get to the rallies as much as some 19 - or 20 - year - old voter . ”
Yet as much as anything else , Uresti and other local officials working on Clinton ’s behalf said it was the fundraising figures that had suddenly raised hopes and expectations .
“ It gives us that extra boost that we need to boost the morale of the volunteers and campaign in general , ” said Uresti .
“ And it shows that we have the momentum .
I truly believe the momentum is shifting in Texas . ”
Like Uresti , State Rep. Jose Menendez , whose district is two - thirds Hispanic , also believes the Clinton campaign is newly energized .
“ I think Texas is a place where people do n’t like being told what to do .
We ’re independent , and a lot of us resent the fact that , whether it be the pundits or the media or other states trying to tell us , ‘ Here ’s the inevitable .
Just jump on board . ’” he said , referring to Obama ’s candidacy .
“ Well , I ’m sorry , we have a choice .
We have a choice .
And it did n’t stop me from writing a check [ to Clinton ] and maxing out . ”

If you have not noticed , many Tech How - To 's tell you that Windows low disk space warning pop-ups are annoying and the best solution is to disable the notification .
For the most part I agree , it is annoying , but I do n't agree with just disabling the notification warning .
Why ?
Because there is good reason to the low disk warnings triggering the notification that could potentialy lead to loss of data or cause Windows to shutdown an important component .
The obvious reason for the warning is becuase you are low on disk space .
But the Windows monitoring component that 's causing the notifications is the SRService , known as System Restore Service .
Not just an annoying notification Microsoft want to irritate people with .
As sometimes controversial as System Restore service can be , it is a usefull tool that can be used to restore your computer to a previous state due to harmfull changes such as a virus , spyware , or if the installation of software causes more trouble than it 's worth .
Additionally , the operation of Windows can be effected , such as expanding the page file if there is not enough space available .
From the above screen shot , no matter how many logical drives or partitions you have , when disk space dips below 200 MB of free space on the drive , Windows suspends System Restore not just on the drive that is low on disk space , but on all drives .
Including the System drive .
If you do not free up disk space on the drive , the next set of warnings occur at 80 MB and 50 MB thresholds with frequency of notification messages increasing each time .
In order to compensate , Windows now needs to free up disk space by deleting previous restore points based on a calculation .
If you continue to use up the remaing space , no current restore points are created .
With out restore points available , you will not be able to restore back in time if needed .
Once free disk space reaches 200 MB , Windows enables System Restore service and stops sending the notifications ( any previous restore points that Windows deleted are permanently lost ) .
With low disk warning notifications disabled , you will never see the balloon pop-ups , unless you check the System event log , which many home Window users do n't do or know how to view the event log .
NOTE : To view Windows Event Logs , click on Start \ Run and in the run box type eventvrw and click OK .
An Alternative Method
If you insist on disabling the low disk warnings , you need to provide an allternative solution for having Windows alert you when disk drives are low on space .
I have not found a decent freeware solution yet ( if you know of one , let me know ! )
There are many software products available for a price , two of which are pretty good .
Space Patrol ( JD Designs – $ 14.24 ) runs on all versions of Windows ( including Vista ) and allows you to set low disk space thresholds to any value you want .
Installation is simple and configuration is easy .
During the trial period settings are lost once you loggoff or shutdown Windows and will need to be reset at each logon .
Once you purchase a license , settings are retained .
Notifications of low disk space appear as a balloon pop-up , alerting you of which drive and the amount of free space available .
Space Patrol starts monitoring when you logon to Windows .
Abaiko Disk Space Monitor ( Abaiko Software – 14.95 for Personal License ) runs on Windows 2000 , XP , 2003 or Vista. 30 day trial is available .
Installation and configuration is simple .
Disk Space Monitor gives your more control with settings by allowing you to select low disk space thresholds in Bytes ( KB , MB , GB ) or as percent .
Additionaly you can modify the frequency for checking disk space and warning notifications .
Notifications of low disk space appear as a balloon pop-up , alerting you of which drive and the amount of free space available .

Scientists are monitoring the orbit of asteroid 2007 TU24 .
The asteroid , believed to be between 150 meters ( 500 feet ) and 610 meters ( 2,000 feet ) in size , is expected to fly past Earth on Jan. 29 , with its closest distance being about 537,500 kilometers ( 334,000 miles ) at 12:33 a.m. Pacific time ( 3:33 a.m. Eastern time ) .
It should be observable that night by amateur astronomers with modest - sized telescopes .
Asteroid 2007 TU24 was discovered by the NASA - sponsored Catalina Sky Survey on Oct. 11 , 2007 .
Scientists at NASA 's Near - Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , have determined that there is no possibility of an impact with Earth in the foreseeable future .
" This will be the closest approach by a known asteroid of this size or larger until 2027 , " said Don Yeomans , manager of the Near Earth Object Program Office at JPL .
" As its closest approach is about one - and - a - half times the distance of Earth to the moon , there is no reason for concern .
On the contrary , Mother Nature is providing us an excellent opportunity to perform scientific observations . "
Asteroid 2007 TU24 will reach an approximate apparent magnitude 10.3 on Jan. 29 - 30 before quickly becoming fainter as it moves farther from Earth .
On that night , the asteroid will be observable in dark and clear skies through amateur telescopes with apertures of at least 7.6 centimeters ( 3 inches ) .
An object with a magnitude of 10.3 is about 50 times fainter than an object just visible to the naked eye in a clear , dark sky .
NASA detects and tracks asteroids and comets passing close to Earth .
The Near Earth Object Observation Program , commonly called " Spaceguard , " discovers , characterizes and computes trajectories for these objects to determine if any could be potentially hazardous to our planet .

Marshall Adame is a Democrat running for Congress in North Carolina ’s 3rd District , a jurisdiction along the Tar Heel state ’s low - lying eastern coast that is home to the U.S. Marine Corps ’ Camp Lejeune , Air Station Cherry Point , and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base , as well as Blackwater Worldwide ’s 7,000 - acre corporate headquarters and training facility .
Adame is an underdog in the congressional race , where he will likely face seven - term Republican incumbent Walter B. Jones — who brought the term “ freedom fries ” to Congress — in the general election .
Jones has since become an opponent of the Iraq war , atoning for his vote to authorize the war by writing letters of condolence to the families of dead soldiers — a “ mea culpa to my Lord , ” he says .
But the incumbent and his Republican party are not the only obstacles Adame will have to overcome if he hopes to take over the 3rd District ’s congressional seat .
He also faces tough opposition from Blackwater .
Despite running as a Democrat in a strongly Republican district , Adame has the sort of military past that is appreciated in these parts .
“ I am a retired United States Marine , ” he tells me .
“ I ’m a Vietnam veteran .
I spent nine months in Kuwait right after we kicked Saddam out , helping to rebuild the Kuwaiti air force .
I spent four years in Egypt with Kaman Aerospace ” — a military contractor — ” as their logistics leader in that country . ”
More recently , he spent three years in Iraq working on reconstruction projects , ultimately rising to a senior position with the State Department ’s National Coordination Team in Baghdad , where he oversaw the work of roughly ten Provincial Reconstruction Teams .
Two of his sons have served in the U.S. Army in Iraq — one was seriously wounded in an IED attack and is still undergoing reconstructive surgeries ; the other is currently on his second 15 - month tour , stationed in Tikrit .
Now back in North Carolina , Adame has even opened his home to a family of Iraqi refugees .
Yet Adame ’s recent public criticism of the private security industry ’s role in Iraq has caused him to become the target of a political attack from Blackwater .
It all began in mid-January when Adame participated in a live question - and - answer forum on a North Carolina progressive blog called BlueNC .
“ People were writing in , and I was answering the questions , ” he says .
“ It just so happened that the first one was about Blackwater . ”
He did n’t mince words .
“ There is no place in the American force structure , or in American culture for mercenaries , ” he wrote on the blog .
“ They are guns for hire ;
No more , no less …
Private Armies represent the very things we despise as a people .
Servants to the highest bidder with true allegiance to no -one . ”
Numerous Democratic candidates , including presidential contenders Barack Obama and North Carolina ’s own John Edwards , have assailed Blackwater , an easy target this election cycle .
But Adame claims to speak from personal experience .
As a State Department official in Iraq , he was protected by Blackwater , which , he says , used excessive force on at least two occasions while he was in their care .
“ I saw them shoot people , ” he says .
“ I saw them crash into cars while I was their passenger … .
There was absolutely no reason , no provocation whatsoever . ”
Once , while en route to the Iraqi Ministry of Interior , Adame says he heard gunfire coming from the turret gunner in his own vehicle .
He looked out the window of the humvee and “ saw people ducking and falling … .
The vehicle in front of us rammed into a car that was trying to get out of the way , and they just spun that guy around .
He was out cold in that car , maybe even dead .
I do n’t know , but we just kept on going . ”
Adame ’s comments about the company have enraged Blackwater employees , including executive vice president Bill Mathews .
In an internal corporate email , Mathews encouraged his colleagues to barrage Adame with mail ( “ he was too cowardly to put a phone number on the web , ” Mathews noted in the message ) .
“ [ H]e wants this company and all of us to cease to exist , ” Mathews wrote in the email , which was obtained by the Raleigh News & Observer and posted to the newspaper ’s web site .
“ Do you like your jobs ?
Are you sick and tired of the slanderous bullshit going on in DC ?
If so , would you all mind joining me in reminding Mr. Adame that he is running for office in our backyard … .
Let ’s run this goof out of Dodge… ! ”
Since then , Adame has been on the receiving end of “ some pretty rough stuff , ” he says .
“ I received all kinds of hate mail from Blackwater people .
They use a lot of vulgarity .
They tell me how Blackwater is defending America ’s rights , and that we ’re free because Blackwater is fighting for us .
Give me a break !
That is so erroneous and misleading .
It ’s just totally dishonest , but those people really believe it .
Blackwater is a large organization , and they have a great way of propagandizing their product . ”
For its part , Blackwater is unrepentant for the harsh words Adame has received from its employees .
“ Mr. Mathews regrets that he wrote an inappropriate email in haste , ” says Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell in a statement .
“ He does not regret for one moment his desire to defend the brave people who risk their lives every day working for Blackwater . ”
Tyrrell says Adame “ used inaccuracies to unfairly criticize the company ” and notes that “ one thing that should be taken away from Mr. Matthew ’s email is that our people are incredibly proud of and passionate about the work we do in support of the U.S. government . ”
Adame , who plans to hold a campaign event near Blackwater ’s Moyock headquarters next month , is quick to point out that he has received no threats of physical harm from Blackwater , and despite some obscene emails , has engaged in constructive conversations with some of its employees .
“ These people do n’t want to lose their jobs , and I understand that , ” he says .
Indeed , looming larger than the issue of military contracting in his district is concern over domestic priorities like health care and jobs .
Still , Adame ’s recent confrontation with Blackwater seems to have focused his attention on the company .
“ I feel very strongly about how extensively organized Blackwater has become , ” he explains .
“ And I will do everything I can as a congressman to look into that , to find out whether or not the things they ’re doing are even legal . ”
It ’s an open question what this particular campaign promise might do to Adame ’s chances .

But for certain Hello Kitty fans , the return of one Kitty product in particular has Internet sites buzzing : the shoulder massager .
Back in 1997 , Sanrio , the Japanese creators of the feline character known as Hello Kitty , introduced the Hello Kitty shoulder massager through a licensee .
Unknown to Sanrio , the product soon made its way into adult stores as a sex toy .
It “ sold like crazy , ” said Pamela Doan , public relations manager for Babeland , a chain of adult shops in New York , Seattle and Los Angeles .
Mary Ketterborn , an assistant manager at Babeland SoHo , added that “ people still ask about it . ”
The vice president for marketing for Sanrio ’s American division , Andrea Sobel , stands by the wholesome intentions of the Hello Kitty brand .
“ I have no idea what people may have used it for , ” she said .
“ The product was marketed as a shoulder massager .
That ’s what it was sold as . ”

NY Times changes CIA headline for WH
The New York Times has changed the subheadline in Wednesday ’s front - page story on the CIA ’s destruction of secret interrogation tapes , following a formal request by the White House .
The correction has already been made online , and there will be a print correction in the paper , according to a Times representative .

On Wednesday , White House press secretary Dana Perino said in a statement that the Times subheadline — “ White House Role Was Wider Than It Said ” — was inaccurate .
“ The New York Times ’ inference that there is an effort to mislead in this matter is pernicious and troubling , and we are formally requesting that NYT correct the subheadline of this story , ” Perino said .
The White House has continued not to comment on what the representative dubbed “ misleading press reports . ”
In a statement , the Times said , “ The White House has not challenged the contents of our story , but it questioned the precision of the second deck of our headline .
...
While Bush administration officials have discussed the White House role in the tapes episode ( asserting , for example , that Harriet Miers opposed the destruction of the tapes ) ‘ the White House ’ has not officially said anything on the subject .
We have made the appropriate correction online , and will print a correction . ”
Dean Baquet , the Times ' Washington D.C. bureau chief , told Politico that while the deck — the subheadline — went a “ little farther than the story , ” the facts in the piece are accurate .
“ Nobody has challenged the thrust of the story , ” Baquet said .
“ If they want to quibble with the deck , they have a legitimate point .
But nobody is raising any questions with what the story is about , and what the story said . ”
Although the story was written and edited in Washington D.C. , according to Baquet , the subheadline and layout , in typical fashion , were handled in New York .
Mark Mazzetti and Scott Shane , the Times reporters who co-authored the story , could not be reached for comment .
“ We stand strongly by the story , ” Baquet said .
I am a fairly new member of the Lisp community , so new that most people have never heard of me .
I ’m one of the young programmers that have read the excellent writing from Paul Graham , Raganwald , and Steve Yegge and decided to try Lisp out for myself .
I ’ve had much more time available in small chunks , enough to read tutorials and articles on the internet but not enough to dive into heavy programming .
As a result , I ’ve gotten to know the community and history better than the language and tools , probably better than any new convert .
Here are some observations I ’ve made ( summary then detail ) :
Lisp is like a new language with lots of praise from important people .
Lisp used to be very important but lost that position .
Lisp lacks the infrastructure to get new users running quickly .
The tools are there but they are n’t organized and streamlined .
The Lisp community is fractured but composed of enough good people that it could develop into a positive , influential force .
1 ) Lisp feels like an emerging language ( think Ruby circa 2003 ) that may or may not make it big but happens to have 50 years of history under its belt .
I recently read that said SBCL and Clisp were the top two open source Common Lisp implementations , with single digit thousands of installs each .
A decent number but nothing earth shaking .
Interest could at this level for years , or given the right conditions , it could take off immensely ( see Rails , Ruby on ) .
However , Lisp also has the burden and the blessing of decades of history .
It was doing things 20 years ago that modern languages are just beginning to incorporate .
Years of large scale development have driven improvements in the language , tools , and performance that blow the doors off of new scripting languages like Python and Ruby .
It was the language of choice for the hardest problems of the 70s and 80s .
Luminaries in all aspects of computing have publicly praised Lisp for being so great ( Eric Raymond , Alan Kay , Peter Norvig , Guy Steele , etc ) .
But . . . decades of work by lots of brilliant people have caused Lisp ’s family tree to splinter instead of remain close knit .
The ease of writing software in Lisp means that people are more likely to roll their own tools instead of standardizing around a few common tools .
And because it was so old and mature once the Internet started driving new users , the community infrastructure is not geared towards new users .
This is more than a little weird compared to other languages .
2 ) Lisp used to be much more prominent in computing , and there are people around who remember that era .
Lisp was the language of choice for CAD , artificial intelligence , expert systems , and many other challenging problems .
There were multiple competing vendors offering Lisp environments , with new innovations in tools , improved compilers , and high performance .
There were even two companies that made hardware to run Lisp natively and a complete stack on top of those machines !
At that time , languages like Java , .
Net , Perl , Python , Ruby , and even C++ did n’t even exist and Lisp was only competing with C , Cobol , Fortran , and Assembly .
To make a long story short , the game changed and Lisp fell from prominence .
A number of factors torpedoed the Lisp machine companies , the DoD pulled funding for AI research , competing languages improved and incorporated some of Lisp ’s features like garbage collection , and the Common Lisp standard took some of the innovation out of commercial Lisp vendors .
Although it fell from prominence , during its heyday Lisp was a powerful contender in the computer world .
Keep in mind that at this time , computer hardware was expensive ( too expensive for individuals ) and was almost exclusively owned by corporations and universities .
3 ) Today , most of the work in programming languages and development technology is done by individuals , on their own hardware and often on their own time .
Since everyone is a volunteer , tools that cost money will reach many fewer people than free and especially open source tools will .
Since most people are volunteers as opposed to employees , they care about stuff like “ How long will it take me to get setup ? ” and “ How hard is it to resolve issues ? ” .
This is where languages like Ruby and Python shine .
How long does it take to get setup ?
Just download the installer package and run it !
Libraries included , directions just like the tutorial , easy .
Oh yeah , and it works for Windows and Linux and Mac. Batteries Included .
With Lisp , newbies say “ How do I get started ? ” and instead of a URL , they get “ Lisp is a family of languages , with the primary branches being Common Lisp and Scheme .
But these are just language standards with a number of implementations .
Which implementation is best for you depends on your platform and computing needs . ”
Huh ?
From reading a bunch of blogs and discussions , the impression I got is that the two best environments are SBCL and PLT Scheme .
But it seems rare for anyone to say “ You should use implementation X ” or even “ You should use implementation X unless you need to do Y ” .
This confusion makes it hard to even know how to get started .
Enough has been said about emacs .
I think it ’s great fun and I ’m enjoying learning it , but I ca n’t say that emacs / Slime is the most welcoming combination for newcomers .
And there are more and more of these types of things .
In tutorials / demos , it ’s not clear how your file structure should go .
It ’s not clear if a command should be entered in your code file , in the REPL , or in your SBCL init file ( which is where , again ? ) .
Part of my problem is that I wanted to learn all the nitty gritty stuff , so I ’m learning Linux , emacs , SBCL , Slime and Common Lisp at the same time .
This means that I have to leave tons of time to work through issues , because I could run into something in any of these layers of my stack .
I ’m not sure what it is about me that keeps me from using Lispbox , but something like this would make life a lot easier .
This should probably be the starting point for new Lispers , sort of like InstantRails is for the Ruby on Rails community .
Incidentally , there are good resources out there , but they need to be vetted and organized .
Hey , I ’m an organized person , maybe I ’ll volunteer for this !
( Oops , by publishing this , I think I just did ( gulp ) ) .
( clearly my writing style predisposed me to write Lisp code ) .
( Note : If I had searched my feeds before I sat down to write , I would have found that Eli Bendersky basically wrote this post for me five months ago .
Thanks Eli ! )
4 ) The community is . . . special .
There really is no community per se , but several communities bound together by one common name .
There are the crusty old guys ( the ones people warn you lurk on comp.lang.lisp ) , the generally good experienced developers ( Peter Seibel had received several compliments ) , and the new people asking “ dumb questions ” .
It ’s a challenge having all these groups interact , and the results are n’t always pretty .
I have n’t ventured onto c.l.l or IRC , but there are enough good Lisp bloggers that I feel connected ( note to self : connect back more ) .
People complain about the community ( mainly because of group # 1 ) , but a couple dozen or so active , friendly , constructive people could create a positive impression for all visitors to the community .
Just look what happened to Ruby with the Rails team .
And so that ’s where I think I ’ll leave off ( now I just need to trim and edit the 1,000 + word ramble above ) :
So the Lisp “ Golden Age ” of # 2 wo n’t be back ( the computing world is too different ) , but the future could be very bright indeed .
Let ’s make it so .
( Of course , people have been making this observation for a while .
Let ’s see if anything changes . )

* Original text : “ better competing languages were developed , ”
A few weeks back a longtime Rails developer by the name of Zed Shaw wrote a post in which he declared Rails is a ghetto .
If you have n’t already read it I would suggest that you probably not bother .
It ’s likely not going to be very interesting to you unless ; a ) you ’ve been involved in Rails since almost it ’s very beginning and thus you probably already read it or b ) you ’re planning to become a consultant in Rails .
See , a lot of it is kind of like the guy telling you how much the party sucked because a bunch of people showed up and ruined it before you got there .
Except , because you only showed up at the party very late to begin with , you had a completely different experience .
The people who ruined the party are gone or at least are n’t ruining anything anymore .
And the people who had their party ruined …
Well , they ’ve moved on to another party .
A really boring one that started in 1991 that never really caught on and is n’t going to .
Those of us who only really showed up to the Ruby and Rails party in 2007 ( and viewing the build a weblog in 15 minutes video the year before does n’t count ) are happy to show up to the party .
There ’s plugins to do everything under the sun , good books on interesting topics are showing up regularly , user groups are either already established or are popping up everywhere , it ’s a great party .
Especially if you ’re a serial entrepreneur like myself and you ’re looking to build websites with lots of features quickly and you are n’t going to get a lot of help from a huge crew of people to do it .
So maybe Rails is a ghetto .
Maybe it would suck to be a consultant in it right now because there ’s not enough jobs yet or rates are n’t where they should be .
Maybe I would have developed strong animosity between myself and some other developers / writers because I got in too early .
But frankly I did n’t and I love it .
Working on LOL.com was truly the first web development experience I have ever really enjoyed .
Yes , Enjoyed .
Oh , I still love Java and it ’s my go - to language for heavy data lifting .
But Rails is it for my web development .
I can go to a web development project and like it and then come back later and not wince at what ’s I did .
Sure , I ’m making novice mistakes , but even those are n’t proving that bad to clean up .
Before I clam up again , there ’s two other things I ’d like to say :
Zed Shaw singles out Dave Thomas for a lot of vitriol in his rant .
I ca n’t speak to any of that .
Maybe he is a horrible person , maybe the Ruby book he wrote sucked horribly .
But , I have read his Rails book and it ’s not a bad book at all .
I ’ve gone back to it many times already .
I have a lot of other Rails books at this point .
Several of them are n’t very good at all , so it ’s not just my ignorance of what other Rails books are like .
Nor is it my inexperience with programming books .
I ’ve been a professional developer for 20 years now .
I know programming books both bad and good .
I can stand up and say that Agile Web Development with Rails is pretty good .
Everybody who has seen the explosive growth of Ruby and Rails over the last couple of years eclipse their favorite language / framework ( e.g. Python , Groovy , PHP , etc. ) seems to be blogging or commenting this idea that Ruby and Rails is n’t really that great , it ’s just hype .
It ’s only a committed few who have something to gain from you adopting Rails ( i.e. a book to sell , consultant hours , etc. ) who are promoting something that is snake oil .
Seriously , how stupid do you think we all are ?
I ’ve been doing professional development since 1985 and doing it full time since ’ 87 .
Do you really think that I and thousands of others can’t tell when something works and it does n’t ?
I did HTML when the only browser was NCSA Mosaic and ASP websites to build DevGames.com and then later GameDev.net in 1999 .
That was painful .
I can tell the freaking difference people .
This works and it works well .
I might not pick it for building the next version of eBay because it would n’t stand up to the load , but I would pick it for building the early versions of the next site that will become as big as eBay because it will offer that site lots of fast growth and flexibility .
So when did science fiction become science fact , eh ?
After reading this , you may just discover that we ’re a lot closer to the technology in Star Trek than you might think …
Being the sci - fi fan of old , I could n’t resist writing this article .
In fact , I ’ve been looking forward to it for quite some time !
I ’ve been waiting for the principle technologies maturing enough to a point where it would make sense for me to talk about them in a contemporaneous sense that would whet the appetites of those like myself .
As you ’ll see for yourself , in terms of advancements in technology , we ’ve come a long way already …
Matter Transporters
Is transporter technology a matter of opinion or a matter of fact ?
Well , you might just want to ask Professor Eugene Polzik what he thinks :
“ Until now scientists have teleported similar objects such as light or single atoms over short distances from one spot to another in a split second .
But Professor Eugene Polzik and his team at the Niels Bohr Institute at Copenhagen University in Denmark have made a breakthrough by using both light and matter . ”
This is a topic I covered very recently :
“ Although teleportation is associated with the science - fiction series ‘ Star Trek , ’ no one is likely to be beamed anywhere soon .
But the achievement of Polzik ’s team , in collaboration with the theorist Ignacio Cirac of the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching , Germany , marks an advancement in the field of quantum information and computers , which could transmit and process information in a way that was impossible before . ”
In summary , while there are significant hurdles to overcome , and some years between now and when these technological hurdles are traversed , matter transportation could well be a matter of fact .
Warp Drive
This is no flight of fancy , and Chief Engineer Mr. Scott might smile with pride .
As we begin to see the commercial benefits of space exploration , the need to move efficiently and at speed through space becomes a high priority .
Advanced propulsion is an area of science and physics that a lot of very well - educated and very serious - minded people are currently exploring :
“ Every year , the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics awards prizes for the best papers presented at its annual conference .
Last year ’s winner in the nuclear and future flight category went to a paper calling for experimental tests of an astonishing new type of engine .
According to the paper , this hyperdrive motor would propel a craft through another dimension at enormous speeds .
It could leave Earth at lunchtime and get to the moon in time for dinner . ”
And who do we have to thank for this premier contribution to modern science and the stuff of science fiction ?
“ In 1957 , German theoretical physicist Burkhard Heim publicly outlined a new idea for spacecraft propulsion .
It was based on his new theory of physics which successfully described Einstein ’s theory of Relativity within the framework of Quantum Mechanics , and it married the two so effectively that he became an instant celebrity .
Such a goal was long sought by Einstein himself , but never realized . ”
Might it be that within StarTrek lore there ’s inspiration drawn from Burkhard Heim and his ideas ?
Could be .
Maybe someone more familiar with Star Trek could fill us in on that one ?
It ’s also worth pointing out that there are fundamental differences between Warp Drive and the proposed Hyperdrive technology .. but that ’s another story .
Much too technical for now .

Transparent Aluminium
Clearly this ca n’t be real ?
While seemingly improbable and bound to test the mettle of the best minds in metallurgy , transparent Aluminium ( Aluminum for the US readers ) is right here and right now :
“ The Air Force Research Laboratory ’s materials and manufacturing directorate is testing aluminum oxynitride – ALONtm – as a replacement for the traditional multi-layered glass transparencies now used in existing ground and air armored vehicles .
… ALONtm is a ceramic compound with a high compressive strength and durability .
When polished , it is the premier transparent armor for use in armored vehicles .
… ALONtm is virtually scratch resistant , offers substantial impact resistance , and provides better durability and protection against armor piercing threats , at roughly half the weight and half the thickness of traditional glass transparent armor , … ”
Hypospray
Bringing 23rd century into the 21st century would obviously be something of a shot in the arm for the medical industry and medical science in general , that ’s for sure .
Also sure to draw a smile of satisfaction from Doctor “ Bones ” Leonard McCoy .
So please welcome the Hypospray :
“ It is n’t called HypoSpray , but the SonoPrep is a similar means to an identical end : painless injections .
After 20 years of research and development , Prof. Joseph Krost of Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba , Israel has developed the device which applies ultrasonic waves to a small area of skin , opening microscopic pores and allowing medication to pass into a patient ’s bloodstream . ”
Cloaking Device
You ’ll be forgiven for not seeing this one coming a little sooner .
However , for those guys currently developing Cloaking Device technology , it ’s still very much a work in progress , with much more still to be done before a fully - working prototype is viable – which will no doubt be a relief to any fledgling Klingon Empire out there :
“ Physicists have drawn up blueprints for a cloaking device that could , in theory , render objects invisible .
Light normally bounces off an object ’s surface making it visible to the human eye .
But John Pendry and colleagues at Imperial College London , UK , have calculated that materials engineered to have abnormal optical properties , known as metamaterials , could make light pass around an object as so it appears as if it were not there at all . ”
And for now , there are significant limitations that rely on some advances in other technologies :
“ However , Pendry ’s team ’s design could currently only work at wavelengths larger than visible light .
Designing a cloaking device for visible wavelengths could be tricky as it would involve creating nanoscale metamaterials . ”
Universal Translator
Say what ?
The idea of a true , real Universal Translator will undoubtedly leave some people a little tongue - tied , but not for much longer .
So whether you ’re fluent in Andorian or just learning Bajoran , getting lost in translation may be a thing of the past :
“ ViA , a wearable computer maker , has developed an Earth - based language translator that will be available later this year to the U.S. military and English - speaking consumers . ”
And here ’s something from a recent press article :
“ ViA Team Mission Statement :
To develop a near real time , two way , mobile , lightweight , robust and low cost multi-lingual language translation device that can be operated with minimal training in a hands free manner . ”
What can I say ?
Words fail me .
Force Fields
While this final technology was always likely to draw some flack , I can assure you , Force Fields are very real , tried & tested and are due to be in production and then on a battlefield ( hopefully not too close to you or I ) very soon :
“ The system can simultaneously engage several threats , arriving from different directions , is effective on stationary or moving platforms , and is effective against short and long range threats ( such as RPGs and ATGM ) .
Trophy was designed to be effective in open or closed terrain , including urban area and can be operated under all weather conditions . ”
Phasers
Clearly unfazed by the challenge of developing weapon technology from the 24th century , scientists have set to the task of creating stunning laser beams as a means of pacifying a foe :
“ The US government has unveiled a ‘ non- lethal ’ laser rifle designed to dazzle enemy personnel without causing them permanent harm … The Personnel Halting and Stimulation Response ( PHASR ) rifle was developed at the Air Force Research Laboratory in New Mexico , US , and two prototypes have been delivered to military bases in Texas and Virginia for further testing . ”
Tricorders
Looking set to measure up to the challenge of creating the portable medical diagnostician of the future , scanning through this excerpt , you ’ll no doubt get a good fix on the many , many possibilities that will open up in the near future :
“ Nanogen ’s APEX scanner is n’t as flashy as Doctor McCoy ’s medical tricorder – requiring direct contact with human tissue instead of a casual wave over the body – but Nova nevertheless predicts it will revolutionize diagnostic medicine .
‘ We ’re using electronics as the basis of our science , ’ she says , adding that her technology could pose a competitive threat to conventional test tube laboratories , where results can be late and are occasionally wrong . ”
Where to next ?
There is no simple answer to this question .
Threads that begun long before my time and the time of most of you reading this will extend onwards through our time and into some distant future .
Some of those threads will merge and some will dwindle , fade into obscurity and some will – much like us – die .
However , some will find a second life and carry on renewed and afresh , while those that have persisted for centuries – and along the way , coalescing with others – will vanish and be replaced by something more permanent and appropriate for their time .
But know this :
OperationImpeachment.org —
Twenty some people protested Dick Cheney when he came to the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce to give a speech on January 31 .
Protesters called for Cheney to be impeached & arrested for war crimes , spying , lying us into wars , torture , war profiteering & other crimes against the people .
Grassroots Impeachment Movement ( GRIM ) brought a criminal complaint against Dick Cheney & gathered signatures on it .
People from Charlotte , Salisbury , Greensboro , Chapel Hill , Carrboro , Winston - Salem , Pinnacle , & Pittsboro took part in the protest .
Groups organizing for the protest included Action Center For Justice , CODEPINK - Charlotte , Grassroots Impeachment Movement ( GRIM ) , and NC World Ca n’t Wait .
The Charlotte Observer , Channel 3 & 9 , and maybe other TV news filmed and / or talked to protesters .
AP took a photo which is posted on Yahoo News Photos .
WFAE radio also spoke to a protester .
A full report , film , pictures , etc will be sent out later today or tomorrow and posted at www.CharlotteAction.org.
Pentagon holds brain injury data
The Pentagon is refusing to release data on how many soldiers have suffered brain injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It says disclosing the results would put the lives of those fighting at risk .
The data come from screenings of 1,587 soldiers at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and 9,000 at Fort Carson in Colorado .
Army Medical Command spokesman Jaime Cavazos said Wednesday that the results of the tests represent " information the enemy could use to potentially make soldiers more vulnerable to harm . "
He declined to elaborate .
FROM MILD TO SEVERE : Brain injuries add up Pentagon scientists and other health officials have already made public similar data from other installations .
Those results show that about 10 % of combat troops — and 20 % in front - line infantry units — suffered concussions during their tours .
The injuries frequently go undiagnosed ; multiple concussions can lead to permanent brain damage .
The screening is done with a questionnaire prepared by the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center , a research arm of the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments .
The questionnaire is used at four military bases , and center director Deborah Warden has urged that it be used throughout the military .
So far , the Pentagon has declined to do so because it questions whether troops can accurately answer the questions in the screening .
Naval Medical Center San Diego , which has been screening Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton for two years — and , more recently , soldiers from the Army 's Fort Irwin — released data this week .
Those data show that 10 % of 7,909 Marines with the 1st Marine Division suffered brain injuries .
Researchers tried to follow up with 500 Marines who suffered concussions .
They reached 161 of them and found that 83 % were still suffering symptoms on average 10 months after the injury .
At Fort Irwin , 1,490 soldiers were screened , and almost 12 % suffered concussions during their combat tours .
How much money will songwriters make ?
That 's the question before the Copyright Royalty Board ( CRB ) here in the US as the judges have launched a rate setting procedure that will determine — for the first time — what songwriters get for digital downloads and streaming music .
Not surprisingly , the issue has become contentious .
On the one side are the music labels ( represented by the RIAA ) and the digital media companies ( represented by DiMA ) that stream and sell music over the Internet .
Both groups have to pay " mechanical royalties " whenever a physical copy of the song is sold or a digital version is downloaded , and they 'd obviously prefer to pay less .
The groups think that the current mechanical rate of about 9 cents , used to calculate how much songwriters get from CD sales , is too high .
As the music industry suffers a downturn in overall revenues , these groups argue that songwriters have to accept less money in order to keep the whole industry alive .
But the songwriters do n't have an interest in being kneecapped by lower rates for their work .
David Israelite heads the National Music Publishers ' Association , and he argues that the rates for digital distribution ought to go up , on the theory that digital distribution costs far less than physical distribution and there 's more profit to be shared .
Israelite calls the current hearing " the most important rate hearing in the history of the music industry , " as it sets a baseline that could be difficult to move much in the years to come .
Here 's how far apart the two groups are : when it comes to digital downloads , the NMPA wants 15 ¢ per track for the songwriters ( often split 50/50 between the songwriter and the music publisher ) , but the RIAA only wants to pay 5 ¢ or 6 ¢ a track .
DiMA suggests paying even less .
For streaming music , the NMPA suggests that 12.5 percent of total revenue would be a fair payment , while the RIAA thinks that 0.58 percent would be appropriate .
DiMA has suggested that songwriters do n't actually deserve any mechanical royalties at all for streaming music , comparing the practice of streaming to radio and arguing that radio's " performance royalty " should be used instead .
As the numbers show , these are not trivial disagreements ; the two sides have very different visions for the future of the industry .
At a CES panel this year that was headed by our own Ken Fisher , DiMA head Jonathan Potter and Israelite sparred over the issue , with Israelite angrily accusing DiMA of trying to undercut songwriters .
If songwriters are not also recording artists ( and many are not ) , these mechanical and performance royalties are one of their main sources of income .
Even if the songwriters are in a band and record their own material , songwriter royalties can still be a large percentage of revenue , especially since radio currently pays songwriters but not recording artists ( Congress has been considering proposals that could eliminate this carve - out for radio ) .
Wired 's Eliot Van Buskirk covered the issue recently , and he claims that " music is bad enough already .
Cutting songwriters out of the equation not only means that manufactured bands that rely on them sound worse .
It also means bands that do their own songwriting will have a tougher time surviving . "
The move to cut ( substantially ) songwriter royalties does n't sound like something done to " support the artists , " though perhaps moving more songs at lower prices would be better for everyone in the long run .
On the other hand , it 's not hard to imagine prices staying the same and the labels and resellers simply keeping the extra cash .
It 's also important to note that it's not just the RIAA that wants to lower rates ; Apple , Amazon , Napster , iMeem , Live365 , RealNetworks , and more are all DiMA members , and they 're pushing for the lowest rates of all .
The CRB has started hearings and will issue a final decision in October 2008 .

The holidays : they can be stressful for everyone , even local TV news producers who need to fill that two - minute gap between the waterskiing squirrel story and the house fire in the next state that injured no one .
You could assign " reporters " to dig up some local " news " of actual community value , but that takes time and money , and frankly , who wants to watch anything that might make them think at 10 PM ?
Much easier just to let industry send the news in premade packets .
This Christmas season , the RIAA has a present for local news divisions : a video news release about music piracy , complete with exhortations to buy iTunes gift cards and cell phone ringtones .
An anonymous reader , who claims to work for the company that distributed the video package , has posted the alleged video news release online .
The video is shockingly bad — the narrator talks too slowly , the pacing is poor , and the " fly - in " bullet points look like they were produced in Windows Movie Maker .
Still , for the first half of the clip , it 's generally accurate information about recent busts at duplication facilities .
And then come the bullet points .
" Watch for compilation CDs that could only exist in the dreams of a music fan , " viewers are warned , a statement that only serves to highlight the fact that pirates do a better job of providing what music lovers want than the industry does .
Whoops .
Beware the bullets
Then there 's this gem : " Audio quality on pirated CDs is usually atrocious . "
Someone alert the RIAA to how digital copying actually works , please .
From there , the clip moves into straight - ahead advertising .
" Make sure the music you buy is legitimate , " says the narrator .
How ?
Simple !
Just use the " cool , innovative ways to get your favorite music " that the industry offers .
The video then shows iTunes digital album gift cards and a cell phone , for which you can buy Christmas - themed ring tones .
The production values of the video initially led us to suspect it of being a fake , but the leaker has provided Ars with a copy of an alleged press advisory that went out promoting the clip .
It 's directed to " news assignment desk / consumer reporters , " who are more likely to use the footage and basic " storyline " themselves than to simply run the unedited report .
The RIAA has not yet responded to our request for authentication of the video .
Lending credence to the video , though , is the fact that it follows a recent RIAA press release almost exactly .
Though that release says nothing about a video news feed , it does mention that the RIAA is launching a " holiday anti-piracy campaign " that " offers shoppers innovative gift ideas and tips for avoiding pirate product . "
The campaign is set to focus on 15 cities with " exceptionally high piracy rates " ( every major US city , apparently ) .
For an industry already the target of so much consumer suspicion , feeding misleading claims and self - serving footage to ostensibly objective " news " outlets just does n't seem like a great idea .
Yes , piracy is bad ; yes , we should shut down illegal commercial stamping operations .
But trying to turn the news into such an explicit commercial ?
Unhelpful .
You 'll find fluoride in tea , beer and fish , which might sound like a balanced diet to you .
But this week Alan Johnson announced a new push for putting it in our drinking water , with some very grand promises - and in the face of serious opposition .
General Jack D Ripper developed his theories about environmental poisoning and bodily fluids when he experienced a pervasive sense of emptiness during the physical act of love .
He instantly identified the cause , as documented in Dr Strangelove : " Do you realise that in addition to fluoridating water , there are studies under way to fluoridate salt , flour , fruit juices , soup , sugar , milk , ice cream ?
Ice cream , Mandrake ?
Children 's ice cream !
You know when fluoridation began ?
1946 , Mandrake .
How does that coincide with your post - war Commie conspiracy , huh ?
" It 's obvious , is n't it ?
A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual , and certainly without any choice .
That 's the way your hard - core Commie works . "
Bill Etherington MP calls fluoride " poison " .
Nazis supposedly used it to subdue people in concentration camps .
According to a former Guardian alternative health columnist , fluoride is " in the same league as lead and arsenic " .
The reality is that anyone making any confident statement on fluoride speaks way beyond the evidence .
In 1999 the Department of Health commissioned the centre for reviews and dissemination at York University to do a systematic review of fluoridation and its effects on dental health .
Little new work has been done since .
In the review , 3,200 research papers , mostly of very poor quality , were unearthed .
The ones that met the minimum quality threshold suggested there was vaguely , possibly , around a 15 % increase in the number of children without dental caries in areas with fluoridated water , but the studies generally could n't exclude other explanations for the variance .
Of course , the big idea with fluoride in water is that it can reduce social inequalities in dental health since everyone drinks it .
But there is n't much evidence on that either .
So when the British Dental Association says there is " overwhelming evidence " that adding fluoride to water helps fight tooth decay , it is in danger of stepping into line with Ripper .
And when Johnson says fluoridation is an effective , relatively easy way to help address health inequalities , he is really just pushing an old - fashioned line which says complex social problems can be addressed with £ 50 m worth of atoms .
But since I 'm in the mood for scaremongering , let 's not forget the potential harm .
A study from Taiwan found a high incidence of bladder cancer in women from areas where the natural fluoride content in water was high .
It might have been a chance finding ; but it could be real .
The problem is one of small effect sizes .
Fluoride and bladder cancer would be a pig to research as the effect size is small , the exposure runs over half a century , and the outcome - bladder cancer - takes a lifetime to reveal itself .
Welcome to the finer details behind " more research is needed " .
And the numbers can get very scary , very quickly : in the UK a 10 % increase in risk would give you 1,000 extra new cases of bladder cancer a year .
Fear .
Actually , I enjoyed that .
Maybe I should move to the Mail .
Even stories about Tibet are now accessible People in China are able to access English language stories on the BBC News website in full , after years of strict control by Beijing .
The Communist authorities often block news sites such as the BBC in a policy dubbed the " great firewall of China " .
But BBC staff working in China now say they are able to access news stories that would have been blocked before .
However , the firewall remains in place for Chinese language services on the website and for any links in Chinese .
' Without hindrance '
Beijing has never admitted to blocking access to BBC news stories - and there has been no official confirmation that the website has been unblocked .
But Chinese users trying to access pages on the site have almost always been redirected to an error message telling them : " The connection was reset . "
I can read the BBC website on a normal internet cafe computer
Gudrun Gallhoff
Website reader , Shandong province
China readers react China 's web battle
It now appears that this is no longer the case , and access to the site is much easier .
Steve Herrmann , editor of the BBC News website , says this is a welcome development .
" We want BBC News to be as accessible in China as anywhere else in the world , " he said .
" We will endeavour to continue working with the Chinese authorities to improve our access in other areas . "
Technology experts say such a development would not be possible without the approval of internet service providers - which are under strict supervision by Beijing .
Surprised readers Statistics show that traffic to the website from China has been much higher than usual .
Typically fewer than 100 people read stories from Chinese computers - but on Tuesday that figure jumped to more than 16,000 .
And comments have been flooding in to BBC forums from all over China .
Ross Brown in Qingdao , Shandong province , wrote : " We were just discussing with some of our Chinese colleagues about the fact BBC website was blocked , went on to show them and we see this latest news .
Excellent news . "
Many of the comments came from readers of the website who have spent years accessing the stories by linking their computers to others based outside of China .
Tibet difficulties
The Chinese authorities had promised to give foreign journalists more freedom in the run-up to this summer 's Olympic Games .
But analysts say that recent outbreaks of unrest in Tibet have made this promise more difficult for Beijing to uphold .
The BBC and other media organisations still find reporting from Tibet very difficult - foreign journalists were refused permission to enter the region during the recent protests .
The websites of UK newspapers the Times and Guardian - as well as video - sharing site YouTube - were blocked or partially blocked during the unrest .
This week the Chinese government has arranged a trip for foreign media organisations to Tibet - but the BBC 's request to be included was rejected .
Although no official ban has ever been announced , the BBC News website has been blocked for almost a decade .
The Chinese language website has been blocked since its launch in 1999 .

What are these ?
Evolution carries out an incredibly tricky balancing act : the genetic program of a species has to be resistant to small changes , yet also susceptible to the adaptive remodeling of natural selection .
The human genome is so robust that over 6 billion variations give rise to viable organisms that have successfully traversed the complex developmental program that produces a live human infant from a single cell .
Yet the human genome is the product of major evolutionary innovation , even over the relatively short period since the human and chimp lineages diverged .
How can genomes be robust and malleable at the same time ?
A team of researchers led by Andreas Wagner have recently published an interesting theoretical study of this question .
This subject can get abstract and tough to follow if you have n’t mastered a lot of technical jargon .
However these results are worth the effort to follow the argument , and below I try to explain this study in a relatively jargon - free way .
So how does evolution maintain both stability and the potential for innovation ?
It ’s much easier to study this question by focusing on a small model system , such as a .
A transcription factor regulatory network is essentially a set of genes that switch each other on of off ( via , of course , the proteins that are encoded by these genes ) .
These networks are the subject of Wagner ’s research .
Over time , a stable pattern can emerge in a transcriptional regulatory network , with some genes on and others off .
This phenomenon , the emergence of a stable pattern of gene expression , is roughly what happens when a stem cell differentiates into another type , such as a nerve or muscle cell - a certain combination of genes are switched on or off to produce a stable pattern that represents the final state in the fully differentiated cell .
A critical point to understand is that different versions of the transcriptional regulatory network can produce .
In other words , we can rewire some of the connections in our network , but still get the same final pattern of genes switched on or off .
This is one way that evolution produces networks that are stable to change - small variations do n’t radically alter the end result of the transcription factor network .
Andreas Wagner and his colleagues used simulations to test just how much rewiring can happen in a network that still produces the same final gene expression pattern .
The answer is that you can in fact do a lot of rewiring and still have your network carry out its proper function .
Naturally some rewiring is going to produce catastrophic change , but the point is that evolution has many different ways to produce the same final pattern of gene expression .
Once nature has hit on a great way to make a stem cell differentiate into a nerve cell , it ’s not that difficult to keep making nerve cells , even in the face of significant evolutionary change .
Thus this group of researchers has used simulations to come up with a theoretical understanding of how the complex systems in a lineage of organisms remain stable over long periods of evolutionary change .
But if these systems are so stable , how does evolution ever produce something new ?
If it is so stable , how can a transcriptional network which produces a stable pattern of gene expression in a nerve cell ever be rewired to produce an expression pattern for a new cell type ?
The answer to this question is paradoxically tied to the very features that make transcriptional networks so stable .
Wagner and his colleagues found in their simulations that networks which are structured in very similar ways ( and thus producing essentially identical patterns of stable gene expression ) can be mutated to produce only a few limited , new patterns of gene expression .
But we learned just a moment ago that transcriptional networks can be structured in very different ways yet still produce the same final effects ; these different networks can evolve in different ways and thus increase the potential for evolutionary innovation .
An example can make this idea clear .
Let ’s say we a dozen different but closely related species ; each of these species produces its nerve cells using very similar transcriptional regulatory networks .
The networks can only be changed in certain , limited ways , thus the potential for evolutionary innovation is limited .
But now let ’s say we have a hundred different ( more distantly related ) species , and they all produce nerve cells ( with similar stable patterns of gene expression ) , but they do so using a wide variety of transcriptional network structures .
The pool for evolutionary innovation is now much larger , meaning that it ’s much more likely that a new and useful cell variant will evolve .
If all of these hundred species had to produce their nerve cells in exactly the same way , using very similarly structured transcriptional networks , this potential for evolutionary innovation would not be possible .
Thus Wagner ’s group demonstrated how it ’s possible for regulatory networks to be both stable , and yet malleable at the same time .
Last November , we reported on H.R. 4137 , the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007 , which includes misguided anti-piracy requirements for universities .
For the most part , the massive , nearly 800 - page bill refreshes existing legislation about federal financial aid .
But the bill also includes a section with a title that sounds as if it were dreamt up by an entertainment industry lobbyist : " Campus - based Digital Theft Prevention . "
Specifically , the bill says :
Each eligible institution participating in any program under this title shall to the extent practicable — [...]
( 2 ) develop a plan for offering alternatives to illegal downloading or peer - to - peer distribution of intellectual property as well as a plan to explore technology - based deterrents to prevent such illegal activity .
To those unfamiliar with this particular sort of DC double - speak , " alternatives to illegal downloading " means industry - sanctioned download services ; and existing " technology - based deterrents " means network filters and other tools .
These congressional requirements will turn out to be expensive dead - ends -- the industry - sanctioned online music services are laden with DRM , and network detection / filtering programs present privacy risks and are inevitably rendered obsolete by technological countermeasures .
Advocates of the bill stress that the language stops short of demanding implementation -- that it only requires universities to " plan " -- but this argument misses the point entirely .
The passage of this bill will unambiguously lead universities down the wrong path .
For the sake of artists , administrators , students , and consumers better approaches exist .
The bill also would hang an unspoken threat over the heads of university administrators .
In response to concerns that potential penalties for universities could include a loss of federal student aid funding , the MPAA 's top lawyer in Washington said that federal funds should be at risk when copyright infringement happens on campus networks .
Moreover , earlier versions of " Campus - based Digital Theft Prevention " proposals nakedly sought to make schools that received numerous copyright infringement notices subject to review by the US Secretary of Education .
In October 2007 , the MPAA even tried to supplement its efforts in Congress by giving away custom - built network monitoring software to universities it had flagged for having the most file - sharing traffic .
The software , which they called " University Toolkit , " was exposed by researchers to have egregious security and privacy flaws .
And , in an ironic twist , the University Toolkit was removed from the MPAA website following allegations of copyright infringement -- the MPAA had failed to comply with copyright licensing terms that required the source code for the toolkit software to be freely available .
Recent reports suggest that February may be the earliest that the House will address the bill .
There is time yet to contact your representative in Congress to educate them about these out - of - place requirements , and to ask that they support any effort to remove the offending mandate from the bill .

Quote :
I 've been attending the USENIX NT and LISA NT ( Large Installation
Systems Administration for NT ) conference in downtown Seattle this
week .
One of those magical Microsoft moments ( tm ) happened yesterday and
I thought that I 'd share .
Non -geeks may not find this funny at
all , but those in geekdom ( particularly UNIX geekdom ) will
appreciate it .
Greg Sullivan , a Microsoft product manager ( henceforth MPM ) , was
holding forth on a forthcoming product that will provide Unix
style scripting and shell services on NT for compatibility and to
leverage UNIX expertise that moves to the NT platform .
The
product suite includes the MKS ( Mortise Kern Systems ) windowing
Korn shell , a windowing PERL , and lots of goodies like awk , sed
and grep .
It actually fills a nice niche for which other products
( like the MKS suite ) have either been too highly priced or not
well enough integrated .
An older man , probably mid-50s , stands up in the back of the room
and asserts that Microsoft could have done better with their
choice of Korn shell .
He asks if they had considered others that
are more compatible with existing UNIX versions of KSH .
The MPM said that the MKS shell was pretty compatible and should
be able to run all UNIX scripts .
The questioner again asserted that the MKS shell was not very
compatible and did n't do a lot of things right that are defined in
the KSH language spec .
The MPM asserted again that the shell was pretty compatible and
should work quite well .
This assertion and counter assertion went back and forth for a
bit , when another fellow member of the audience announced to the
MPM that the questioner was , in fact David Korn of AT&T ( now
Lucent ) Bell Labs .
( David Korn is the author of the Korn shell )
Uproarious laughter burst forth from the audience , and it was one
of the only times that I have seen a ( by then pink cheeked ) MPM
lost for words or momentarily lacking the usual unflappable
confidence .
So , what 's a body to do when Microsoft reality
collides with everyone elses ?
We blog .
Sometimes .
Maybe .
" As Governor , I tried to do the right as best I knew it , serving the law and answering to the Constitution .
I did not confuse the particular teachings of my church with the obligations of the office and of the Constitution – and of course , I would not do so as President .
I will put no doctrine of any church above the plain duties of the office and the sovereign authority of the law .
" As a young man , Lincoln described what he called America 's ' political religion ' – the commitment to defend the rule of law and the Constitution .
When I place my hand on the Bible and take the oath of office , that oath becomes my highest promise to God .
If I am fortunate to become your President , I will serve no one religion , no one group , no one cause , and no one interest .
A President must serve only the common cause of the people of the United States .
" There are some for whom these commitments are not enough .
They would prefer it if I would simply distance myself from my religion , say that it is more a tradition than my personal conviction , or disavow one or another of its precepts .
That I will not do .
I believe in my Mormon faith and I endeavor to live by it .
My faith is the faith of my fathers – I will be true to them and to my beliefs .
" Some believe that such a confession of my faith will sink my candidacy .
If they are right , so be it .
But I think they underestimate the American people .
Americans do not respect believers of convenience .
Americans tire of those who would jettison their beliefs , even to gain the world .
" There is one fundamental question about which I often am asked .
What do I believe about Jesus Christ ?
I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Savior of mankind .
My church 's beliefs about Christ may not all be the same as those of other faiths .
Each religion has its own unique doctrines and history .
These are not bases for criticism but rather a test of our tolerance .
Religious tolerance would be a shallow principle indeed if it were reserved only for faiths with which we agree .
" There are some who would have a presidential candidate describe and explain his church 's distinctive doctrines .
To do so would enable the very religious test the founders prohibited in the Constitution .
No candidate should become the spokesman for his faith .
For if he becomes President he will need the prayers of the people of all faiths .
" I believe that every faith I have encountered draws its adherents closer to God .
And in every faith I have come to know , there are features I wish were in my own : I love the profound ceremony of the Catholic Mass , the approachability of God in the prayers of the Evangelicals , the tenderness of spirit among the Pentecostals , the confident independence of the Lutherans , the ancient traditions of the Jews , unchanged through the ages , and the commitment to frequent prayer of the Muslims .
As I travel across the country and see our towns and cities , I am always moved by the many houses of worship with their steeples , all pointing to heaven , reminding us of the source of life 's blessings .
CBS issued its own statement this evening , saying : “ CBS News regrets not being able to offer the Democratic presidential debate scheduled for Dec. 10 in Los Angeles .
The possibility of picket lines set up by the Writers Guild of America and the unwillingness of many candidates to cross them made it necessary to allow the candidates to make other plans . ”
The Writers Guild of America represents both the news and entertainment writers involved in the labor disputes with CBS , but the news writers operate under a separate contract from the scriptwriters .
All the networks and Hollywood production studios have been hit by the scriptwriters ’ strike , but only CBS News would be affected if the news writers go ahead with a strike .
That group voted earlier this month to authorize a strike , but no date has been set for one .
Sherry Goldman , a spokeswoman for the Writers Guild of America East , which represents the news writers , said today that a report posted on several Web sites , which asserted that the news writers had voted to begin a strike on the day of the debate , was untrue .
“ I do n’t know where they got that information , ” Ms. Goldman said .
She explained that the “ board and counsel ” of that union would have to meet and vote on setting a strike date and no such meeting has taken place .
“ No one in any sense has made a decision about anything , ” Ms. Goldman said .
The news writers have been working at CBS without a contract for more than two years .
The debate on Dec. 10 was never scheduled to run on the entire CBS network , as individual stations would have been able to choose whether to broadcast it or not .
But the 90 - minute debate would have taken place from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.
Pacific time , putting the Democratic tussle into prime time in the East and Midwest and making it unlikely that many stations in the Eastern or Central time zones would have chosen to carry the debate .
It would have been available on CBS ’s Web site .
By David Swanson , After Downing Street – A private off - the - record meeting was held on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that included House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Subcommittee on the Constitution Chairman Jerrold Nadler , Judiciary Committee Member and advocate for opening Cheney impeachment hearings Robert Wexler , and several other committee members , activists , staffers , and former staffers from the Watergate days .
I was n’t there , so I ’m free to talk about what happened .
Wexler proposed opening impeachment hearings on Cheney .
Conyers committee staffer Perry Appelbaum laid out instead a schedule for non-impeachment hearings over the coming 11 months .
Conyers ’ notion is to hold non-impeachment hearings on “ the imperial presidency ” and run out the clock .
I guess that would be sort of like a dozen police officers paying a non-arresting visit to the home of a mass murderer .
Seriously ?
An “ imperial ” president , and you do n’t impeach him , and you do n’t retire or commit suicide ?
This baffles me .
Now , there are topics that have not been touched in congressional investigations over the past 12 months , such as the Iraq war lies .
But a lot of the other topics have already been gone over , just absent the I word .
What will differentiate the new non-impeachment hearings from the past year ’s worth of non-impeachment hearings ?
Of course , getting witnesses to show up and testify would be a change , but without impeachment , nothing will compel any witnesses to testify who have previously refused .
One of the big topics this group wants to go after is the firing of U.S. Attorneys , and – contrary to the position expressed today by the Democratic leadership – this group was in agreement that Congress should vote on contempt citations for Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten .
But , even understanding that nothing was going to budge on that any time soon , most of the Congress Members present still refused to back Wexler ’s proposal .
The chief opponent of impeachment hearings was not Conyers .
It was Nadler .
Nadler argued strongly against any use of the I word .
He argued that Congress should focus on passing bills , even though they will be vetoed , and then pass them again next year .
Arguing for keeping open the possibility of impeachment hearings developing out of the non-impeachment hearings was Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson .
Daniel Ellsberg was also among those backing impeachment hearings .
Conyers and some subgroup plan to take their proposal for non-impeachment imperial abuse hearings to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to request her blessing .
She is , of course , most likely to share Nadler ’s position .
She may have given Nadler his position , or perhaps it originated with Hillary Clinton , but it sounds most likely that Nadler has simply been speaking for himself : he honestly opposes impeachment hearings , even for emperors .
Nadler ’s constituents have been among the most dedicated activists , many of them repeatedly sitting in at his office for impeachment and going to jail .
One group has just set up a website solely to allow people all over the country to Email Nadler on this issue : http://asknadler2impeach.org
Nadler chairs the most relevant subcommittee and could open Cheney impeachment hearings in that subcommittee tomorrow if he chose to do so .
The full House voted to send articles of impeachment on Cheney to the Judiciary Committee last November .
Wednesday ’s meeting was handicapped , of course , because no - one says aloud what the reasons are for opposing impeachment .
That Cheney and Bush have committed impeachable offenses is universally understood .
But the arguments against impeaching them ( other priorities , bipartisanship , we do n’t have the votes , etc. ) usually sound like lame cover for whatever the real reason is .
I suspect the real reason is built into Nadler ’s plan of wasting a year in order to pass bills next year .
He assumes that in 2009 there will be either a better Congress or a better president ( he backs Hillary Clinton ) , or both .
Sadly , history says otherwise .
For 230 years , the party that brings impeachment wins , and the party that fails to do so when it ’s called for loses .
Conyers was there when the Democrats moved to impeach Nixon and then won big .
He was there when they refused to impeach Reagan and then lost .
And most of the current committee was there when the Republicans impeached Clinton against the will of the public for a non-impeachable offense and still won both houses of Congress and the White House .
When the Democrats held back from impeachment during Iran Contra , they lost the next elections .
When the Democrats led the effort to investigate and impeach Nixon , they won big in the next election , even though Ford was running as an incumbent .
When the Republicans tried to impeach Truman , they got what they wanted out of the Supreme Court and then won the next elections .
Articles of impeachment have been filed against 10 presidents , usually by Republicans , and usually with electoral success following .
When the Republicans impeached Clinton , impeachment was actually unpopular with the public .
Even so , the Republicans lost far fewer seats than is the norm for a majority party at that point in its tenure .
Two years later , they lost seats in the Senate , which had acquitted , but maintained their strength in the House , with representatives who had led the impeachment charge winning big .
Parties that seek to impeach are not punished at the next election .
In fact , they frequently improve their position — as evidenced by the Democrats in 1974 , Republicans in 1952 , and all the way back to the Whigs of last century .
In every election back to 1842 where House members of an opposition party to a sitting president have — as a whole or a significant caucus within the party — proposed impeachment of the president , that opposition party retained or improved its position in the House at the following election .
There is no instance of voters responding to a significant impeachment effort by sweeping its advocates out of office .
In fact , history points in a different direction , suggesting that voters frequently reward parties for taking the Constitution and the rule of law seriously .
And we would n’t wait until the next election to reward members of Congress who put impeachment back in the Constitution .
The minute Pelosi or Conyers or Nadler opens the door to impeachment hearings , every activist organization in this country and around the world that works on behalf of peace or justice or the rule of law will flood them with flowers , donations , volunteers , and support .
And if Fox News says one word , we will shut it down .

AUSTIN , Texas —
The most massive black hole in the universe tips the cosmic scales at 18 billion times more massive than the sun , astronomers suggest today at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society .
Even though researchers suggested black holes up to this mass might exist in quasars , this is the first direct confirmation of such a behemoth .
The hefty gravity well is six times more massive than the previous record and is orbited by a smaller black hole , which allowed the measurement of the giant 's mass .
Black holes can't be seen , but astronomers detect them by noting how other objects are affected by the tremendous gravity created in tremendously small sphere of space .
The binary black hole system powers a quasar known as OJ 287 , which is located 3.5 billion light - years from us in the constellation Cancer .
The quasar — an overwhelming beacon of light associated with a developing galaxy — has been studied in greater detail than most quasars .
Quasars are thought to be powered by gas falling into giant black holes boasting millions or billions of solar masses .
Though smaller than the solar system , a quasar can outshine an entire galaxy .
This particular quasar has a regularly pulsing light signal with two major pulses every 12 years .
The first two pulses were observed in the year 1994 - 1995 , and the first one of the next set in 2005 .
The observations helped astronomers refine their computer models , predicting the next pulse would come on Sept. 13 , 2007 .
Mauri Valtonen of the Tuorla Observatory in Finland , who presented the study , says there is a simple physical explanation for the 12 - year pulsing .
" In addition to the primary back hole in the [ accretion ] disk , we have a secondary black hole that crosses the disk twice during the orbital period , " Valtonen said .
" And that 's what gives us the two pulses . "
An international network of astronomers operating telescopes across the globe took part in monitoring the quasar in September and October .
The largest telescopes involved were the German Calar Alto telescope and the Nordic optical telescope .
Sure enough , right on schedule OJ 287 sent out a light pulse on that date .
No other pulses of that kind showed up during September or October , indicating , the astronomers say , the binary black - hole model was correct .
The next pulse is due in January 2016 .
It is quite common to hear experts explain that the current tight oil markets are due to “ above - ground factors , ” and not a result of a global peaking in oil production .
In reality , geological peaking is driving the geopolitical events that constitute the most significant “ above - ground factors ” such as the chaos in Iraq and Nigeria , the nationalization in Venezuela and Bolivia , etc.
Geological peaking spawns positive feedback loops within the geopolitical system .
Critically , these loops are not separable from the geological events — they are part of the broader “ system ” of Peak Oil .
Existing peaking models are based on the logistic curves demonstrated by past peaking in individual fields or oil producing regions .
Global peaking is an entirely different phenomenon — the geology behind the logistic curves is the same , but global peaking will create far greater geopolitical side - effects , even in regions with stable or rising oil production .
As a result , these geopolitical side - effects of peaking global production will accelerate the rate of production decline , as well as increase the impact of that production decline by simultaneously increasing marginal demand pressures .
The result : the right side of the global oil production curve will not look like the left … whatever logistic curve is fit to the left side of the curve ( where historical production increased ) , actual declines in the future will be sharper than that curve would predict .
Here are five geopolitical processes , each a positive - feedback loop , and each an accelerant of declining oil production :
1. Return on Investment : Increased scarcity of energy , as well as increased prices , increase the return on investment for attacks that target energy infrastructure .
Whether the actor is an ideologically driven group ( al - Qa’ida ) , or a privateer ( youth gangs in the Niger Delta ) , the geologically - driven declines increase the ROI for attacks on energy , which will drive both decisions to act , as well as targeting decisions for that action .
This is a positive feedback - loop because attacks on energy infrastructure and supply drive up the price , which further increases the ROI for such attacks .
John Robb has calculated the Return on Investment for the most recent bombings of oil and natural gas pipelines in Mexico this September at as high as 1.4 million percent .
2. Mercantilism :
To avoid the dawning “ bidding cycles ” between crude oil price increases and demand destruction , Nation - States are increasingly returning to a mercantilist paradigm on energy .
This is the attitude of “ there is n’t enough of it to go around , and we ca n’t afford to pay the market price , so we need to lock up our own supply . ”
Whether it ’s the direction of a pipeline flow out of Central Asia , defending only specified sea lanes , or influencing an occupied nation ’s laws on Production Sharing Agreements , there are signs of a new energy mercantilism all around us .
This is a positive feedback - loop because , like an iterated “ prisoner ’s dilemma ” game , once one power adopts or intensifies a mercantilist attitude all others must follow suit or lose energy share .
It will act to accelerate oil production declines because mercantilism prevents the most economically efficient production of a resource , accelerating the underlying problem of diminishing marginal returns .
This issue of energy mercantilism has recently hit the headlines again with the intensification of the race by several nations to to lay claim to the Arctic with its uncertain but possibly vast oil and gas potential .
3. “ Export - Land ” Model : Jeffrey Brown ( westexas on The Oil Drum ) , has proposed a geopolitical feedback loop that he calls the export - land model ( most recently discussed in his Iron Triangle post ) .
In a regime of high or rising prices , a state ’s existing oil exports brings in great revenues , which trickles into the state ’s economy , and leads to increasing domestic oil consumption .
This is exactly what is happening in most oil exporting states .
The result , however , is that growth in domestic consumption reduces oil available for export .
In states , such as Mexico , where oil production is also in decline , the “ export - land ” model predicts that oil exports will decline much faster than oil production — and this is exactly what is happening , with the latest PEMEX report showing 5 % production decline year - on - year , but 11 % export decline .
4. Nationalism : Because our Westphalian system is fundamentally broken , the territories of nations and states are rarely contiguous .
As a result , it is often the case that a nation is cut out of the benefits from its host state ’s oil exports .
This will be especially apparent when the “ export - land ” effect reduces the total size of the pie to be divided .
As a result , nations or sectarian groups within states will increasingly agitate for a larger share of the pie .
We see this already within Iraq , Iran ( Khuzestan ) , Nigeria ( Delta State ) , Bolivia ( indigenous groups ) , even places not normally associated with oil production such as Nagaland in India .
This process will continue the spread and advancement of the tactics of infrastructure disruption , as well as desensitize energy firms to ever greater rents for the security of their facilities and personnel - - both of which will drive the next loop …
5. Privateering : Nationalist insurgencies and economies ruined by the downslide of the “ export - land ” effect will leave huge populations with no conventional economic prospects .
High oil prices , and the willingness to make high protection payments , will drive those people to become energy privateers .
We are seeing exactly this effect in Nigeria , where a substantial portion of the infrastructure disruption is no longer carried out by politically - motivated insurgents , but by profit - motivated gangs .
This is the ultimate positive feedback - loop : infrastructure disruption further degrades any remnants of a legitimate economy , increasing the incentive to engage in energy Privateering , and compensating for any diminishing marginal returns in Privateering caused by enhanced security or competition from other privateers .
We may see some or all of these effects in any given area , and are already seeing this in some trouble spots .
Some states , like Iraq , have been thrown into full - fledged “ Nationalism ” and “ Privateering ” - driven geopolitical disruption by the actions of an outside power — in this case , the US invasion was itself largely the byproduct of a shift towards energy mercantilism .
This is just one illustration of the synergistic interrelationship of these processes .
The big - picture effect of these geopolitical feedback - loops is this :
Peak
Oil theory takes the logistic curve decline of oil from individual fields and producing regions and extrapolates those effects to the world .
The result of that extrapolation is that world oil production will follow a geologically - driven logistic curve , and that it will peak and decline in a manner similar to individual fields or producing regions .
The decline of a logistic curve gradually tails of in a " long tail " of oil production .
The result is a phrase that has become virtual dogma : " Peak Oil is not the end of oil production , but rather the beginning of an inexorable decline in production . "
Geopolitical positive feedback - loops , however , do not act like logistic curves .
They are positive feedback loops that are both self - intensifying and intensified by geologically - driven declines in production .
While the geologically - dictated baseline in oil production decline may exhibit a long tail of ongoing production , geopolitical forces may abruptly chop off that tail .
Commercial oil production requires some threshold level of security , rule of law , etc. to operate at all .
Below that threshold , oil production does not gradually decline , but rather stops completely .
Will geopolitical forces , combined with geologically - driven decline , be sufficient to bring oil production to a total halt in the near - term , at least regionally ?
WASHINGTON / SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Google Inc on Monday unveiled plans for a new generation of wireless devices to operate on soon - to - be- vacant television airwaves , and sought to alleviate fears that this might interfere with TV broadcasts or wireless microphones .

In comments filed with the Federal Communications Commission , the Internet leader outlined plans for low - power devices that use local wireless airwaves to access the “ white space ” between television channels .
A Google executive called the plan “ Wi - Fi 2.0 or Wi-Fi on steroids . ”
“ The airwaves can provide huge economic and social gains if used more efficiently ... , ” Google said in the comments .
Rick Whitt , Google ’s Washington telecom and media counsel , said this class of Wi-Fi devices could eventually offer data transmission speeds of billions of bits per second -- far faster than the millions of bits per second available on most current broadband networks .
Consumers could watch movies on wireless devices and do other things that are currently difficult on slower networks .
The white - space airwaves could become available in February 2009 , when TV broadcasters switch from analog to digital signals .
Whitt said he expects devices using white - space spectrum could be available by the end of 2009 .
Shares of Google surged $ 27.36 , or 6.3 percent , to $ 460.91 amid a sharp rise in U.S. stock markets .
The Nasdaq composite index was up 3.3 percent .
Google sees the white - space spectrum as a natural place to operate a new class of phones and wireless devices based on Android , Google ’s software that a variety of major equipment makers plan to use to build Internet - ready phones .
The Silicon Valley company also said that , in general , it stands to benefit whenever consumers have easier access to the Internet .
Google ’s primary business is selling online ads as people perform Web searches .
The FCC filing comes less than two weeks after Bill Gates , co-founder of Google rival Microsoft Corp , urged the agency to free up the white - space spectrum so it could be used to expand access of wireless broadband .
Google and Microsoft are part of a coalition of technology companies that has been lobbying the FCC to allow unlicensed use of white - space spectrum .
The group also includes Dell Inc , Intel Corp , Hewlett - Packard Co and the north American unit of Philips Electronics .
The idea is opposed by U.S. broadcasters and makers of wireless microphones , who fear the devices would cause interference .
The FCC currently is testing equipment to see if the white - space spectrum can be used without interfering with television broadcasts .
In a compromise designed to mollify some interest groups opposed to expanding use of white - space spectrum , Google proposed a “ safe harbor ” on channels 36 - 38 of the freed - up analog TV spectrum for exclusive use by wireless microphones , along with medical telemetry and radio astronomy devices .
In effect , no white - space devices could use these channels .
Google said “ spectrum - sensing technologies ” could be used that would automatically check to see whether a channel was open before using it , thereby avoiding interference with other devices .
It said such technology is already being used by the U.S. military .
Google said the enhancements “ will eliminate any remaining legitimate concerns about the merits of using the white space for unlicensed personal / portable devices . ”
Google also said it would provide free technical assistance to other companies seeking to take advantage of white - space airwaves .
This would include having Google help to maintain “ open geo databases ” of local channels for use by any device certified to use the spectrum .
A proposal being studied by the FCC would create two categories of users for the airwaves : one for low - power , personal , portable devices , and a second group for fixed commercial operations .
57 - year - old Brit Susan Tollefsen was terrified because she found a large , solid mass in her abdomen .
She went to the doctor , fearing ovarian cancer , only to be told that she was seven months preggers .
" I was lying on the examination table thinking , ' I 'm going to die ' when the sonographer turned round to me and said ' Congratulation .
My initial reaction was to think , ' What a terrible way to tell me I 've got ovarian cancer . '
When he then said , ' You 're pregnant ' I was literally speechless , " Tollefsen told reporters .
She 's getting a Caesarean next week .
Here 's a picture of Susan with her boyfriend , Nick Mayer , who is a sprightly 46 .

The long and extraordinary political career of Fidel Castro is over - at least as far as the presidency is concerned .
But his enormous influence will live on .
His regular columns for Granma , the state newspaper - which he has continued to write throughout his illness - will continue .
Only the strapline will be altered : instead of the reflections of the commandante en jefe , now it will be plain old camarade Fidel .
For Cubans and international observers alike , they will still bear close reading .
There can be no replacement for Fidel .
Not simply because of his qualities as a leader , but because the historical circumstances will never be the same .
Castro has lived through everything from the Cuban revolution to the fall of the USSR , and decades of confrontation with the US .
The fact that he departs while alive will help to ensure a peaceful transition .
The Cuban people now accept that the country can still be run the same way by a different team .
For a year and a half they have been getting used to the idea , while Castro remained theoretically president but his brother , Raul , held the reins .
It was Fidel the mentor , as ever .
The most surprising thing that I found out about the man , in the hours we spent together compiling his memoirs , was how modest , human , discreet and respectful he was .
He has a tremendous moral and ethical sense .
He is a man of rigorous principles and sober existence .
He is also , I discovered , passionate about the environment .
He is neither the man the western media depict , nor the superman the Cuban media sometimes present .
He is a normal man , albeit one who is incredibly hard working .
He is also an exemplary strategist , one who has led a life of enduring resistance .
He contains a curious mixture of idealism and pragmatism : he dreams of a perfect society but knows that material conditions are very difficult to transform .
He leaves office confident that Cuba 's political system is stable .
His current preoccupation is n't so much socialism in his own country as the quality of life around the world , where too many children are illiterate , starving and suffering from diseases that could be cured .
And so he thinks his country must have good relations with all nations , whatever the regime or political orientation .
So now he is handing over to a team he has tested and trusts .
This will not lead to spectacular changes .
Most Cubans themselves - even those who criticise aspects of the regime - do not envisage or desire change : they do n't want to lose the advantages it has brought them , the free education right through university , the free universal healthcare , or the very fact of a safe , peaceful existence in a country where life is calm .
While Castro turns full - time columnist , the main task for his political heirs will be how to confront the one perpetual challenge of Cuban life : relations with the US .
We must wait to see if changes occur .
Raul Castro has twice publicly announced he is prepared to sit down for talks with Washington on the problems between the two countries .
But it is in the US itself that a more appreciable political shift may come , with the Democratic frontrunner Barack Obama having signalled his willingness to engage with America 's perceived enemies or adversaries , be it Iran , Venezuela or Cuba .
An immediate and radical change may be unlikely , but there is reason to hope that November 's election may at least alter the atmosphere after the Bush years - a presidency Castro regards as the most damaging to the whole planet of the 10 he has experienced .
The departure of Bush is likely to lead the US to a reappraisal of foreign policy : learning the disastrous lessons of Iraq and the Middle East , and returning the focus to Latin America .
The US will find a changed situation : for the first time , Cuba has genuine friends in government in Latin America , most prominently Venezuela , but also in Brazil , Argentina , Nicaragua and Bolivia , a host of governments who are not particularly pro-American .
It is in the US 's interests to redefine its relations with all of them : non-colonial , non-exploitative and based on respect .
Cuba , meanwhile , has developed closer relations with partner countries , as part of the EU - like ALBA economic and political organisation , and in agreements with the Mercosur trade area .
In the bigger international picture , Cuba is no longer such a unique case .
It is on this international plane , developing ever stronger ties with Latin America , where the most visible changes in Cuban politics are likely to come .
Its socialism will undoubtedly alter - but not in the manner of a China or Vietnam .
Cuba will continue to go its own way .
The new regime will initiate changes at the economic level , but there will be no Cuban perestroika - no opening up of politics , no multiparty elections .
Its authorities are convinced that socialism is the right choice , but that it must be forever improved .
And their preoccupation now , more than ever with the retirement of Castro , will be unity .
But everything in Cuba is related to the US : that is the one overarching aspect of political life which outsiders need to understand .
The retirement of Castro , long anticipated , means continuity .
But in the evolution of this small nation 's history , the election of Obama could be seismic .

Q. Can a hobby make you better at your job ?
A . Yes , because doing something you enjoy can help you think more creatively and give you confidence .
Ms. Kauffman said a hobby could even help prepare you for a difficult meeting , making you more sure of yourself and energetic .
“ Let ’s say you are passionate about opera .
Google your favorite opera piece and listen for five or six minutes , ” she said .
“ That positive emotion builds your cognitive and social skills .
If you follow your bliss for a little while , it really gives you a surge of energy . ”
Challenging and stimulating hobbies may inspire ideas that will help you at work — leading , for example , to a new approach to making presentations , solving problems or meeting a client ’s needs .
“ Any time you take a break from routine , you develop new ways of thinking , ” said Gail McMeekin , a psychotherapist and owner of Creative Success , a career coaching company in Boston and author of “ The Power of Positive Choices . ”
Ms. McMeekin said that by tapping into our creativity through hobbies , we make connections that lead to a flurry of insights and new ideas .
Q. Life is so busy .
How do you make time for a hobby ?
A . If you start thinking of your hobby as something that helps you professionally as well as personally , you wo n’t feel so guilty about making time for it .
Schedule an activity on your calendar at home and at work , said Andrea Kay , a career consultant in Cincinnati and author of “ Life ’s a Bitch and Then You Change Careers . ”
Ms. Kay ’s hobby is making whimsical papier - mâché creatures .
She usually dedicates time on the weekend for her art , but also suggested using time early in the morning or in the evening , after children are in bed .
“ A lot of people just spend their nights in front of the TV ; do your hobby instead , ” she said .
Another option : take a class , like painting or pottery , that forces you to make time for it .
Q. How can you tell if your hobby is something you should pursue professionally ?
A . The tipping point is reached when you are far more interested in your hobby than your job and when work feels like a waste of time , Ms. McMeekin said .
But take a long look before you leap .
“ You have to do some market research first and make sure you could earn a living doing your hobby .
You also take the risk that making your hobby your career will take all the fun out of it , ” she said .

Commissioners
This is important because many people have assumed that -- even if Zelikow and the Commissioners had conflicts of interest -- the staff would at least do a thorough and unbiased job in investigating what happened on 9/11 .
We now know this is not true .
purposely
every single person involved
Lehman himself is a textbook example of conflict of interest
.
In 1998 , 9/11 Commission executive director Zelikow published an article in Foreign Affairs , the journal of the Council on Foreign Relations , entitled Catastrophic Terrorism : Imagining the Transformative Event .
Some two years later , PNAC picked up the Zelikow language , saying that
the campaign to convince the public to allow expanded use of U.S. military force
around the world " is likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event -- like a new Pearl Harbor " .
Lehman was a member of PNAC , and a signatory to PNAC 's plea for " a new Pearl Harbor " .
See this video and this essay .
When taken with other facts undermining the Commission 's credibility ( and see this ) , Lehman 's revelation should completely destroy the idea that there has been any real investigation into 9/11 .
WHEN YOU READ something confusing , or work a crossword puzzle , or try to remember where you put your keys , what do you do with your body ?
Do you sit ?
Do you stand ?
Do you pace ?
Do you do anything with your hands ?
Do you move your eyes in a particular pattern ?
How you answer questions like these , it turns out , may determine how long it will take for you to decipher what you 're reading , solve your puzzle , or get your keys back .
The brain is often envisioned as something like a computer , and the body as its all - purpose tool .
But a growing body of new research suggests that something more collaborative is going on - that we think not just with our brains , but with our bodies .
A series of studies , the latest published in November , has shown that children can solve math problems better if they are told to use their hands while thinking .
Another recent study suggested that stage actors remember their lines better when they are moving .
And in one study published last year , subjects asked to move their eyes in a specific pattern while puzzling through a brainteaser were twice as likely to solve it .
The term most often used to describe this new model of mind is " embodied cognition , " and its champions believe it will open up entire new avenues for understanding - and enhancing - the abilities of the human mind .
Some educators see in it a new paradigm for teaching children , one that privileges movement and simulation over reading , writing , and reciting .
Specialists in rehabilitative medicine could potentially use the emerging findings to help patients recover lost skills after a stroke or other brain injury .
The greatest impact , however , has been in the field of neuroscience itself , where embodied cognition threatens age - old distinctions - not only between brain and body , but between perceiving and thinking , thinking and acting , even between reason and instinct - on which the traditional idea of the mind has been built .
" It 's a revolutionary idea , " says Shaun Gallagher , the director of the cognitive science program at the University of Central Florida .
" In the embodied view , if you 're going to explain cognition it 's not enough just to look inside the brain .
In any particular instance , what 's going on inside the brain in large part may depend on what 's going on in the body as a whole , and how that body is situated in its environment . "
Or , as the motto of the University of Wisconsin 's Laboratory of Embodied Cognition puts it , " Ago ergo cogito " : " I act , therefore I think . "
The emerging field builds on decades of research into human movement and gesture .
Much of the earlier work looked at the role of gestures in communication , asking whether gesture grew out of speech or exploring why people gestured when they were talking on the telephone .
But today , neuroscientists , linguists , and philosophers are making much bolder claims .
A few argue that human characteristics like empathy , or concepts like time and space , or even the deep structure of language and some of the most profound principles of mathematics , can ultimately be traced to the idiosyncrasies of the human body .
If we did n't walk upright , for example , or were n't warm - blooded , they argue , we might understand these concepts totally differently .
The experience of having a body , they argue , is intimately tied to our intelligence .
" If you want to teach a computer to play chess , or if you want to design a search engine , the old model is OK , " says Rolf Pfeifer , director of the artificial intelligence lab at the University of Zurich , " but if you 're interested in understanding real intelligence , you have to deal with the body . " . . .
Embodied cognition upends several centuries of thinking about thinking .
Rene Descartes , living in an age when steam engines were novelty items , envisioned the brain as a pump that moved " animating fluid " through the body - head - shrinkers through the ages have tended to enlist the high - tech of their day to describe the human cognitive system - but the mind , Descartes argued , was something else entirely , an incorporeal entity that interacted with the body through the pineal gland .
While a few thinkers , most notably the French philosopher Maurice Merleau - Ponty in the 1940s , challenged Descartes ' mind - body separation , it remained the dominant model up through the 20th century , though its form evolved with the times .
After the development of the modern computer in the years after World War II , a new version of the same model was adopted , with the brain as a computer and the mind as the software that ran on it .
In the 1980s , however , a group of scholars began to contest this approach .
Fueled in part by broad disappointment with artificial - intelligence research , they argued that human beings do n't really process information the way computers do , by manipulating abstract symbols using formal rules .
In 1995 , a major biological discovery brought even more enthusiasm to the field .
Scientists in Italy discovered " mirror neurons " that respond when we see someone else performing an action - or even when we hear an action described - as if we ourselves were performing the action .
By simultaneously playing a role in both acting and thinking , mirror neurons suggested that the two might not be so separate after all .
" You were seeing the same system , namely the motor system , playing a role in communication and cognition , " says Arthur Glenberg , a professor of psychology and head of the embodied cognition laboratory at Arizona State University .
This realization has driven much of the recent work looking at how moving and thinking inform and interfere with each other .
For example , a pair of studies published in 2006 by Sian Beilock , now an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Chicago , and Lauren Holt , one of her former students , examined how people who were good at certain physical activities thought about those activities .
In one study , Beilock and Holt had college hockey players , along with a non-hockey - player control group , read a sentence , sometimes hockey - related , sometimes not .
Then the subjects would be shown a picture and asked if it corresponded with the sentence .
Hockey players and non-hockey players alike almost invariably answered correctly , but on the hockey - related sentences the response times of the hockey players were significantly faster than the nonplayers .
In a second study , the researchers found similar results with football players .
According to Beilock , the difference in response time was n't a matter of knowledge - after all , all of the subjects in the study got the vast majority of the questions right .
What it suggested , Beilock argues , is that the athletes ' greater store of appropriate physical experiences served as a sort of mental shortcut .
" People with different types of motor experiences think in different ways , " she argues .
These sorts of results are n't simply limited to thinking about sports , or other highly physical activities .
A 2003 study by Michael Spivey , a psychology professor at Cornell , and his student Elizabeth Grant , found that people who were given a tricky spatial relations brainteaser exhibited a distinctive and unconscious pattern of eye movements just before they arrived at the answer .
The subjects seemed to unconsciously work through the problem by enacting possible solutions with their gaze .
A study published in August by Alejandro Lleras and Laura Thomas , two psychologists at the University of Illinois , built on those results by inducing the eye movements Spivey had discovered .
Lleras and Thomas found that doing so greatly improved the rate at which people solved the problem - even though most never figured out that the eye movements had anything to do with it .
" The subjects actually think that the eye - tracking task is very distracting , " Lleras says .
" They think we 're doing this to keep them from solving the problem . "
Other studies have looked at non-spatial problems and at memory .
Work led by Susan Goldin - Meadow , a psychology professor at the University of Chicago , has found that children given arithmetic problems that normally would be too difficult for them are more likely to get the right answer if they 're told to gesture while thinking .
And studies by Helga Noice , a psychologist at Elmhurst College , and her husband Tony Noice , an actor and director , found that actors have an easier time remembering lines their characters utter while gesturing , or simply moving .
The body , it appears , can subtly shape people 's preferences .
A study led by John Cacioppo , director of the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience at the University of Chicago , found that subjects ( all non-Chinese speakers ) shown a series of Chinese ideographs while either pushing down or pulling up on a table in front of them will say they prefer the ideographs they saw when pulling upward over the ones they saw while pushing downward .
Work by Beilock and Holt found that expert typists , when shown pairs of two - letter combinations and told to pick their favorite , tend to pick the pairs that are easier to type - without being able to explain why they did so .
A company called SolFocus ( which was spun out of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 2006 ) has started installation of a 3 - megawatt solar power plant in southern Spain .
SolFocus makes solar cells that use much less silicon than regular panels because they use lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight .
The solar concentrators magnify sunlight 500 times , which according to the company , is the “ sweet spot ” between higher energy production and excessive heat .
The blocks have two sets of mirrors : mirrors on bottom face reflect sunlight back to mirrors on the top face , and these in turn reflect the light on to one - millimeter - square photovoltaic cells popped into the center of the bottom mirrors .
Silicon - based solar panels today cost close to $ 3 per watt to produce .
Solfocus says that larger scale production of its concentrators ( in the area of gigawatts ) would cut the cost per watt to just 50 cents .
The second generation version of the device should cut costs further to as low as 32 cents per watt , according to the company .

Taking a single gene from the virus stops it replicating , US scientists wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal .
Ebola , currently handled in highly secure labs , kills up to 80 % of those it infects .
However , one expert said the new method may not yet be a fail - safe way of dealing with the virus .
We wanted to make biologically contained Ebola virus
Yoshihiro Kawaoka
University of Wisconsin at Madison
The need for a " biosecurity level 4 " ( BSL4 ) laboratory for any work involving Ebola means that very few research institutions are capable of doing this .
Researchers wear biosafety suits with their own air supply , and the air pressure in the room is less than the pressure outside , so any leak would mean air flowing inwards rather than outwards .
This makes anything more than small - scale study of the virus very difficult to arrange .
If Ebola could be kept in a viable form , yet with the risk of infection removed , then conventional labs might be able to study it .
The researchers , from the University of Wisconsin at Madison , say that they have found a " great system " to do this .
Key gene
They said that a single one of Ebola 's eight genes , called VP30 , is the key , as without it , the virus cannot replicate within host cells by itself .
EBOLA Initial symptoms include high fever , severe headache , muscle , joint , or abdominal pain , severe weakness and exhaustion , sore throat , and nausea
As the infection progresses more serious symptoms include diarrhoea , vomiting blood , organ damage , and internal bleeding
However , the scientists still want the virus to replicate in order to study it , so they developed monkey kidney cells which contained the protein needed .
Because the cell was providing the protein , and not the virus itself , it could only replicate within those cells , and even if transferred into a human , would be harmless .
In an effort to prove this , they used the monkey cells for dozens of " cycles " of infection and replication , without once encountering a form of the virus capable of making another creature ill .
" We wanted to make biologically contained Ebola virus , " said Yoshihiro Kawaoka .
" The altered virus does not grow in any normal cells .
This system can be used for drug screening and for vaccine production . "
Monkey tests
However , not everyone in Ebola research is convinced .
Professor Susan Fisher - Hoch , at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston , was among those at the forefront of Ebola study in the early 1980s , at the UK's BSL4 lab at Porton Down .
She said that she would need to see more proof that the modified virus could do no harm .
" I would n't be comfortable using it until it had been thoroughly tested and did not cause disease in live monkeys , at a high dose .
" There is no way you can prove that it is non -toxic unless this has been done . "
Steckl is an Ohio Eminent Scholar in UCs Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering .
He believed that if the electrons  mobility could be manipulated , then new properties could be revealed .
In considering materials to introduce to affect the movement of the electrons , Steckl evaluated the source of materials with an eye to supply , especially materials that do not harm the environment .
 Biological materials have many technologically important qualities  electronic , optical , structural , magnetic ,  says Steckl .
 But certain materials are hard for us to duplicate , such as DNA and proteins .
He also wanted a source that was widely available , would not have to be mined , and was not subject to any organization or countrys monopoly .

COLORADO SPRINGS , Colorado ( CNN ) --
" It seemed like it was me , the gunman , and God , " said Jeanne Assam , describing her feelings as she confronted a man who charged into her Colorado Springs church Sunday firing a weapon .
Assam , a church security guard with law enforcement experience , fired her own weapon at the invader and stopped his attack , police say .
Police on Monday identified the gunman as Matthew Murray and said he was also responsible for an attack earlier Sunday at a missionary center some 80 miles away .
The two incidents left four people dead , in addition to the gunman , and five wounded .
Police said forensic evidence showed a positive match between a handgun found at the church and shell casings found at the missionary center in Arvada , a suburb of Denver .
Officials from the Colorado Springs and Arvada police departments appeared at a joint news conference to brief reporters on what they had pieced together about Sunday 's events .
The first incident took place Sunday at about 12:30 a.m. at Youth With a Mission in Arvada .
Police said a man with a beard , wearing a dark jacket , glasses , and skullcap , entered the facility , got into a dispute with a staff member about whether he could stay there for the night , and then opened fire .
Two staff members , Tiffany Johnson , 26 , and Philip Crouse , 24 , died later Sunday from their injuries , Youth With a Mission co-founder Peter Warren said .
Two other staff members were injured , and one was in critical condition .
Investigators tried to track the gunman through fresh snow with the help of dogs , but lost his trail in a heavily walked area , Deputy Chief Gary Creager of Arvada police said .
About 12 hours later , police say , Murray showed up at New Life Church as a service was letting out .
Police said Monday he had an assault rifle and two handguns , and may have had as many as 1,000 rounds of ammunition .
He fired on a family who were in or near their car .
Two sisters , identified by police as Rachael Works , 16 , and Stephanie Works , 18 , were killed , and their father , David Works , 51 , was also shot and is hospitalized in fair condition with two gunshot wounds .
Murray then entered the church , police say , where Assam was one of several volunteer security guards on duty .
" I saw him coming through the doors , " she told reporters on Monday .
" I took cover , and I waited for him to get closer , and I came out of cover and identified myself , and engaged him , and took him down .
And that 's pretty much it . "
Watch Assam tell how she stopped Murray »
Police said they were still investigating whether Assam 's weapon killed Murray , or whether he might have died of a self - inflicted gunshot .
Assam extended her sympathy to the families of the victims " and of the gunman -- and I mean that very sincerely . "
Phil Abeyta , who identified himself as Murray 's uncle , appeared at another news conference and read a statement from the family asking for forgiveness .
" Our family cannot express the magnitude of our grief for the victims and families of this tragedy , " he said .
" On behalf of our family and our son , we ask for forgiveness .
We cannot understand why this has happened . "
Abeyta appeared with spokesmen from the Youth With A Mission center , who confirmed that Murray had been part of a training program five years ago .
Peter Warren , director of Youth With A Mission , said Murray did not go on the mission he was training for in 2002 because managers thought that " issues relating to his health made it unsafe for him to do so . "
But a man who served at the center with Murray told CNN Monday that Murray was kicked out of the mission program for strange behavior .

A source -- a long - time member of New Life Church -- said Murray had a falling out with Youth With A Mission after working with the organization a couple of years ago .
The source said Murray sent antagonistic and threatening correspondence afterward .
Earlier Monday , Boyd said the gunman was unknown to parishioners there .
" He simply showed up on our property yesterday with a gun , with the intention of hurting people , and he did , " Boyd said .
Boyd said the megachurch instituted security precautions after the shootings at the Denver area mission center .
Boyd said Assam was a hero in preventing further bloodshed , rushing to confront the gunman just inside the church .
" She probably saved over a hundred lives , " Boyd said .
Watch pastor tell how guard saved lives »
" I give the credit to God .
And I say that very humbly .
God was with me and the whole time I was behind cover -- this has got to be God , because of the firepower that [ the gunman ] had vs. what I had , " Assam said .
" I did not run away and I did n't think for a minute to run away , I just knew that I was given the assignment to end this before it got too much worse .
I just prayed for the Holy Spirit to guide me . "
She told reporters she had not slept since the shooting , " as I 'm sure you can tell . "
She said she was on the third day of a three - day regimen of fasting and prayer , wanting to know God 's will for what to do with her life , when the shooting took place .
" I was weak , and where I was weak , God made me strong , " she said .
" He filled me and he guided me and protected me and many other people .
And I 'm honored that God chose me . "
Assam was one of about a dozen volunteer security guards at the church , half of whom are armed , Boyd said .
The guards are licensed , trained and screened , and are church members , not " mercenaries , " he said .

The US government has weighed in on the constitutionality of the $ 222,000 damage award in Capitol v. Thomas with a brief filed yesterday .
The government suggests that the court avoid ruling on the constitutionality of the statutory damages clause of the Copyright Act .
Should the court feel the need to rule on the constitutionality , it should find that the damages award does not violate the Due Process Clause of the Constitution .
After a three - day trial , single mother Jammie Thomas was found to have willfully infringed on the record label 's copyrights .
The jury awarded the RIAA statutory damages of $ 9,250 per song , for a total of $ 222,000 , out of a maximum of $ 150,000 per track .
Thomas quickly vowed to appeal the verdict , and when her motion of remittur was filed the following week , she asked for a ruling that the damages handed down by the jury were unconstitutionally excessive .
The Copyright Act allows for statutory damages of $ 750 to $ 150,000 .
Thomas argued — as have other defendants — that since the labels make around 70 ¢ per song , even the $ 750 damage floor violates the Due Process Clause of the Constitution .
In its reply to Thomas ' motion , the RIAA argued that statutory damages need not have any relationship to actual damages .
Furthermore , the group said that she had no basis to challenge the constitutionality of the damages since she had not objected to the jury instructions .
The Department of Justice agrees .
" This Court may find that defendant has waived her challenge to Congress 's statutory damages provision by submitting ' jury instructions and approv[ing ] the verdict form that allowed the jury to consider the full range of statutory damages under the Copyright Act , " the DoJ argued in its brief .
The DoJ also says that Thomas ' motion ignores the fact that statutory damages are given in place of actual damages .
" Statutory damages compensate those wronged in areas in which actual damages are hard to quantify in addition to providing deterrence to those inclined to commit a public wrong , " argues the DoJ .
It 's also impossible for the true damages to be calculated , according to the brief , because it 's unknown how many other users accessed the files in the KaZaA share in question and committed further acts of copyright infringement .
That 's significant , because it shows that the DoJ is siding with the RIAA when it comes to the issue of whether making a file available for download on a P2P network constitutes distribution .
It was a contentious issue during the Thomas trial , with the jury instructions originally stating that making songs available is not the same as distribution .
The RIAA objected to that instruction , and in its final form , all the jury had to do was find that Thomas made the files available .
" [ G ] iven the findings of copyright infringement in this case , the damages awarded under the Copyright Act ’s statutory damages provision did not violate the Due Process Clause ; they were not ' so severe and oppressive as to be wholly disproportioned to the offense or obviously unreasonable , ' " concludes the DoJ .
Given that Capitol v. Thomas was the first file - sharing lawsuit to go to trial and the fact that statutory damages have become a significant issue in a number of P2P lawsuits , the judge 's decision in this case will be very closely watched .
LAS VEGAS  A man who stayed in a Las Vegas hotel room where ricin was discovered on Thursday has been hospitalized in critical condition since Feb. 14 with symptoms consistent with exposure to the deadly toxin , Las Vegas police said Friday .
The man ’s identity , age and hometown were being withheld on Friday as investigators tried to determine why ricin , as well as castor beans from which is it derived , were found in a room at an Extended Stay America hotel one mile west of the Las Vegas Strip .
Deputy Chief Kathleen
Suey said the man had been staying in the room where the ricin was found for an unknown length of time and was leasing the room when the substance was discovered .
A man , said to be a relative or friend of the sick man , had gone into the room to retrieve the patient ’s belongings when he found the vials of white powder and showed it to the hotel ’s manager , Deputy Chief Suey said .
Police were called by the hotel .
The man had been hospitalized on Feb. 14 with respiratory distress but did not indicate to doctors that he may have been exposed to ricin , so the health district and police were not notified of the prospect , she said .

Mr Taylor is accused of funding Sierra Leone 's former rebels Ex-Liberian President Charles Taylor ordered militias to eat the flesh of their enemies , a former death squad leader has told his war crimes trial .
Joseph " Zigzag " Marzah said Mr Taylor had instructed his fighters in Liberia to even eat UN peacekeepers to " set an example for the people to be afraid " .
Mr Taylor is on trial at The Hague for backing rebels in Sierra Leone in an 11 - year war in which thousands died .
He has denied the 11 charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
The trial at the UN - backed Special Court for Sierra Leone has been moved away from West Africa because of fears that it could lead to renewed instability in the region .
It began last June , but was adjourned until January after only one day when Mr Taylor dismissed his lawyer .
Many witnesses have since testified behind closed doors .
Cannibalism Mr Marzah , a key prosecution witness , agreed to appear in open court only after lengthy negotiations over the protection provided for him and his family .
He said we should eat them ...
Even the UN white people - he said we could use them as pork to eat
Joseph " Zigzag " Marzah Describing himself as Mr Taylor 's former chief of operations and commander of a death squad in Liberia and Sierra Leone , Mr Marzah said the former leader ordered militias to eat the flesh of enemies in Liberia , including African and UN peacekeepers .
" He said we should eat them .
Even the UN white people - he said we could use them as pork to eat , " Mr Marzah said , adding that it was to " set an example for the people to be afraid " .
He said repeatedly that nothing was done without an explicit order from Mr Taylor and that anyone who violated his commands would be executed .
Mr Taylor began an uprising against the government in 1989 Mr Marzah then recalled how the victims of the cannibalism were usually members of the Krahn tribe of Liberia 's former president , Samuel Doe , who was in power in 1989 when Mr Taylor started the country 's six - year civil war .
However , he said they had also included troops from the West African Ecomog peacekeeping force , which was deployed in 1990 , and some UN peacekeepers .
The international peacekeepers eventually helped stabilise Liberia , leading to a peace agreement in 1995 and a presidential election two years later that Mr Taylor won .
" We ate a few [ Ecomog soldiers ] , but not many .
But many were executed , about 68 , " Mr Marzah said .
' Throw away the head '
When asked by defence lawyer Courtenay Griffith about how the militiamen would " prepare a human being " for eating , Mr Marzah described the splitting , cleaning , decapitating and cooking of the corpse with salt and pepper .
" We slit your throat , butcher you ... throw away the head , take the flesh and put it in a pot ...
Charles Taylor knows that , " he added .
Mr Marzah also described how he had killed so many men , women and children that he had lost count , and also slit open the stomachs of pregnant women on Mr Taylor 's orders .
Earlier in his testimony , Mr Marzah told the court he had taken weapons , some stored at Mr Taylor 's presidential mansion , to Sierra Leone and returned to Liberia with diamonds which he then delivered to Mr Taylor .
Mr Taylor is accused of funding Sierra Leone 's former rebels , the Revolutionary United Front , by selling diamonds on their behalf and buying weapons for them .
The RUF became notorious for hacking off the hands and legs of civilians during their armed rebellion in Sierra Leone from 1991 to 2002 .

There are a few trends that are becoming apparent as I spend time at this year 's CES .
The expected trends are things like iPod docks being everywhere .
Less expected ?
Ultraportables are really big .
One of the most impressive examples of this new beast is the Fujitsu LifeBook U810 .
It 's tiny ; those of you who complained about the keyboard on the Eee PC are going to be feeling cramped .
In fact , the Lifebook is slightly smaller than the Eee PC .
I put the life - size paper mockup given out at the show on my Eee , and it's a surprisingly tiny design ; it did n't feel that much smaller in my hands .
Fujitsu claims its ultraportable runs Windows Vista ( and it seemed surprisingly zippy in my limited hands - on time with it ) , and is also available with Windows XP .
It sports an 800MHz Intel A110 CPU , 1GB of RAM , built - in support for AT&T's 3G network , and a 40 GB hard drive .
It also features a touch screen with built - in stylus .
There 's a thumbstick on the right side of the unit , with the left and right click on the left - hand side ; you hold it almost like a game controller .
With a screen that can be twisted and flipped backwards like a tablet PC , a built - in stylus for the touch - screen , and nice little touches like a thumbprint scanner and 0.3 megapixel webcam built in , this could be a good gadget for people who want their portable computing a little more robust than what the Eee is capable of .
The U810 will carry a $ 1,000 price tag and will ship in March .
PRODUCT developer Chris Hayes claims he ’s being “ shut out ” and “ bullied ” by hairstylist John Barrett .
Hayes says in a letter to friends that he spent two years developing the Elementage hair - care line with Barrett : “ John agreed that I was a partner in the business and that I would receive my equity once the product hit stores . ”
Hayes says that although he “ successfully launched the line and secured distributions , ” he ’s been told he ’s out of the partnership .
A source told us , “ John is trying to disparage Chris . ”
Hayes confirmed he sent the letter , and Barrett had no comment .
The Clinton campaign 's decision not to reject or denounce Geraldine Ferraro 's racial gaffe strikes me as a conscious and deliberate one .
The Obama campaign saw Samantha Power resign for a less offensive remark .
But Ferraro is now on the networks and airwaves amping up the volume , and Clinton , in classic passive - aggressive mode , is merely " disagreeing . "
Is n't this obviously about Pennsylvania ?
Is n't this classic Rove - Morris politics - to keep designating Obama a beneficiary of affirmative action and Clinton a victimized white woman in order to racially polarize a primary where Clinton needs white ethnic votes ?
Ferraro 's original gaffe was an accident .
The compounding of it is a strategy .
A reader comments :
I 'm willing to bet damn near anything Bill thought this up himself .
As a white male Bill realized he could n't push Obama into the ghetto box , but what a brilliant strategy !
- let 's have another " disadvantaged group " lambaste Obama through an elderly white female surrogate to divide and conquer in the victimology sweepstakes .
Since whites outnumber blacks , and white females in particular outnumber black voters , it 's an incredibly audacious gambit to win the nomination .
Throwing the kitchen sink apparently means turning the Democratic Party into an all out race versus gender war , ultimately allowing Bill and Hillary to either emerge on top or for Obama to be so badly damaged that the Superdelegates will fear he 's lost the white vote in the general election .
That 's exactly the game the Clinton 's have set in motion here .

Buster is counting down to the London Marathon on 13 April
Working plumber Buster Martin ran Sunday 's Roding Valley half marathon in Essex in five hours 13 minutes , and is now focusing on London 's 26 - mile event .
On finishing the run , the first words of the ex-member of rock band The Zimmers were : " Where 's my beer ? "
Mr Martin , who has 17 children , started work at Pimlico Plumbers in London three years ago because he was bored .
He drank a tankard of ale before signing autographs and chatting to fans near the finish line of the Essex race .
' A revelation '
Charlie Mullins , managing director of Pimlico Plumbers , said he was " amazed " when Mr Martin appeared at work on Monday morning after his exertions .
He said : " I was amazed and delighted , he turned up on time and set to work polishing the vans .
He 's a revelation . "
Mr Martin 's trainer is marathon enthusiast Harmander Singh , who helped Fauja Singh , 96 , break the London marathon record for the over -90s .
Buster , who lives in London , made headlines last year when he signed up as an agony uncle for men's magazine FHM , offering guidance to a younger generation .
He also found fame when The Zimmers , who had a combined age of more than 3,000 years , scored a hit single last year with a cover of The Who 's My Generation .
WASHINGTON , Sept 1 ( Reuters ) -
The government warned on Thursday that some U.S. refineries shut by Hurricane Katrina may not resume processing oil for several months and a consumer group said such market conditions justified gasoline at $ 3 a gallon .
" Some refineries likely ( will be ) able to restart their operations within the next 1 to 2 weeks , while others will likely be down for a more extended period , possibly several months , " the Energy Information Administration said .
The Energy Department 's analytical arm said nine major oil refineries in Louisiana and Mississippi remained shut from the hurricane .
Those refineries account for about 11 percent of total U.S. refining capacity .
" Unlike 2004 's Hurricane Ivan , which affected oil production facilities and had a lasting impact on crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico , it appears that Hurricane Katrina may have a more lasting impact on refinery production and the distribution system , " the EIA said in its most recent update on the effects of the hurricane on the energy sector .
With less production of gasoline , motor fuel prices have jumped around the country to near or above $ 3 a gallon , with pump prices in Atlanta topping $ 5 .
President George W. Bush earlier Thursday urged Americans to conserve gasoline while supplies are disrupted , and promised the government would go after oil companies that gouged consumers at the pump with high prices .
The Consumer Federation of America , which is normally a critic of Big Oil , said on Thursday that $ 3 gasoline was justified , given current market conditions .
The group pointed out that with many refineries shut , major pipelines not working and gasoline demand up as drivers top off their tanks due to fears of supply shortages , higher prices should be expected .
However , Mark Cooper , the group 's research director , said the U.S. oil industry is controlled by a few big companies and the supply - and - demand forces that set fuel prices " are not very consumer - friendly . "
He said some retailers were likely using the hurricane to gouge consumers at the pump , but such cases would be difficult to prove .
Two congressional committees will hold separate hearings next week on the jump in gasoline prices and the impact on oil refining capacity after the hurricane .
DUBAI ( Zawya Dow Jones ) -- A third undersea fibre optic cable running through the Suez to Sri Lanka was cut Friday , said a Flag official .

Life ’ll Kill Ya – Nick Hasted
( From the September 2002 issue of Uncut )
“ His last hit was in 1978 , " says a stagehand , out of earshot of the fading star .
“ He does n't put out , ” agrees another , sadly .
" But Zevon , you gotta listen to his lyrics , " demurs stagehand three .
" What is this , a cafeteria ? " asks the star 's guitarist , stage left .
If it ’s Sunda y , this must be Pittsburgh - the latest date on Warren Zevon 's last American tour of the Eighties .
The venue in this burnt - out steel town looks more like a school assembly hall than a cafeteria , with plastic chairs and zero atmosphere .
In a corner of its stage a man with a body that looks gutted , and a face pale with exhaustion , drinks Coke and plays " Moon River " .
This is the most hardboiled , harshly undervalued , hysterically funny songwriter in America , Warren Zevon .
Not many could have known , even then .
It was n't always that way .
The Zevon legend had already been written by 1989 , the year of my first of three testing encounters with him .
The songs were one part of that legend , " Werewolves Of London " ( 1978 ) the hit .
" Better stay away from him - he 'll rip your lungs out , Jim " Zevon hysterically warned , in a jaunty tune about lycanthropic mayhem intended as a homage to his hero and eventual friend , Hunter S. Thompson .
His other near - hits of the Seventies veered from lush ballads like " Accidentally Like a Martyr " - a hit for Linda Ronstadt - to lyrics of more desperate romance : " Desperadoes Under the Eaves " , " I'll Sleep When I 'm Dead " , " Lawyers , Guns And Money " .
Though he was recording in LA at the time of The Eagles and Fleetwood Mac , and such musicians were on his records , he was clearly a punk at heart .
" Excitable Boy " in particular , the title track from his 1978 LP , was the most guiltily funny US pop song till Eminem 20 years later , predicting his tone with its prom date from Hell : " ... he raped her and killed her , then he took her home / Excitable boy , they all said /
Well , he ’s just an excitable boy . ”
By the time our boy had dug his date 's body up and decorated the trees with her bones , you knew you 'd left the Hotel California .
When Zevon casually admitted in an interview that this psycho's memorable smearing of pot roast on his chest at dinner was something he'd done himself , you feared his own life might be as great an outrage on decent values .
And so it was .
Zevon was born in 1947 , the son of a Jewish pro gambler father and respectable Mormon mother .
He grew up in California and was acclaimed as a prodigy almost as soon as he could talk .
He knew Stravinsky in LA , but put his classical ambitions aside to try out as a Dylanesque folk singer in 1964 Greenwich Village .
When he failed , he returned to the fringes of LA 's pop scene .
Then in 1971 , the Everly Brothers made him their band - leader , and " the road , booze and I became an inseparable team " .
Seeming to want to live out Fear And Loathing
In Las Vegas , in 1974 he dropped acid with his girlfriend Crystal and , guzzling vodka all the way , drove through the night to marry in Reno .
The next year , they moved to Franco 's Spain - " Looking for trouble , " he told me in Pittsburgh , " where they still point machine - guns in your face . "
Back in LA , his friend Jackson Browne had convinced David Geffen to give Zevon a contract , and his most successful records , Warren Zevon ( 1976 ) and Excitable Boy ( 1978 ) followed .
But the booze had crept up on him , and made him a monster .
He played gigs he could n't remember , and woke in the night to count the bullets in his gun , fearful of what he might have done .
His wife got up once and found him shooting holes in the picture of himself on the sleeve of Excitable Boy .
It took a kindly visit by his Californian crime - writing idol Ross MacDonald to save his life .
He confessed all in Rolling Stone in 1981 , then took the piss out of celebrity confessionals on Sentimental Hygiene ( 1987 ) , with R.E.M. , Neil Young and Bob Dylan in his band .
But , somewhere in the mirk and mayhem , he had lost his audience .
When I took a Greyhound to Pittsburgh that weekend in 1989 , a 22 - year - old beginner looking for a story ( which would not be told , until now ) , Zevon 's final attempt on the mainstream was failing .
His expensive concept LP Transverse City , inspired by William Gibson 's cyberpunk novel Neuromancer and the alienation of mall culture , had had the plug pulled by Virgin before he could finish it , and would not trouble the charts .
When I met him in his hotel room , he looked worn and had a crippling headache .
But , in the wreckage of his career , he told me he was happy .
" When people say to me , ' Do n’t you wish you were more successful ? " ' he said in his sardonic , uniquely snappy Californian drawl .
“ I say , ‘ No . ’.
My comparison is with real people doing their jobs as best they can , they dorm t worry about how many people like it .
And I 'm very pleased to have this job .
At the time I was very young - under 10 , as early as I can remember - I had this sense that I would be an artist ... a fine artist , as opposed to a pop artist .
And as such I assumed that I would survive , and be content with that .
I did , and I am . "
Then we wound back to the bad , boozing days - how he got into them , and how he got out .
" I 'd come away from my youthful fascination with Norman Mailer and Hunter Thompson with the idea that the more one performed one 's work in one 's life , the more integrity the work had , " he recalled .
" Eventually I decided that maybe the more you needed to perform , the less you were creating , and the more you were just trying to stumble through a Salvador movie of your own experience .
I 'd become like a Time magazine profile of a real person , like a novel .
l realised all that matters in the end is , are you bad to people ?
Are you honest , or are you not ?
I guess you can be drunk and tend not to be dishonest , not be unkind - just be drunk .
But when I stopped behaving that way , I liked it like this .
Be most unfortunate if I had to tell you I did n't . "
Before we went outside to the .
show , I asked him about his songs .
It would be the first shot in a decade - long duel to make him admit they meant anything at all .
" Every song I write I try to make sound like the songs I like , " he deadpanned .
" The main purpose of ' Boom - Boom Mancini ' [ about the Eighties boxer who killed a man in the ring ] was to sound like ' Start Me Up ' .
Lyrics can be something morally adequate to sing for three minutes when I feel like it .
' Boom - Boom Mancini ' is about saying the guy 's name .
None of it 's very conscious , and there are no resolutions .
This is the material world , Nick , and there are no resolutions anywhere . "
MASSACHUSETTS , FEBRUARY 2000 : MANIAC COP
" I maybe old and I maybe bent / But I had the money till it all got spent ...
I had to stay in the underground / I was in the house when the house burned down . "
Warren Zevon - " I Was In The House When The House Burned Down "
Eleven years on , and we 're talking again .
Commercially , time 's only been cruel to Zevon .
Four more excellent albums - R.E.M.- backed covers LP Hindu Love Gods ( 1990 ) , Mr Bad Example ( 1991 ) , Learning To Flinch ( 1993 ) and Mutineer ( 1995 ) - all sold so poorly that he effectively retired .
He 'd been a spectral presence throughout the decade , present only when followers evoked his name .
" Things To Do In Denver When You 're Dead " ( from Mr Bad Example ) became uncredited inspiration for the movie ; Larry Sanders and David Letterman gave him gigs ; former wrestler Jesse " The Body " Ventura surreally invited him to sing " Lawyers , Guns And Money " at his inauguration as Governor of Minnesota .
But from this washed - up phase , almost accidentally , Zevon would compile the songs which eventually became 2000 's Life 'll Kill Ya , a snarling comeback about losing your fame , health and life , in roughly that order .
This time , I located him in a speeding car on a Massachusetts highway .
Speaking on his mobile phone , he was more reluctant than ever to explain himself .
So that inauguration , I enquired , was it odd ?
" Only because singing ' the shit has hit the fan ' to government inauguration reminds you that there 's some kind of strange progression in American politics .
The fact that I was wearing a suit and the governor was dressed like Jimi Hendrix was also bizarre - pleasantly so . "
Then I tried getting deeper into the work - this time for an album as deathly funny as Dylan 's Time Out Of Mind , worthy of endless discussion - and Zevon clammed up again .
It took a passing Massachusetts Highway Patrolman to revive him when , mid- interview , the cop pulled him over and pulled out all his old gonzo flare .
" Why are we stopping ? " he suddenly gasped to his driver .
" Were you speeding ?
They do n't want to know you 're with me !
What are you counting on , some kind of mercy ?
Yeah , sure , tell 'em , this is Warren Zevon .
He 's talking to the English press .
They 'll drag us out and beat us like crows !
What , are you going to start giving him promotional material now ?
We 'll be sodomised in prison before the sun goes down ! "
It did n't come to that .
The Highway Patrolman , it turned out , was a Zevon fan , that rare , secret breed .
But when I tried to resurrect the interview , Zevon had had time to plot his escape .
" I can't hear ya , Nick , " he wailed , " ca n't hear ya at all .
The phone 's buzzing horribly .
There are wires across the highway .
Horrible , horrible buzzing … ”
Click .
And he ’d gone again .
Take three , and things are n’t looking up .
Zevon and I are sitting down for the first time in 11 years .
It 's late afternoon , and we 've retired to a London hotel 's dark , empty bar , glinting with hundreds of varieties of his former liquid ruin .
He drinks coffee , but it does n’t seem to clear his head .
Our phone encounter had tickled him enough to want to try talking to me again , to really answer my questions this time , for Uncut .
But when the tape rolls , once more his head starts splitting , and words won’ t come .
One of the most articulate men in rock , something in Zevon ’s brain rebels at the whole concept of interviews .
Taking pity he at last explains what it is .
" I want to find the least obnoxious way I can of not participating in too much discussion of my work , " he admits .
" I believe that artists are essentially idiots whose ideas are painfully innocent , or dangerous .
I 'm not going to try to give anyone answers . "
So for our last 30 minutes together , I try the scattershot approach , going over Zevon ’s life one final time , trying to find what 's in the head of rock 's most hardboiled songwriter by sleight of hand .
It 's strained , awkward .
But , sliver by sliver , he lets his true thoughts on rock , art , excess and America slip out .
What , for instance , does he think of his hellraising days now ?
" In a lot of ways it was a lot of fun , " he confesses .
" And it was all interesting .
Even the agony .
It made me reckless , which is always good , if it does n’t kill ya .
And if it kills ya , it does n't hurt anybody - it 's just unfortunate for you .
Or so we assume . "
And is it really fair to blame the romantic self - destruction of his favourite writers - Mailer , Thompson , F Scott Fitzgerald - for a life that careered so close to the alcoholic edge ?
" Well , no .
Their real influence was that , when Mailer and Hunter wrote in their own voices , they were writing about an intensely experienced moment­to - moment existence .
That 's what art 's supposed to be about .
It 's not about how you should behave , or what you should vote for .
Artists are supposed to be people who are thunderstruck by the sheer awe of existence .
That 's all .
It 's like when me and Crystal went out to Spain - we went because it was exciting , it was cheap , we had experiences .
That 's how everyone thinks , is n’t it ?
Where am I going to have a good night that 's fun ?
When I 'm tired , I 'll sleep .
And if they don t think like that , it 's the artist 's job to remind them that life is short , but can be intensely sweet .
So you 'd better think of something to do tonight . "
What about when he started out , as that Greenwich Village folkie ?
What were his hopes ?
Did he want to change the world , like Dylan ?
" What appealed to me was bringing the resources and references I felt I had as an intellectual to pop .
And when I say intellectual , I do n’t mean anything good , I do n’t mean smart .
But I do know what I know , a vast , useless amount about 20th - century art , more than you could ever imagine .
And I wrote that way .
And I thought it might be interesting to people .
And someday , maybe it will be . "
Then he moved back to a Seventies LA scene that was an object of loathing in punk Britain .
Could he feel punk hitting from where he was ?
Could he understand why so many wanted to bring his friends and peers crashing to the ground ?
" No .
It 's all showbusiness to me .
And when you talk about showbusiness , to me there are only two things you can be - hypocritical or not hypocritical .
Is there a distinction between The Eagles and The Sex Pistols ?
Do the chaps in The Sex Pistols think they 're in showbusiness ?
I 'm sure they do .
I have faith they do .
They'd be the first to tell you .
They 're every bit as much showbusiness personalities as the Rat Pack . "
But many still consider rock 'n ' roll separate from showbiz , I say , because , once , it seemed like it could change the world .
Surely , in his near - four decades in American rock , he 's believed that too ?
" No . "
Not even when he first listened to Dylan ?
" No . Well ... "
For the first time in 11 years , he lets his defences drop .
" Maybe I 'm being a little hypocritical now .
I guess it depends on the social changes .
The issues that matter in America are racism , genderism and poverty .
Are my songs about those things ?
They might be about the things that produce those results in civilisation .
Like the endless human capacity to bullshit yourself .
I 'm better than them because I 'm this colour , I 'm better than them because I 'm an intellectual . "
He indicates the result .
" Bang , bang . "
2002 : My Ride ’s Here
When his new album My Ride 's Here - continuing Life ’lll Kill
Ya's dark revival , with more laughs - arrives this year , Zevon chooses not to pick up the phone and speak again .
Maybe he regretted his sudden candour .
Or maybe he decided he 's finally said enough .
A BRITISH woman who said she suffered cruel jibes from work colleagues because of her chronic flatulence has lost a discrimination claim .
The unnamed woman said she was taunted by colleagues at Leeds Metropolitan University because she suffered from severe irritable bowel syndrome and claimed disability and racial discrimination against the university , as well as constructive dismissal .
A Leeds employment tribunal was told one workmate said : " She opens the window because she sits there and stinks the place out - we should n't have to put up with it . "
She told the hearing colleagues would make sniffing noises and " bowel jokes " when she was within earshot .
The three - strong tribunal panel dismissed all three of her claims , the British Press Association reported .

Stupid Shit People ACTUALLY
Put On Their Resumes
10 Shittiest Books Ever Written .
Literally .
HISTORIANS have often noted that George Washington not only began but also did much to define the American presidency .
He imprinted on the office a sense of competence and integrity that can make later presidents , even successful ones , seem to fall short .
Then to top it off , he left the job voluntarily .
No law required him to step down , and running against him would have been impossible .
Retiring after two terms , Washington enabled the transfer of executive power by electoral process .
That crowning achievement also made George Washington our first lame - duck president .
Here again he set the standard , albeit one less celebrated by history .
His last year in office was , in his estimation , lame indeed .
He was just waiting for it all to be over .
Not that Washington was ever exactly chipper about being president .
He ’d fervently hoped to resign at the end of his first term .
By then , his hearing and memory had started to fail .
He complained of the burden of endless duty .
His cultural status as a demigod made it impossible for anyone to criticize him publicly , but he interpreted every attack on a subordinate as meant for him .
According to Thomas Jefferson , then secretary of state , Washington bitterly disbelieved the gushing reverence the press accorded him .
Yet feeling that he was needed to referee the battles between Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton , secretary of the Treasury , and to shore up national unity , he agreed to serve a second term .
Was the unofficial national anthem of the United States lifted from a couple different sources ?
Consider the following :
In 1906 a trio of Irish songwriters scored a minor vaudeville hit with the song " When Mose with his Nose Leads the Band . " 
An eighteen - year - old named Israel Baline probably heard the song because he worked as a singing waiter and needed to know all the hits , big and small .
One never knew what a table might request .
As Jody Rosen says in the liner notes from a recent re-release of " When Mose with his Nose Leads the Band "  ( Reboot Stereophonic ) : " A decade later , Baline had a new name , Irving Berlin , an exalted place among popular songwriters , and a habit of interpolating bits of half - remembered songs into his own numbers , "  which is exactly what he did when he wrote " God Bless America "  in 1918 .
As you 'll hear in the following two examples , the opening strains of the chorus from each song are identical , note for note .
" God Bless America "  [ excerpt ]
" When Mose with his Nose Leads the Band "  [ excerpt ]
As for Berlin 's lyrics , take a close look at this little excerpt from another song ( a very obscure song ) called " God Bless America "  written by Robert Montgomery Bird published over 80 years before Berlin's ( 1834 , to be exact ) :
God bless America !/ God bless the land , the land beloved
[ Compare that to Berlin's : God bless America ! / Land that I love " ¦ ]
Now , whether or not Berlin lifted part of the tune , or part of the lyric , it 's still an amazing song .
And , as I 've noted in this feature before , refusing to make money off his deep - seated patriotism , Berlin donated all the royalties from his version of " God Bless America "  to the Boy Scouts , Girl Scouts and Campfire Girls .
So it 's hard to nitpick .
But still , one can't help but wonder if part of the decision to do so was possibly / maybe / perhaps ( just perhaps ) due to the fact that he possibly / maybe / perhaps felt an eensey weensey pang of guilt ?
Eh ?
Eh ?
A soupÃ§on , maybe ?
What do you all think ?
I libri digitali , i cosiddetti e-books , non sono ancora molto diffusi tra la popolazione , forse perché mancano dei supporti ottimali per poterli leggere senza affaticare troppo la vista e probabilmente perché siamo ancora legati al vecchio libro cartaceo , ma potete star sicuri che da qui a pochi anni la loro diffusione sarà altissima .
Pensate che in un unico supporto ( palmare , portatile , libro digitale ) potranno essere immagazzinate intere biblioteche , con un risparmio di spazio incalcolabile .
I files che identificano i libri digitali sono generalmente in formato pdf , txt , lit , doc , html .
Già oggi si trovano sotto forma di e-book milioni di titoli in tutte le lingue e non è raro riuscire a trovare in rete anche quelli in cima alle classifiche dei libri più venduti ( come si fa a trovarli l'ho spiegato in questo articolo ) .
Ecco di seguito i migliori 10 siti web che ho trovato , nel quale sono presenti centinaia di libri gratuiti da scaricare in italiano :

An examination of meaning in language and meaning in action
Time Warner Inc. announced today the consolidation of its filmed entertainment businesses , Warner Bros. Entertainment and New Line Cinema .
The combination brings together New Line ’s 40 - year legacy as the world ’s most successful and innovative independent film studio with Warner Bros . ’ creative leadership and unparalleled scale and reach in global distribution and marketing .
As part of the consolidation , New Line will be operated as a unit of Warner Bros .
New Line will maintain separate development , production , marketing , distribution and business affairs operations , but will closely integrate and coordinate those functions with Warner Bros. to maximize film performance and operating efficiencies , achieve significant cost savings , and improve margins .
In making the announcement , Time Warner ’s President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes said : “ We are moving quickly to improve our business performance and financial returns .
New Line has built a strong franchise of cutting - edge entertainment .
We can enhance its value by combining it with Warner Bros .
Given the trend toward fewer movie releases , New Line and Warner Bros. will now have more complementary release slates , with New Line focusing on genres that have been its strength .
With the growing importance of international revenues , it makes sense for New Line to retain its international film rights and to exploit them through Warner Bros . ’ global distribution infrastructure .
We can also take better advantage of digital distribution platforms by combining our studios .
These changes will enhance our revenue opportunities and drive dramatic cost efficiencies and higher margins at New Line . ”
New Line ’s Co-Chairmen and Co-CEOs Robert Shaye and Michael Lynne have elected to leave the studio , but are in discussions about possible future business relationships with the company .
Mr. Bewkes said : “ Bob and Michael have a unique partnership that is noteworthy not only for its stability and longevity , but for its record of innovation and success .
They have guided New Line ’s growth from a privately held art film distributor to the world ’s leading independent film studio that is home to some of the most popular films in entertainment history , including ‘ The Lord of the Rings ’ trilogy , ‘ The Mask , ’ ‘ Austin Powers , ’ ‘ Blade , ’ ‘ Rush Hour , ’ ‘ Elf , ’ ‘ Wedding Crashers ’ and ‘ Hairspray . ’
We thank Bob and Michael for their enduring contributions to Time Warner and look forward to a continuing working relationship with them . ”
Mr. Shaye and Mr. Lynne said : “ New Line has been our respective life ’s work as well as our second family .
While we ’re sad to be leaving , we ’re enormously proud to have overseen its extraordinary growth and worked with so many dedicated and talented colleagues .
New Line represents innovation , creativity , and independent success .
We hope that the company can continue to be a leader in creating entertainment that resonates around the world .
We will now focus our efforts on exploring new entrepreneurial opportunities . ”

One guiding principle advocated by manygurus is " fat models , and skinny controllers " .
Rails controllers should only have enough code to mediate between models and views .
Thebelongs in the , not in controllers and views .
With the current state of support forin Rails 2.0 , controllers become quite similar , with seven basic actions ( index , get , create , update , destroy , new , and edit ) , which tend to have very similar implementations .
In Rails 2.0 pro-forma controllers can easily be generated using , say script / generate scaffold standard , which generates a RESTful chunk of code including a controller which looks like this :
Other than the specific names , all generated controllers look very much like this .
Using generated controllers is quite easy , and in many cases , little or no change needs to be made to the generated code , particularly if you take the " skinny controllers " mantra to heart .
On the other hand , another Ruby / Rails mantra is " do n't repeat yourself " , and having all that almost duplicate code , even if you did n't write it yourself , is a violation of the DRY principle .
Enter : resource_controller .
James
Golick offered up a new plugin for rails called resource_controller which allows the same controller shown above to be written as :
class StandardsController < ApplicationController
resource_controller
end
Well , there is a little bit of a white lie here , this wo n't give you the standard xml response capability , but that 's easy to get back with a few lines :
class StandardsController < ApplicationController
resource_controller
index.wants.xml { render :xml => @standards }
[ new , show ] . each do | action |
action.wants.xml { render :xml => @standard })
end
create.wants.xml { render :xml => @standard , : status => : created , :location => @standard }
[ update , destroy ] . each do | action |
action.wants.xml { head :ok }
end
[ create_fails , update_fails ] .
each do | action |
action.wants.xml { render :xml => @standard.errors , :status => :unprocessable_entity }
end
end
This plugin makes writing controllers look more like writing models , with declarative class methods like resource_controller , and " callbacks " like action .
wants .
The plugin automatically gives the controller the right instance variable for each action , in this case either @standards for the index action or @standard for the others .
There are some common patterns in Rails which force changing controller code .
One of these is nesting resources .
It 's easy to set up the routes in the config / routes.rb file
map.resources :organization , :has_many => : standards
But once you 've done this , you need to change the controller to fetch and use the parent resource and use it appropriately for each action .
The resource_controller plugin simplifies this .
After the above routing change all that 's needed is to add a declarative call to our controller
class StandardsController < ApplicationController
resource_controller
belongs_to :organization
end
The belongs_to declaration enables the controller to be used with the nested resource .
Now when a controller action is reached through a nested resource URL , like / organization / 1234 / standards , the controller will automatically create an instance variable named @organization and set it appropriately , and will use the standards association of the parent object to find , and build instances of the model Standard .
Note that the same controller also works if the URL is not nested , so we can have another mapping in routes.rb which allows access to standards outside of an organization :
map.resources : standard
map.resources :organization , : has_many : standards
And the resource controller will automatically work in either context .
The plugin also handles namespaced controllers , polymorphic nested resources ( similar and related to polymorphic associations in ActiveRecord ) and other magic .
You also get URL and path helper functions which work in the context of the URL in the request .
Resource_controller looks like a useful plugin , and it will no doubt get even better as it matures .
The details are on James Golicks blog .
There 's also a rapid - fire screencast by Fabio Akita , which really shows what the plugin can do in action .
SPIEGEL ONLINE Interview with Jyllands - Posten Editor ' I Don't Fear for My Life '
Authorities in Denmark have foiled what came close to becoming the first assassination of one of the cartoonists behind the 2006 Muhammad caricature scandal .
SPIEGEL ONLINE spoke to Flemming Rose , the editor responsible for commissioning the caricatures in Jyllands - Posten , who has also been the subject of death threats .
The Geek Squad 's ongoing porn problem / Bloggers catch the tech service pilfering porn and it turns into a local PR disaster , while Violet Blue wonders ' Is nothing sacred ? '
If you took your car in to have that mysterious noise diagnosed and fixed , would you expect the mechanics to rifle through your glove box and make copies of your Penthouse ?
Perhaps the more paranoid among us would make sure there was nothing naughty in our car before we brought it in for service — but what if we 're talking about the repair people we give access to our personal computers , or to our homes ?
As I reported back in December , members of the Geek Squad ( possibly the best - known corporate computer repair service in the nation ) got caught not only stealing porn off customers ' hard drives ( thanks to a three - month sting operation conducted by the Consumerist blog ) , but openly shared the porn with other Geek Squad employees .
One such hard drive belonged to adult performer Jasmine Grey , whose elaborate victimization was only discovered when she died in a car crash and a guilt - racked Best Buy employee ' fessed up to the porn harvesting , divulging details in a confession to the Consumerist .
Earlier this month , Geek Squad employees in Palm Beach discovered porn on a customers ' hard drive and handed the evidence over to the police , resulting in the arrest of a man for possession of child pornography ( the second such Geek Squad instance within a month — another man in West Palm Beach was arrested for 76 counts of " possessing a photograph of sexual performance by a child . "
No public statements have been made from the Geek Squad 's PR department about the porn theft exposed by Consumerist , their exploitation of Jasmine Grey , or the Geek Squad 's practice of examining their customers ' files during the process of equipment repair .
That is , until the Customer Service is the New Marketing summit and conference here in San Francisco two weeks ago .
The Geek Squad came with a team who hovered on a balcony over the conference while Geek Squad founder Robert Stephens took the stage for his talk , entitled " Marketing is a Tax You Pay for Being Unremarkable . "
Little did he realize that while he was onstage , there were full - on back - channel conversations on various social networking instant message sites about Geek Squad 's nonconsensual " customer service . "
So when it came time for Q & A , local blogger , respected social community management expert , professional social media insights consultant , Engadget columnist , and community manager for Pownce Ariel Waldman spoke up .
Rather than drop off Stephens at Kink.com for a lesson in respect at the ( feminist - identified ) boot heels of Princess Donna , Waldman asked Stephens for a statement in front of his peers , asking what kind of outreach the Geek Squad plans on doing to make their customers feel safe from exploitation like this in the future .
You can watch their exchange here at the 46:10 mark ( the session was recorded by local GETV vlogger Eddie Codel ) .
You can also see Waldman 's take on his response to her question here :
" Robert 's response immediately jumped into a cringe - worthy response , by saying first and foremost that bloggers are not journalists and do n't ever hold themselves to the same standards as journalists .
He then called out Ben Popken from Consumerist for asking for his response to these issues , but having already published the story .
He said if bloggers publish the story first without waiting for his response that it's not a 2 - way conversation and he just wo n't respond to it at all .
He said bloggers will need to someday need to hold themselves to journalist standards because they have far too much competition to not to .
So , he did n't answer AT ALL about things they 're trying to do to make people or their customers feel better about these issues .
He was defensive about the question , instead of being sensitive to the issue , which was disappointing .
If you 're for enabling conversation within your company , you should be for enabling positive conversation online as well , instead of writing it off as bloggers only being a form of disrespectful trolls . "
Personally , my reaction would have been to get on the Ocean with Princess Donna for an emergency takedown , followed by a trip to the Armory for some serious blogosphere discipline and knee - pad - needed lessons in sexual privacy .
Followed by a dog- collar - and - leash march over to the Electronic Frontier Foundation for more sexual identity and privacy deprogramming .
According to Consumerist in the breakout post " Geek Squad Hatched Plot To Harvest Porn From Pornstar Jasmine Grey 's Hard Drive , Days Before She Died In Car Crash , " it was n't an isolated employee ( or ' one luggage handler , ' as Stephens might say ) :
An entire team passed Jasmine Grey 's pictures around .
The Geek Squad whistle - blower told Consumerist :
" I left for the day and came back the next day to find that one of our fellow employees had copied all of the files to a few DVD's and shared them with management , as well as most of the other techs .
Her webcam was still locking up her machine when she took her computer home that night , so she returned again in the morning .
She still would n't provide us with her site ( not that we needed it anyway at that point ) , but she did want to look into purchasing a new machine .
At this point I handed her off to a PCHO rep who proceeded to convince her that instead of buying a new machine ... she should just have an Agent come out to fix it at her house ( that way she ' could rest easy that her privacy would be assured ' ) .
The manager on duty at the time was involved in the scam , so he offered to send an Agent out for free to ' go the extra mile and insure she only shop at Best Buy in the future . '
Of course , the Agent that came out to her house was none other than the same person who copied all her files to DVD .
He fixed the webcam in a few minutes then spent the entire remainder of the appointment scouring her network for more porn , which he saved to a portable hard drive .
Those files were then shared across the store . "
Stephens ' response would suggest that since mainstream media failed to cover any of this scandal , violation of sexual privacy — which seems to be an ongoing practice for both evil and good results — does n't even merit a response .
Actually it deserves more than a response .
Just because it 's sex does n't mean people 's privacy can be violated or degraded for sport and without accountability .
Just because we need to have some tech help does n't mean we should be worried that our entire private lives — especially the sex parts — are going to get passed around for company amusement .
Nor should we have to worry about what else the Geek Squad might do with the contents of our computers , whether it 's laughing at my sex toy collection photos or turning my laptop over to a federal government agency because they interpret my last Survival Research Labs art show photos as " terrorist activity . "
Porn is a sex toy ; it 's generally really lame and disappointing , but adult use of visual stimulation for personal erotic enjoyment is no less shameful than any other form of sexual expression , enjoyment or sexual self - reliance .
Corporations need to send a message that they do not believe that sex is such an embarrassment that the mere mention of " sex " or " porn " automatically gives a free pass to their employees to steal from , degrade , exploit or humiliate a person daring to exhibit sexual interest .
Good thing we have blogs to expose sexual douchebaggery — and to tell us how to make our computers catch people stealing our porn .
And stealing porn off computers when there 's a whole Internet ?
Is nothing sacred !?
Like , duh .
I am so calling Princess Donna right now .

Now even though I 'm old and fairly roughed up by father time I know when to let my other head , whom I call Dick , take over and do the talking .
Dick replied sheepishly to this inquiry with a " why no I do n't , how did you know ?
" To which this stranger said to me , " because your ear hairs look like cat tufts . " and she reached over and gave them a tug and a stroke .
At this point I said to Dick , if you ask her a single question using the word ' pussy ' in it you will blow this one right out of the water so be careful my friend .
Smooth is the key here .
Dick , having been around the block a few times over the last 50 + years agreed and did the only thing he could do that would cinch the deal .
He purred .
Well that was the ticket my friends .
The next thing I knew I was being tossed around on her bed like a mid day salad .
The funny thing is , my ear hairs never got trimmed .
FORT BRAGG , N.C. , Sept. 17  From his position about 100 yards away , Master Sgt. Troy Anderson had a clear shot at the Afghan man standing outside a residential compound in a village near the Pakistan border last October .
When Capt .
Dave Staffel , the Special Forces officer in charge , gave the order to shoot , Sergeant Anderson fired a bullet into the man ’s head , killing him .
In June , Captain Staffel and Sergeant Anderson were charged with premeditated murder .
On Tuesday , in a rare public examination of the rules that govern the actions of Special Operations troops in Afghanistan , a military hearing will convene at Fort Bragg to weigh the evidence against the two men , both Green Berets .
The case revolves around differing interpretations of the kind of force that the Special Forces team that hunted and killed the man , Nawab Buntangyar , were allowed to use once they found him , apparently unarmed .
To the Special Forces soldiers and their 12 - man detachment , the shooting , near the village of Ster Kalay , was a textbook example of a classified mission completed in accordance with the American rules of engagement .
They said those rules allowed the killing of Mr. Buntangyar , whom the American Special Operations Command here has called an “ enemy combatant . ”
Collins : Stealing Ohio 2004 – The Case Heats Up
Stealing Ohio 2004 – The Case Heats Up
Ohio citizen sending a message right after 2004 election Image
" Letters from the Edge " Part 2
Michael Collins
" Scoop " Independent News
Washington , DC ( Part 1 )
April , 2007 .
Columbus , Ohio. 56 of 88 Ohio counties defied a federal court order and failed to return some or all of the 2004 presidential ballots that they were ordered to retain indefinitely .
Over 1.5 million ballots were destroyed or lost , key evidence for major federal law suit charging election fraud and voter suppression in the 2004 presidential contest .
For example : " fraudulent votes … cast for George W. Bush ; inflating of vote tabulations in areas that tended to vote for George Bush . "
What impact will the massive destruction of evidence by Ohio counties have on the federal case charging criminal election fraud in the 2004 presidential election ?
Some , but the case is still viable .
Devastating findings by researchers for the plaintiffs are reviewed and a motive the destruction is provided .
But first here are two more outstanding " Letters from the Edge " courtesy of Ohio elections officials trying to explain the mishandling and destruction of evidence .
Chaos and Outright Defiance after Losing and Destroying Evidence
Montgomery County Ohio was the scene of numerous election problems in 2004 .
The home of Dayton , this county was positively defiant when it reported deliberate destruction of all 2004 ballots .
Why ?
Election records were requested by the Secretary of State on April 9 , 2007 .
Elections director Steven Harsman took until May 15 , 2007 to produce this letter ( Page 172 )
" … we contacted our county prosecutor for further authorization .
In addition , we experienced an extra ordinary situation having 4 elections during a 90 day period .
We literally ran out of space to prepare , stage , and retain material for those elections .
It was imperative we process the 2004 materials for destruction under the guidelines of the 22 month retention .
Therefore , all materials were properly destroyed in a timely manner and we are unable to comply due to those circumstances .
We did not receive formal notice from the courts prior to preparing the certificate of destruction . "
How often does a county executives contact the DA to get approval for shredding ?
A prosperous county with a $ 750 million budget and an " A1 " Moody 's credit rating could n't rent some storage space for vital records ?
Harsman should have used Google to find storage in Dayton .
Why is space even an issue if Montgomery was in full compliance with the law , as Haisman and the DA say they were ?
But the last sentence takes the prize .
The county did n't get " formal notice " before " preparing the certificate of destruction . "
The county was sent a fax from plaintiff 's attorney Arnebeck 's office eight days before the destruction certificate .
It contained the federal court order and a clear explanation .
Was n't this formal enough ?
Montgomery County did a lot of shredding and it was deliberate .
Along with the rest of Ohio , Cuyahoga County ( Cleveland ) was under court order to retain all 1.1 million records from the 2004 presidential election .
Newly appointed acting elections director Jane Platten walked into a mess left by her predecessors .
Platten complied within just days of the April 9 , 2007 request for ballots and other records .
It was hard to tell if the April 17 shipment contained only the 700,000 voted ballots or if it included Cuyahoga 's 1.1 million ballots of all types ( voted , unvoted , provisional , and soiled ) .
Then the county sent a second shipment after a revealing discovery .
This is a detail from the May 1 , 2007 form that accompanied the second shipment of ballots from Cuyahoga County .
It reported that the vital unvoted ballot evidence was " found hidden " in a warehouse ( line 4 ) .
( Page 58 )
On May 1st , Platten sent 400,000 additional unvoted ballots to the state capitol following the instructions in the federal court order .
These ballots are critical evidence to determine if unvoted ballots were marked and substituted for voted ballots .
These " ballots had been found hidden in Cuyahoga 's Canal Street warehouse , " she wrote .
She goes on , " It was thought that they were delivered on April 17th . "
Why was hidden crossed out ?
Why was it there in the first place ?
Were the ballots " hidden " evidence that Ms. Platten " found " because she had to look ?
If so , why had n't her predecessor 's secured this notable amount of evidence ?
In the past , the county stalled those requesting the legal right to review unvoted ballots .
Patten 's predecessor , Michael Vu , " resigned " in controversy during February , 2007 .
Bob Bennett chairman of the county board of elections was asked to resign by the new Secretary of State a few weeks later .
In 2004 , he was both chairman of the elections board and head of state Republican Party .
Bennett is a named defendant in the suit charging election fraud .
Maybe one or both of them can explain why these ballots were hidden .
They 'll Get Away with It Right ?
Wrong , at least not if the law is enforced .
The destruction of evidence , while not currently pursued at the state level , has a remedy in the federal court system .
It 's called contempt of court .
In addition , the federal district judge , Algenon Marbley , can refer the case to a federal prosecutor .
But there 's no reason to give up on the most significant election fraud trial in modern history : King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association ( KLBNA ) v. Blackwell et al .
Among others , the suit charges the following individuals with election fraud and voter suppression in the following capacities during the 2004 election : Kenneth Blackwell , Secretary of State and Ohio Bush campaign chairman ; Bob Bennett , both a senior state Republican party official and also chairman of the Cuyahoga County board of elections ; and a technician from Election Systems and Software ( ES&S ) .
The case was filed on behalf of Ohio citizens by trial attorney for plaintiffs Clifford O. Arnebeck and Henry W. Eckhart , with Robert J. Fitrakis of counsel .
The original and amended complaints were filed in federal district court , on August 31 and October 9 , 2006 respectively .
It continues in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ( Case 2:06 - cv-00745-ALM - TPK ) .
These are highly significant election fraud and voter suppression charges .
We 're dealing with the election fraud and voter suppression that enabled the theft of the 2004 United States presidential election .
Specifically , the defendants :
have conspired to deprive Plaintiffs of their right to vote … by undermining the bipartisan supervision of elections prescribed by Ohio law and avoiding any election audit so as to permit the following : fraudulent votes to be cast for George W. Bush ( “ Bush ” ) ( “ election fraud ” ) ; the double - counting of absentee ballots ( “ vote dilution ” ) ; the suppression and / or spoiling of votes in areas that tended to vote for John Kerry ( “ Kerry ” ) and the inflating of vote tabulations in areas that tended to vote for George Bush ( “ vote suppression ” ) ; the failing to follow Ohio ’s law for the proper recount of votes ( “ recount fraud ” ) ; and other violations of federal and state laws .
KLBNA v Blackwell et al .
There are at least two factors that should allow this case to move forward .
First , there 's a legal doctrine called " spoliation . "
Defendants are denied a reward for destroying evidence that may point to their guilt or culpability in a pending law suit , either announced or anticipated .
The destruction of evidence can be taken as a sign of guilt .
Second , much of the evidence has been documented through the meticulous research of Richard Hayes Phillips , PhD .
Proving Election Fraud with Hard Evidence : The Declaration of Richard Hayes Phillips and the Federal Law Suit
Phillips has an intense involvement in documenting and analyzing election fraud with over 40 articles on the subject .
He visited 9,343 of Ohio's 11,323 precincts conducting research for this case .
The Declaration of Richard Hayes Phillips was the opening document filed in federal court .
It is a powerful narrative of election fraud and voter suppression .
( Summary of the declaration evidence )
When Phillips visited Deleware County to examine ballots and other evidence ( his right under Ohio law ) , election officials must have been terribly upset .
They called the police five times and the county prosecutor twice seeking to stop the legal request for ballot review .
Why ?
Hamilton County shredded all of its unvoted and soiled ballots making it difficult to determine if any of those unvoted ballots were marked and substituted for voted ballots .
Then there 's the practice of the illegal pre-punching ballots and the impact on election results in Cincinnati .
The county offered an incomprehensible excuse which included " inadvertent " ballot shredding .
" Inadvertent ? "
Clermont County lost all of its unvoted ballots , every single one .
Were any of those unvoted ballots marked and substituted for voted ballots ?
We may never know that or why Phillips found absentee ballots stuck under phone books ; or why the county failed to segregate voted spoiled and unused ballots as required by law ; or why Phillips ' repeated requests to examine unused ballots were turned down .
What else should we know about Clermont County ?
Phillip 's analysis uncovered the fact that Miami County 's ballot count was off in each and every one of its 82 precincts .
A return of soiled ballots might have helped sort this out but they were destroyed .
Why ?
Three counties , Stark , Summit , and Warren , failed to return any unvoted ballots making it difficult to determine if unvoted ballots were marked and substituted for voted ballots .
Stark and Warren said it was standard procedure to destroy unvoted ballots 60 days after an election .
Summit did n't bother to offer an explanation .
Trumbull County claimed to have returned all of its ballots .
This contradicts a report that Phillips received during his field work indicating that Trumbull 's unused ballots were destroyed .
Who would you believe ?
Montgomery County failed to return one single ballot from 2004 , including more than 290,000 voted ballots from 2004 .
That was most unfortunate since Montgomery County was responsible for a disproportionate number of the 1.5 million destroyed or lost ballots .
Phillips documented reports that technicians from voting equipment vendor ES&S visited county election divisions , in some cases programming vote tabulators .
ES&S technician Sam Hogsett is a named defendant in the federal law suit .
He stands accused ( p. 21 ) of " adjusting computer software in tabulators and by other means to officially count more votes for Bush in predominantly Republican suburban and rural counties than were in fact cast for Bush in those counties in the 2004 general election in Ohio . "
The Free Press reported Secretary of State Blackwell dispatched Hogsett by name to help with the 2004 Fairfield County recount .
Why ?
A critical theme that runs throughout the evidence gathered is the attack on minority citizens , specifically those who chose to vote .
Successful suppression of the Democratic vote requires a concerted attack on the voting rights black citizens .
The evidence gathered and documented lends credence to the immoral and unconstitutional practice in Ohio .
Of the 11 counties in the Phillip 's declaration , 10 reported that some or all destroyed or lost Election Day 2004 ballots .
Not one of these counties indicated any regret for the loss .
Not one of them took any responsibility for failure to obey the law on secure storage of election materials .
And several either lost or destroyed ballot evidence while Phillips was conducting his research .
Why ?
Due to the evidence gathered by Phillips and associates , the amended filing for KLBNA v. Blackwell et al documents even more instances of election fraud and voter suppression .
Of 27 counties where election fraud and voter suppression took place according to the suit , 19 failed to return all or some of the ballots and other evidence that they were ordered to produce .
Why ?
( See summary of the KLBNA v. Blackwell et al evidence )
Maybe this was just a series of coincidences .
It happens all the time .
Right ?
Defendants routinely destroy evidence while they wait for trial .
There 's nothing to see here .
Move along .
What were they hiding and why ?
The destroyed and lost ballots , hidden forever , were key elements in the KLBNA v Blackwell suit claiming election fraud in Ohio
The specific evidence examined by Phillips was presented in September , 2006 .
It was a road map to the case that seeks to prove criminal acts of election fraud and voter suppression .
It was also a road map of another sort , one that offered the path to undermine charges and potentially end the case in a definitive and final way .
Given all this , what 's one logical response if you 're guilty ?
Destroy the specific evidence supporting Phillips ' claims and more .
Destroy , lose , and hide as much evidence as possible , let 's say about 1.5 million pieces of ballot evidence .
They 'll never prove anything without the ballots .
We 'll cry ' sour grapes , ' ' sore loser , ' and our favorite , ' conspiracy theory . '
The media wo n't even carry the story .
Yet the case proceeds in federal court .
Despite the destroyed evidence , there are still extensive records of voting patterns and election practices that denied Kerry supporters their right to vote and have their vote counted .
There remains the meticulous record in the form of data , analyses , photographs and video tapes .
The people of Ohio and the United States demand a rational process to examine our flawed election system .
It 's time for the truth about Ohio's 2004 presidential election .
No subsequent election can have meaning and legitimacy without that truth .

Clinton loaned her campaign $ 5 million
Senator Hillary Clinton confirmed at a press conference in Virginia this afternoon that she 'd loaned her campaign $ 5 million , and said , " The results last night proved the wisdom of my investment . . "
Spokesman Howard Wolfson emailed with the news minutes earlier :
Late last month Senator Clinton loaned her campaign $ 5 million .
The loan illustrates Sen .
Clinton ’s commitment to this effort and to ensuring that our campaign has the resources it needs to compete and win across this nation .
We have had one of our best fundraising efforts ever on the web stoday and our Super Tuesday victories will only help in bringing more support for her candidacy .
As I reported earlier , she 's drawing on a pool of personal wealth estimated to be as much as $ 41 million , as well as a reported payout to Bill Clinton of $ 20 million from the Los Angeles billionaire manager Ron Burkle .
Clinton told reporters that her fundraising was healthy , but that " my opponent was able to raise more money , and we intended to be competitive , and we were . "
Clinton also emailed supporters today with an ambitious online fundraising goal : to , over the course of three days , " raise $ 3 million to fund our history - making campaign . "
Scotland Yard allowed a suspected war criminal to escape Britain because officers feared an attempt to stop him would lead to a gun battle at Heathrow airport , police documents seen by the Guardian reveal .
The former senior Israeli officer was supposed to be detained as he arrived in London for a speaking engagement after a British court had ordered his arrest .
But detectives watched on as he landed and hid on the plane for two hours , before flying off to escape justice .
In the documents , counter - terrorism police say they did not try to board the Israeli civilian jet partly because they feared armed guards on the plane would open fire on British officers .
A UK court had issued a secret arrest warrant for Major General Doron Almog over alleged war crimes under the Geneva conventions of ordering the demolition of 59 civilian Palestinian homes .
Israeli diplomats were tipped off after Almog 's plane left Israel on September 11 2005 .
Once it landed in London , a military attaché from the Israeli embassy boarded the jet and warned Almog to stay on board .
He refused to leave the plane until it took off again for Israel , two hours later .
UK police were waiting to arrest him at the immigration desk inside the terminal .
The war crimes arrest warrant was issued by senior district judge Timothy Workman , after an application by British lawyers acting for Palestinian victims of the demolition in 2002 , in Gaza .
Under British law , war crimes should be treated so seriously that even if they are committed abroad , UK courts have jurisdiction to try suspects .
Almog , commanding officer of the Israeli defence forces ' southern command from December 2000 - July 2003 , was due to arrive at Heathrow airport at 1.25 pm on a flight belonging to El Al , Israel 's national carrier .
The airline refused Scotland Yard permission to board the plane .
Those who obtained the warrant say the police made errors .
The document is written by detective superintendent John MacBryane , from the counter - terrorism command , who was in charge on the day Almog arrived in London .
It was drafted by Scotland Yard as part of their response of an investigation into the incident by the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
It forms a summary of the decision log , detailing what actions police took and why .
MacBrayne wrote of events the day Almog landed at Heathrow : " By 2.30 pm it became apparent that Mr Almog had not presented himself at the Immigration desk .
A check of the flight manifest revealed that Mr Almog was on the plane , possibly in company with his wife .
" Consideration was given to boarding the El Al flight and DSU MacBrayne sought clarification of his powers to do so with those officials present . "
Top detectives were told that police routinely boarded flights , but were not sure if they could do so without the permission of the airline .
" It was confirmed that El Al were refusing voluntary access to the plane and DSU MacBrayne could not get confirmation that he had a legal right to do so .
The time scale involved made it impossible to receive the appropriate advice before the El Al flight was due to return to Israel at 15.30 hrs …
" Another consideration being that El Al flights carried armed air marshals which raised issues round public safety .
There was also no intelligence as to whether Mr Almog would have been traveling with personal security as befitted his status , armed or otherwise . "
" DSU MacBrayne took the considered opinion that , as access to the plane would not be consensual , there existed a real threat of an armed confrontation . "
Detectives considered boarding the plane with armed officers , but felt this " presented an exponential risk to the officers , especially with the lack of intelligence regarding personnel on the plane " .
" In light of the above , the decision was made not to approach / board the aircraft . "
Daniel Machover , a solicitor involved in gaining the warrant on behalf of Almog 's alleged Palestinian victims , said police did not need permission to board the plane .
He said they should have told the airline : " You 're on British soil , we 're coming aboad . "
Machover said police could also have stopped the plane taking off until Almog emerged .
The document reveals that before the planned arrest , Scotland Yard consulted West Midlands police and a special police unit called the national Communities Tensions Team , for advice on reaction in the British Jewish community .
A " trusted partner " of the police , a Jewish contact , also made inquiries about finding a lawyer for Almog and raising his bail money , once he was arrested .
The document says the inquiries were made " discreetly " without Almog 's name being mentioned .
But Machover said it would have been obvious that the inquiries were about Almog : " If you go about making inquiries of this kind , it is easy for someone to put two and two together and work out the inquiries are to do with Almog . "
The arrest warrant was issued at Bow Street magistrates court , central London .
It was believed to be the first warrant for war crimes of its kind issued in Britain against an Israeli national over conduct in the conflict with Palestinians .
The attorney general would have had to sanction the war crimes prosecution before it went ahead .
Speaking days after avoiding the arrest , Almog told the Guardian that as he prepared to leave the plane , he was advised to wait by the cabin crew .
Israel 's then military attaché in London arrived on the plane to inform him that he faced arrest .
The 55 - year - old former general said : " I do n't know how he [ the military attaché ] found out but I am glad he did .
It was also fortunate that I was flying with El Al as they are loyal .
I do n't know what would have happened if I had been on a British Airways flight . "
Almog said : " As a soldier and a general , I have never committed a crime .
Many times I have saved Palestinian lives by risking my life and the lives of my soldiers . "
The actions of the Israeli army in Gaza were to prevent terrorist attacks against Israel , he said .
Raji Sourani , the director of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights , said : " Failure to respect the rule of law and to pursue those responsible for attacking civilians will undermine the respect for international law which we do badly need if we are to have peace in our region .
Until such time we will be faced with the rule of the jungle . "
We are a family of 7 .
When the boys were 2 I knew that something was not quite right with them .
Our pediatrician told me that they were delayed because they were boys and twins .
They would catch up ....
Not so .
No one would listen to me .
In November of 2007 we finally got a diagnosis of Autism .
This is the chronicles of our journey .
We are using a biomedical approach with the boys and their younger sister , who also has an Autism diagnosis .
This is our journey .
1 .
On Tuesday afternoon , I witnessed a superhuman act of strength .
We were gathered inside the West Angeles Cathedral on Crenshaw Boulevard , a mammoth facility with a balcony and video screens that 's like a concert hall crossed with a place of the Lord .
Only a few funerals each month happen here , mostly for Los Angeles celebrities and people with ties to the church .
For Johnnie Cochran 's funeral two years ago , every one of the cathedral 's 5,000 seats was famously filled .
It 's the type of place you would n't expect to see a 17 - year - old kid lying peacefully in a coffin , not unless he was related to a singer or a politician or something .
But that 's who was there , and that 's who we came to see .
[+]
Enlarge Bill Simmons Jamiel Andre Shaw II was a kid who , by all accounts , did things the right way .
Sitting in the front row , an older man wiped a black handkerchief against his eyes and kept burying his head into his hands , as if he could n't summon enough power to watch the proceedings .
He had been repeating this cycle for most of the previous hour , digging that handkerchief against his eyes , burying his head in dismay , looking up at that coffin , then beginning the whole process again .
The man seemed broken .
You could n't even say he was grieving .
This was something else .
I spent much of that hour watching the man and his wife , as well as their 9 - year - old son sitting unflinchingly between them .
The boy never moved .
He sat upright in his chair , listening to everybody speak , unfazed by the sniffling and the wailing , frozen by everything that was happening .
His mother was sobbing intermittently and feeding off the church 's singers , especially during a stirring rendition of " If I Ain't Got You , " as she raised her hands and swayed to the music , pulling her hands back toward her body and sucking force from the words .
At one point , I glanced at my program and noticed the broken man was scheduled to speak .
This seemed impossible .
He could n't even keep his head up ... and he was going to say something ?
The moment came and the man unfurled himself from his seat , took a deep breath and staggered toward the podium .
When he kicked things off by saying , " This is gonna be hard for me , " his voice cracked and it seemed like that would be that .
He would cry , and he'd keep crying , and then he would collapse against the podium , and four relatives would rush up there and help him back to his seat .
That 's how this would play out .
I would have bet anything .
I was wrong .
Somehow , the man summoned the power to keep talking .
Once the words started coming , he gained more and more strength , and within a few seconds , he was giving a poignant speech and attempting to place his son's life in perspective .
When he finished speaking , everyone in the church -- maybe 1,200 mourners in all -- stood up and applauded him .
I do n't know how he did it .
I will never know how he did it .
2 .
To understand the meaning behind his words , you need to understand what brought everyone to the cathedral on a sunny Tuesday afternoon .
We came to mourn Jamiel Andre Shaw Jr. , a 17 - year - old junior from Los Angeles High who everyone called " Jas " ( pronounced " Jazz " ) , the nickname that initially belonged to his father before Pops graciously handed it down .
On the first Sunday night in March , Jas was walking home in Arlington Heights when two Latino gangbangers started eyeballing him from a trailing car .
Jas kept walking .
When they hopped out of their car and approached him , Jas stopped just 40 yards from the front door of his house , the same distance he dreamed of running for NFL scouts some day .
[+]
Enlarge AP Photo / Damian Dovarganes Somehow , Jamiel Shaw Sr. mustered the strength to eulogize his son .
" Where you from ? " one of them asked .
That 's a loaded question on the streets , code for determining someone 's gang affiliation .
Give the wrong answer and that 's that .
Since he did n't belong to a gang , Jas decided against saying anything .
Maybe he was thinking about that last 40 yards .
Maybe he thought they would n't shoot a star running back .
Maybe he believed that silence was his best recourse .
Maybe he was too scared to say anything .
They shot him anyway .
Twice .
Sitting inside his house , Jamiel Shaw Sr. heard the unmistakable sounds of gunfire and dialed his son's cell phone to warn him .
Senior spent all 17 years of Junior 's life terrified that something bad would happen , that his son would wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time , that he'd talk back to the wrong person , that he'd be riding in the wrong car on the wrong night .
He desperately wanted his son to reach 18 .
That was his only goal as a father .
Eighteen .
He even dubbed it the " 18 - Year Plan " to bang home the point .
Eighteen meant college .
Eighteen meant Jas never became a casualty of the streets , that he never found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Eighteen meant Jas was relatively lucky .
Minority kids in Los Angeles , whether black or brown , need a little luck to make it to 18 .
Not a ton of luck , but a little luck .
Just a smidge .
You never know .
[+]
Enlarge AP Photo / Damian Dovarganes Jas ' honors from the football field fill a room in the Shaw family home .
When nobody picked up Jas ' phone within a few seconds , it dawned on Jamiel Sr. that his son could have reached the neighborhood already .
He darted out his front door and right into his worst nightmare -- the sight of his innocent son laying on the sidewalk , the sound of a getaway car speeding away .
Had this happened in a movie , we would have seen the father running toward the son in slow motion and screaming " Noooooooooooo ! "
The son would have said something profound with his last breaths before his eyes froze open .
The father would have cradled his dying son , reared his head back and screamed toward the sky .
And ... scene .
In real life , you hear a pop - pop sound , make a call , bolt outside and find your son already gone .
As Jamiel Sr. described it later , " He was laying on the ground and his face looked so peaceful .
I knew he was dead . "
Over the next few days , friends and family would wonder what happened and , more importantly , why it happened .
And Jas did do everything right .
He studied and attended class .
Stayed out of trouble .
Treated people with respect .
Listened to his parents .
Took care of his little brother .
Played football so well that his league named him most valuable player as a junior .
Carried the football so beautifully ( averaging more than 14 yards per carry ! ) that his coach compared him to Houdini .
Showed enough promise that schools like Stanford and Arizona State were recruiting him .
The son dreamed of playing football in college and the NFL , then pursuing a second career as a sports agent .
The father simply dreamed of seeing the son turn 18 .
When Jas came up 10 months shy , his senseless murder received national attention because of his football ability and a fascinating wrinkle that his mother , Anita , happened to be serving the country overseas in Iraq .
The Associated Press filed an extensive story that landed in nearly every newspaper and on nearly every Web site .
CNN filmed an interview with Anita Shaw for Anderson Cooper 's show .
The Los Angeles Times wrote an initial story and a few days of follow - ups .
Every L.A. network led its newscast with the story .
There was a candlelight vigil after Jas ' death that attracted a phalanx of cameras .
At Tuesday 's funeral , I half - expected to see a couple of Hollywood executives lingering afterward , hoping to purchase Jas ' story and turn him into the Cornbread Hamilton or Ricky Baker of his generation .
None of that happened .
Jamiel Shaw 's funeral turned out to be unfathomably sad .
It 's tragic any time a parent outlives a child , or a teenager is slain for no reason , but the mourning process jumps a level if it's a gifted athlete getting chopped down before his prime .
There 's a reason A.E. Housman 's " To An Athlete Dying Young " gets taught in nearly every high school poetry class ; there 's a reason students always respond to that poem and remember it .
The finest prep athletes achieve a level of notoriety that dwarfs everyone else in school .
They 're envied and respected , admired and coddled , cheered and idolized .
Everyone else would trade places with them in a heartbeat .
It 's a gift ; not an important gift , not a life - altering gift , but still a gift .
When that gift gets taken away , it gets taken away from everyone .
Had a typical student with good grades been gunned down , the story would n't have attracted as much attention .
When it 's a star football player with a chance to make something of his life ?
It matters to people who did n't even know him .
Maybe he would have starred in college .
Maybe he would have starred in the pros .
Maybe he would have injured a knee next season , and that would have been that .
There 's no way to know .
What mattered was the promise that something could happen , that something might happen .
And although A.E. Hausman believed it 's a blessing in disguise for an athlete to pass early ...
Smart lad , to slip betimes away
From fields where glory does not stay
And early though the laurel grows
It withers quicker than the rose
... everyone at Jamiel Shaw 's funeral would respectfully disagree .
3 .
When a screwed - up city like Los Angeles claims someone like Jas , the pain goes beyond a gifted kid getting cheated out of a bright future and even beyond the community losing a much - needed role model , the successful product of a two - parent family , someone who set a constant example for everyone younger than him .
Jas ' death makes all of us feel vulnerable .
If the anointed ones can't make it , then who can ?
[+]
Enlarge AP Photo / Damian Dovarganes Friends and neighbors were shocked by Jamiel 's death earlier this month .
And so hundreds of people showed up at West Angeles Cathedral to pay their respects and find solace in numbers .
Other than his family and friends , 34 of Jas ' teammates showed up in their white football jerseys .
A good chunk of Los Angeles High showed up on a school day , with their principal 's blessing .
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa gave a heartfelt speech about peace and unity , then tapped into his inner Carcetti and snuck out halfway through the service .
There were cameras and photographers , reporters and policemen , teachers and mourners , acquaintances and well - wishers .
I showed up early , found a seat in the balcony and tried to make sense of everything while holding three things :
My notebook .
A disturbing flier with a $ 55,000 reward for Jamiel Shaw Jr. 's killer .
And a well - done program that featured heartfelt letters to Jas from the ones closest to him , including a cousin who asked the salient question , " Why is the world so mean ? "
Like everyone else , I was waiting for an answer when Jamiel Sr. somehow pulled himself together and started speaking .
He mentioned the fear of residing in a gang - infested city , how he felt powerless when Jas got older for the same reason that every parent starts to feel powerless -- once children start spreading their wings and parents realize they can't spend every second of the day with them , there comes a point when the parents just have to cross their fingers , let the children spread those wings and hope for the best .
Still , as Jamiel Sr. put it , " We should n't have to cringe every time our kids go outside . "
He described the " 18 - Year Plan " and how it did n't necessarily fall a few months short , how he planned on devoting his life to spreading that message and making sure his son did n't expire in vain .
To his everlasting credit , he attempted to diffuse racial tensions that have been smoldering since the murder , saying his son's death was n't a black / brown thing but a gang thing , then going out of his way to mention some of Jas ' Latino friends from his football team and his neighborhood .
He hoped the community could quell gang violence and use his late son as a rallying cry , mentioning wistfully that " [ Jas ] believed me when I told him that if he did everything right , it would be OK ... and look what happened . "
Normally in these situations , the speaker feels obligated to editorialize against gang violence ( " We gotta band together ; we gotta stop killing each other " ) , and everything sounds great until you remember later that it's a pipe dream .
Jamiel Sr. took a more realistic approach , making the astute point that " sometimes people are in gangs for the wrong reason , but it 's the right reason for them . "
Which is precisely why a community has no chance of snuffing out these gangs , no matter how much money is raised and how many people get involved .
There will always be reasons for people to join a gang , just like there will always be reasons to stop them .
The commitment has to come from the top .
Almost always , it does not .
4 .
There was a certain symmetry to Jas ' funeral occurring two days after the final episode of " The Wire , " the groundbreaking HBO show that over five seasons detailed the decay of Baltimore , a city that rotted like a fish from the head down .
The good guys rarely ended up winning on that show .
In one memorable moment during the final season ( note : spoiler warning from this point on ) , detective Jimmy McNulty found out budget cuts had curtailed his ongoing investigation of Marlo Stanfeld , the city 's reigning drug kingpin .
He could n't believe it .
AP Photo / Damian Dovarganes Jas ' Los Angeles High School teammates arrive at the funeral at West Angeles Cathedral .
" Marlo does n't get to win , " McNulty muttered in frustration .
" WE get to win . "
McNulty ended up rigging a murder investigation , turning the city upside down for a few weeks , somehow bagging Marlo and his crew , then losing Marlo on a techicality and getting asked to resign .
That 's the thing about real life -- guys like Marlo do get to win .
Through the wisdom imparted in 60 grueling episodes , " Wire " fans learned rudderless cities are helpless against drugs and gangs .
You need politicians willing to make substantial commitments to police and schools .
You need a never - ending reservoir of money .
And , even then , that 's probably not enough if drugs and gangs are the only options for so many impoverished teenagers .
When Jamiel Sr. made his point about " the right reason for them , " I thought instantly of Marlo , an icy character who never lost his cool until the second - to - last episode , when he finds out in prison that a street foe had been calling him out on the streets but nobody bothered to tell him .
Marlo upbraids his minions with a stream of obscenities , finally screaming in frustration , " MY NAME IS MY NAME ! "
For him , that was all that mattered .
His name and nothing else .
In the final episode , after his lawyer sprung him of all charges -- but with the caveat that Marlo sell his business and never go back to dealing drugs -- there is an incredible scene in which Marlo leaves a cocktail party filled with elite Baltimore businessmen , unable to handle the thought of inhabiting their spineless world , ultimately walking the streets and picking a fight with two thugs on a street corner .
After landing two blows and sending them scurrying , the scene ends with Marlo checking a wound on his arm , tasting the blood , laughing and standing proudly on his new corner , reclaiming the streets if only for those few seconds .
You could say Marlo was wrong for being a drug dealer , but , to steal a phrase from Jamiel Sr. , it was the right reason for him .
Marlo's character became a defining character on the show , an unredeeming villain who embraced street life and everything that came with it .
We never met Marlo 's parents and did n't need to meet them -- he was created by Baltimore itself , a city with reprehensibly bad schools and too many one - parent and no-parent families , a city that left its young kids to mostly fend for themselves .
The show 's fourth season revolved around four teenage friends , all of whom started out with good hearts even though they had little chance of making anything of their lives .
By last weekend 's final episode , three of the four were hopeless -- one stuck in a group home , one hooked on drugs , one resigned to life as a street thug -- with the fourth finding salvation from an adopted family .
When we saw the fourth speaking about AIDS in Africa at a Baltimore city debate this season , it was an especially rewarding moment because we knew the odds had been stacked so dramatically against him .
That 's why those 60 episodes were so special as a whole :
They did n't just tell you that things were bad , they showed you why things were bad and why things had so little chance of ever changing .
The show 's enduring point was there will always be more people like Marlo , Omar , McNulty , Prop Joe , Bubbles and Carcetti ; everyone was filling a certain role , the principles of a messed - up city were more cyclical than anything : nothing will really ever change .
You could say the same about inner-city Los Angeles , an area ravaged by violence and poverty that seems utterly entrenched in its ways .
The city 's police force is woefully and comically understaffed , and most public schools are sketchy enough that the competition for spots in private schools and respected public schools starts as early as pre-K .
There 's a festering feud between Latino gangs and black gangs that has been threatening to boil over for years , a problem that , ironically enough , would have been the theme for the sixth season of " The Wire " had HBO ignored feeble ratings and allowed creator David Simon to keep the series going .
It 's the same feud that ultimately claimed L.A.
High 's star running back .
He looked like Dwyane Wade , smiled like Magic Johnson and ran like a young Barry Sanders .
For the past year , his teammates and his community looked up to No.
4 . Tuesday , they looked down on him .
He was lying peacefully , like the way his father found him .
And for three hours , a number of people spoke and tried to make sense of what happened , but , really , nobody did until the minister mentioned something in his eulogy : the " irony " of Jas ' mother " fighting terrorism on foreign soil , and lo and behold , street terrorism is right here . "
And thriving .
According to a story in Wednesday 's L.A. Times , the alleged killer was a 19 - year - old member of the 18th Street Gang who had been released from prison a day earlier .
LAPD Chief William Bratton explained the killer mistook Jas for a member of a rival gang , the implication being that his death , for lack of a better word , was a mistake .
Of course , we know better .
When somebody commits murder because they 're trying to make a name for themselves or defend some arbitrary stretch of turf , that 's not a mistake .
It 's terrorism in its most basic form , an excessive use of fear to accomplish a goal .
Whether we do anything about it remains to be seen .
When Jamiel Sr. emerged from a sobbing heap , stood on wobbly legs and vowed to keep his " 18 - Year Plan " going , I desperately wanted to support him and felt humbled by his strength .
But I could n't shake the memory that , once upon a time , the man felt obligated to start an " 18 - Year Plan " in the first place .
RIP , Jas .

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is taking steps to brace for an increase in failed financial institutions as the nation 's housing and credit markets continue to worsen .
The FDIC is looking to bring back 25 retirees from its division of resolutions and receiverships .

Two masked and machete - wielding men who barged into a club in Sydney , Australia , could n't have picked a worse night for their robbery -- a monthly meeting of bikers .
The robbers chose the wrong night to burst into the club where the Southern Cross Cruiser Club have their monthly meeting .
About 50 burly bikers fought back with tables and chairs -- pretty much anything that was n't bolted down .
One would - be robber was tied up ; the other in the hospital .
Police arrested both .
" These guys were absolutely dumb as bricks , " Jerry Vancornewal , leader of the bikers , told CNN Thursday .
" I can't believe they saw all the bikes parked up front and they were so stupid that they walked past in . "
Vancornewal and his buddies were at the Regents Park Sporting and Community Club in Sydney when the two men wearing ski masks stormed in Wednesday night .
They yelled at patrons to drop to the floor as they emptied cash registers at the bar .
Hearing the commotion from an adjacent room , Vancornewal and his pals with the Southern Cross Cruiser motorcycle club stomped through to the bar area to intervene .
" They ( the robbers ) thought they had the upper advantage with their knives and their machetes , " Jim Webb , night supervisor of the club , told CNN .
" They did n't expect to run into a bunch of guys carrying chairs and tables . "
One of the would - be robbers crashed through a plate - glass door and jumped off a balcony .
" All he had to do was push the button and it automatically opened , " Webb quipped .
New South Wales police said they arrested the 20 - year - old man a short distance away .
The second man made a break for it through the club 's service entrance , but the bikers tackled him near a neighbor 's fence .
" We just grabbed him , crash - tackled him to the ground , hogtied him with electrical wire and left him for the cops , " Vancornewal said .
Police confirmed in a statement that club patrons subdued the second man until officers arrived , but did not provide additional details .
The suspect turned out to be a 16 - year - old boy .
Both would - be robbers were charged with attempted armed robbery and " face disguised with intent to commit indictable offense , " police said .
A third person , who was waiting in a getaway car , took off when the bikers threw pieces of furniture at him , Webb said .
Police have not located him .
The Regents Park Sporting and Community Club is a place where locals come to enjoy drinks and take part in various games : cricket , soccer , lawn bowling .
The biking enthusiasts meet there once a month to plan rides and other club activities .
In the last year or so , criminals have struck the club about 10 times , Webb said .
And Wednesday night 's incident , while unusual , was n't the most memorable .
" We have these old bingo players and they are really serious about their games , " Webb explained .
" They do not like to be interrupted . "
When robbers barged in one evening and announced that they were holding up the place , the players turned around and testily told them to be quiet .
" They were making it difficult for the players to hear the numbers being called , " Webb said .

The first sentence of Darwin 's section on the eye is often cited by his enemies as the naturalist throwing in the towel .
The idea that the exquisite , complex structure of the eye could have evolved by accumulated random mutations , Darwin says , seems " absurd to the highest possible degree " .
But read on and Darwin cajoles his reader to embrace the full power of natural selection .
If you accept the logic that variation between individuals is heritable and those individuals with the most successful variations survive to reproduce , then you have to accept that vast chasms of adaptation can be traversed by the slow plodding accumulation of inherited changes .
Natural selection can travel huge distances if given time .
" [ The reader 's ] reason ought to conquer his imagination , " writes Darwin , throwing in a few types of simple eye to show some of the possible steps along the way to a complex eye .
It is this failure of reason to conquer imagination that lies at the heart of the modern - day notion of intelligent design .
Proponents of ID make the very same argument that Darwin is trying to counter here , namely that complex structures in nature are simply too intricate to have come about by natural selection , therefore they must have been the work of a designer .
One favourite example is the bacterial flagellum , a whip - like tail that propels the beast along .
It looks beautifully designed , with a drive shaft and motor made up of over 40 proteins .
If you take one away , the flagellum stops working .
To ID proponents , this " irreducible complexity " means it cannot have evolved .
But this crude attempt at re-running evolution is meaningless .
It turns out that the flagellum 's complexity can be reduced .
One bacterial species that lives in our stomach , for example , has 33 proteins instead of the full complement .
What 's more , many of the components of the flagellum have turned up doing separate jobs elsewhere in bacteria .
So the notion of natural selection bodging together the tail using bits already present in bacteria is plausible .
No need for a designer .
Again , Darwin was a century and a half ahead of the ID crowd .
He acknowledges the temptation to liken the eye to a human - produced telescope : " We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long continued efforts of the highest human intellects ; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process .
But may not this inference be presumptuous ?
Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man ? "
Some academics say warnings of a farm labor debacle are exaggerated .
“ By and large the most dire predictions do n’t come true , ” said Philip Martin , an agricultural economist at the University of California , Davis .
“ There is no doubt that some people ca n’t count on workers showing up as much as they used to , ” he said .
“ But most of the places that are crying the loudest are exceptional cases . ”
But some recent studies suggest that strains on the farm labor supply are real .
Steve Levy , an economist at the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto , compared unemployed Americans with illegal immigrant workers in the labor market .
“ The bottom line , ” he concluded , “ is that most unemployed workers are not available to replace fired unauthorized immigrant workers , ” in part because very few of the unemployed are in farm work .
Mr. Scaroni said he started growing in Mexico reluctantly , after seeing risks to his American operations .
At peak season his California company , Valley Harvesting and Packing , employs more than a thousand immigrants , and all have filled out the required federal form , known as an I - 9 , with Social Security numbers and other identity information .
“ From my perspective everyone that works for me is legal , ” he said .
But based on farm labor statistics , he surmises that many of his workers presented false documents .
An impatient man in perpetual motion , Mr. Scaroni marches through his fields shouting orders to Mexican crew leaders in rough Spanish while he negotiates to buy new trucks in Mexico on a walkie - talkie in one hand and to sell produce in the United States on a cellphone in the other .
Frustrated with experts who say that farmers with labor problems should mechanize , he plunges his hands into side - by - side lettuce plants , pulling out one crisp green head and one that is soggy and brown .
After his company invested $ 1 million in research , he said , “ We have n’t come up with a way to tell a machine what ’s a good head and what ’s a bad head . ”
He also dismisses arguments that he could attract workers by raising wages , saying Americans do not take the sweaty , seasonal field jobs .
“ I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I did that I would raise my costs and I would not have a legal workforce , ” Mr. Scaroni said .
Societe Generale confirmed that a person was being questioned
The bank confirmed that police had searched its trading floor and held one person for questioning .
Societe Generale said the employee was a cash equities broker , but declined to name the individual .
Societe Generale announced 4.9bn euros ( $ 7.6bn ; £ 3.8 bn ) of losses , which it blames on its trader Jerome Kerviel .
' A scapegoat '
This person has not been named , but is understood not to be the broker from the bank 's Fimat unit - now called Newedge - and who was questioned and since named as a witness .
Mr Kerviel is being investigated for breach of trust , computer abuse and falsification .
He has previously said that he refused to be made " a scapegoat " .
He is due to appear in court on Friday in an attempt to secure a temporary release while the investigation continues .
Mr Kerviel has previously said that he was acting alone , but insisted that his bosses ignored his huge trades as long as he was making a profit .
Lawsuit
The latest arrest came as a US - based law firm said it had filed a class action law suit against the French bank on behalf of holders of SocGen 's US - listed shares .
It alleges that Societe Generale misled investors about exposure to the sub - prime mortgage market , and failed to act on information about trades by Mr Kerviel .
An internal inquiry at the bank found that it lacked controls that might have prevented the trader building up 50bn euros of unsupervised bets on European share prices .
The bank 's 2007 profits fell 82 % from 2006 , mainly due to the losses incurred by Mr Kerviel but the bank also suffered some losses related to the sub - prime crisis .
Tater Titan - project finished on 3/2/2009
With Apocalypse out , I decided I needed something BIG for my Orks .
After all , superheavy vehicles are what Apocalypse is all about .
One of the members over on The Waaagh ! , who goes by the handle of burna_boy , suggested the idea of using a Mr. Potato Head as a basis for making a Stompa .
I just had to get in on such a crazy / stupid / genius / insane idea .
After a year and a half of work , this beastie is finally complete .
Why so long ?
Well , I only worked on him when I felt inspired to .
I put so much effort into this thing , I did n't want to half - ass any of it by rushing .
It 's been a long time coming , but he 's finally finished .
Hey , at least I beat the release date of the ' official ' Games Workshop Stompa ( only by a week , though )
Click on the image for a larger view .
Concept and Construction Some of the examples in the original thread were a bit static in my opinion .
A Stompa should look like it can actually stomp !
While the body shape is perfect , the feet of the stock spud are stuck together .
Something needed to be done ...
I decided to chop open the body and rig up my own legs while still retaining the shoes .
The first step in building my " Tater Titan " was to make the stance a bit more dynamic .
I turned the body around , so the ' butt - hatch ' became a ' belly hatch ' .
The pot -belly look really suits the stompa model .
I used PVC pipe for the hip axle held in place by a foamcore frame within the body .
The legs are a mockup using foamcore with some Imperial Tank wheels as ankle joints .
The legs will be reworked using plastic tubing and tank wheels , but the foamcore is good enough for this stance test .
I 'm not sure yet what 's going into the belly hatch .
Either a BIG gun , or an assault ramp for a mob of boyz .
I might keep the belly modular so I can swap in whatever I want .
Here 's a mockup of how I intend the thing to look , as well as a boy next to it for scale .
Here I 've started on the business end of the ' choppa arm ' .
I 've also made some improvements to the feet and legs .
Here 's the choppa arm in a rough placement of where it will be on the finished model .
Here 's a shot of the ' stompy ' foot and leg .
You can see I 'm starting to replace foamcore with actual plastic parts .
I 'm using 12 guage copper wire to hold the parts in place as well as provide structure .
12 guage wire is good stuff , pliable enough to be formed and bent into shape , but sturdy enough to hold weight and retain it 's shape .
Here 's a shot of the ' standing ' foot and leg .
I 've used copper wire here too , as well as a length of coat hanger running from the foot , through the leg , and up into the body for support .
Once this thing is mounted on a base , it should be pretty stable , the coat hanger will provide an anchor and the copper wire will tie it all together .
Here you see the arms are coming along nicely .
There 's still a lot of detail work to be done on them ( wires , pistons , rivets and other gubbinz ) , but the structure is pretty much all there .
Here 's a close up shot of the ' choppa ' arm .
It 's basically a huge version of the chainsaw choppa carried by the slugga boy you see in the scale shots .
Here 's a close up of the gun arm .
I loved the idea of a massive gatling cannon , something that would unload rapid - fire death .
Now that the Apocalypse book is out , I may have to redesign the gun to fit in with the specs in the book .
Either that or just come up with my own rules for this guy .
And just so you all know that I 've gone absolutely , 100 % , batshit crazy ... ... I 'm making this beasty poseable .
Here you can see I 've got the face pretty much done as well as some armor plating .
I 've also done some more work on the feet and legs , bulking them up and adding some detail work .
The feet are going to get more armor plating to give them kind of a steel toe boot look , but not to worry , the shoelaces are STAYING !
A close up of his cute little mug .
This is his " Angry Face " ... ... and this is his " Sad Face .
That 's right boyz and girlz , he 's not only poseable , you can change his expression too !
A concept I 've been toying with is making his right eye a gun slit with a big shoota poking out .
For those of you interested in seeing some of the ' worky bitz ' , here 's a shot of the innards .
You can see the PVC pipe I 've used as the axle , the foamcore support struts , and the copper wire holding it in place .
The foamcore struts have been cut to fit into ' feet ' and ' mouth ' holes of the original potato head toy .
Here you can see the interior shot with the coat hanger bit running up from the leg and into a pin stuck into the ' arm slot ' .
You can also see the tab on the foamcore strut that fits into ' foot slot ' .
I 've actually used the ' ear slots ' for the placement of the arms .
I think it gives the little guy a more hunched over , ' orky ' appearance .
And another shot of our favorite spud .
Ain't he cute !
Some more progress has been made .
I have started to cut a hole to make room for the belly cannon .
I also managed to get myself the classic bowler hat for him .
I think it adds a nice touch .
More work has been done on the metal plating covering the body .
The engine / boiler / smokestack assembly has been started .
Another shot of the boiler and the armor plating .
Riveting this thing is quite a chore .
A face only a mother could love !.... well , maybe not .
It 's been awhile since the last update on the guy , mostly because I was getting a bit burned out on building him .
There was also something not quite right about him , but I could n't quite place it .
After taking a long break and coming back with a fresh perspective , I realized I was n't too happy with the rivets on the main body .
I decided to strip them all off and start fresh .
As you can see here , the rivets are no longer made from white plasticard .
They were a bit too large and too uniform .
The rivets you see now are made from the spear shafts of a bunch of fantasy orcs ( yet another project waiting for me , oh man ... ) .
I sliced the spear shafts into small discs , kinda like slicing sausage only reeeeeally small .
I think they came out a lot better this time around .
I 'm also starting to add some cables and hoses to various parts of the stompa , as well as getting the small rivets done on various parts of the body , weapons , feet and engine .
I gotta tell ya , the detail stage of a project is the most tedious ... but also the most important .
Here you can see a bit more detail added to the ejection port on the main kannon as well as some detail work on the iron gob .
The feet have also been largely finished .
I had to redo the toe spikes since I was n't happy with them the first time around .
I 've also added tread to the bottom of the shoes and some ' style stripes ' to the sides to give them that running shoe look .
After all the plasticard work was done , I slapped on the rivets .
These were made from plasticard using a small hole punch .
Here 's a close - up shot of the belly kannon , complete with a co-axial mounted big shoota .
The ' belly gun ' mount is modular so I can create multiple weapons for it , that way I can tailor this bad boy to whatever mood I happen to be in .
The arms on this thing are also modular .
The tater titan will probably have several weapon loadouts in the future .
I really want to make a ' toaster ' weapon configuration , all with big flame - belching weapons , as well as a ' zapper ' model with a bunch of crazy looking energy guns .
First things first though , let 's get the ' dakka ' configuration finished .
Another round of detailing has been done to this bad boy .
Along with more riveting , the weapons and powerplant are pretty much finished .
Here 's a shot showing the gun arm and a couple of the ' grot rokkits ' .
These little one - shot - wonders add a lot of character to the machine as well as being pretty effective anti-tank weapons in their own right .
A shot of the powerplant , showing the second exhaust stack .
The chainsaw arm and another ' grot rokkit ' .
Here 's a close up shot of the engine exhausts .
The large exhaust pipe on the left is a chimney from the Games Workshop Manufactorum kit .
The compression chamber and small exhaust in the middle is from the Chemical Plant kit by Pegasus Hobbies , just like most of the other engine bits .
Here 's a close up of the chainsaw arm , showing some engine and exhaust bits .
The exhaust pipe is from the same Chemical Plant model kit I mentioned above .
The vent plate is a Forgeworld piece .
The other side of the chainsaw arm , as well as a menacing shot of the ' grot rokkit ' .
Here 's a close up of the gun arm .
I did quite a bit more detail work on this baby .
Hyraulic pistons on the arm , tons of rivets , a heat shield for the gattling cannon , and a mounting rack for a ' grot rokkit ' .
Rear shot of the gun arm .
A close up of the ' grot rokkits ' .
They 're custom built from plasticard , some bits , and the shells from a 1:35 scale Sturmtiger model .
There 's a " How To " for them in the Tutorials section .
Here we are !
Construction on this beast is complete .
I 've added a base made from MDF board .
The foot is attached to the base with liquid nails and wood screws .
He 's not going anywhere .
He can now stand on his own , no more propping him up with the cap from a bottle .
I 've also mounted a twin - linked big shoota to the hat and carved in a whole ton of dings , scuffs and scrapes .
Here 's a close up of the big shoota on the hat .
And an aerial view as well .
Here he is all dismantled and ready for primer .
One last dramatic pose before paint .
Painting
Here he is after being primed flat black .
Word to the wise :
Make DAMN sure you paint any pieces of foamcore with a brush before you break out the spray paint .
The propellant in spray cans eats styrofoam ( which is a component of foamcore ) .
It had been so long since I 'd worked on the legs , I completely forgot there was still unprotected foamcore in there .
His legs were so wobbly that his ' stompy ' foot actually came clean off .
Some superglue and liquid nails fixed him right up , and then I touched up the primer .
Here all his metal pieces got a liberal drybrushing of Tin Bitz .
I left the hat alone .
I want it to be a slightly different color than the rest of the titan .
After the Tin Bitz coat dried , I gave him a drybrushing of Boltgun Metal .
You can just make out the Tin Bitz below the surface of the Boltgun coat on the teeth and gob .
I think it produces a pretty convincing rusty metal effect .
Here 's his chainsaw arm , looking extra choppy with some paint on it .
And the gatling cannon .
I could n't resist doing the brass effect on the shells in the ammo drum .
Here we see more paint on this bad boy .
Right now I 'm just blocking in the solid colors .
That 's why he's got that saturated " explosion - in - a - paint - factory " look .
Do n't worry , he 'll look all dingy , dirty , and beat to s**t by the time I 'm done .
Side angle showing more colors .
I 'm still working on how to put some color on the rear of this thing .
Eh , something will come to me ...
The other side with colors .
Here I have the painting stage all but completed .
The weathering and battle damage are all done as well as the rest of the detail work .
After a year and a half , this beast is finally ready for some dullcoat varnish and some glamor shots .
Another angle of everybody 's favorite spud .
Side shot .
I really like how muddy his shoes look .
Back shot showing the engine and exhausts
The gun arm with the Grot Rokkits Here 's the lighting effect on his eye .
After two days , three seperate attempts and countless washes of various green colors I 'm finally happy with how it came out .
Close up of the gunner .
Grot Rokkit on the right shoulder .
Preflight checklist complete and ready to ruin somebody 's day :-)

Senator Dodd renews call against telecom immunity
Senator Dodd threatened to filibuster a bill that would give immunity to the Telecommunications companies that broke FISA wiretap laws .
Continuing his battle against retroactive immunity for telecommunication companies , Senator Dodd gave an impassioned speech against what he referred to as a " 5 - year concerted effort contrary to the law of the land . "
Pointing out that not all telecoms complied with the request from the Bush administration to listen in on private conversation of American citizens unless they were given a court order to do so , Dodd also questioned where such violations would end , and warned the notion of Americans giving up rights in order to be safe was a " false dichotomy that is dangerous . "
Senator Dodd also had high praise for the " brave whistleblower " who came forward with the wiretapping information , and said without that information the practice might have remained hidden .
Dodd ended the session calling for his collegues to support him when he returns to the issue at 9:30 am EST Thursday morning , when he promises to continue to fight against telcom immunity with every means at his disposal .

Four protesters climbed on top of the plane
Four people were arrested after unfurling a banner from the top of the British Airways Airbus A320 , which had arrived from Manchester .
BAA said operations at the airport were not affected and described the protest as " unlawful and irresponsible " .
The move came as protesters were gathering in Westminster on Monday to oppose plans to expand the airport .
A government consultation on the plan closes on Wednesday .
We are here to draw a line in the sand and tell Gordon Brown his new runway must not and will not be built
Anna Jones , Greenpeace activist
Greenpeace said protesters put a banner reading " Climate Emergency - No Third Runway " over the plane 's tailfin at about 0945 GMT .
It said two women and two men crossed the tarmac at the airport after the passengers had disembarked .
One protester , Anna Jones , said : " Our planet and the people who live on it are in danger .
" Climate change can be beaten but not by almost doubling the size of the airport .
" We are here to draw a line in the sand and tell Gordon Brown his new runway must not and will not be built . "
' Four arrests '
BAA said police were attending the incident but it had not disrupted airport operations .
It said : " The government is currently consulting on the future of Heathrow airport and all parties have the opportunity , through the proper democratic process , to make their views known . "
But it criticised the Greenpeace protest as " unlawful and irresponsible " and said there would be a full investigation .
The four were arrested and taken to Heathrow police station at about 1100 GMT , a BAA spokeswoman said .

Few things are less appetizing than a man four years my father ’s junior , a dumpy , pasty , greedy - eyed man in a gray suit who says he does n’t care to screw fat women because they ’re harder to overpower , asking me over a big bowl of warm apple crisp if I like anal sex .
But since he ’s just offered me $ 3,000 a month plus perks — gifts , dinners , shopping sprees — to get naked with him once a week , I keep my tight young ass in its place , laugh politely , and pick up my fork .
I learned about SugarDaddy.com when an acquaintance I ’ll call “ Kim ” recommended it to my friend , who ’s had trouble finding a job despite ( or because of ) earning her master ’s in media arts several months ago .
Kim collected $ 900 every time she went on a date with one of her sugar daddies ; another gave her $ 3,500 in less than a week before announcing that he had to quit her because his wife had found out .
Kim ’s best friend “ Jill ” had two sugar daddies giving her a combined $ 8,000 a month until one got jealous of the other .
Jill has blond hair , amazing lips , and is 19 .
All I had to do to gain access to the “ meeting grounds of the rich and the beautiful ” was enter a user name ( “ Nextdoor_Nicole ” ) ; some vitals like age ( I lied and said 23 , afraid 27 is overripe ) , marital status ( “ Do You Care ? ” is kind of an exciting choice ) , and body type ( slim ) ; and “ Expectation : Select Financial Assistance You Desire , ” which ranges up to “ more than $ 10,000 per month . ”
I chose “ negotiable , ” so as not to seem like a gold digger , I guess , and slapped up a picture my mom took of me last Christmas .
By the next day , I ’d received 13 emails and 6 kisses , whatever that means , and been checked out by 36 older , wealthy men , two of whom added me to their “ favorite list . ”
Which brings me to my place across the table from Do You Like Anal , who puts proprietary hands on my shoulders and hips before we even get our cocktails and starts bartering for carnal treasure by the time dessert comes by asking me if I ’d want to “ hang out ” once a week .
I ask if “ hang out ” is a euphemism for “ screw ” ; he says yes ; I say that I would n’t consider it for less than $ 5,000 a month .
He counters with $ 3,000 .
There is actually no stack of cash large enough to persuade me to have sex with this guy , but as his income is listed as “ more than $ 1,000,000 , ” I feel slighted .
I ask why he uses this website if he ’s not prepared to dole it out , and he says regular dating sites do n’t cater to his preferences regarding age or “ sensuality , ” and that the young girls on Craigslist are all unclassy whores .
This statement is followed by an offer of $ 500 to “ get into ” my “ cooch . ”
My double vodka does n’t do nearly enough to muffle his egotistical blather ( “ Enough about me , ” he says 20 minutes in .
“ Tell me about you .
What do you think about me ? ” ) or the commentary he provides about his , um , girth .
My roommate — charged with checking in on me — texts , “ If he gets you the guacamole egg rolls you owe him a BJ .
Also , ask him if I can have a pony . ”
When I arrive home to a houseful of twentysomethings , we rail against the lowball .
The lone male in the group asks , “ Would it have made a difference if he ’d been attractive ? ”
Nobody answers for a second .
“ Probably , ” I concede , and everyone reluctantly agrees ; we are all sex - positive feminists here , offended not that he offered me money for sex , but that he offered so little and was so gross , and if the idea of doing him were palatable , and I were single , it ’s possible he’d be doing double duty as my boyfriend and payroll officer .
Clearly I ’m not the only one intrigued by such a setup .
Every time I log on to SugarDaddy.com ( a.k.a. SugarDaddyForMe.com ) , around 2,000 other members are also online .
SeekingArrangement.com , “ The meeting place for mutually beneficial relationships , ” has 100,000 users .
Sugardaddie.com , “ Where the classy , attractive and affluent can meet , ” has 200,000 .
“ These websites make it very efficient , ” says historian Ruth Rosen , the author of a book on prostitution .
“ Because it ’s very clear ; you do n’t have to use coded language . ”
She adds , “ It ’s many fewer hours than working at Wal - Mart , and if it ’s not completely disgusting , the women may see it as just something that does n’t particularly identify them in any way ; in other words , their identity as a person may not be , ‘ I am a prostitute or a sex worker . ’
It ’s just , ‘ I do this in order to support myself . ' ”
Steve Pasternack , Sugardaddie.com ’s founder , offers a more romantic view .
“ It ’s just natural for guys to want to take care of women and women to want to be taken care of , ” he explains .
“ It ’s hard to find a nice guy that ’s successful and so is n’t gonna split the bill at McDonald’s . ”
So true .
Thus , three days later , I am pretending to negotiate with Potential Daddy No. 2 .
He ’s looking for a friend , someone he can trust , someone who is younger and hotter than he — and his wife .
He does n’t want a professional .
He just wants to replace his last beloved sugar baby , who , he claims , slept with him four to eight times a week for $ 300 a pop , which would technically a professional make , but like my first date , he is n’t here to quibble over semantics .
“ Under California law , solicitation is to offer or accept anything of value for sexual services , ” says former San Jose police chief and Hoover Institute fellow Joseph McNamara .
“ But this is right on the line .
If the relationship exists for some time and the guy is mega-rich , he can give you whatever he wants ; it ’s not prostitution anymore .
Let ’s face it — a lot of relationships are like that .
It ’s a common thing . ”
My friend of the disheartening post - graduate - school job search initially scowls when I tell her what Daddy No. 2 offered me .
When I point out that it took me two days to get two offers that pay more than my job at Mother Jones , that I could make $ 9,600 a month — $ 115,200 a year — and the average starting salary for someone with humanities masters ’ like ours is $ 39,808 , she sighs , “ I really do n’t know if I could stand banging some disgusting creep for money .
But there are really some pretty compelling reasons to try . ”
It is the same sentiment that I ’ve elicited from a lawyer , who says , “ I paid 100 grand to go to law school , and I could make more money on my back , ” the same response I get from an executive assistant , a service - industry worker , and a teacher , who hold five degrees between them .
Even Rosen , after asking me how much I ’m “ worth , ” exclaims , “ That ’s a lot !
Think about your income .
Think about mine .
I ’m not advocating this ; I ’m just saying I can understand the calculations . ”

I add to this : " The battle for freedom is never won , and is never lost .
The battle for freedom always continues .
It is never too late , and it is never soon enough , to defend freedom . "
We could WIN the election , and still lose the battle for freedom , if we fail to maintain this mass movement for the defense of liberty .
Ron Paul cannot do everything by himself .
The masses , organized for the defense of liberty , will be needed to influence Congress to support Ron Paul .
We could lose the election , and still WIN the battle for freedom , if we maintain this mass movement for the defense of liberty .
We must formalize the organization of the mass movement for the defense of liberty .
We must now , while the enthusiasm is at its peak .

> What would it take to throw a wrench in McCain 's drive , legally stop > him ?
I would be more than happy to contribute .
Hi John ,
I 've been thinking about that precise point , on and off , all day today , and this is what I would do ( with the necessary funds ) :
A State has the right to commence an original action right in the U.S. Supreme Court .
See Article III here :
" In all cases affecting Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , and those in which a State shall be Party , the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction . "
A WRIT OF PROHIBITION is the correct common law procedure to stop someone from trying to occupy any government office before they have done so .
A WRIT OF QUO WARRANTO is the correct procedure to oust them from office , after that office has been occupied .
Here 's all that we need , by way of paperwork :
State of California
ex rel .
Paul Andrew Mitchell , Private Attorney General
v .
John McCain
APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
First MOTION filed in that case would be a MOTION FOR ORDER TO RESPONDENT TO SHOW CAUSE WHY A WRIT OF PROHIBITION SHOULD NOT ISSUE BARRING HIM FROM THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT .
The ONLY fact to be decided is McCain 's place of birth .
2:1:5 has already been correctly interpreted to require a candidate 's natural birth inside the " United States " as defined by Congress .
So , the applicable common law is " jus soli " ( law of the soil ) ; jus sanguinis ( law of blood ) is not applicable in this case .
Even though it does NOT define " United States " , Black 's Law Dictionary , Eighth Edition , puts the matter into very plain English here :
Natural Born Citizen Clause
The clause of the U.S. Constitution barring persons not born in the United States from the Presidency .
[ Black ’s Law Dictionary , Eighth Edition ]
[ cf. Natural Born Citizen Clause ]
[ emphasis added ]
So , the issue is simple geography and , we 've already determined that Panama was neither a State of the Union , nor a federal Territory or Possession , on the date of his birth .
Piece o' cake , really -- EXCEPT for the fact that 5 of the 9 " Justices " currently on the high Court lack one or more credentials ...
http://www.supremelaw.org/rsrc
/commissions / NO BIG PROBLEM : the Plaintiff will specifically petition the other three ( 3 ) Justices who do have all 4 required credentials , because this will be a good opportunity for the State of California to raise a B - I - G stink about all the missing credentials e.g. 3 past and present " Justices " never obeyed the California Business and Professions Code either !
Tsk Tsk !!
Shall we call this a Tempest in a Teapot , or something else ?? :)
Actually it 's called MAKING A RECORD ( during a bona fide constitutional crisis ) !!
If we wanted to get fancy , we could request a 3 - Justice panel to adjudicate California 's claim that the apportionment of Congressional Districts is skewed by the discrimination against State Citizens .
That is presently the ONLY way to convene a 3 - judge " district court " .
Similarly , Relator may also jump in to demand that the State of California register him to vote in the 2008 Presidential Election , because California voter registration statutes now discriminate against California State Citizens who are not also federal citizens .
Finally , the Relator ( Paul Andrew Mitchell ) NEVER got his chance to adjudicate his CRIMINAL CROSS - COMPLAINT against McCain et al. because the District Clerk in Arizona , Richard Weare , obstructed that CROSS - COMPLAINT .
So , WE MAKE ANOTHER RECORD TOO -- via a MOTION FOR MANDATORY JUDICIAL NOTICE .
That CROSS - COMPLAINT would become a matter of formal Supreme Court judicial history .
The rest would be up to the political process , e.g. what would the GOP would do about all this , particularly if we got moving and filed this BEFORE the Republication National Convention ?
There is a good chance that enough political pressure could be brought to bear upon McCain to withdraw , leaving the field wide open to Ron Paul and another candidates still campaigning by that time , e.g. Huckabee ?
I would LOVE the opportunity to argue this case before the U.S. Supreme Court , and your funds would certainly help make that possible ( if the U.S. Marshals can convince United Airlines to let me board a passenger jet without a driver 's license ) .
Your thoughts are always appreciated , John .

I would estimate that $ 10,000 should be enough to cover all of my expenses ,
professional fees , and all incidentals e.g. time & materials ,
travel and living to & from D.C. , etc .
This is a bargain , as compared to what Microsoft 's ATTORNey charged
Bill Gates in USA v. Microsoft ( reportedly $ 750 PER HOUR for 7 YEARS of work ) .
So , if you collect donations in excess of $ 10,000 , I am very happy if
all of those excess donations are transferred into the Ron Paul for President
campaign .
If you do n't mind the exposure , we would also need some " advance work "
to happen with the downtown San Diego office of the U.S. Marshals :
Someone else will please make the first contact -- to notify them that
I may be REQUIRED to deliver ORAL ARGUMENTS at the U.S. Supreme Court ,
and a U.S. Marshal escort will be needed CHIEFLY because Amtrak will NOT
allow me onto any of their trains without a Driver 's License or State - issued I.D .
In California , one can NOT obtain either without an SSN , and
I am protesting Social Security .
Thus , I have no SSN , and
no D.L. and no State - issued I.D .
Same is true of all commercial airlines operating in and out of downtown San Diego .
However , U.S. Marshals did accept this AFFIDAVIT OF IDENTIFICATION
permitting me to enter the Federal District Courthouse in Sacramento
immediately after 9/11/2001 :
Washington , D.C. , is just too far for me to walk , or hitchhike !
LOL !!
BEST WAY is to initiate a routine telephone call to the
U.S. Marshals in downtown San Diego , showing TOTAL RESPECT
AND TOTAL CIVILITY ( no emergency here , OK ? ) , beginning with
a request to speak with the U.S. Marshal in their Federal Witness
Security Program who is assigned to security of Paul Andrew Mitchell .
I cannot disclose any of their names to you , however , even if I wanted to
( for obvious security reasons ) .
FYI : Federal Witness Security Program is DIFFERENT FROM
Federal Witness Protection Program : in the former , there is no
need to re-locate a witness , change his name or create an entirely
new identity for the witness .
Nevertheless , under 18 USC 1512
and 1513 , they are required by law to maintain my security .
OK : you now know what to do .
p.s. I think we should keep this litigation SEPARATE FROM
the Ron Paul campaign , as much as possible : it will be
MUCH BETTER , in the long run , if Ron Paul can honestly say that
this was NOT " his idea " but Paul Andrew Mitchell 's original idea .
Re : McCain eligibilit y

The " United States " ( federal government ) is not a corporation .
See U.S. v. Cooper Corporation , cited and quoted here :
More details re : C.J. Marshall's " dictum " in Bouvier 's Law Dictionary
are elaborated here :
The entire U.S. Constitution was expressly extended
into D.C. in 1871 :

What the public needs to understand is that FOX , ABC , CBS , CNN , MSNBC and the other established * mainstream " mass media " / news sources [ * see definition @ Wikipedia.org ] are perpetrating criminal fraud ( via omissions , distortions and outright lies ) and a deliberate censorship of Dr. Ron Paul in 2008 Presidential race — with malice and aforethought and evil intent to control the 2008 presidential elections .
This is an outrage and " We the People " need to organize against this dangerous plot and TAKE ACTION by filing " class action " criminal charges and civil suits against the owners and executives of these news sources .
This illegal censorship is not only harming Americans because they wield the power to control the outcome of elections via the quantity and quality of the news coverage they provide the candidates ; it constitutes an unAmerican and antiAmerican criminal enterprise ; not to fail to mention a violation of the first amendment / freedom of the press .
These accused individuals — the elitist media executives — exercise monopolized and Fascist - control over media / news sources with intent to get the candidate preferred by them elected while simultaneously wrongfully hiding and / or playing down the true facts , popularity and success of the Ron Paul campaign .
-
Please spread this message and let 's get criminal charges and a class action lawsuit executed against this dangerous organized crime syndicate identified as the present mainstream media outlets which are collaborating in a RICO [ Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO ) Act , Title 18 , United States Code , Sections 1961 - 1968 ; reference : www.ricoact.com] conspiracy to censor Dr. Ron Paul and control the outcome of the 2008 Presidential Election .
This is definitely " RICO " if it can be shown that any of the accused media executives have donated money to any of the other presidential candidates , directly or indirectly !
The accused individuals herein have wrongfully utilized their outrageous MONOPOLY over the media across America to injure Dr. Ron Paul and his millions of supporters ; all Americans , in fact .
These accused individuals need to go to prison upon conviction .
They need to be criminally prosecuted and have their personal assets seized .
They need to have their Federal FCC licenses revoked for participating in this criminal conspiracy .

COMMENTS by Clarence Douglas Malcolm .
As the private criminal investigator for Gunderson & Associates Professional Investigations I am amazed at how effectively the American public has been dumbed - down , especially with regard to any knowledge of Law , the Federal Constitution , their respective State constitution and common law maxims .
The American Bar Association has succeeded quite well in monopolizing this knowledge for the exclusive financial benefit of their powerful private " special interest group . "
This is why some people cannot recognize how felony crime and conspiracy is afoot by the mainstream mass media moguls to injure Dr. Ron Paul and the American people .
The elistist " billionaire boys club " of corporate media barons — only a few in number — have effectively MONOPOLIZED the entire mass media / news service industry for the benefit of their wealthy " social class " and they control the outcome of all elections in this nation with the tremendous power they enjoy via this outrageous and illegal MONOPOLY which definitely violates the letter , spirit and intent of our anti-monopoly and anti-trust laws !!!
Everyone who has read the criminal complaint executed by Ted Gunderson and me need to go study a few definitions from any good law dictionary ( e.g. Black 's Law Dictionary ) including : " monopoly " … " conspiracy " … " fraud " …" RICO " ( organized " racketeering " ) … then … they may begin to understand how diabolical and damaging the controlled media has become .
-
There is really no such thing as " free press " because it is owned by persons all belonging to the wealthy class of our society in America and they have an agenda … AS THEY ALSO HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE OR BREAK PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES by how much coverage they provide them and by the quality of coverage provided .
We need to take a hard look at what 's happening with Dr. Paul — at how these mass - media - moguls are controlling the outcome of elections in America .
Look at the lies , the distortions , the OMMISSIONS and the boldface lies they perpetrate .
This is not only unethical , immoral , unfair , unAmerican and antiAmerican , it is criminal and it constitutes a very real and intentional conspiracy against Dr. Paul and the American People who want fair and unbiased reporting .
-
The News Services have a moral duty to be impartial , ethical and honest in their reporting because the public has an continuing interest in the " news worthy " news they report .
Ron Paul 's remarkable success in several straw polls deserves the same national publicity that Mitt Romney received when he purportedly won the Iowa Straw Poll .
The opposite is happening , however , with regard to Ron Paul .
He 's being wrongfully CENSORED .
Dr. Paul would definitely win the Republican nomination were he given the same special coverage afforded to Elitist - preferred lackeys : Romney , Guilliani and Hillary .
The conspiracy is intended to promote the candidates PREFERRED by the media moguls ( who establish the internal corporate policies for their respective media services ) and ignore the candidates they least favor .
This is a terrible fraud against the American public who stupidly or unwittingly trust the news services to be honest and impartial — a blind trust for the most part .
I feel sorry for those individuals who lack the insight and intelligence to recognized how the present corrupt media establishment is RIGGING and , in fact , powerfully CONTROLLING the outcome of U.S. elections .
It is truly operating as a criminal enterprise .
-
RICO requires two or more predicate acts perpetrated in violation of federal law with a property nexus and involving two or more individuals acting in conspiracy to perpetrate the criminal acts .
So , how is Ron Paul 's property rights being violated ?
C'mon … think … he 's applying for a job along with 9 [ or whatever # it is now ] other candidates on the Republican side … and that job is going to pay over $ 200,000 per year , the presidents salary !!!
This is the " property " nexus .
The media moguls are providing preferential treatment and financial support to those candidates who will promote their financial interests and agenda .
A media conspiracy exists to deprive Dr. Ron Paul of his fair opportunity to acquire the " position " he is seeking within the " federal corporation . "
That 's enough for now .
Wake Up ! … and come to grips with the fact that America is a nation of corporations , by corporations and for corporations — benefitting Wall Street / Banking Interests …and Dr. Paul is a threat to this " establishment " because he does not hide the fact that when he becomes president he is going to put " We the People " FIRST … rather than last as the present situation exists .

Dear Fellow Ron Paul Supporters ,
I 'm using an MLM Grassroots tactic to email to every one of my contacts in my data - base to alert them concerning this 8 minute video concerning the Federal Reserve .
Why ?
Because our fearless leader , modern forefather and prophet Ron Paul has been warning Americans about our economy and the falling dollar for a long time now and it is becoming a major concern that needs to be addressed .
Time is everything when it comes to getting people to take action and now is the time to strike .
Here is the letter and video link I 've been sending out to my entire contact data base .
Just cut and paste and pass it on .
Dear Fellow Friends & Countrymen ,
I am sending what could possibly be the most important 8 minute video you will ever see in your lifetime !
It has nothing to do with a business opportunity or joining any organization .
It has everything to do with saving your beloved Country !
We are in an economic crisis that has moved us into a recession .
Since 1913 , our American dollar has been reduced to a value of 4 cents .
For the sake of your future , your kid's future and the future of this Country , I beg you to watch this and pass it on to 3 or more email contacts you know .
Using a 3x12 matrix chart , if we can get everyone to email 3 personal contacts and have them duplicate the same process 12 levels deep , we will have over 500,000 people watching this brief video within a matter of weeks !
Once again , the key is for everyone to do their responsibility by emailing just 3 .

Let 's push Ron Paul over the top and fund his $ 5 Million Boost !
Dr. Paul is beginning to make headway , if we can raise $ 10,000,000.00 - even better .
We must ensure that Ron Paul , his message , and WE THE PEOPLE are taken seriously .
Money Talks PERIOD .FEBRUARY 5 ( Super Tuesday ) News of the amount of money raised will be reported on the 2nd or 3rd of February .
Talk of Ron Paul 's longevity and financial backing will echo .
Then on the 5th , primary voters ( Independants , Swing , Unsettled Thompson Conservatives , and post Kucinich voters ) will have Ron Paul still fresh in their minds !
APRIL 15 ( The Beginning of the End ) On April 15 , 2008 the largest protest in recorded history will take place .
The protest will be global in scale and peaceful in nature .
Please watch the most important video in the world below .

You Say You Want A Revolution ?
Every movement in history has faced some time of testing , some experience that either forges it into something strong and unified , or forces it to fade away into the history books as another failed experiment .
Dr. Paul has written to you that we are heading straight for Super Tuesday .
Our opponents are free to beat up on each other and wear themselves down while we gather our supporters and prepare to storm the convention with delegates .
Last night , over 60,000 people stood up and asked for an end to the runaway violation of our liberties .
But contrary to the impression you may be getting from the mainstream media , no national delegates have yet been won in Florida .
Those delegates will only be awarded between February 6 and April 30 at delegate selection caucuses , and many of those delegates will be supporters of Dr. Paul .
Ron Paul is the only candidate not to give up on any state in the Republican race , and just as we competed strongly in overlooked states like Nevada and Louisiana , so too will we compete in Maine , Minnesota , and other states that the so - called " top- tier " candidates are content to ignore .
Now , as the focus shifts to Super Tuesday , Rudy 's campaign is crushed , Huckabee is losing momentum by the day , and McCain and Romney are fighting over who is the most liberal .
We 've been here before .
In 1776 , despite a courageous effort at holding onto the city , George Washington ceded New York and quickly retreated to New Jersey .
1777 brought the British recapture of Fort Ticonderoga , as well as American defeats at Brandywine and Germantown .
And then , during the winter of 1777 - 1778 , Washington and his army faced perhaps their most humiliating moment , forced to endure a harsh Pennsylvania winter with limited supplies at Valley Forge .
The American revolutionaries dealt with their defeats , focused on their goals , and emerged from Valley Forge as a force that would defeat the most powerful nation on earth .
Our momentum is building .
Each one of us , from Dr. Paul himself down to the grassroots supporter who donates the last $ 5 he or she can give , is focused on the goal .
Early in the struggle for American independence , George Washington wrote : " Perseverance and spirit have done wonders in all ages . "
Even then , Washington realized that a fierce struggle for self - government can only be won with a spirit of determination equal to the challenge .
Today , in the midst of our new revolution , let 's consider Washington 's words once again .
The task before us is enormous .
The foes of liberty are deeply entrenched , and they will not relinquish their power without a struggle .
But fighting in our favor is the unconquerable human spirit , the innate desire to be free .
We must embrace this inner strength , dig in our heels , and persevere , just as Washington and his rag - tag colonials , the first American grassroots patriots , did before us .
And if we must pass through a Valley Forge or two along the way to victory , let those times of testing temper the steel of our determination .
If Ron Paul is to continue his fight for liberty to the Republican Convention , we need your help in two critical ways :
1. Become a precinct leader today :
It 's easy , but more importantly , it 's vital to Ron Paul 's success : https://voters.ronpaul2008.com .
2. Donate : Just as the Continental Congress supplied General Washington 's troops in the field , we too must raise as much money as we can to equip our grassroots supporters .
Help us win this revolution and usher in a new era of freedom , peace , and prosperity .

Wow !
What a night .
Chaos and clarity battled tonight .
Clarity won and I for one am very happy about it .
Now we get the one - on - one scenario I laid out a few weeks ago but which was delayed by Romney 's victory in Michigan ( won by his embrace of economic fascism ) .
Again , let me mimic Michael Corleone :
Romney 's dead .
Giuliani's dead .
Huckabee 's dead .
Rudy will now drop out and endorse McCain .
Les belligerents need to stick together .
Huckabee will stay in to draw votes from Romney and hope to get VP .
( Why anyone would want to be Vice President beats me . )
Romney 's attempt to buy the presidency with his personal wealth has failed .
He outspent McCain ten to one in TV ads and got whipped anyway .
His speech tonight looked like a funeral .
McCain was civil to all his opponents tonight except one : Ron Paul .
That was the tip - off that this is now a two - man race .
Ron Paul got 60,000 votes tonight in Florida even though there has been a media blackout of his campaign since three days before Iowa .
We are already being told that McCain is a lock ; it 's all over .
That 's the conventional wisdom and anything else is just wishful Paulian thinking .
But , as with all my prognostications this year and last -- including that Rudy had " zero chance " to win when he was leading the polls by 14 % -- my analysis is based on facts .
Such as : John McCain has only eight percent of the delegates he needs .
And : McCain is a deeply flawed candidate who remains unpopular with the Republican base .
In spite of taking a beating in the early primaries , the General ordered his troops to hold their fire and wait for the right time to strike back .
The time is now !
The time is now to drive the beltway elite all the way back to their homeland in Washington DC .
The troops are fresh .
Morale remains high .
There 's money in the bank and the orders are to fight on .
We appreciate you !

" I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies . .
If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency , first by inflation , then by deflation , the banks and corporations that will grow up around . . willdeprive the people of all property until their children wake - up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered ...
The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people , to whom it properlybelongs .
" -- Thomas Jefferson
“ The military - industrial complex , the biased media , the big banks , the Fed , the waterboarders , and the IRS do n’t like what we ’re doing .
But every good American is applauding us , and daring to hope for a better future . ” -- Ron PaulWhen the Nazis came for the communists , I remained silent ; I was not a communist .
When they locked up the social democrats , I remained silent ; I was not a social democrat .
When they came for the trade unionists , I did not speak out ; I was not a trade unionist .
When they came for the Jews , I did not speak out ; I was not a Jew .
When they came for me , there was no one left to speak out .
Friedrich Gustav Martin Niemöller " Failure of government programs prompts more determined efforts , while the loss of liberty is ignored or rationalized away .
Whether it ’s the war against poverty , drugs , terrorism , or the current Hitler of the day , an appeal to patriotism is used to convince the people that a little sacrifice of liberty , here and there , is a small price to pay .
The results , though , are frightening and will soon become even more so . "
Honorable Dr. Ron Paul 12/9/03 More Ron Paul Quotes
“ " The liberties of our country , the freedoms of our civil Constitution are worth defending at all hazards ; it is our duty to defend them against all attacks .
We have received them as a fair inheritance from our worthy ancestors .
They purchased them for us with toil and danger and expense oftreasure and blood .
It will bring a mark of everlasting infamy on the present generation – enlightened as it is if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by violence without a struggle , or to be cheated out of them by the artifices of designing men . "
- Samuel Adams ” GO RON PAUL !
