About 11 hours before the Deepwater Horizon exploded , a disagreement took place between the top manager for oil giant BP PLC on the drilling rig and his counterpart for the rig's owner , Transocean Ltd. , concerning the final steps in shutting down the nearly completed well , according to a worker 's sworn statement .
Michael Williams , a Transocean employee who was chief electronics technician on the rig , said there was " confusion " between those high - ranking officials in an 11 a.m. meeting on the day of the rig blast , according to a sworn statement from Mr. Williams reviewed by The Wall Street Journal .
Mr. Williams himself attended the meeting .
The confusion over the drilling plan in the final hours leading up to the explosion could be key to understanding the causes of the blowout and ultimately who was responsible .
What is known from drilling records and congressional testimony is that after the morning meeting , the crew began preparations to remove from the drill pipe heavy drilling " mud " that provides pressure to keep down any gas , and to replace this mud with lighter seawater .
Ultimately , the crew removed the mud before setting a final 300 - foot cement plug that is typically poured as a last safeguard to prevent combustible gas from rising to the surface .
Indeed , they never got the opportunity to set the plug .
WASHINGTON — President Obama is traveling to the shadow of Wall Street on Thursday to counter what he calls “ the furious efforts of industry lobbyists ” trying to weaken or kill new financial regulations that he says are needed to stave off a second Great Depression .
As the Senate debates how to rewrite rules governing the financial industry , Mr. Obama will lay out the elements he insists must be in any legislation to get his signature .
Among them are more consumer protections , limits on the size of banks and the risks they can take , reforms on executive compensation and greater transparency for controversial securities known as derivatives .
In flying to New York City , the president wants to confront the financial industry more directly through a sharp speech just a few minutes ’ subway ride from Wall Street , and with some of its leading corporate titans in the audience .
After castigating their “ failure of responsibility ” in recent years , he intends to call on them to stop resisting tighter regulation through the army of lobbyists now staked out on Capitol Hill .
“ I am sure that many of those lobbyists work for some of you , ” Mr. Obama plans to say , according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House for release on Thursday morning .
“ But I am here today because I want to urge you to join us , instead of fighting us in this effort .
I am here because I believe that these reforms are , in the end , not only in the best interest of our country , but in the best interest of our financial sector . ”

What comes to mind when you hear the word " tattoo ? "
Well , yes , there is the needle .
And , for some , a certain stigma or seedy association .
But one in three Americans between the ages of 18 and 35 has a tattoo .
And for them , it 's art .
Tattoos are art for the Institute of Contemporary Art , too .
Right now , the ICA is hosting a show of tattoo - inspired work by Mexican artist Dr. Lakra .
Just to be clear , Dr. Lakra 's exhibition is not a " tattoo show . "
While he does ink skin , he also puts tattoo - like illustrations on found objects .
Demons , snakes and gang symbols cover old pin-up girl prints , advertisements , even plastic Kewpie dolls .
That 's the focus of this show — Dr. Lakra 's first solo museum exhibition in the United States .
At the ICA , Dr. Lakra paints murals in the gallery as museum workers move crates of his art during installation .

Crouching near a lift , the bearded , soft - spoken artist moves a thin paint brush across the wide surface of a gallery wall .
His hand is covered with tiny tattoos , but here Dr. Lakra is creating looming imagery , almost like effigies .
" They 're a mixture of everything — this is like Egyptian , this is from Thailand , this is from Africa , that one is Aztec , " Dr. Lakra explains , pointing to different images on the wall .
Dr. Lakra has traveled the world studying traditions of tattooing in different cultures .
The themes in his vast body of work range from the ritualistic to the subversive .
Even his nickname means " Dr. Delinquent " in Spanish .
The 38 - year - old artist started tattooing underground as a teenager in Mexico .
But today , tattoos are more accepted .
And while that 's gratifying , Dr. Lakra says part of him laments the street form going mainstream .
" Before it was more , I think , not profound , but intimate , maybe , " Lakra says .
Tattooing on skin — highly personal and awfully permanent — is one of humankind 's oldest art forms .
Tattoo - like scars were found on the earliest men .
Ancient kings and warriors had them .
Charles Darwin wrote about them .
In his art , Dr. Lakra mashes this history with more modern imagery from comic books , Mexican wrestlers and Day of the Dead skulls .
Pedro Alonzo curated Dr. Lakra 's show .
" He 's very informed about this , this is all coming out in his work , " Alonzo says .
" And in a way it 's a challenge to us to get over our preconceived notions and our stigma attached to tattooing and say , ' Hey , this has been around a long time and it's not just , you know , hookers and sailors . ' "
Or criminals .
That said , Alonzo believes there 's a huge audience for this type of art work since more Americans have tattoos than ever before .

An ICA Visit With The Tattooing " Old Guard "
But how is the tattoo - inspired art exhibit playing with the tattoo community in Boston ?
To find out , I visit Fat Ram , a tattoo artist , who opened Fat Ram 's Pumpkin Tattoo shop in Jamaica Plain when tattooing became legal in Massachusetts — only a decade ago .
He was unabashedly skeptical about his preferred medium 's jump from skin to museum walls .
" The museums just like , ' Oh , new artsy - fartsy guy has to do with tattoos , that 's trendy in the media , let 's push this as being the latest thing , ' " Ram says .
" And so my reaction is to resist against that . "
But , with a little cajoling , Ram reluctantly agrees to head to the ICA to see Dr. Lakra 's show with me .

First , Ram 's eyes linger on a group of framed photos from old Mexican pin-up magazines .
Dr. Lakra drew tattoos on their flawless skin .
" It 's just funny , " Ram says , " you know the images are like traditional images from early American tattooing combined with current iterations of them and gang tattoos . "
Then there 's a dictator with Maori tattoos on his face .
And a traditional wood block print of a Japanese courtesan , tattooed , blood dripping from her mouth .
She 's holding a heroin needle and a demon or ghoul watches her in the background .
" I love altering images like that , and so it 's interesting in that sense , " Ram says .
" It 's just so bizarre and ironic that it 's in this setting . "
In the end , Fat Ram says he is most impressed by Lakra 's wall murals .
But , as for the exhibition as a whole , he says nothing has been resolved .
" All my reservations about it and my questions I would ask , and what I feel that people in my industry are going to be wondering , none of those things have been answered , " he says .
Ram thinks about it .
All art , he says , is a personal and subjective experience , in the museum or — especially — on your own bicep .
I suspect Dr. Lakra would agree .
The BRIC group of the world 's four biggest emerging powers has a fundamental role in creating a new world order , Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Thursday .
Lula was speaking at the end of a summit in Brasilia with the leaders of China , India and Russia .
The countries reiterated their call for developing nations to have a bigger role in global economic and financial decision - making .
PM pitches for close cooperation among BRIC nations
Noting that India , Russia , China and Brazil are resource - rich , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Friday pitched for close cooperation among them in the fields of energy and food security besides tapping potential in other sectors like trade and investment , science and technology and infrastructure .
Addressing the Brazil - Russia - India - China ( BRIC )
Summit here , he said the four countries can benefit by sharing their experiences in the field of inclusive growth .
" We are four large countries with abundant resources , large populations and diverse societies ...
We aspire for rapid growth for ourselves and for an external environment that is conducive to our development goals , " Singh told the second Summit of the four - nation grouping here in the Brazilian capital .
Contending that the people of the four countries " expect us to work together so as to bring the benefits of inclusive social and economic development to them " , he identified energy and food security as two specific areas where they can work together .
" Our grouping includes two of the largest energy producers and two of the largest consumers in the world .
We can cooperate in both upstream and downstream areas , and in the development of new fuels and clean energy technologies , " he said .
Similarly , BRIC countries are both large producers and consumers of agricultural products , he said , proposing that the four nations should consider putting in place an architecture of food security that focusses on increasing agricultural productivity , better land use , sustainable farming practices and agro-processing .
Besides this , there is vast potential for cooperation in areas such as science and technology , trade and investment , pharmaceuticals and infrastructure , Singh said .
" Investments in human capital will create new sources of growth . "
The Prime Minister said BRIC countries have an important role to play in the shaping the pace , direction and sustainability of global economic growth .
Recalling that the four countries had at the last Summit decided to commission a BRIC Study on which way the world economy will move in the period ahead , Singh said India has circulated the draft terms of reference for the study and " we would be happy to carry this idea forward . "
On the global economic and financial crisis , he said while it appears that that it is " behind us , it is still early to say that we are on the path of long term recovery . "
Singh said a lot would depend on how the developed economies fare .
" Sustainable recovery will also depend on several factors such as enhanced investment for infrastructure development , stable capital flows to the developing markets , appropriate macroeconomic adjustments , and avoiding complacency in the area of financial sector reforms , " Singh said , adding financial inclusion will be a major determinant of success .
Singh asked the leaders of other three BRIC countries that the grouping should prepare for the forthcoming G - 20 Summits in Toronto and Seoul .
" Their outcomes need to be supportive of the post crisis - phase of the recovery process .
This requires the avoidance of protectionism in all its forms , commitment to a fair and rule - based trading system , reform of international financial institutions and better regulation and supervision , " he said .
Singh said capital adequacy of international institutions should be ensured to fund development needs and for this , Finance Ministers of the four countries should be in regular touch with each other .
Noting that BRIC nations represent an important voice in the global climate discourse , Singh said , " despite its shortcomings " , the Copenhagen Conference did generate a broad understanding on several contentious issues .
Referring to the next summit on climate change in Mexico in 2011 , he said the BRIC approach to the Cancun Conference should be anchored within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , the Kyoto Protocol and the Bali Roadmap .
" Technology will be a key element in our strategy to meet the challenge of climate change .
Each of us has our own strengths in climate - friendly technologies .
If we pool our best scientific and technological resources , BRIC nations can set a fine example in promoting collaborative development , deployment and dissemination of clean energy and renewable technologies , " Singh said .
He said BRIC countries are also uniquely placed to contribute to reforming the architecture of global governance .
" A genuine reform of the Security Council by expansion in its permanent membership as well as non-permanent membership and improvement in its working methods is essential to make the United Nations reflective of contemporary realities , " Singh emphasised .
On terrorism , he said it poses a " special challenge to our development efforts " and all the four countries should unite in efforts to combat this scourge .
The BRIC countries should also step up cooperation in addressing other non-traditional threats to security , the Prime Minister said .

An Ohio death row inmate was executed Tuesday for the 1988 murder of a 16 - year - old girl , officials said .
Darryl Durr , 46 , was pronounced dead at 10:36 a.m. at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville , according to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction .
He was executed by lethal injection for killing 16 - year - old Angel Vincent in 1988 .
Vincent , a friend of Durr 's girlfriend at the time , was abducted from her Elyria , Ohio , home on January 31 , 1988 .
Her body was found nearly three months later , stuffed into two traffic barrels placed together at a park , according to an account of the case given by the Ohio Supreme Court in a 1991 decision and cited by the Ohio Parole Board .
Durr 's girlfriend at first told Vincent 's mother that the girl must have run away .
She came forward after Durr was arrested for two unrelated rapes in September 1988 and told police she knew Durr had abducted and killed Vincent , according to the parole board .
She said she had been afraid to speak out because he had threatened her life and that of her child .
Durr did not request a special last meal Monday night but had a dinner served to other prisoners -- beef and noodles , greens , cauliflower , peaches , apple sauce , white bread and Kool - Aid , according to the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction .
However , Durr did not eat the meal , the facility said .
Interviewed by the parole board in 2009 , Durr said that " he wished to convey his apologies to the victims for their tragic loss " but maintained his innocence in Vincent 's death .
The board -- in a 7 - 0 vote -- denied Durr 's clemency request .
Durr was one of two Ohio death row inmates whom Gov. Ted Strickland granted temporary reprieves in October amid confusion over capital punishment in the state .
The moves came after the botched execution attempt of Romell Broom in September , which raised questions about the state 's lethal injection procedure .
Technicians tried without success for two hours on September 15 to find suitable veins on Broom to insert the deadly chemical cocktail .
Ohio switched to a new one - drug method of lethal injection and began using it in December .
The method had never been tried on U.S. death row inmates .
It relies on a single dose of sodium thiopental injected into a vein .

Shanghai's Metro , Now World 's Longest , Continues to Grow Quickly as China Invests in Rapid Transit
» System will carry about five million passengers a day .
Dozens of other Chinese cities are spending billions of dollars on similar grade - separated transit systems .
If China ’s massive investment in high - speed rail is impressive , its huge spending binge in local rapid transit is remarkable .
And nowhere is that record more dramatic than in Shanghai , the world ’s most populous city proper .
Just fifteen years after the first segment of its first metro line opened , the city ’s metro network has gained the title as the world ’s longest with the opening of a section of Line 10 last week .
This followed years of continuous construction and the opening of pieces of Lines 2 , 9 , and 11 over the past month .
In anticipation of the inauguration of the city ’s Expo 2010 event on May 1st , Line 13 will open sometime in the next two weeks .
Now Shanghai offers 282 stations and 420 km ( 261 mi ) of lines , compared to 408 km in London and 368 km in New York , which now have the world ’s second and third - largest rapid transit networks .
Unlike those cities , which have only minor line extensions planned , Shanghai ’s expansion plans are only half complete : not only does the city have 140 km of more lines currently under construction and intended for service by 2012 , but it has an additional 300 km planned to be ready for operations by 2020 , by which time this city alone will have more rapid transit mileage than the entire country of Japan .
The Shanghai Metro is now capable of handling about five million passengers a day ; the system is likely to become the world ’s most-used , passing Tokyo and Moscow , by the time the full construction program is complete .
Beijing is pursuing a similarly extension metro expansion project , but these cities are n’t alone : twelve Chinese municipalities currently have rapid transit , nineteen more have systems under construction , and an additional seventeen new networks are in planning .
The national government has committed $ 150 billion to the projects by 2015 , though additional funds originate from the municipalities themselves , such as the progressive and independent City of Shanghai .
It ’s a country - wide investment in urban transportation unparalleled in human history .
The American government , managing a much wealthier country than China , typically commits about two billion dollars a year to transit capital projects nationwide .
China ’s aggressive efforts are a response to the country ’s rapid urbanization , which has brought tens of millions of rural peasants into the cities as a result of increasing economic development .
Though the Chinese automobile market is now larger than that of the United States , when compared on a per capita basis , it is still relatively small , especially considering that most Chinese car purchases are of first vehicles , not second or third , as are typical American consumer investments .
This means that these quickly growing cities must respond with significant spending on improved public transportation — and they ’ve chosen rapid transit as their preferred technology .
Specifically , Shanghai ’s effort is an attempt to avoid American - style commuting habits even as its population increases in prosperity .
With a per capita GDP three times the national average , Shanghai must endeavor to ensure that its growing number of middle - class inhabitants do n’t clog the streets with their cars .
The European and North American experience shows that it can be done :
In the first half of the 20th century , cities like New York , Berlin , and London reacted to a growing population and densification of land use by constructing extensive rapid transit networks and the results today are cities with high rates of public transportation use in spite of wealthy populations ;
Shanghai is likely to follow in the same mold .
But the extent and rapidity by which Shanghai is expanding its system reinforces the high - speed rail - driven sense that the West is falling behind , at least in infrastructure investment .
Though no American and European cities are growing as quickly as their Chinese counterparts , there are significant demands for transportation improvements that are being unmet in virtually every major Western metropolitan region , with the possible exception of Madrid , Barcelona , and Paris , which are all spending billions to extend their transit networks out of the traditional urban core and into near suburbs .
These neighborhoods have for years been deprived of adequate public transportation despite a real demand ; most regions , however , are n’t spending on new line capacity .
Unlike the U.S. or Europe , China benefits from strong economic growth , making these investments more feasible , especially since construction costs are lower .
Nonetheless , if Shanghai ’s construction is so extensive as to be impossible to replicate in the more affluent parts of the world , current efforts in most major American and European cities are modest , doing very little in terms of transportation to respond to significant increases in population since the first half of the 20th century .
They ’re not making much of an effort to prepare for their increasingly urban futures by building new transit links .
China is .

Yesterday , we announced that the Bespin server is going to be rebuilt from the ground up in node.js with a decentralized model in mind .
I ’ve seen a lot of positive reaction to that , which is great because I think it ’s an important step forward for Bespin .
We also mentioned on bespin-core that we have changed from SproutCore , which we adopted during the “ reboot ” of the Bespin client side code , to jQuery .
A handful of people have suggested that we should just build our own “ framework ” .
Our decision to use jQuery came after much deliberation , so I thought I ’d go into a little detail about that since this question has now come up many times .
What is Bespin ?
It ’s hard to say if something is a good choice for Bespin without actually being clear about what Bespin is .
Bespin is a customizable programming environment for web applications .
There are at least two correct ways to interpret that sentence :
Bespin is a programming environment that you can include in your web applications that you create Bespin is a programming environment for creating web applications
Early in Bespin ’s life , people were embedding the editor in their own applications , but this was n’t well supported .
We made a decision to make that a well - supported use of our project and that change has major ramifications for the project .
Frameworks vs. Libraries
A libraryÂ is something you call from your code
A framework is something that calls your code
Note that this definition says nothing about the size ( libraries could certainly be bigger than frameworks , and vice versa ) .
This definition also makes no judgments about which is better or whether the code is loosely coupled or tightly coupled .
Frameworks can make building an application really fast .
They do a great job of reducing the amount of code you need to write , as long as your application fits the framework ’s design and intended applications well .
The farther you stray from the path , the more resistance you ’ll get as you try to add new things .
SproutCore is a framework .
It attaches event handlers to the page and delegates those events to views that you create .
Further , it has a powerful declarative binding / observation system that it updates automatically as part of a runloop that it maintains .
It ’s really quite a powerful GUI toolkit that runs entirely in your browser .
For Bespin “ the application ” ( the software that runs at bespin.mozillalabs.com ) , SproutCore seemed like it would be a good fit because what we were doing was more like a desktop app than a website .
On the other hand , for Bespin “ the customizable , embeddable editor ” , the tools we want and need are not such a great fit for a framework .
Bespin needs to fit in well with what people are already doing on their pages .
Why use a library at all ?
OK , so Bespin and frameworks are not a good match .
But there are plenty of libraries out there ( jQuery , YUI , Prototype , Mootools , Dojo , Closure , and even MochiKit about which I ’ve written extensively in the past )
Why not just build our own set of utilities , especially since Bespin exclusively targets modern browsers ?
We wrestled a bit with that very question .
Even with modern browsers , some conveniences are still handy .
Here ’s a simple case I can point to : addClass .
A function that will add a CSS class to a DOM node .
We all need to do that at times , but it ’s not yet a method offered by the DOM , nor is it in any proposed standard that I ’ve seen .
I believe that every JavaScript library offers addClass .
Their APIs vary , but it ’s in there somewhere .
We could create our own library with our own version of addClass .
But that has disadvantages :
we have to write it / test it ourselves or copy it from somewhere
we have to maintain it
for people extending Bespin , there ’s that much more surface area that they need to learn
we need to write docs for it
we ca n’t use fancier things people create ( overlays , trees , etc. ) without porting them
if people already have a library on their page , our utilities will add additional size
There are probably other disadvantages as well .
The only advantages I see to rolling our own are :
we get exactly the functionality we need and no more
we maintain our own release schedule for it
We are considering a “ best of both worlds ” approach as well , if we feel like slimming down Bespin Embedded “ Drop In ” ( the prepackaged single .js file ) even further : we take just the functionality we ’re interested in from a library ( jQuery ) and create our own mini library that uses the exact same API .
Our modules / build tooling can make it transparent to switch between the mini library , the full library and one that is already on the page .
Why jQuery ?
As I mentioned earlier , when it comes to utilities the libraries all offer a very similar collection of functions .
We do n’t want to use a library that “ leaks ” onto the page , either through the creation of globals or the extension of built - in prototypes .
That still leaves a number of choices .
We evaluated some , but ultimately decided on jQuery because :
It ’s very popular , which increases the chance that it ’s already on the page ( and decreases the size of Bespin )
many people are already familiar with it
there ’s lots of good documentation available
there are many decent open source plugins that people can use when extending Bespin
It ’s worth noting that these are not technical reasons to use jQuery , and these largely only matter because jQuery is popular and Bespin is intended to be used on other peoples ’ pages .
The choice of jQuery for Bespin is not a technical choice .
We certainly like jQuery , but we like the other libraries as well .
Not just jQuery
One more important point : Bespin Embedded is still designed to be easily built into a self - contained .js file .
The current code in our repository puts only one name on the page ( bespin ) and everything else is hidden away conveniently inside of there .
The next release of Bespin Embedded will be less than half the size of the previous release , even with jQuery bundled in .
So , Bespin will be a good addition to your application , regardless of which JavaScript library you might use for the rest of your code .
Summary
Bespin has had unusual and competing requirements along the way and as we ’ve zeroed in on exactly what Bespin is and will become , we ’ve changed our infrastructure to match the needs of the project .
We ’re really excited about how far we ’ve come since “ rebooting ” the project and are looking forward to these next few releases that lead up to a “ 1.0 ” of the Bespin project .
John - David Dalton commented via a gist .
He points out that unless we are using a compatible jQuery , people who already have jQuery on the page will not have any size advantage .
Of course , if we have our own library no one will gain a size advantage .
With respect to Bespin users being able to use whatever library they wish without porting additional widgets , we ( the Bespin team ) want to be able to use things like trees and such without having to port them to our own library .
Bespin users do remain free to use whatever they wish without porting anything .
Finally , regarding “ fourth time ’s a charm ” , I ’ll just note that the 0.8 version number of the next release of Bespin is actually significant .
The client APIs are settling .
Thanks for the comment , jdalton !
ClassList API in HTML5
I was happy to hear from Thomas Bassetto that addClass has indeed been rendered redundant by HTML5 ’s ClassList API which looks great .
element.classList is available today in Firefox 3.6 and , according to the Mozilla Hacks article , WebKit is planning to also support the API .
The current version of Chrome does not have it yet .
LINDEN
--
The remains of two bodies were found in several garbage bags in Linden at about 9:45 a.m. this morning , though the identities have not been released , according to police .
Updated coverage :
( 6:50 p.m . )
Dismembered bodies of man , woman are found in six trash bags on Linden street
“ Our public works people were picking up garbage , ” said Linden police Detective Lt. James Sarnicki .
“ One of the garbage bags appeared to have part of a human body protruding from it . ”
More Linden Coverage
The sanitation workers found the bags at the corner of Essex and Cranford avenues , by Peach Orchard Brook .
Sarnicki said the body parts did n’t seem badly decomposed .
“ Decomposition was n’t so bad they could n’t tell it was human , ” Sarnicki said .
Police went to the scene and verified the bags contained human remains , and police called the Union County Prosecutor ’s Office and the Union County Sheriff ’s Crime Scene Unit .
Many questions about the body remain , including the deceased person ’s identity and how it ended up in Linden .
“ How long it ’s been there , I do n’t know , ” Sarnicki said .
Local and county investigators are still on the scene .
The Union County Prosecutor 's Office has scheduled a 3:45 p.m. press conference .
Lindsay Lohan has been hitting the party scene hard and has n’t done much work since her last film Labor Pains , which went straight to DVD .
Despite her lack of income , RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively that she has n’t cut back on her spending and is now over half a million dollars in debt .
“ Lindsay owes credit cards $ 600,000 , ” a source tells RadarOnline.com of the troubled 23 - year - old .
“ One card cut her off last week and it ’s only a matter of time before all her other credit cards cut her off too . ”
Lohan used to make a good chunk of change by doing club appearances , but as RadarOnline.com previously reported the invites are becoming sparse and the starlet gets only from $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 at most .
Lindsay Lohan Fires Back At Dr. Drew
Lohan ’s financial woes are nothing new but the severity of them is .
She recently made headlines when it was reported that the actress was two months behind on her rent , prompting her landlord to threaten eviction .
Lohan allegedly paid $ 23,000 to catch up and stay in her place .
“ One credit card company is going to discuss a payment plan for Lindsay , ” the source continued .
“ But if she does n’t have the income and ca n’t make her payments , they are prepared to sue her . ”
EXCLUSIVE : Jewelry Store Wants Lindsay Lohan To Return $ 2 Million Jewels
The creators of South Park–Matt Stone and Trey Parker–decided that they would depict the Prophet Muhammad on the 200th episode of their show .
A radical group known as “ Revolution Muslim ” – based out of New York–issued thinly veiled threats against the South Park creators , hinting that their misdeed would result in their untimely deaths .
CNN picked up the story , and soon the controversy that the South Park creators so desired came to fruition .
Muslim Americans are irate .
But not so much at South Park .
Rather , the anger is directed at two groups : CNN for their poor journalism and Revolution Muslim for their insanity .
Let ’s start with CNN : Anderson Cooper covered the topic for over ten minutes and even found time to interview the famous Islamophobe Ayaan Hirsi Ali .
Surprisingly , Cooper did not interview a single Muslim American spokesman , thereby giving –whether he intended it or not –the false impression that Revolution Muslim represents a broad spectrum of the Muslim American population , and that the organization speaks for Islam itself .
In reality , the radical fringe group is composed of no more than two to ten members , and one could easily find similar sized extremist groups belonging to other faiths .
The vast majority of Muslim Americans despise Revolution Muslim and their hate - filled ideology .
The New York mosque the group frequented banned them from setting foot inside the premises , forcing them to preach on the street corner .
Many Muslim Americans question whether Revolution Muslim are real Muslims , and instead hold them to be agent provocateurs who wish to smear Islam .
Ibrahim Hooper , spokesman for the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , said Revolution Muslim is “ an extreme fringe group that has absolutely no credibility within the Muslim community ” and that the “ wild and irresponsible things ” they say has led to “ a strong suspicion [ in the Muslim American community ] that they ’re merely a setup to make Muslims and Islam look bad . ”
There ’s reason to believe that .
The founder of the group goes by the name of Yousef al - Khattab , but his real name is Joseph Cohen .
He was born and raised in the United States as a Jew , and holds both American and Israeli citizenship .
In the late eighties , Cohen embraced an ultra-orthodox interpretation of Judaism , and began attending a yeshiva ( rabbinical school ) .
In 1998 , Cohen hearkened to the Zionist call , and packed up his bags to relocate to the Israeli Occupied Territories where he became an Israeli settler .
As an ardent and extreme Zionist , Joseph Cohen fell in with the Jewish fundamentalist group Shas , an extreme right - wing political party that believes in flouting international law based on their religious beliefs .
Less than three years later , Cohen “ converted ” to Islam , moved back to the United States , and founded the most radical Islamic group in the country . [ 1 ]
His underling Younus Muhammad –the other half of the dynamic duo–is similarly a mysterious “ convert ” to Islam .
This pair of former extremist Zionists [ 2 ] –who together form Revolution Muslim–conveniently read off a script that could only be written by an Islamophobe .
For example , one of the two claimed that the Quran commands terrorism , something that no sincere Muslim would ever say ( and a claim that is patently false ) ; those are words that an Islamophobe ( or extreme Zionist ) would agree with , not a Muslim .
Considering the founder ’s background in an extreme right - wing and fundamentalist Israeli political party , Muslim Americans have reason to be suspicious .
Revolution Muslim is just too convenient .
Regardless of whether they are Muslim or agent provocateurs , they are simply inorganic wackos that have no community support whatsoever .
Yet , that has n’t stopped the media frenzy from portraying two “ Muslims ” as being representative of millions of Muslim Americans .
Cohen ( Khattab ) is just selling the mainstream media the narrative they want to hear .
According to these preconceived notions , Muslims lose their minds when the Prophet Muhammad is depicted .
The reasoning is simple enough : Muslims reacted in a frenzy to the Danish cartoons , so does n’t it just make sense that a similar reaction would take place when South Park depicts the Prophet Muhammad ?
However , the reality is that South Park has already portrayed an uncensored Muhammad in 2001 , in an episode entitled “ Super Best Friends ” .
In fact , the image of the Prophet Muhammad was not only used in that episode , but appeared in the opening segment of the show for four entire seasons .
What was the Muslim reaction ?
Nothing .
Absolutely nothing happened .
No protests , no riots , and no death threats .
The Muslim American community shrugged it off , as they did the recent episode ( barring the Revolution “ Muslim ” group ) .
Muslim columnist Zahed Amanullah wrote an article for the Guardian entitled “ No [ Muslim ] freak - out over South Park ” , saying :
But has there really been any Muslim outrage ?
The characterisation of Muhammad in a July 2001 episode entitled “ Super Best Friends “ , where he teams up with Jesus , Moses , and Buddha to defeat evil ( even though Buddha “ does n’t really believe in evil ” ) , has been available for viewing online ( if not on a spooked Comedy Central ) for nine years without censorship , more than enough time to spark another cartoon crisis if Muslims really cared .
As should be obvious by now , they do n’t .
Somehow “ a couple of misfits ” from Revolution Muslim are allowed to smear the entire Muslim American community .
The reality is that the vast majority of Muslims in this country barely flinched when they heard of South Park ’s intention to portray the Prophet Muhammad .
Anderson Cooper covered Revolution Muslim months ago , and at that time he had concluded that “ it ’s just a bunch of , you know , four morons standing on the street corner , shouting at the top of their lungs –how many people are really listening ? ”
That summation of Revolution Muslim , “ four morons standing on [ a ] street corner ” , is exactly how Muslim Americans view them as .
Yet flash forward to the recent Cooper report and there is no mention of this fact , and they are instead portrayed as spokesmen of Islam .
To really seal this impression , Anderson Cooper had on his show the vitriolic Ayaan Hirsi Ali , an ardent Islamophobe .
Unbelievably , she told Cooper that one religion ( Islam ) is “ beyond criticism ” nowadays .
What world is Ms. Ali living in ?
Today , Islam is the most vilified religion ever , and you can say things against Islam and Muslims on television that you simply could not say against any other religion or religious group .
On Fox News , that ’s simply routine , and guests ( and oftentimes hosts ) can get away with virtually any swipe at Islam .
And on the internet , the level of Islamophobia is astronomical , with Islamophobic websites being amongst the most popular sites on the net , and anti-Islamic comments being hurled at Muslims from sites ranging from YouTube to our very own LoonWatch .
So it is actually the opposite of what Ms. Ali claims : there is no other religion which is criticized more than Islam .
And it ’s gone far past criticism but entered into wholesale bigotry , which explains the hypersensitive reaction of some Muslims to this abuse .
In any case , the idea that only Muslims have ever threatened people for portraying their prophet in a certain way is false to begin with .
The indefatigable Glenn Greenwald decimated this argument here , so I do n’t need to belabor that point ; for example , he mentions a play by the name of Corpus Christi which was canceled several times , due to death threats from extremist Christians .
It is clearly not a Muslim only problem , and ought not to be used as a stick to beat Muslims over the head with .
Ms.
Ali takes this stick not only to all observant Muslims , but to all of Islam itself .
On Cooper ’s show , she claims that the Islamic scripture itself advocates killing those who criticize the religion .
Last I checked , the Islamic scripture is the Quran , and not a single verse in it advocates such a thing .
In fact , we find quite the opposite ; the Quran commands believers to say “ peace be unto you ” to those who insult their religion .
In the Islamic holy book , God describes the righteous :
They are patient , and repel evil with good …
When they hear vile ridicule ( against their faith ) , they ignore it and say : “ We shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds ; peace be unto you ! ” ( Quran , 28:54 - 55 )
That ’s what the Islamic scripture says .
As for the hadiths ( Prophetic traditions ) , these are an amorphous body of texts , which Muslims do not hold to be inerrant like the Quran .
Rather , a large number of hadiths are rejected outright as apocryphal in nature , and controversy surrounds many others . [ 3 ]
Muslim Americans focus on explicit hadiths in which the Prophet Muhammad forgave those who reviled him . [ 4 ]
For example , a group of disbelievers cursed the Prophet Muhammad , and his wife angrily retaliated in kind .
The Prophet , however , admonished his wife : “ Calm down .
There is not gentleness in anything except that it becomes more beautiful , and there is not harshness in anything except that it makes it ugly .
So be calm . ”
He then expounded an integral Islamic belief , saying : “ God is kind and lenient , and likes that one should be kind and lenient in all matters . ” [ 5 ]
Contemporary Muslims argue that if the Prophet Muhammad forbade even verbal aggression against non-Muslims who insulted him , then physical violence is even more loathsome .
Similarly , if the Prophet Muhammad did not seek vengeance against those who physically assaulted him and even tried to kill him , then how could it be justified against those who merely insulted him ?
For example , the Prophet Muhammad was poisoned by a woman who opposed his message , yet he forgave her and sought no retaliation against her .
When the people brought her to him , and asked : “ Shall we kill her ? ” , the Prophet replied emphatically “ no . ” [ 6 ]
Contemporary Muslims argue that if the Companions were forbidden to kill the one who tried to physically harm and kill the Prophet Muhammad , then it seems safe to say that it is even more forbidden to punish the one who merely insults him or draws a demeaning cartoon of him .
One last example I will give here ( although there are many others ) is that of Labeed ibn al - Asam , a sorcerer who cursed the Prophet Muhammad , and attempted to harm him through black magic .
When his wife asked him why he did not seek retaliation against the sorcerer , the Prophet Muhammad replied “ I hate to cause harm to anyone . ” ( Sahih al - Bukhari ) Contemporary Muslims ask : if the Prophet hated to cause harm to anyone , then he would hate for Muslims to kill those who merely drew cartoons of him , a “ crime ” much less egregious than black magic .
Are there certain texts from the hadiths and classical scholars that say otherwise ?
Certainly , and I am not denying that .
But the Islamophobes put a standard to Muslims that they themselves cannot meet .
For example , the vitriolic Catholic crusader Robert Spencer would show such - and - such hadith , and then say “ well , it says to kill people who insult the Prophet Muhammad , and so an observant Muslim must do that . ”
Yet , his own Bible says to kill those who insult his God ( Jesus ) , commanding the faithful to stone the blasphemous infidels to death :
Anyone who blasphemes the name of the LORD must be put to death .
The entire assembly must stone him .
Whether an alien or native - born , when he blasphemes the Name , he must be put to death .
( Leviticus , 24:16 )
Ayaan Hirsi
Ali ’s swipe at Islam can be applied here , with the condescending disclaimer that “ not all Christians follow the scripture . ”
And what of Anderson Cooper ’s comment on his blog : “ I have no respect for a prophet or god that needs its followers to defend it by threats and murder . ”
Would he now think lowly of the Jewish and Christian God who–according to their most authentic scriptural source–calls for its followers to kill those who insult Him ?
Or do we realize that it ’s not wise to cherry - pick a passage of a religious text and then vilify an entire creed ?
Islamophobes like Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Robert Spencer claim that Islam itself and the scriptural sources themselves explain why the riots against the Danish cartoons occurred .
I recently covered the resurgence of Christian witch hunts in Africa ; one could make the unsophisticated claim that the primary blame for the witch hunts can be attributed to the Bible and Christianity itself , since the Bible calls for witches to be killed . [ 7 ]
Yet , experts understand that “ poverty , exacerbated by the current world economic crisis , often lay behind the [ witch hunt ] phenomenon as people sought to find scapegoats for their misfortunes and the illnesses they suffered . ”
Christianity was simply the currency in which the people expressed their frustration .
In other words , it is a very superficial understanding to reduce the issue to Biblical verses .
Likewise , there were sociological factors behind the anger that fueled the Danish cartoon riots .
Yet , an unsophisticated understanding of the issue would lead one to believe that the riots were simply the result of an Islamic prohibition on the depiction of the Prophet Muhammad .
The reality , however , is that –in spite of an orthodox ban on imagery of the Prophet [ 8 ] –the Prophet Muhammad has been depicted in the Islamic world for centuries .
British author Dr. Kenan Malik writes :
Over the past 400 years , a number of Islamic , especially Shiite , traditions have accepted the pictorial representation of Muhammed .
The Edinburgh University Library in Scotland , the Bibliotheque National in Paris , New York ’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Topkapi Palace Museum , Istanbul , all contain dozens of Persian , Ottoman and Afghan manuscripts depicting the Prophet .
His face can be seen in many mosques too – even in Iran .
A 17th - century mural on the Iman Zahdah Chah Zaid Mosque in the Iranian town of Isfahan , for instance , shows a Mohammed whose facial features are clearly visible …
So , if there is no universal prohibition to the depiction of Muhammad , why were Muslims universally appalled by the caricatures ?
They were n’t .
And those that were , were driven by political zeal rather than theological fervour .
European Muslims have long suffered from high levels of unemployment , social alienation , and systemic discrimination –factors that contributed to the riots more than indignation over the pictorial representation of the Prophet Muhammad .
In fact , most of the rioters had not even seen the cartoons , and the caricatures were –in the words of the Islamic scholar Dr. Khaled Abou El Fadl – “ the straw that broke the camel ’s back ” ( an ethnically appropriate phrase ) .
In the Muslim majority world , Muslims had long been suffering from what they view as Western “ neo- colonialism ” , and the Danish cartoons were viewed as salt on the wounds .
The bewilderment of many in the West– “ how could they react this way to some cartoons ? ” – only underscores a profound ignorance of the problems that plague those in the East , many of which the West either causes or exacerbates .
Dr. Malik goes on :
There were demonstrations and riots in India , Pakistan , Indonesia , Egypt , Libya , Syria , Iran , Nigeria , Palestine , Afghanistan and elsewhere .
Danish embassies in Damascus , Beirut and Teheran were torched .
But , as Jytte Klausen has observed , these protests ‘ were not caused by the cartoons , but were part of conflicts in pre-existing hot spots ’ such as northern Nigeria , where there exists an effective civil war between Muslim salafists and Christians .
The violence surrounding the cartoon conflict , Klausen suggests , has been ‘ misreported ’ as expressions of spontaneous violence from Muslims ‘ confronted with bad pictures ’ .
That , she insists , ‘ is absolutely not the case ’ .
Rather ‘ these images have been exploited by political groups in the pre-existing conflict over Islam . ’
Similarly , the Salman Rushdie affair had political not theological roots :
We have come to accept almost as self - evident the idea that the worldwide controversy was sparked by the blasphemies in The Satanic Verses that all Muslims found deeply offensive .
It is not true .
The Satanic Verses was published in September 1988 .
For the next five months , until the Ayatollah Khomeini issued his fatwa on Valentine ’s Day 1989 , most Muslims ignored the book .
The campaign against the novel was largely confined to the Indian subcontinent and to Britain .
Aside from the involvement of Saudi Arabia , there was little enthusiasm for a campaign against novel in the Arab world or in Turkey , or among Muslim communities in France or Germany .
When the Saudi authorities tried at the end of 1988 to get the novel banned in Muslim countries worldwide , few responded except those with large subcontinental populations , such as South Africa or Malaysia .
Even in Iran the book was openly available and was reviewed in many newspapers .
As in the controversy over the Danish cartoons , it was politics , not religion , that transformed The Satanic Verses into a worldwide event of historic proportions .
Malik then explains the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran , both countries desperately competing for regional dominance .
Each seeks –with its ultraconservative implementations of the religion –to assert itself as the standard - bearer of “ authentic ” Islam .
Saudi Arabia had attempted to ban the book , and Iran ’s fatwa was an attempt to one up the Saudis .
In the words of Kenan Malik : “ The Satanic Verses became a weapon in that conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran .
Riyadh had made the initial running ( by calling for a ban on the book ) .
The fatwa was an attempt by Iran to wrestle back the initiative …
The controversy over The Satanic Verses was primarily a political , not religious , conflict . ”
Unfortunately , many Westerners think it sufficient to hold superficial understandings of such complex issues ( whereas others find it expedient to do so ) .
The elements that led to the Danish cartoon affair simply do not exist in today ’s South Park controversy , which explains why the Muslim American community –notwithstanding the “ four morons on [ a ] street corner ” –have had such a subdued response .
Interestingly , there has not even been any significant drive to boycott the show , nor any peaceful protests ( let alone violent recourse ) – which shows how little they care about this “ controversy . ”
Most Muslim Americans understand that South Park pokes fun at people of every faith , and even if they may find it personally distasteful , Muslim Americans do n’t think too much of it .
As CAIR ’s Ibrahim Hooper put it : “ [ Muslims ] are pretty tired of this whole : ‘ Let ’s insult the Prophet Muhammad thing . ' ”
They do n’t want to dwell on it , and just want the incident to pass .
Internally , Muslim Americans are telling each other to “ ignore it ” , and they are cognizant of the fact that outrage will only publicize the South Park episode more .
By presupposing that the reaction of Muslim Americans would be the same as their coreligionists in parts of Europe and the developing world ( some ) non-Muslim Westerners have placed all Muslims into one box .
According to this “ the other ” understanding , all Muslims –of every nationality and region of the earth–ought to react similarly .
Yet , one clearly understands this not to be the case when comparing Evangelicals in America with those leading witch hunts in Nigeria .
The reality is that Muslims in this country have a distinctly American Islam , one which has incorporated freedom of speech into it .
Therefore , it is incorrect to simply assume that the reaction of Muslim Americans would be the same as their religious brethren elsewhere .
Unlike the Muslim communities in many ( but not all ) European countries , Muslim Americans are well integrated ; unemployment and poverty do not affect them in the same way .
Instead , they tend to be rather well off , and are “ overrepresented ” in professional fields like medicine and engineering .
The absence of the sociological factors present in the Danish cartoon affair explains the lack of response to the South Park cartoons , and this is so even though the scriptural texts are still the same–again pointing to the fact that the protests had sociological and not theological roots .
Another reason why the South Park cartoons did not cause a Muslim outcry like the Danish cartoons did is that the South Park cartoons were not Islamophobic in nature .
The creators of South Park are equal - opportunity haters and have lampooned every religion , which really softened the blow .
The Danish cartoons , on the other hand , were Islamophobic in nature , and portrayed the Prophet Muhammad as a stereotypical Muslim terrorist with a bomb on his head .
( The same publisher had earlier refused to publish cartoons that were deemed offensive to Christians . )
The Danish cartoons were racist and bigoted .
Can one imagine the reaction of socioeconomically depressed African Americans had a mainstream newspaper ( like the New York Times ) published cartoons portraying blacks as apes ( a stereotypical racist image ) ?
In the seventies or eighties , such a thing would have led to widespread riots .
Would people still be bewildered as to how a population could react so violently to a “ mere cartoon “ ?
How is an ape - like representation of a black person any different than a stereotypical hook - nosed Muslim with a bomb on his head ?
Freedom of speech is one of the principles of this country , and without it a democracy cannot flourish .
But let ’s not forget that racial and religious tolerance is another bedrock of democracy .
It is a true oddity that certain segments of society have chosen that today freedom of speech is the most important issue to them , only because it allows them to channel their racial and religious intolerance .
The neo -conservatives who are today masquerading as the defenders of the first amendment are the same ones who just yesterday were justifying warrantless wiretapping , racial profiling , suspension of habeas corpus , secret prisons , torture , coerced confessions , state - sponsored assassinations ( of even U.S. citizens ) , and on and on…all because these things were directed at Muslims .
In the words of Glenn Greenwald , the South Park controversy has been exploited so that the “ majoritarian group [ can act ] as the profoundly oppressed victim at the hands of the small , marginalized , persecuted group which actually has no power [ i.e. Muslim Americans ] . ”
It is selective and unprincipled outrage expressed by unsavory folks who do n’t really care about the principles of freedom and tolerance , but are instead using the incident to promote intolerance and demonization of a minority group … something which threatens our democracy far more than “ four morons on [ a ] street corner . ”
In conclusion , this is a contrived controversy , and there was no freak - out by Muslim Americans over the South Park cartoons .
Yes , many Muslim Americans were offended , but no more so than pious Christians whose stomachs churn at the South Park episodes mocking their religious icons .
But most Muslim Americans know that this is the cost of living in a free society , and most importantly , they know that it wo n’t affect what they perceive is the greatness of their prophet .
As one Muslim American told me : “ Barking dogs cannot harm the moon , so let them bark . ”
Despite the crudeness of this analogy , it adequately depicts the indifference of Muslim Americans to the South Park cartoon .
Dr. Hesham Hassaballa , a prominent Muslim spokesman and former board member of CAIR , said :
I must admit : I was offended .
I was really bothered by the depiction of the Prophet Muhammad in a bear suit on Comedy Central ’s satirical show “ South Park . ” … [ But ] ever since the beginning of his ministry , the Prophet Muhammad has been attacked , maligned , and insulted , including from his own uncle .
The Prophet never retaliated against [ them ] .
When he was brutally expelled from the city of Ta’if , two angels offered to crush the city under the mountains that surrounded it .
The Prophet refused , hoping that their children may one day believe in God .
After conquering Mecca , the Prophet issued a general amnesty to the very same people that brutally and violently opposed him , including the person who mutilated his beloved uncle Hamza after he was killed in battle .
This is the example of the Prophet Muhammad that Muslims should seek to emulate whenever he is insulted .
The Prophet once said , “ I was sent to perfect the most noble of character . ”
He also said , “ The best of you are the best in character . ”
Rather than pray for God to “ kill Matt Stone and Trey Parker , ” Mr. Chesser should have prayed for God to show Stone and Parker the beauty of the Prophet Muhammad , so they can understand more about the man whom 1.2 billion people around the world revere and honor .
It is what the Prophet would have done .
No angry pitchfork , Dr. Hassaballa ?
The media thinks to itself : that wo n’t sell a story and certainly does n’t fit our preconceived notions of what a stereotypical Muslim is , so let ’s forget that you are a respected figure in the community and instead focus on “ four morons on [ a ] street corner ” who are n’t even allowed inside their mosque due to how much the Muslim American community dislikes their views .
( Phew , that was a long sentence ! )
Ahmed Rehab , the executive director of CAIR - Chicago , writes :
The latest Muhammad cartoon controversy , courtesy of Comedy Central ’s South Park , seems somewhat contrived … [ Revolution Muslim is ] literally 5 - 10 people who are widely reviled by the mainstream community for their radical and confrontational style including harassing Muslims outside mosques ( where they tend to be banned ) with outlandishly provocative anti-American rhetoric .
Most suspect the group is fraudulent .
Its mysterious leader , born Joseph Cohen , is an American Jew who converted to Islam in 2000 after living in Israel and attending an orthodox rabbinical school there .
Whether , true Muslims or agent provocateurs , the result is the same : they are five community outcasts …
South Park ’s provocation was mostly met by silence and indifference [ by the Muslim American community ] .
The widespread Muslim attitude went something like this : this is a free country , you go on mocking Jesus and Muhammad , and we will go on keeping them in our prayers .
No harm done .
Muhammad ’s and Jesus ’ value to humanity certainly will not dip as a result of your mockery .
The Muslim American community by and large supports freedom of speech , feeling that the right of the cartoonists to lampoon the Prophet exists and that the best thing to do is ignore such insults .
Perhaps the lack of reaction by Muslim Americans has disappointed the sensationalist media looking for a story , forcing them to focus on a few misfits .
Amazing how “ four morons on [ a ] street corner ” are allowed to become the spokesmen for Islam .
The message to Muslim Americans is loud and clear : even if 99.9999 % of you behave , that last 0.00001 % will be enough to hit you over the head with .
The entire community will be defined by its two ( or four ) village idiots .
Muslim Americans can never hope to have their voices heard , unless of course they become Revolution Muslims .
Update :
In retrospect , I fear that I may have used too strong wording when I was discussing Joseph Cohen ’s past .
The way my article is written , it seems as if I am saying that he is really a Jew pretending to be a Muslim , and this could be used by some to promote a vast conspiracy , i.e. “ it ’s the Mossad ! ”
This was not my intention , and I caution people to stay away from such conspiratorial talk .
The reality is that I do not know Cohen ’s true intentions .
I myself have a nagging suspicion that he is a disingenuous attention whore , as is his underling Younus Muhammad .
They have found a way to become famous , and I believe they enjoy the feeling of self - importance and their fifteen minutes of fame .
Accordingly , I believe that the outlandish things they say come from a desire to grab media attention , not from a genuine belief in Islam .
As I said , it is difficult to imagine that a sincere Muslim would claim that the Quran advocates terrorism , etc .
To fulfill this desire for fame , the so - called Revolution Muslims have adopted the role of agent provocateurs , trying to push as many buttons as they possible can .
“ Look at us !
Look at us ! ”
This is the limit of my “ conspiracy , ” and I do not at all claim that they are still Jews , even though I realize that my wording in the article above was poorly constructed .
I am not one to make excuses for my mistakes , and so I say quite simply : I made a mistake .
Yes , it is a possibility that the group was formed to make Muslims look bad , as Ibrahim Hooper of CAIR said .
But the evidence I presented with regard to Cohen ’s past can at most make one question intentions , nothing more .
There is no way to know for sure either way ; one can only conjecture .
However , the rest of the article still holds : regardless of Revolution Muslim ’s sincerity of faith or lack thereof , the point is that they are extreme outliers , completely at odds with the vast majority of Muslim Americans .
The suspicion of the Islamic community is important insofar as it is highlights this very fact , and indicates how far off Cohen and co. ’s viewpoints are from the rest of the Muslim Americans .

Here is how I think the nomination process is likely to play out .
I divide it into process and substance .
First , the process :
Note the relationship between Monday ’s announcement and the Senate calendar .
There are seven weeks between Monday and June 28 .
Six to seven weeks is traditionally regarded as the minimum amount of time between a nomination announcement and hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
June 28 marks the last week the Senate is in session before its July 4 recess , which runs from Saturday , July 3 to Sunday , July 11 .
So , tomorrow ’s announcement is timed to permit hearings to be conducted prior to the recess , if ( and it ’s a big if ) the Senate Judiciary Committee agrees .
Whether they will agree will depend on a number of factors .
Kagan ’s relatively short paper trail -- note the contrast with the nearly two decades of decisions by Sonia Sotomayor - - means there is less to review , and thus less time is required prior to the start of hearings .
Kagan was also recently confirmed by the same committee as Solicitor General .
Senate Democrats will prefer to move the process forward quickly for two reasons : so that Kagan is not “ left hanging ” for nine weeks before she appears before the committee ; and so that the nomination can be moved forward to make room in the calendar for legislative efforts .
On the other hand , Republicans , as the opposition , will prefer delay because as more time passes there is a greater chance that something will emerge that justifies defeating ( or at least undercuts ) the nomination .

While other kids were watching the Three Stooges and other classic American fare , my tastes drew me across the pond where I got hooked on Monty Python ’s Flying Circus and The Goodies .
My Pythonesque journey took me to the religious universes of Lenny Bruce and George Carlin , two comedians who helped me to deconstruct the world of organized religion during that period when my home life detonated .
When I first started writing satire , I got turned on to the religious rants of Bill Hicks , an American comic with a definite British sensibility .
By the time I caught Eddie Izzard ’s HBO performance Dressed to Kill ( 1999 ) , I had become a full - blown comedy junkie , devouring the likes of Jonathan Swift , Richard Pryor , P.J. O’Rourke , Molly Ivins , and Steve Allen .
Given how much Izzard ’s astute observations of religion and politics helped inform my own development as a satirist , I eagerly picked up a copy of the Eddie Izzard documentary Believe , thinking I might glean some insights as to the formation of his religious beliefs .
At the very least , I was hoping this surrealist might explore how he inhabited the body of satirist Lenny Bruce during a 1999 limited run production of Julian Barry ’s 1971 play Lenny .
Instead , this documentary — directed by ex-girlfriend Sara Townsend — captures the intense mania that drove Izzard to seek out international success as a comedian and actor .
Snippets from home movies , stand - up performance clips , interviews , and other footage reveal a complex person , who comes to the self - realization that everything he does in his life is to get back his mother , who died from cancer when he was six years old .
Such a revelation could have been explored further .
Also , while Townsend briefly touches on the moment when Izzard chose to go public as a transvestite , those looking for a sleazy TMZ - styled expose of Izzard ’s personal life will have to go elsewhere .
During one of the few pensive moments of the film , Izzard reflects how “ you ’ve got to believe you can be a stand - up before you ’re a stand - up . ”
This belief in his own creative spirit drove to keep performing even though his early reviews ranged from “ crap ” to “ lukewarm . ”
When he had achieved a level of success that would satisfy most comics , his relentless drive enabled him to achieve seemingly unattainable goals such as playing to sold out crowds at Wembley Stadium and Madison Square Garden , or completing the equivalent of 43 marathons in 51 days for charity even though he is not a trained athlete .
Earlier this week , I caught a press screening for the Doors ’
When You ’re Strange , and found myself reflecting on the similarities between these two documentaries .
While one cannot draw too direct a parallel between the two men ’s careers , I had to wonder , why did Morrison ( and my parents , eventually ) self - destruct from drugs and alcohol while Izzard shows no signs of slowing down ?
According to Canadian scientists writing in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine , women exposed to synthetic fibers and petroleum products in the course of their work appear to be most at risk of breast cancer .
Exposure to certain chemicals and pollutants before she reaches her mid-30s could triple a woman ’s risk after menopause .
Now comes news from ChemicalSafeSkincare.co.uk that women unknowingly apply up to 175 different chemicals to their bodies daily in the form of mainstream cosmetics .
As a result , manufacturers of natural “ personal care ” products are calling on makers of mainstream cosmetics to provide more information on their products ’ ingredients and side effects .
ChemicalSafeSkincare says three ingredients are especially hazardous .
Parabens ( preservatives used in many moisturizers and body creams ) have been linked to both cancer and to skin irritation .
Sodium lauryl sulfate ( a foaming agent used in shampoos ) can irritate the skin , as can formaldehyde ( used in hand soap and shampoo ) .
“ Media reports about the possible dangers of certain chemicals such as parabens , sodium lauryl sulfate , phthalates and formaldehyde have made consumers more aware of what they are buying , and potentially more demanding of chemical safe alternatives , ” says Julia Mitchell , spokeswoman for ChemicalSafeSkincare.co.uk .

There have been tons of comparisons between Ruby and other languages ( mostly Python ) ranging from the technical to the epically titled .
I ’ve always felt that both languages are nice , but feel much more at home with the expressive , readable Ruby syntax .
And do n’t get me wrong , I love Ruby for all kinds of language reasons .
Re-openable classes , blocks and the general meta- programming DNA of Ruby make it just wonderfully powerful and useful for me as a developer .
However , when I think about it the language is really only half the story when it comes to why I love being a Ruby developer .
Whether it ’s inherent in the makeup of the language and those to whom it appeals or the “ buck the mainstream ” attitude of Rails ’s opinionated - ness , Rubyists tend to take to new things like fish to water .
An outsider may look at the insane progression of testing frameworks and other different - ways - to - do - the - same - thing and think it ’s a kind of madness , sickness , or chaos .
Well , I suppose it is .
However , living inside the Ruby hurricane has helped me to grow as a developer more than I could possibly have imagined in the few years I ’ve been doing it full time .
Thanks to Ruby , I was on board with these technologies months or even years before I feel I otherwise would have been ( just a few examples ) :
Test - Driven Development : Already a mainstay in the Ruby community when I joined it , TDD has seen some pretty rapid expansion into other languages and communities .
I ’m not saying Ruby was the first or only , but it was certainly an early and strong TDD community .

I ’m not trying to say that X language does n’t promote innovation or adoption of new ideas or Y has an inferior community .
This is n’t a comparison post .
I just know that when it comes to new technologies , most Rubyists I know are already jumping out of the plane while still trying to figure out how the parachute works .
That sounds like an insult , but I think it ’s amazing .
We have a community of people so excited about technology that they literally can’t wait to build on it or for it , and share it with others .
The huge proliferation of regional Ruby conferences speaks to this : we ’re a group of people so intensely interested in learning about what ’s new that we can’t manage holding just a few mainstream conferences each year .
For me , being a part of the Ruby community feels like getting a sneak peek at where software development is going six months to two years from now .
That ’s not to say it ’s all rainbows and daisies … the constantly changing landscape requires a real passionate dedication to keep up or you ’ll quickly fall behind , and not all technologies are meant to immediately be deployed to massive - scale production environments ( restraint is a skill a good Rubyist must learn and exercise on a regular basis ) .
But I love Ruby because I feel confident that I will be made aware of trends in software development long before I would otherwise be expected to understand them .
It ’s fun to live in the future .
The Parents Television Council ramped up its ongoing crusade against how human beings actually speak by condemning the title of a new CBS TV Series : $ #*! my dad says .
" CBS intentionally chose to insert an expletive into the actual name of a show , and , despite its claim that the word will be bleeped , it is just CBS ' latest demonstration of its contempt for families and the public , " declared PTC President Tim Winter .
" There are an infinite number of alternatives that CBS could have chosen but its desire to shock and offend is crystal clear in this decision . "
We 're scratching our heads at the " infinite number of alternatives " for which CBS could have opted .
The series , starring William Shatner , is based on the actual tweets ( and subsequent book ) of Justin Halpern , who lives and functions as informal scribe for his 74 year old father , a devotee of intemperate language .
" He is awesome , " Justin writes .
" I just write down the $ #*! that he says . "
The latest tweets include ( following CBS 's lead , we 've inserted more upper case symbols ) :
" They 're offended ?
f*^@k , $ #*! , a$ $h@le , $ #*! f*@k ; they 're just words . . .
Fine .
$ #*! f*@k is n't a word , but you get my point . "
and :
" I do n't want your advice , you 're 27 f*@king years old . . .
Fine .
I do n't want your advice , you 're 29 f*@king years old . "
You get the idea .
So now the PTC thinks not only should n't you hear the actual words on TV , but you should n't read mnemonics for them either .
" The PTC will wage an unrelenting campaign against every network advertiser that chooses to support this program ; and in this instance , we will wage an unrelenting campaign against every local advertiser sponsoring the program at the affiliate station level , " Winter warns .
" We will challenge the broadcast license of every network affiliate that chooses to air the program before 10 pm or that chooses to air a promotion of the program before 10 pm " — that being the " safe harbor " hour at which the Federal Communications Commission allows more risque programming to be broadcast ( through 6 am ) .
CBS counters that the program " will in no way be indecent and will adhere to all CBS standards . "
But it looks like a showdown is looming , given that the network has scheduled the series for Thursdays at 8:30 pm .

Red Bull were soundly beaten by the weather at the Chinese Grand Prix after dominating qualifying .
Yet there was evidence they would not have won even if the Shanghai race had been dry .
When both Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber pitted prematurely for a rain shower that quickly passed , Red Bull 's chances on Sunday were scuppered .
That set the stage for Jenson Button 's victory .
In a dry race , the chances are it would have been Fernando Alonso 's Ferrari that beat the Red Bulls - and the reasons why make the Spaniard a strong contender for victory at the next race in Spain .
Bridgestone 's technical manager Hirohide Hamashima spoke post - qualifying in China about the big variation in tyre usage he was seeing between different cars - and between team - mates in the same cars .
The Shanghai circuit - with its middle sector of long - duration fast sweeps coming soon after the tyres have already been punished by the never - ending grind of Turns One - Two - Three , flat in top on entry , constantly slowing and turning until down to second gear - is the biggest tyre killer of the four tracks visited so far .
Differences in how various cars and drivers use their rubber are exaggerated here .
These patterns will be a good indicator , too , for how things might stack up in Barcelona - a track which , if anything , is even tougher for the tyres .
Of the top cars , the Red Bull was taking the most out of its tyres , the Ferrari was by far the kindest .
One McLaren - Jenson Button's - was almost as good as the Ferrari in its tyre usage ; Lewis Hamilton 's car was almost as bad as the Red Bulls .
The soft compound tyre being used as the option in Shanghai was much faster than the hard , but also much more delicate .
From the wear rates Bridgestone was seeing in the practice sessions , it was unlikely to have lasted much more than 15 laps on the most aggressive usage , with a possibility of up to 30 laps for cars that were gentler on it .
In other words the Ferrari was likely to have been able to use the faster tyre for up to twice as long as the Red Bull , had the race been dry .
Alonso 's car may have been a couple of tenths of a second per lap slower at its peak than Vettel 's Red Bull , but the difference in tyre performance after a few laps was going to be far more than that .
Over a sequence of dry laps , the Ferraris - and Button 's McLaren - looked likely to have been faster than the Red Bulls .
ANDREW BENSON BLOG
How stupid do those who questioned Button 's move to McLaren look now ?
Passing opportunities are relatively good at Shanghai , with grip through the tight Turn 11 rewarded with greater speed down the long back straight that follows .
A routine dry race there with the existing grid might well have seen the two Red Bulls leading the early stages but soon being hunted down by Alonso 's second - row Ferrari .
Once past , Alonso would likely have left them well behind as their tyres deteriorated at twice the rate of his .
Button ?
From the third row he would likely have been fighting with Nico Rosberg .
The Mercedes was pretty good on its tyres too , but arguably not quite as fast as the McLaren .
Button may well have lost too much time in fighting Rosberg to have been able to take the challenge to Alonso .
It 's also likely that they would have been joined in battle by Felipe Massa 's Ferrari , the Brazilian having qualified out of the car 's natural position on account of a crucial mistake on his final qualifying lap .
The Red Bulls would likely have fallen back into this group as the race went on , all playing further into the hands of Alonso as they held each other up .
All total conjecture of course - but based on very clear tyre usage patterns seen during the practices .
The final pre-season tests were conducted at Barcelona and there the Red Bulls were very quick , but prone to high tyre degradation .
Everyone 's cars have been developed extensively since then , but Shanghai suggested that basic trait of the RB6 is still there on tracks punishing enough on the tyres to bring it out .
There is little doubt that on tracks with shorter duration turns - ie , most of them - the Red Bull is F1 's fastest car and is therefore likely to win a whole bunch more races this season .
Even if the team has scored only one victory from the first four races , they are still the logical championship favourite .
But another defeat at Barcelona , at the hands of either Ferrari or McLaren , would probably help make the points battle rather more exciting than it otherwise might be .

The Tories were embroiled in a furious row over lesbian and gay rightson Saturday after the shadow home secretary , Chris Grayling , was secretly taped suggesting that people who ran bed and breakfasts in their homes should " have the right " to turn away homosexual couples .
The comments , made by Grayling last week to a leading centre - right thinktank , drew an angry response from gay groups and other parties , which said they were evidence that senior figures in David Cameron 's party still tolerate prejudice .
In a recording of the meeting of the Centre for Policy Studies , obtained by the Observer , Grayling makes clear he has always believed that those who run B& Bs should be free to turn away guests .
" I think we need to allow people to have their own consciences , " he said .
" I personally always took the view that , if you look at the case of should a Christian hotel owner have the right to exclude a gay couple from a hotel , I took the view that if it's a question of somebody who 's doing a B &B in their own home , that individual should have the right to decide who does and who does n't come into their own home . "
He draws a distinction , however , with hotels , which he says should admit gay couples .
" If they are running a hotel on the high street , I really do n't think that it is right in this day and age that a gay couple should walk into a hotel and be turned away because they are a gay couple , and I think that is where the dividing line comes . "
Ben Summerskill , chief executive of the gay rights group Stonewall , said the comments would be " very alarming to a lot of gay people who may have been thinking of voting Conservative " .
He added : " The legal position is perfectly clear .
If you are going to offer the public a commercial service – and B& Bs are a commercial service – then people cannot be refused that service on the grounds of sexuality .
No one is obliged to run a B&B , but people who do so have to obey the law .
" I do n't think anyone , including the Tories , wants to go back to the days where there is a sign outside saying : ' No gays , no blacks , no Irish . ' "
Labour said that Grayling 's comments ran contrary to the Equality Act ( Sexual Orientation ) Regulations 2007 , which state that no one should be refused goods or services on the grounds of their sexuality .
Grayling voted in favour of the regulations , which apply to the provision of " accommodation in a hotel , boarding house or similar establishment " .
Last month , a Christian B&B owner in Cookham , Berkshire , was reported to the police for refusing to take in a gay couple as guests .
Susanne Wilkinson said she had expected a man and woman , but when two men turned up she did not feel she could accommodate them because to do so was " against her convictions " .
The couple said they were considering suing , not for money , but " for a principle " .
Chris Bryant , the Europe minister , who last weekend became the first gay MP to be married in the Commons , said from his honeymoon in Edinburgh : " Anybody who thinks that the Tory party has changed should think what it would be like to have Chris Grayling as home secretary .
It is impossible to draw a distinction between bed and breakfasts and hotels .
It is very clear that very senior Tories have not realised that the world has moved on . "
A Conservative spokesperson said last night that Grayling had been clear about the obligations on hotel owners , but declined to be drawn on his views on B & Bs : " Chris Grayling was absolutely clear that in this day and age a gay couple should not be turned away from a hotel just because they are gay couple . "
The row will alarm David Cameron as he prepares for a general election that looks certain to be called on Tuesday .
The Tory leader has gone out of his way to win over gay and lesbian voters by stressing his new - look party 's liberal credentials .
Last year , he apologised for section 28 , the law passed by Margaret Thatcher 's Tory government in the late 1980s that bans the promotion of homosexuality in schools .
Cameron has also voted in favour of civil partnerships .
However , his progress in attracting the gay vote has been halted by a series of disputes involving his own MPs and MEPs .
Tory MEPs last year refused to support a motion that condemned a new homophobic law in Lithuania .
Cameron was also left embarrassed during a recent interview with Gay Times , broadcast by Channel 4 News , in which he admitted he did not know his party 's position on a series of votes involving gay rights issues in the UK and European parliaments .
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , said : " Chris Grayling 's plan would allow discrimination to thrive , as every bigot was given a licence to opt out of equality rules .
These views … show how far the Conservative party still has to travel before reaching the modern age . "
The culture secretary Ben Bradshaw , who is openly gay , said : " What is critical at this election is whether David Cameron is for real and whether his party has actually changed .
Yet again the mask has slipped . "
No job for years and still looking
The percentage of unemployed people who are out of work for a long period has been steadily on the rise even during good times for the economy during the past ten years .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- John Miller was n't too nervous when he lost his job in the mortgage industry in June 2008 .
The worst of the financial crisis was still months away .
While the subprime mortgage industry had already imploded , there was still a debate at the time whether a recession had started .
Job losses were steady but not dramatic .

Being out of work for nearly two years has been " unfathomable " for John Miller , pictured with his wife Carolyn and sons Nolan and Ian .
I stopped looking for work View photos
The number of discouraged job seekers is at an all time high .
These readers tell us what it 's like to give up on the job search .
Miller lost his job when Deutsche Bank shut down a unit making government - guaranteed FHA loans , but he had found work in the past when an employer had closed a unit .
He thought that even if it took a few months to find another job , something would turn up .
Almost two years later , he 's still looking .
" It 's unfathomable to me , " said Miller .
" Never in my wildest dreams did I think I 'd be coming up on two years without a job . "
Miller is exhibit A of why this economic downturn feels so much worse to most than any other since the Great Depression .
Long - term unemployment is at a level that dwarfs anything since the government started tracking the problem shortly after World War II .
Of the nearly 14 million people now counted as unemployed , a record 44 % have been out of work more than six months .
Before the most recent recession , that figure had never reached 24 % .
There are various theories about why long - term unemployment has reached historically high levels .
Heidi Shierholz , labor economist with the Economic Policy Institute , points to three major factors that have caused the unprecedented long - term unemployment problem -- the length of the recession , an older work force and the battered housing market , which makes it harder for people to relocate and find a new job .
The simple length of the downturn , with job losses in 22 straight months from January 2008 through October 2009 , left too many job seekers and too few companies hiring for too long a period .
" There 's just a lot of people out there looking for jobs , " said Sherry Eckert , who lost a small business lending job at Washington Mutual in January 2009 , after the nation 's largest thrift failed and was taken over by JPMorgan Chase .
Eckert said she knew she was facing a long stretch of unemployment , but never imagined it would last more than a year .
" I figured it would be six to eight months , something like that , " she said .
Older workers , longer time out of work .
Shierholz said the exceptionally large number of older workers who are unemployed is also a major factor .
Statistics show it is tougher for anyone ( regardless of age ) who has been unemployed more than six months to find work .
But Shierholz ' analysis of 2009 data shows unemployed people aged 55 and older are about 17 % more likely to be out of work for longer than six months than their 25 - to - 54 - year old counterparts .
" Older and more educated people are less likely to become unemployed , but once you become unemployed you 're more likely to be unemployed for a long period of time , " she said .
Some of that might be due to employers being reluctant to hire older workers .
" I 'm 55 - years old .
I know these folks are thinking ' This is a guy who should be thinking about retirement , ' " said Richard Travis , who lost a job in human resources at Blue Ridge Paper in Richmond in May 2008 after corporate merger .
But older workers also often have more financial resources to wait out a long period of unemployment than a younger worker .
So they may be less inclined to settle for an entry - level job .
Many employers also do n't like to hire someone they believe is over - qualified for a position , which also works against older workers .
" Anyone like me in their 50's who is any good was making far more than many of these job openings pay , " said Steve Greenlaw , who lost a six - figure management job at auto parts maker Delphi at the end of 2008 .
He said he has trouble getting interviews for jobs once recruiters find out his former salary .
" They worry that even if you take the job , you 're only going to stay till something better comes along , " he said .
Housing problems strike again .
In the past , a strong housing market gave many people a chance to move to where the job situation was better .
But with many homeowners owing more on their mortgage than their home is worth , it 's not so simple to just sell the house .
Miller said that 's one of the problems he faces in his job search .
He estimates he owes $ 75,000 to $ 85,000 more than he could hope to recoup from a sale of the home he bought in July 2005 .
" My wife and I have talked about relocating , but I 'm so upside down on my house , we could n't sell it if we had to , " he said .
Then there is the simple fact that long - term unemployment has been on an upward trend for decades -- even when the economy was in good shape .
So it 's not surprising that long - term unemployment spiked to unprecedented levels this time around .
Unfortunately , few see signs of improvement ahead , and those who never thought they would be out of a job for so long are left wondering when their nightmare will end .
" I always have found jobs fairly quickly , and I 'm not one of the people who says ' The economy is bad , I 'm not going to find a job , ' " said Diane Hansen , who has been unemployed since July .
" So I was n't too worried when I lost my job .
Little did I know .
It 's been very humbling . "
Are your snipers bored of the same old stationary , predictable cardboard targets ?
What they need is disconcertingly realistic acting robotic ones !
The Australian Defense Force and Marathon Robotics took a number of two - wheeled RMP 200 Segway robots , placed hoodie - clad foam dummies on top , armored the bottoms , and then programmed them to wander randomly around a small village .
A sniper perched up on a hill then picks off his target and , like magic , the remaining robots all scatter automatically in a game way more fun than Modern Warfare could ever hope to be .
There 's a video of that after the break , along with an RMP 400 doing some sweet jumps off - road , even roaring up stairs .
The YouTube channel at the source link has plenty more Segway demos , some new and some old , so if you have some time to kill today you know where to click .

Bonuses lost by fired Infinity Ward co-founders Jason West and Vince Zampella have been " redistributed " among the studio's remaining employees , says a rep speaking on Activision 's behalf .
Amid the discussion and speculation surrounding the legal dispute between the publisher and the departed execs , community rep and former game journalist Dan Amrich chose the message board of a Facebook group entitled " Gamers against Bobby Kotick & Activision " to , in his words , attempt to " put some of the more controversial discussions in context , or explain some things that have been misreported .
"
In the thread , Amrich addresses widespread reports of Infinity Ward employees leaving Activision in the wake of West and Zampella 's exit , possibly to join the pair at their newly - founded Respawn Entertainment -- a studio that , while independent , enjoys publisher support from Activision rival Electronic Arts .
" Vince and Jason had very large bonuses ; those bonuses are being redistributed to everybody else , to the people who did not allegedly attempt to steal company secrets , " writes Amrich , advising members of the group to look at Activision 's counter - suit " for details about Vince and Jason 's surreptitious attempts to photocopy and scan sensitive documents . "
" Activision is not pocketing that bonus money ; it 's still going to the people who work at IW , " Amrich continues .
" But you have to work at IW to get it , see ? " In recent days Activision has asserted Infinity Ward is still about 100 staffers strong , citing the studio's " deep bench of talent " under the interim leadership of CTO Steve Pearce and production head Steve Akrich .
But numerous industry analysts have warned of risk to the publisher if too many staff departures weaken the studio .
Amrich concedes that the continuing wave of employee departures from Infinity Ward is " not over yet . "
He writes that " more people will probably go too , looking for new situations .
Maybe they will join Respawn , maybe not .
I 'm confused , because by leaving , they are giving up their bonus -- and the more people that leave , the bigger the bonus gets for the people who stay .
" He adds : " I 'd think if you are young and hungry and have a vision for a new game , IW would be a really good place to be right now .
" Amrich also attempted to field gamer criticism of Activision CEO Bobby Kotick 's well - known comments about wanting developers to work in an environment of " skepticism , pessimism and fear , " stressing that Kotick was referring to maintaining pragmatism about the economic climate and not to the creative culture of Activision studios .
Nonetheless , Amrich also said that " while I respect him as a businessman , I wish Bobby Kotick would not shoot from the hip so often .
"
He criticizes the games press who he believes have " willfully misinterpreted " Kotick 's often - bombastic comments -- " but at the same time , he has to understand that the whole world is listening , not just the people in the banking community that happen to be in the room when he says stuff . "

Author ’s update : the graphics in the post below have been updated to correct some minor mistakes , such as dated information that left out Rhode Island and Maine ’s dispensaries and Oregon ’s recent acceptance of Alzheimer ’s agitation as a qualifying condition .
Also , I have outlined Oregon ’s attempt at legalization through the OCTA petition as it could be reasonably said to be as far along or farther along than Washington ’s I -1068 .
I regret my errors .
With New Jersey recently becoming the 14th medical marijuana state , activists in marijuana law reform have been celebrating .
After all , over 82 million Americans now live in states where medical use of marijuana is legal – that ’s 27 % of the US population !
Last election , Massachusetts became the 13th decriminalization state , which means over 107 million Americans live in a state where possession of small personal amounts of marijuana no longer merit an arrest – that ’s 35 % of the US population .
However , after watching fourteen years of marijuana activism focused solely on those who use cannabis for medicine , I must warn activists that medical marijuana is not getting any better and the time for re-legalization of cannabis for all adults – even the healthy ones – is now .
Medical marijuana was a great 20th century strategy to get the sick and dying off the battlefield in the war on drugs .
It was the perfect vehicle to enlighten the public , who for so long have been indoctrinated into the reefer madness that classifies cannabis like LSD and heroin .
But in the 21st century the idea that marijuana is only a medicine is beginning to take hold and governments and voters are crafting ever - more - restrictive medical marijuana laws .
For the vast majority of cannabis consumers this threatens to move us from the category of “ illegal drug users ” to “ possessors of medicine without a prescription ” – a step up , perhaps , but still left facing criminal prosecution .
California legalized medical marijuana in 1996 .
That initiative , Prop - 215 , established what is clearly the most liberal medical marijuana statute to date :
A doctor can recommend for any condition ;
You need n’t have a “ bona fide ” doctor / patient relationship ;
Dispensaries are allowed ;
Self cultivation is allowed ;
Patients are protected from arrest .
If we consider these five attributes of the law the baseline , then in the past fourteen years , all thirteen medical marijuana states that have followed have failed to achieve all five .
Eight states only offer three or four of those liberties and the rest offer two or only one .
Most disturbingly , the right of patients to grow their own medicine ( or have a caregiver do it for them ) , which has been a bedrock principle in medical marijuana law , was taken away from patients in the most recent medical marijuana state , New Jersey .
Bills that were considered but vetoed in 2009 in Minnesota and New Hampshire , and those moving forward in New York , Pennsylvania , as well as an initiative in Arizona , all sacrifice this core right .
A comparison of plant and possession limits also shows the decline from the original starting point in California , where 12 plants and 8 ounces are allowed .
Oregon and Washington passed their laws next and have the highest statutory limits : 24 plants and 24 ounces in Oregon and 15 plants and 24 ounces in Washington .
( To be fair , all the West Coast states started with lower limits or more vague limits that were modified by the legislature . )
But since then , only one state has allowed more than 3 ounces ( New Mexico with 6 ounces ) and average number of plants allowed is a little less than ten .
Another decline in medical marijuana freedom appears when we look at the conditions for which medical marijuana protection is afforded in the various states .
There are eight conditions which could be considered the “ standard ” ones : cancer ; HIV / AIDS ; seizure disorders , like epilepsy ; spastic disorders , like multiple sclerosis ; glaucoma ; chronic nausea ; cachexia ; and chronic pain .
Most medical marijuana states recognize all eight conditions ; a couple ( Vermont and Rhode Island ) recognize seven of eight .
The latest law in New Jersey , however , eliminated chronic pain , chronic nausea , and cachexia , making it the most restrictive list in the nation .
The bill proposed but vetoed in New Hampshire required one to try all other remedies for chronic pain before trying medical marijuana .
The vetoed Minnesota bill would n’t even allow cancer and HIV / AIDS patients to use medical marijuana unless they could show they were terminal ( about to die ) .
The lists in the latest proposed bills continue to become more restricted .
Until we do have legalization for all , every medical marijuana law is going to fail to adequately serve all medical users and subject them to increasing restriction and scrutiny .
Additionally , medical marijuana laws make patients an attractive target for criminals because prohibition maintains huge profits for stolen medical cannabis , as well as becoming targets for overzealous anti-marijuana cops and prosecutors .
The reason the recent medical marijuana laws are losing ground is not a failure of the medical marijuana strategy , but rather due to its success .
Medical marijuana has portrayed the herb as “ powerful and effective medicine ” .
Well , what do we do with powerful and effective medicines ?
We keep them under lock and key .
We require people to visit doctors .
We strictly monitor prescription pads .
We bust people who have them without proper papers .
Rather than justifying the prohibitionists ’ shibboleth of medical marijuana as “ the camel ’s nose under the tent ” for legalization , I ’m arguing it ’s the opposite : that continuing the medical marijuana strategy further cements the “ powerful and effective medicine ” frame and takes us farther away from treating cannabis as a personal choice of relaxant .
We ’ll get to a point where the public accepts “ powerful and effective cannabis medicine ” and looks upon personal use like we look at someone getting fraudulent scrips for painkillers .
If one of the West Coast states does n’t pull off legalization soon , the pendulum is going to swing back the other way on marijuana .
The economic incentives may fade if the economy recovers and then the tax & regulate argument fizzles .
And if we are going to continue working on medical marijuana , the bills and initiatives need to get better , not worse .
The way it ’s looking now is that the Northeast and upper Midwest are going to institute chronic conditions - only , 2 oz limit , strict registry , only personal doctor , no home grow , state - run dispensary medical marijuana for $ 15 / gram in the next six years .
How then do we approach those people and say , “ Hey , you know that powerful and effective medical marijuana that you only let a few hundred really sick people use after jumping though a mile of hoops ?
We think everybody should have it and jump through no hoops ! ”
Medical marijuana would never have passed in any state if it were not for the votes of non-medical users of marijuana .
I do believe it is time for medical marijuana patients in the states that have programs to “ repay the favor ” and fight as hard for legalization as social tokers fought for medical .
Only patients can best make the argument that while prohibition exists , they will always face job discrimination , loss of child custody , high black market prices , housing discrimination , and the sneers of the Bill O’Reillys who think 99 % of medical marijuana patients are faking .
So long as the prohibition profit exists , there will always be these CBS Undercover investigations casting a pall on all legitimate medical marijuana because of the irresponsible acts of a few .
Maybe I ’m just too much of a dreamer .
I imagine acres and acres of hemp fields , huge indoor hydroponic cannabis warehouses , thriving cafes and coffeehouses , some folks growing their own in a garage or closet , regular outdoor festivals and special indoor events where cannabis smoking is permitted , buying and selling all varieties of cannabis from ounces at a farmer ’s market to bulk bales at CostCo … and none of that is done with “ powerful and effective medicines ” .
I do n’t think that it is reformer ’s job to pass medical marijuana in all fifty states first and then worry about legalization in one .
I think states that have medical should be moving forward on legalization , states without should focus on better medical laws by calling prohibitionists ’ bluff on “ marijuana outta control ! ” in the Western states with liberal medical laws .

WellPoint Inc. revealed Friday that it boosted its chief executive ’s compensation 51 % last year , even as the health insurance giant prepared massive rate increases in California that embroiled it in a national controversy over skyrocketing health insurance costs .
The proposed rate increases of up to 39 % in individual policies turned the insurer into a flash point in the healthcare overhaul battle , breathing new life into President Obama ’s effort at a crucial time in the debate .
Chief Executive Angela F. Braly saw her total compensation shoot to $ 13.1 million , from $ 8.7 million a year earlier , according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
At least three other WellPoint executives got compensation increases of as much as 75 % .
The hefty packages come as WellPoint ’s California subsidiary , Anthem Blue Cross in Woodland Hills , seeks double - digit rate increases for many of its 800,000 members who buy individual policies .
Anthem delayed the hikes until May 1 amid an outcry from policyholders , consumer groups , state regulators , members of Congress and the Obama administration .
California policyholders sharply criticized the WellPoint pay , complaining that they are subsidizing generous packages for millionaire executives .
“ It ’s unconscionable , ” said Mark Weiss , a Century City podiatrist whose Anthem policy will jump 35 % .
“ How much more does somebody need ? ”
Indianapolis - based WellPoint defended the pay increases , saying they reflected the company ’s overall positive performance in 2009 .
Its stock price rose 38.4 % last year to $ 58.29 , from $ 42.13 in 2008 .
The company said compensation for its top executives was at or below the median for comparably sized companies .
Premiums are being driven up by rising healthcare costs that are beyond its control , a spokesman said .
“ Well Point wants to attract and retain top talent , ” said spokesman Jon Mills .
“ In order to be the best , to be innovative , to continue delivering the best service , we do have to retain the best quality . ”
He added : “ We are in no way trying to inflate the salaries and compensation figures but trying to maintain a high level of talent at the organization . ”
The bulk of Braly ’s increase came from $ 6.2 million in restricted stock , up from $ 2.4 million a year earlier .
She also got a $ 1.5 - million performance bonus , compared with $ 73,810 in 2008 .
Braly ’s salary inched up 1 % to $ 1.1 million .
She got stock options worth $ 4 million , down from $ 4.9 million in 2008 , according to the filing .
Braly also got $ 292,036 in other compensation , including $ 150,907 for security - related improvements to her home and car , and personal security when she traveled .
The security steps were taken “ in light of growing concerns regarding the safety of Ms. Braly and her family as a result of the national healthcare debate , ” according to the filing .
The pay of other WellPoint executives also jumped sharply , according to the document .
Finance chief Wayne DeVeydt took home $ 7.2 million , up from $ 4.1 million in 2008 .
Ken Goulet , the head of WellPoint ’s commercial business unit , got $ 4.4 million , up from $ 2.7 million .
Dijuana Lewis , the head of its comprehensive health solutions unit , got $ 4.5 million , up from $ 2.7 million .
The pay hikes at WellPoint come at a time when overall CEO compensation has been falling slightly amid the recession and a public furor over executive pay levels .
A survey this week of 200 large companies by the Hay Group , a management consulting firm , showed average CEO pay decreasing 0.9 % to $ 6.95 million last year .
It was the second - straight annual drop , according to the firm .

The Welsh Revolution
Why are radical politics electable in Wales but not in England ?
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 19th April 2010
The lowland meadows are greening up , but the high pastures – the wet deserts of Snowdonia – are still yellow and bleak .
A few streaks of snow cling to the mountains ; but on the first hot day of the year you can almost hear the relief shuddering up from the ground .
Buds imperceptibly unclench .
The turbines on the hills stand still for first time in months .
Wavelets lip over the shingle – gentle , identical , like a screensaver on the edge of the sea ’s white monitor .
And everyone is out of doors .
In the rain - sodden lands of west Wales , no one wastes a day like this .
Business almost grinds to a halt as mysterious illnesses strike the working population down .
Hardy pilgrims dip themselves in the healing waters of Cardigan Bay .
The elderly lean on their front doors , eyes closed , faces to the sun .
To Elfyn Llwyd it feels like one big village .
Though the reshaped constituency he ’s contesting is strung from Bardsey island to the Dyfi Valley , from the post - industrial dystopia of Blaenau Ffestiniog to the deep peace of the Rhinog mountains , though it can take three hours by car to cross from end to end , almost everyone either knows him or knows his face .
With the possible exception of my own MP – the ubiquitous and surprisingly effective Lembit Opik – I have never met a backbencher who is so widely recognised in his constituency .
Yet I doubt that one in 1000 Londoners knows who he is .
He scarcely needs to campaign for this seat .
On some accounts Dwyfor Meirionedd is the safest in Wales .
Llwyd took 51 % of the vote at the last election , and support for his party is even stronger in the region which has been tacked onto his constituency .
But it looks like unpromising territory for politics like his .
There is no large town , no deep mining , no steel plant : most people are employed by farms or small businesses .
While radical rural politics are familiar in parts of France , Mexico and Brazil , those of us brought up in England associate the countryside with conservatism .
Here in the remotest parts of Wales there ’s overwhelming support for policies well to the left of Labour’s .
This is the mystery I have come to solve .
Why , when the three main parties in Westminster appear to be trapped in a neoliberal consensus , is a green socialist party sharing power in Cardiff ?
How , even in the first - past - the - post system of Westminster elections , can Plaid Cymru return three MPs with comfortable majorities , with a fair shot at electing a further four ?
What has Wales got that England has n’t ?
For the past few years a quiet but momentous revolution has been taking place to the west of Offa ’s Dyke .
That this revolution has passed largely unnoticed in England reflects the London media ’s lack of interest in Wales .
English progressives know more about the political transformation in Bolivia than the similar shift happening over the border .
Perhaps this is just as well .
The Welsh have been left to get on with it , and nobody in England cares enough to try to stop them .
It was Plaid Cymru that led the attempt to impeach Tony Blair over the invasion of Iraq .
It opposed the conflict in Afghanistan from the outset .
It wants to scrap Trident and cancel the aircraft carrier and Eurofighter contracts .
It would break up the banks , ban short selling , tax foreign exchange transactions , raise capital gains tax , raise income tax for the rich while reducing it for the poor .
It would set a maximum wage and give workers seats on corporate boards .
It seeks to re-nationalise the railways and curb the power of the supermarkets .
It wants a living pension for everyone over 80 , to raise benefits in line with average earnings and to scrap tuition fees .
It would abandon ID cards , stop detaining asylum seekers and shift sentencing away from prison and towards restorative justice .
Such policies are widely held to make parties in England unelectable .
But in Wales they are considered mainstream , and not just among Plaid supporters .
The Labour Party in Cardiff is a different beast to the Labour Party in Westminster .
The Welsh Assembly Government , where Labour is the senior coalition partner , has stopped SATs testing in schools , scrapped the private finance initiative , is abandoning the internal market in the NHS , has imposed tough social housing policies , helped set up a network of credit unions and – belatedly – more or less killed new opencast mining .
The manifesto Labour has just published for the Westminster vote would be a lengthy suicide note for the Assembly elections .
What explains the difference ?
To try to understand , I spent last Friday trailing Llwyd around his constituency .
He looks like a Victorian cartoon of a policeman : big , burly , with chubby cheeks and a thick moustache .
In fact his father was a cop , though Elfyn trained as a barrister .
He ’s the second MP produced by a tiny legal practice in Porthmadog ; the other was David Lloyd George .
He ’s clubby , uncomplicated , likes his rugby , knows the price of milk .
He ’s probably the last MP in Westminster to list pigeon breeding as his hobby .
I would n’t describe him as an intellectual : I sense that he ’s more comfortable cracking jokes with his constituents than arguing about ideas .
But his job is surprisingly straightforward .
Plaid must be the only leftwing party in Europe that , for the past 20 years , has not been split by doctrinal disputes .
There is no war between the Welsh People ’s Liberation Front and the People ’s Liberation Front of Wales .
When I asked him why this was he seemed at a loss to explain it .
“ I ’m not sure really .
I suppose we ’ve learnt from other people ’s mistakes .
We do n’t have a tight system of party discipline .
I think you could say we ’re driven by an ideology . ”
The lack of party discipline became clear as we talked .
After he said some robust things about supermarkets , I asked him why Plaid had allowed Tesco to sponsor its conference last year .
“ I refused to attend the Tesco event .
I ’ve had words with my party about it : perhaps we ’ll ask Saddam to sponsor it next year . ”
I told him that I was surprised , in these days of fierce whipping , that he could make such unguarded statements .
“ I think I ’m entitled to a personal opinion from time to time .
We ’re not a control freak party to be honest . ”
This too appears to distinguish Plaid from what Llwyd calls the London parties .
Its selection of candidates and decision - making processes appear more open than those of Labour or the Conservatives .
Its small size makes this easier , so does the sense of solidarity in Wales : a gradual emergence from colonisation has bolstered a national identity that ’s lacking in England .
That said , I have found no evidence to support the Guardian ’s claim that Plaid veers “ very close to hatred of the English ” .
Even its
Welsh language policy looks pretty modest : it seeks not primacy but equal status with English .
This is good politics : there are , if it can reach them , plenty of votes to be gathered among the goodlifers who have drifted over the border .
When I first asked why a radical party could succeed in Wales , Llwyd replied instantly , as if the answer were obvious .
Proportional representation had created space for a politics inhibited by Middle England .
“ Not the actual people of Middle England but the idea of it .
First - past - the - post politics means that you are always chasing those swing votes in marginal constituencies . ”
But , I argued , while this might explain why Plaid does well in Cardiff , it does n’t explain its success in Westminster elections .
“ Traditionally Welsh people belong to the left .
There ’s a deep and ingrained sense of fair play .
They want to see people being looked after .
The University of Bangor was built on donations from quarrymen , earning a pittance because they wanted a better future for their children . ”
As we walked over the sand at Borth -y - Gest , an old fishing village where children splashed around on the last day of the holidays , he told me about a local farm whose tenants were about to be evicted because the farmer had been killed in an accident .
The neighbouring farmers clubbed together and told the landlord they would look after the husbandry until the oldest boy turned 18 .
“ Perhaps it ’s a result of living in a sparsely populated area .
We help each other because we know each other . ”
I saw some evidence of that in the business we visited .
Harlech Foodservice is a hard - nosed local wholesaler confronting much bigger competitors .
Yet , as we were shown round the warehouses and shivered in the frozen food store , the boss kept returning to its local sourcing policy .
It would have been easier and probably cheaper to have paid a big firm for a “ turnkey ” building ( they build it then give you the keys ) , but Harlech decided to supervise the construction of its new headquarters itself , to allow local firms to do the building , wiring and plumbing .
It also uses local food suppliers as much as it can .
“ It all helps the local economy , ” the boss explained , “ as well as giving us a point of difference from our competitors . ”
It struck me that there must be more to it than this though .
A couple of times , as we drove around the constituency , Llwyd complained about the absence of Welsh newspapers ( there ’s no equivalent of the Herald or the Scotsman here ) and the lack of interest from the London papers .
But might that be a good thing ?
The media prides itself on being a democratising force , but in reality does n’t it limit democratic choice by attacking any party that steps over the line ?
Is n’t that one of the reasons why Labour was neutered ?
He pondered this for a moment .
“ Yes , I see your point now .
It does give us more freedom . ”
He told me that the Sun had lambasted his stand on Afghanistan , published his phone number and told people to ring him .
“ I only got two phone calls and both of them said ‘ good on you ’ .
People do n’t take the Sun very seriously round here . ”
But there ’s no question that , as Llwyd claims , devolution and electoral reform have been decisive factors in the Welsh revolution .
They have created a culture of political responsiveness that ’s mostly lacking in England .
Politics in Wales is closer to the people ; politicians are forced to listen .
Perhaps in England too there is a peaceful revolution waiting to be unleashed , but with a parliament in which Welsh , Scottish and Irish MPs can be drilled through the lobbies to vote on purely English matters , where grass - roots politics are continually thwarted by dodgy voting systems , ruthless party machines and antediluvian powers , the box in which it lurks remains firmly nailed down .
The English like to think of themselves as a modern and sophisticated nation , and sometimes ignorantly view the Welsh as backward and uncouth .
But as far as democracy is concerned , the English are lightyears behind .
Westminster has far more to learn from Cardiff than Cardiff has from Westminster .

School on Saturdays ?
It seems sacrilegious or a form of discipline , but a proposal pending before the state Senate would make that an option .
A Senate bill would allow public schools to require students to attend Saturday classes to make up for cancellations because of severe weather conditions or an emergency such as a water - pipe leak ,
The Senate Education Committee on Tuesday approved the legislation that seeks to strengthen the state ’s minimum of 180 days of instruction by June 30 every year , even if it means Saturday classes .
The state ’s school code permits school on Saturdays only on the rarest of occasions , and snow makeup days are not among them .
The bill advances to the full Senate .
Nancy Olsson of Phoenixville , who was visiting the state Capitol on Tuesday as a chaperone with her fourth - grade daughter ’s class , said she would not have a problem with this proposal .
“ If you ask my daughter , she might have a different opinion of it , ” she said .
“ But it probably would n’t amount to many Saturdays ... and they have to get the education in . ”
Members of Cumberland Valley High School ’s track team , during a break after school , were less enthusiastic about it .
Ninth - grader Sagar
Shah said weekends are the only time he has to spend with his family because school , track practice and homework fill his weekdays .
Madi Bowman and Katie Schwalm , also in ninth grade at Cumberland Valley , said it would never work .
“ People would n’t come .
I think 178 days would be fine .
It ’s not a big deal , ” Bowman said .
Big Spring High School junior Travis Gilbert , a student member of the State Board of Education , said going to school would n’t be high on his list for a Saturday , either , but he understands the need to get in 180 days of instruction .
“ I think odds are slim for a school to actually do that .
If they would , students would n’t like it .
I ’m not sure I would like getting up on a Saturday morning and going to school , but sometimes you just have to do what you have to do , ” Gilbert said .
“ To get that 180 days of school in is really essential .
We have so much to learn and so much to prepare for , and we ’ve got to remain competitive among these other countries . ”
Sen. Jeffrey Piccola , R - Dauphin County , who chairs the education committee , said the need to tighten up the so - called 180 - day rule arose from the state Department of Education ’s “ apparent haste to approve exceptions ” this winter because of snow - related school cancellations .
This year , 28 snow - related waivers were granted , with 26 of them from districts asking to waive the requirement for seniors only , department spokesman David DeKok said .
Thirty - two others were denied or withdrawn .
And 18 nonweather emergencies , such as water - line breaks , were granted as well .
The waivers allow districts to shorten their school year without risk of losing state funding .
Piccola and Sen. Andrew Dinniman , D - Chester County , the ranking Democrat on the education committee , were outraged over Education Secretary Gerald Zahorchak ’s granting of snow - related waivers this year .
The senators suggested those districts could have added days to the end of the school year , extended the length of school days or canceled scheduled days off or teacher in - service days to allow students to meet the state ’s minimum requirements .
Waiving the school year minimum sends a mixed message to students , said Dinniman , the bill ’s sponsor .
“ We ca n’t tell them how important the curriculum is and [ academic ] standards are and studying is and then cancel school days simply because of snow and not make it up , ” Dinniman said .
“ We all understand we have canceled days , but 180 days is the shortest school year of any advanced nation in the world and the least we can do is keep that minimum standard . ”
The proposal allows the waiver to be granted when authorized by the General Assembly or when a district proves it cannot meet the requirement by June 30 , even with Saturday classes .
It limits the number of Saturdays that students have to attend to one a month .
It also maintains the requirement that graduating seniors cannot be required to return to school after graduating , and allows a student to be excused for religious observations .
Furthermore , it specifies that no tests could be administered on a Saturday .

I ’ll be here when it fade to watch you flip like a renegade ”
— Rakim , Follow the Leader
When my partner Marc wrote his post describing our firm , the most controversial component of our investment strategy was our preference for founding CEOs .
The conventional wisdom says a startup CEO should make way for a professional CEO once the company has achieved product - market fit .
In this post , I describe why we prefer to fund companies whose founder will run the company as its CEO .
The macro reason : that ’s the way most of the great technology companies have been built
At Andreessen Horowitz , our primary goal is to invest in the great technology franchises .
As we looked at the history of great technology companies , we discovered that founders ran an overwhelming majority of them for a very long time , including :
Acer — Stan Shih
Adobe — John Warnock
Amazon – Jeff Bezos
AMD — Jerry Sanders III
Apple – Steve Jobs
DEC — Ken Olsen
Dell — Michael Dell
EA — Trip Hawkins
EDS — Ross Perot
Hewlett - Packard — Dave Packard
IBM — Thomas Watson , Sr. (*)
Intel — Andy Grove (*)
Intuit — Scott Cook
Microsoft — Bill Gates
Motorola — Paul Galvin
n Vidia — Jen-Hsun Huang
Oracle — Larry Ellison
Peoplesoft — Dave Duffield
Salesforce.com — Marc Benioff
Seagate — Al Shugart
Siebel — Tom Siebel
Sony — Akio Morita
Sun —Scott McNeely
VMware — Diane Greene
(*)
While not technically cofounders , Andy Grove and Thomas Watson , Sr. were the driving force behind Intel and IBM , respectively .
Andy Grove was Intel ’s third employee ( after the two cofounders Robert Noyce and Gordon E. Moore ) .
Thomas Watson , Sr. joined as a General Manager of the Computing Tabulating Recording Company , but renamed the company International Business Machines and turned it into the IBM we recognize today .
In addition , founders run today ’s most promising new companies such as Zynga ( Mark Pincus ) , Facebook ( Mark Zuckerberg ) , Twitter ( Ev Williams ) , Workday ( Dave Duffield and Aneel Bhusri ) and Fusion - io ( David Flynn ) .
Two more quick data points before I move on to explain why this happens .
First , the University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School of Business just published an analysis of recent exits for high technology companies such as BlackBoard , BladeLogic , Concur , Danger , Liveperson , LogMeIn , and Netsuite .
Looking across these nearly 50 companies , the study finds that founding CEOs consistently beat the professional CEOs on a broad range of metrics ranging from capital efficiency ( amount of funding raised ) , time to exit , exit valuations , and return on investment .
Second , for folks keeping score at home , this phenomenon appears to extend beyond high - technology companies .
Felix Salmon , for instance , points out that Fortune ’s editorial staff considered twelve other candidates including Warren Buffett , Carlos Slim , and Martha Stewart before naming Steve Jobs the best CEO of the decade in November 2009 .
Salmon points out that “ not a single one of the 12 [ candidates ] is a CEO who was hired to run a company by its board of directors . ”
There are certainly exceptions to this rule , most notably Google and Cisco ( I will address both exceptions later in this post ) , but the evidence is one - sided and overwhelming .
The underlying reasons
From a pattern matching perspective , it makes sense that we ’d prefer founding CEOs , but as I said in an earlier post , pattern matching is not knowledge .
So , why are great technology companies so often run by their founders ?
And why do professional CEOs sometimes succeed ?
The innovation business
The technology business is fundamentally the innovation business .
Etymologically , the word technology means “ a better way of doing things . ”
As a result , innovation is the core competency for technology companies .
Technology companies are born because they create a better way of doing things .
Eventually , someone else will come up with a better way .
Therefore , if a technology company ceases to innovate , it will die .
These innovations are product cycles .
Professional CEOs are effective at maximizing , but not finding , product cycles .
Conversely , founding CEOs are excellent at finding , but not maximizing , product cycles .
Our experience shows — and the data supports — that teaching a founding CEO how to maximize the product cycle is easier than teaching the professional CEO how to find the new product cycle .
The reason is that innovation is the most difficult core competency to build in any business .
Innovation is almost insane by definition : most people view any truly innovative idea as stupid , because if it was a good idea , somebody would have already done it .
So , the innovator is guaranteed to have more natural initial detractors than followers .
Steve Jobs ’ return to Apple provides an excellent example .
At the time Jobs regained control of Apple , the conventional wisdom said that Apple was getting killed by “ PC Economics ” and had to separate the operating system from the hardware .
Specifically , Apple could n’t compete with Microsoft unless it became more horizontal and let commodity hardware manufactures compete while Apple focused exclusively on the OS .
The professional CEO who preceded Jobs ( Gil Amelio ) took the conventional wisdom to heart .
He set out to create an ecosystem of Mac cloners who would provide the commodity hardware complement to Apple ’s famous OS .
When Jobs came in and reversed those decisions , most industry analysts thought Jobs was insane .
Jobs not only killed all the commodity hardware and the horizontal strategy ; he went radically vertical .
In addition to the basic hardware and operating system , he added applications ( iLife , iWork ) and peripherals ( like the iPod ) .
He even added retail stores .
Today , people would let Steve Jobs make such a radical turn at nearly any company because of the outcome he ’s achieved at Apple .
But remember that when Jobs returned to Apple in 1996 , he was doing so as the co-founder and CEO of NeXT computer , a marginal computer workstation company which Apple purchased for less than $ 500 M .
Let ’s just say he did n’t have the benefit of the doubt .
What he did have : the founder ’s courage to innovate despite the doubters .
Innovator ’s requirements – what does it take to find the product cycle ?
So where did Jobs get this “ founders courage ” and what is it ?
In addition to general brilliance , we see three key ingredients to being a great innovator :
1. Comprehensive knowledge
2. Moral authority
3. Total commitment to the long - term
Great founding CEOs tend to have all three and professional CEOs often lack them .
Here ’s why .
Comprehensive knowledge
To create the original innovation to start a company , founders must exhaustively understand the technology required , the likely competitors ( past , present , and future ) , and the market in all its variations and segmentations .
This knowledge becomes the foundation on top of which a gigantic knowledge pyramid gets built which includes :
Knowledge of every employee who gets hired and why
Knowledge of every product and technology decision that gets made
Knowledge of all customer data and feedback generated from day one
Knowledge of exactly what ’s strong and weak about the code base
Knowledge of exactly what ’s strong and weak about the organization
This pyramid of knowledge enables new , unique innovative thinking .
This knowledge is nearly impossible to replicate .
Without it , thoughtful people lack the courage to bet the company on entirely new directions .
In retrospect , it seems totally natural that Larry Ellison transformed Software Development Labs from a consulting business into a software company called Oracle .
But would a professional CEO have understood enough about the team , the market and the competition to make such a radical change ?
Moral authority
Often , true innovation requires throwing out many of the foundational assumptions of the company .
If the company is significant , doing so may be extremely difficult for the professional CEO .
The company ’s core belief system is often entangled in those assumptions .
Since the founding CEO made the assumptions in the first place , it is much easier for her .
An excellent example of existing , invalid assumptions paralyzing a whole set of companies recently played out in the music industry .
The music business has been continuously disrupted and revolutionized by the underlying technology since the outset .
In fact , it ’s still widely referred to as the “ record industry , ” because the entire business was created by the invention of the vinyl record .
For the first few decades of the industry , songs were never longer than 3 minutes due to a technological limitation ( the record would skip if the grooves were too thin ) .
The album itself is a construct that originated with the total number of songs one could fit on a 33 1/3 Revolutions Per Minute ( RPM ) vinyl record .
In the 80s , the invention of the CD completely revitalized the industry and led to ( literally ) record - breaking sales .
Despite this dynamic history , modern record company executives badly missed the most sweeping technical innovation — the Internet .
How was that possible ?
By the time the Internet arrived , all of the original founders of the record companies had been bought out , retired , or died .
The new , professional CEOs were unwilling to let go of the most basic assumptions driving the cost structure of their businesses .
Specifically , they would n’t give up their stranglehold on distribution and the value they placed on owning the recording .
They were proficient at running the current business , but lacked both the courage and the moral authority to jeopardize the old business model by embracing the new technology .
The transition would have been far easier if these executives running the companies had invented the old models .
The founders of the music industry likely would have ditched old assumptions , because they would have been nuts to do continue believing an assumption that no longer makes sense .
Conversely , Netflix , run by cofounder Reed Hastings , provides an excellent counter - example .
Faced with a similar transition ( from distribution of the physical recording to electronic distribution of the bits ) , Netflix let go of its old assumption that customers wanted DVDs mailed to them , invested in innovation and produced a series of brilliant new offerings ( streaming video to Xbox 360 , Sony Playstation 3 , Tivo , Wii , connected DVD players , and a host of devices ) that are enabling them to transition smoothly .
Hastings was n’t married to the old distribution model precisely because he invented it .
Total commitment to the long term
Founding CEOs naturally take a long view of their companies .
The company is their life ’s work .
Their emotional commitment exceeds their equity stake .
Their goal from the start is to build something significant .
They instinctively know that big product cycles come from investment and that even the biggest product cycles will eventually fade .
Professional CEOs , on the other hand , tend to be driven by relatively shorter - term goals .
They are paid in terms of stock options that vest over 4 years and cash bonuses for quarterly and yearly performance .
Investments in innovation do not pay out in the current quarter .
Typically , they do n’t even pay out in the current year .
If you care about your bonus this year , you are directly incented not to make investments in new inventions as you will incur the expense , but reap no profits .
Any serious innovation requires a heavy investment .
Beyond the up - front cash , costs may include lower growth , bad publicity , and internal grumbling as existing features atrophy .
Recently , we ’ve seen Facebook ’s founding CEO Mark Zuckerberg make a series long - term bets .
He ’s radically revamped critical features such as the feed used by hundreds of millions of people .
He ’s made bold changes to key policies such as privacy and platform .
For years , he ’s avoided taking any revenue inconsistent with optimizing the user experience .
By committing to the long - term , he put himself under tremendous pressure in the short - term .
The press broadly questioned his business acumen and Facebook ’s ability to generate any meaningful revenue .
Bottom feeding publications such as Valley Wag even went so far as to call for his resignation .
Employees leaked to the press that they thought he should sell the company , and some quit due to temporary declines in page views and user growth .
We now know these critics were wrong and Zuckerberg was right , but would a professional CEO have taken these risks and endured such vicious attacks for unseen , long - term benefits ?
In theory , any professional CEO can rise to the challenge of being a great long - term CEO , but they have to commit to innovation and adopt the three characteristics above .
We ’ll now take a look at two professional CEOs who have done just that .
Understanding the exceptions – why do professional CEOs succeed ?
Two spectacular exceptions to the founding CEO rule are John Morgridge at Cisco and Eric Schmidt at Google .
Let ’s look at how these two overcame the issues illustrated above and massively triumphed .
Eric Schmidt–Getting the goodness of the founders and combining it with the know - how of the professional
Eric Schmidt has been a spectacular success at Google .
He has n’t just maximized the original product cycle ( which was built around search — although he ’s done a brilliant job of accomplishing that feat ) , but he has also overseen the creation of important new product cycles such as Android and Google Apps .
Interestingly , he did so by teaming with the founders and gaining the benefits of their knowledge , moral authority , and long - term vision .
This may seem like an obvious strategy , but shared leadership and control are incredibly difficult to achieve .
Doing so involves intense communication , deep humility , and some hard compromises .
Almost nobody ever pulls it off .
And that ’s why Eric Schmidt is such an important exception .
John Morgridge — All by himself
John Morgidge is another spectacular counter - example of the non-founding CEO building a tech powerhouse .
John took over as the company ’s second CEO in 1988 , a role he held until he became chairman in 1995 .
With John as CEO , Cisco grew from $ 5 m to $ 1b in revenue and from 34 to 2,250 employees .
He also took the company public in 1990 .
How did he do it ?
In speaking to many Cisco employees over many years and observing the dynamic , innovative product and M&A strategy that enabled them to defeat fierce competitors such as Wellfleet and Synoptics , I believe John Morgridge may have been the greatest professional CEO in the history of the high tech industry .
He worked tirelessly to develop the characteristics outlined above as well or better than any founder .
He was smart , knowledgeable , tough , innovative , courageous , and , unlike most professionals , legendarily cheap .
He once said that if you ca n’t see your car from your hotel room , then you are paying too much .
As a result of this magical combination of qualities , he achieved complete moral authority .
He is proof positive that a professional CEO can build a great technology company .
At the same time , he is the ultimate exception .
In the best case , you may find the next John Morgidge .
If you do , hire him !
Otherwise , here is our general rule of investing .
If you hire a professional CEO into a company that has found a large product cycle , the professional will be able to maximize that product cycle , but likely wo n’t find the next one .
If you hire a professional to find the product cycle , get the jelly , because your company will soon be toast .
Are all founders CEO material ?
The simple answer is “ no . ” Being CEO requires a tremendous amount of skill .
The larger the company becomes , the more skill that ’s required .
Steve Blank does an excellent job of illustrating many of these required skills in his outstanding Scalable Start - up series .
We almost never meet a founder who has these skills at the time they found the company .
Therefore , the founder must learn the skills required to run the company on - the - job .
Doing so is often a miserable , debilitating experience .
I can attest first hand to the frustration and exhaustion associated with being responsible for hundreds of employees while learning how to do the job .
I constantly made mistakes a more experienced CEO would n’t make .
These mistakes can be costly in terms of money and jobs .
So , why would any founder want to learn to be CEO on - the - job ?
Because doing so is the most sure fire way to build a great company .
How does one know if they have what it takes to be the long - term CEO of the company ?
In our experience , there are two required characteristics :
1. Leadership as described in my early post Notes on Leadership .
2. Desire — not necessarily the desire to be CEO , but the burning , irrepressible desire to build something great and the willingness to do whatever it takes to get there .
If the founder has these characteristics , then we would encourage them to give it a try .
If they fail , we will help them look for the next Eric Schmidt or John Morgridge .

Thierry Legault is a French amateur astronomer ... and if ever the word " amateur " were misleading , it 's here .
Thierry is an incredibly accomplished astronomer ; his pictures have graced my blog many times in the past .
Like when he caught the Shuttle and Hubble silhouetted against the Sun , or this lighthearted picture of someone painting the Sun , or the Shuttle and the space station transiting the Sun .
Come to think of it , he seems to have a fetish with the Sun .
But that 's good , because he 's done it again : he 's captured a record - breaking picture of the newest new Moon !
It 's very hard to see , so I bracketed it with those red lines .
Thierry caught the Moon when it was as absolutely close to the Sun as it could get at the time , so in fact this is the youngest Moon it could possibly be !
So what does that mean ?
Hopefully this terrible diagram I slapped together may help .
Picture yourself on the Earth ( that should be easy ) marked by the E in the drawing .
Once a day it appears that the Sun ( yellow circle ) circles the Earth ( black path ) .
The Moon ( crescent symbol ) circles the Earth once per month -- well , it rises and sets every night , but relative to the Sun the Moon moves slowly across the sky .
The Moon 's distance to the Sun changes so that at sunset every night , the Moon is in a noticeably different part of the sky than it was the night before .
New Moon is when the Moon and Sun are as close together as they can be , and it happens once per month or so .
But since the Moon 's orbit is tilted , it does n't always pass directly in front of the Sun ( creating a solar eclipse ) ; it misses by a bit .
But still , the Moon is so close to the Sun in the sky that we 're basically seeing the half of the Moon that 's unlit ( the lit half is facing away from us , toward the Sun ) .
When it 's offset a bit from the Sun , only the barest , slimmest bit of it is lit that we can see , producing an extremely emaciated crescent .
When you go outside and first notice the crescent Moon with your eye , it 's usually been a day or two since it passed its closest point to the Sun .
The crescent is thicker , making it easier to see , and it's farther from the Sun than at the exact moment of New Moon , reducing the glare .
The closer the Moon is to the Sun , the thinner the crescent and the brighter the sky , making it doubly harder to catch .
In Thierry 's case , he caught it when it was only 4.6 degrees from the Sun -- only about 9 times the diameter of the Moon itself !
That 's why astronomers prize seeing the thinnest possible crescent ; it 's a contest , like anglers catching the biggest fish or bird watchers seeing a rare species .
It shows that the person involved has used a lot of skill and experience ... and clearly Thierry has those !
This picture shows just how difficult Thierry 's setup had to be .
Look how close to the Sun he was shooting !
The screen blocks a lot of the glare from the sky , and the circular hole lets the ' scope see the Moon while cutting back on glare a little more .
To reduce the sky brightness further he used an infrared filter ; the sky does n't emit as much infrared light , so it appears a little bit darker , while the Moon does reflect IR ( from the Sun ) , making it easier to spot .
He used a filter that let through light at a wavelength at 0.85 microns , just a hair outside what the human eye is sensitive to .
Of course , he could n't see the Moon with his eye .
So he aligned the telescope with the stars the night before to get it properly tracking the sky , and then used a computer program to aim the telescope at the position of the Moon .
And obviously , it worked !
This was an amazing feat .
And the only way to beat it is to catch the Moon at exactly that closest solar approach when the distance is actually smaller ( or , if you like , closer to the point where the two paths of objects intersects on the sky ) .
That 'll make this observation even harder ... but I suspect Thierry 's already planning his next attempt .
We ’ve all read countless articles on the reasons you should consider freelancing .
They often make it out like anyone still working in the corporate world is just a schmuck with no ambition .
But the truth is , there are plenty of reasons not to start freelancing .
Below are twenty such reasons , all laid out so you can make an informed decision about whether freelancing is really something you want to do in your career .
There ’s nothing wrong with staying in a corporate job , just as there ’s nothing wrong with setting out on your own .
But it ’s a choice every designer and developer needs to make for themselves .
One note : when we talk about “ corporate jobs ” , we ’re talking mostly about design firms with multiple employees ( whether they ’re corporations or not ) , but most of it also applies to in - house design teams at large companies .
1. You Think It Will Be Easier Than a Corporate Job
A lot of people considering freelancing think it will be easier than their current corporate job .
After all , they ’ll only have to take on projects they want to take on , they wo n’t have a boss or coworkers to deal with , and they ’ll be able to set their own hours .
But most freelancers , when the first start out at least , are n’t able to be too picky about the work they take on .
And while they do n’t have coworkers or a boss to deal with , that means they also do n’t have anyone to turn to if they get stuck on a project .
There are still clients to deal with , too .
And the whole thing about setting your own hours pretty much just means you can choose which sixteen hours in the day you want to work when you ’re getting started .
2. You Do n’t Have Much Experience
If you ’re just getting out of school , you may not have much experience to draw on .
And there are a couple of reasons why experience is more important when you ’re a freelancer .
First of all , you ’ll need a portfolio to show prospective clients if you want them to hire you .
While you can always use personal projects , it ’s also good if you have at least a few sites in your portfolio that you completed for other people ( bonus points if they ’re not friends or family ) .
This shows a prospective client that you ’re legitimate , and that you ’ve had happy clients in the past .
The other reason is that experience proves to both you and the client that you ’re capable of finishing projects .
If you ’ve never done anything but personal projects , there ’s no indication that you ’ll be able to finish a project .
Freelance designers need to be able to handle client requests and revisions , as there will almost always be things your client wants to change , no matter how great your initial design is .
And until you ’ve finished a client project , you do n’t even have any proof that you have what it takes to work with clients .
3. You Have No Business Sense
When you ’re freelancing , you generally do n’t have anyone around to handle invoicing , collections , marketing , PR , and the myriad other tasks that corporate design firms handle for you .
These are all things you ’ll need to deal with yourself when you start freelancing .
Of course , you can always outsource some or all of these functions , but you may find it prohibitively expensive when you ’re starting out .
It ’s better if you know how to do all of them yourself .
Keeping your own books is especially important , as it gives you a clear picture of how much money you have coming and how much is going out ( and where it ’s going ) .
That ’s important if you want to stay in business .
4. You Need Benefits
Some people ca n’t get by without benefits .
If you have existing health problems , you ’ll almost certainly need health insurance .
And even if you ’re healthy , that ’s no guarantee you will be in the future .
Plus , if you have kids , you ’ll likely want health insurance for them , too .
This is one of those issues that ’s not going to matter in countries with universal health coverage , but even in those countries there are other benefits you may not want to lose .
If you ’re self - employed , you ’ll no longer have employer contributions to your retirement plans .
You wo n’t get paid sick days or personal days anymore .
All of these things will need to be built into your budget or schedule .
5. You Think the Pay Will Be Better
Many considering switching to freelancing think the pay will be better .
After all , they ’ll get to keep all the money they ’ve billed out , without sharing any of it with an employer .
And that ’s true .
But you ’ll also be responsible for paying all of your own taxes ( in the U.S. , at least , that amounts to an extra 7.5 % in payroll taxes that you have to pay that would otherwise be paid by an employer ) .
You also have all sorts of other business - related expenses you ’ll need to pay .
Things like office supplies , new equipment , software , and all those other expenses that go along with running a business will all have to be paid by you .
There ’s also the difference between hours worked versus billable hours to contend with .
Not everything you do will be billable work .
Time you spend on administrative tasks are n’t billable .
If you screw up on a project and have to take time to fix it , that ’s usually not billable either ( at least not ethically ) .
At a corporate job , you generally get paid either for the hours you actually work or on a salaried rate , regardless of how much the client is billed .
6. You Have No Self - Discipline
If you ca n’t discipline yourself to actually work , then you ’re not going to make it as a freelancer .
If you find you ’re spending hours playing video games or on Facebook instead of working , you ’re going to have a very hard time finding enough billable hours to pay your own bills .
When you work in a corporate environment , there ’s always the threat of being let go if you goof off too much .
When you work from home , you do n’t have that same threat lingering .
But if you do n’t get client work done on time , you ’ll have unhappy clients and , eventually , no clients .
If you ca n’t discipline yourself to work when you need to , you ’ll be better off sticking with a corporate gig .
7. You Do n’t Love Your Work
So many people who work the usual 9 - to - 5 do n’t really love their jobs .
They do n’t wake up in the morning looking forward to going to work .
But they do it in order to earn a paycheck and put food on the table .
Sometimes this is because of the work environment itself , but others times it ’s because they do n’t really enjoy the work they ’re doing .
If you do n’t love what you ’re doing , you ’re probably not going to love it any more once you ’re freelancing .
Freelancing is hard work , and if you ’re already struggling to find the motivation to get your job done , you ’ll probably struggle even harder once there ’s no boss there to motivate you .
8. You Think the Hours are Better
When you own your own business , you ’ll likely end up working twelve - to sixteen - hour days five to seven days a week , at least for the first few years .
Freelancing is like any other business .
Sure , once you ’re established , you ’ll likely be able to reduce your hours and only take on higher - paying projects .
But in the interim , you ’ll probably have to take on any work you can get to build up your reputation and a stable of regular clients .
It ’s also likely that your workflow wo n’t be as efficient as it could be for your first few months , or even years , in business .
You ’ll spend time on unnecessary activities .
You ’ll end up repeating things because you do n’t have good methods for keeping track of everything .
And because of this , you ’ll spend more time than is necessary on a lot of things .
Time and effort will eventually fix these issues , but they ’ll still have to be dealt with for a little while .
9 . You Have No Space in Your House / Apartment / Bedroom for an Office
You ’ll need a dedicated space for working .
This does n’t have to be an entire office , but you should at least have a desk that ’s only used for your work .
The idea that you can do everything from your kitchen table is likely just going to cause you headaches .
As will the idea that you can do all your work from the local coffee shop .
The good news is that most people can find a quiet corner in their house , apartment , or bedroom where they can set up a permanent workspace .
If it ’s in a room shared with other activities , an armoire - style workstation is often preferable , so you can “ close up ” for the day and not have to stare at your unfinished work .
10 . You Do n’t Know Where to Find Clients
You ’ll likely need to seek out some clients when you first get started .
If you have no idea where to look or how to contact potential clients , you ’ll probably have a hard time finding work .
Come up with a plan before you start making the transition to freelancing .
Tip : Stealing clients from your previous employer is not the best way to find clients .
11 . You Have No Project Management Skills or Experience
Freelancers need to be able to manage a project from start to finish .
When working in a corporate environment , you may have only had to deal with certain aspects of a design project .
But if you ’re freelancing , you ’ll need to be able to manage every aspect of the design and development process .
This includes outsourcing specific portions of design or development , finding out what the client needs and wants , working within the client ’s budget and timeframe , and managing problems that will inevitably crop up .
If you ’ve never managed a design project from start to finish , you ’ll likely have plenty of missteps on your first few projects .
Either get some experience with project management , or read a lot of books , blogs , and anything else you can get your hands on to learn the ins and outs .
12 . You Do n’t Want to Deal With People
When you freelance , you ’re going to have to deal with clients .
And while you often have more control over how those interactions go , you ’ll still have plenty of face - time with other people .
Do n’t freelance in order to escape dealing with people .
13 . You Ca n’t Stand Up for Yourself
You ’ll almost certainly end up with difficult clients at some point in your freelancing career .
If you ca n’t be assertive and stand up for yourself , you ’ll end up getting walked all over .
You need to have the confidence to stand up to a client who tries to get you to work for free , or who tries to bully you into reducing your price once the work is complete .
You also need to be able to handle clients who do n’t pay their bills or make unreasonable demands .
14 . You Have No Time - Management Skills
Time management can be one of the most challenging aspects of freelancing .
It ’s also one of the most important .
But most designers find it easy to spend too much time on a certain project or aspect of their business ( or personal life ) to the detriment of other parts of their business or life .
Time management for freelancers consists of two important things : time you spend on your work versus time you spend on your personal life , and time you spend on one project versus another project .
Setting regular working hours helps with the first one , even if all those regular hours consist of is only working until 4 pm ( and getting up earlier to allow yourself more working hours ) or only working 8 hours a day ( regardless of which 8 hours ) .
The second one is a bit trickier .
Track how much time you ’re spending on each project and be aware of what you quoted to the client .
Try to estimate how much time each part of the project will take , and then try to stick to that estimate .
15 . You Ca n’t Self - Motivate
This one is closely related to self - discipline , but takes it a step forward .
Discipline is all about doing the things you have to do .
Motivation is finding the wherewithall to do things you want to do .
There should be things related to your freelance business that you do n’t have to do , but want to do or will make your business stronger or more enjoyable .
If you only ever do the bare minimum , you ’re kind of missing the point of freelancing and being your own boss .
Self - motivation means you can do things above and beyond what ’s required to improve your freelancing business .
16 . You Do n’t Want to Maintain a Professional Image
When you work for a corporate design firm , you may never have to deal with clients directly .
Clients might not even really know who you are .
And that ’s okay , because usually they ’re more interested in the company than the individual designer .
When you ’re freelancing , though , it ’s your name that gets tied to your work .
That means you need to keep a professional image for the best business results .
If a client Googles your name and all they find are drunken photos of you from spring break , it ’s going to damage your reputation .
You need to be willing to keep your private life private , and to act professionally in public .
Hint : use the security settings on social networking sites to limit who sees what .
17 . You Want Paid Vacations
As a freelancer , you do n’t get paid vacations .
You ’ll need to either budget accordingly throughout the year to cover your vacation expenses , or make a big push right before a vacation to get everything done .
Of course , the longer your vacation , the more advanced planning you ’ll need .
And in many cases , you might still have to deal with client emergencies while you ’re away .
If you ’ve become very accustomed to having four weeks of paid vacation each year , that can be a big adjustment to make .
The main thing you ’ll need to do is to notify your clients well in advance that you ’ll be taking a vacation if you ’re going to be gone for more than a couple days .
18 . You ’re a Workaholic
When there ’s no one telling you to stop working at the end of the day , it ’s easy for some people to just keep working .
This can be just as detrimental to many as not working enough , though , as it can quickly lead to burnout .
If you ’re not able to limit the hours you work , you ’re probably going to have a short - lived freelancing career .
Your work will suffer if you ’re overworking , as will your family and personal life .
It ’s important to set limits to the number of hours you work , and to only take on projects that fit within those time constraints .
One possible solution is to let yourself be a workaholic for three or four days a week , but then not working at all on those other days .
This can help to satisfy those workaholic tendencies while still allowing you enough time to recharge .
19 . You Do n’t Want to Keep Regular Hours
The freedom to work when you want to is one of the biggest draws for many freelancers .
The idea of not having to work 9 - to - 5 is a huge plus .
But that does n’t mean you do n’t need to keep regular working hours .
First of all , most of your clients probably do keep regular 9 - to - 5 hours .
You ’ll need to be available when they ’re working and want to get in touch with you .
The other issue is that if you do n’t have a set work schedule , you ’ll probably find you have a hard time getting everything done .
Figure out what time of day you work best , whether that ’s from 6 pm till midnight or from 3 am till noon and then work those hours .
But make sure you ’re available during at least some regular business hours so your clients can get in touch with you when they need to .
20 . You Do n’t Like Being Alone
Freelancing can be a lonely business .
In many cases , you ’re not meeting clients in person very often .
You do n’t have coworkers around .
And you ’re probably working out of your house .
If you do n’t like being alone for long stretches of time , you ’ll likely find you ’re not well - suited to freelancing .
Of course , there are solutions to this .
You can work out of your house some days ( from a coffee shop or coworking space ) .
You can foster non -work relationships so you ’re interacting with people when you ’re not working .
Or you might want to set a regular lunch - date with other friends who freelance or work from home .
The Bottom Line
Freelancing is not for everyone .
And there ’s nothing wrong with that .
So often in creative fields we feel like if we ’re working in a corporate environment that we ’re somehow not as creative as those who have set out on their own .
But there ’s very little truth in that .
Freelancing is a career choice and something that every designer and developer has to decide on in respect to their personal situation .
For some , freelancing is a dream come true .
But for others , it ’s like a prison sentence .
Do n’t feel ashamed to stick with your corporate job if that ’s where you ’re comfortable and it ’s fulfilling to you .

Audio : ' I believe there is a direct connection [ to pedophilia ] '

What does the opposition to the Employment NonDiscrimination
Act sound like when talking amongst themselves ?
Well listen to this little nugget that Virginia 's Bishop E.W. Jackson shared with Christian radio host Janet Porter on yesterday 's ENDA - specific show :

Homosexuality=pedophilia ?
Well that 's weird , since I 've heard LGBT person after LGBT person speak out against the Catholic church scandal , while continuing to hear waaaaaaay too many followers of the Pope point a finger , turn a blind eye , or both .
But you keep talking , Bishop Jackson .
Putting LGBT lives and loves on a buffet surrounded by any " perversion " you can cook up may feed your most ardent followers , but the vast majority of the public is getting damn sick of being spoon fed such empty calories .

To those that have it , cellulite can feel like a hideous monster has crept across their skin , leaving behind a trail of grotesque evidence .
At its best , this trail looks like an orange peel .
At its worst , it looks like cottage cheese .
In either case , it can make its victims feel self - conscious , frustrated and desperate for a cure .
Despite its popular definition as skin that looks like cottage cheese , cellulite is actually fat cells that sit under the skin .
Even if cellulite makes you feel like a victim , it has no affect on your health .
It is a purely cosmetic issue that affects 90 percent of post - pubescent women [ source : Doheny ] .

Cellulite is so common in women that many dermatologists consider it a secondary sex characteristic [ source : Wanner ] .
In other words , almost every woman has it , skinny or obese .
After puberty , the female hormone estrogen triggers the woman 's body to store extra fat for pregnancy .
Typically , that added fat appears in the buttocks , thighs , hips and lower abdomen ( areas that naturally store fat ) .
But it can also show up under the arms , in the breasts and even in the nape of the neck [ source : AAD ] .
In 2008 , women dropped $ 47 million on cellulite - reduction products .
Yet those same women only showed a 25 percent to 50 percent improvement , and even that was short - lived [ source : Saint Louis ] .
To be clear , there is no cure for cellulite .
While there are a number of treatments that attempt to tackle the appearance of cellulite , the results vary -- and they 're not permanent .
But there are things , like lifestyle changes , that will make it less obvious .
Read on to find out what you can do to treat your cellulite .
First , discover the potential causes of cellulite to understand how treatment might work .
Boron carbide - the third hardest material on earth - has been built into the fabric of cotton T - shirts , dramatically increasing its toughness .
The process is a novel way to make nanocomposites that are both strong and flexible , and is a step towards creating effective new materials for body armour .
Modern military forces use plates of boron carbide ( B 4 C ) as ceramic inserts for bulletproof clothing but these can restrict mobility , so the design of a nanocomposite - where B 4 C is used to reinforce another material - could provide the perfect balance of strength and flexibility .
Now , a breakthrough has been made by a collaboration of researchers from China , Switzerland and the US , who found that the durable and porous nature of woven cotton fibres were ideal for the task .
’ We were able to make large quantities of high - strength B 4 C nanowires using cotton T - shirts as both the template and carbon source , ’ says Xiaodong Li , who led the group from the University of South Carolina , US .
By using cotton as a template , the team overcame a previous problem of the nanowires clumping together .
In the research , squares were cut from 100 per cent cotton T - shirts and soaked in a solution of boron powder and a nickel - based catalyst , before being heated to around 1100 ?
C for four hours under a flow of argon ( to stop the material burning ) .
’ Cotton fibres have lots of small pores which can be used to trap the powder , ’ Li explains .
’ During the process the cotton fibres change to carbon fibres - which react with the boron powder , producing B 4 C . ’
After the reaction , the T - shirts change from white to black , but remain lightweight and pliable .
But despite the dramatic change in their properties , this type of ’ armoured cotton ’ is not yet ready to replace conventional bulletproof materials , such as Kevlar .
’ Although it is unlikely that these threads will replace others that are comparable in strength to Kevlar , this is an interesting development in the technology of advanced textiles modified with nanoscale materials , ’ says Nicholas Kotov , an expert in composite materials at the University of Michigan , US .
Boris Yakobson , a materials scientist at Rice University , US , agrees .
’ It is clever to use cotton as a natural template to both prevent aggregation of emerging boron - rich nanowires and act as a carbon source .
Although the performance of the final composite is not very high , the approach looks very promising . ’

Earlier on Thursday , Apple CEO Steve Jobs published an essay in which he took Adobe to task over its Flash software , which Apple does not support on its mobile products , such as the iPhone and iPad .
The squabbling between Apple and Adobe has been getting increasingly personal , with Adobe executives and employees angered in particular by Apple 's decision to block Adobe software that would allow developers to produce programs in Flash that would then be converted to work on the iPhone .
The Journal 's Alan Murray had an exclusive interview with Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen Thursday afternoon , and Digits live - blogged the event .
Highlights are below .
Excerpts of the video are set to be available on the News Hub live show at 4 p.m. , with the full video available on the Journal 's Web site .
Alan Murray begins the interview , calling Mr. Jobs 's missive an " extraordinary attack . "
He asks Mr. Narayen what Adobe has done to deserve this .
Mr. Narayen says that the difference is that Adobe believes in open content .
He says that their Creative Suite software was designed to work on multiple devices and that Apple 's " recent behavior shows that they are concerned about Adobe being able " to provide this product that works across multiple platforms .
Mr. Murray likens the Apple - Adobe fight to that between reality TV stars Jon and Kate Gosselin and asks about the history between the two companies .
Mr. Narayen says that Adobe has been " true to the position " with which it was founded and to the idea that it should help people deal with multiple operating systems .

Census Returns Way Down in Republican Parts of Texas
Created : March 30 , 2010 14:31 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
File this under “ problems that we really should have seen coming ” : conservatives , egged on by the likes of Reps.
Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) and Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) , declining to return census forms and possibly shrinking the political power of states like Texas .
The Lone Star State ’s return rate for census forms , so far , is 27 percent .
The national average is 34 percent .
And the data are worse for Republican areas :
In Texas , some of the counties with the lowest census return rates are among the state ’s most Republican , including Briscoe County in the Panhandle , 8 percent ; King County , near Lubbock , 5 percent ; Culberson County , near El Paso , 11 percent ; and Newton County , in deep East Texas , 18 percent .
Most other counties near the bottom of the list are heavily Hispanic counties along the Texas - Mexico border .
The McCain - Palin ticket carried 74.3 percent of the vote in Briscoe , 92.6 percent in King and 65.5 percent in Newton — although Obama - Biden won tiny Culberson County .
UPDATE : Some friendly folks on Twitter have called this a false meme , so I checked the new data at the Census site .
Here are the return rates , so far , for the five most Republican districts in Texas .
King County ( 92. % for McCain ) – 14 % return rate , down from 48 % in 2000 .
Roberts County ( 92.1 % for McCain ) – 22 % return rate , down from 68 % in 2000 .
Ochiltree County ( 91.7 % for McCain ) – 39 % return rate , down from 71 % in 2000 .
Glasscock County ( 90.1 % for McCain ) – 30 % return rate , down from 49 % in 2000 .
Oldham County ( 88.4 % for McCain ) – 26 % return rate , down from 72 % in 2000 .
Obviously , with so much time left to complete the Census , lots of populous and Democratic areas are way off of their 2000 rates so far — Harris County , for example , is only at 35 % , when in 2000 it had a 68 % return rate .
But these numbers in conservative areas are worth watching .

The news just keeps getting worse for computer games giant Blizzard Entertainment , which is reeling after Korea 's Games Rating Board moved to ban youngsters from playing its upcoming title , ``StarCraft II . ''
StarCraft II was obviously the most - anticipated launch of 2010 , being the sequel to the original game that has sold more than 5 million copies since its 1998 release , while singlehandedly spawning a whole new industry of ``PC bangs '' ( commercial gaming lounges ) , and professional gaming leagues within a movement dubbed as e-sports .
The decision by the Games Rating Board , a unit of the Ministry of Culture , Sports and Tourism , is certainly a letdown , although Blizzard can file an objection within the next 30 days .
A Blizzard Korea spokeswoman said the company has yet to decide whether to challenge the decision by Korean game censors .
Should Blizzard opt to adjust the disputed parts of the content and retry the whole reviewing process , as it did with the first game , the release of StarCraft II would likely be delayed until next year .
`` We have nothing to say at this point .
We are discussing our official position on the matter as well as what would be the right reaction , '' she said .
The Games Rating Board 's decision to designate StarCraft II for gamers 18 years and older came as a surprise , as it was the same panel that gave an over - 15 - rating for previous test versions of the game last year .
Blizzard , however , was seeking something similar to the over - 12 - rating it got from North America , and requested a re-evaluation in April with a release candidate ( RC ) version of the game .
At least for now , the move seems to have blown up in Blizzard 's face , with the Games Rating Board insisting on getting stricter on the game 's level of violence , foul language and depiction of drug use .
``Considering that the RC version of the game is closer to what will be sold on the shelves compared to the beta versions , we looked more carefully at the content , '' said an official from the Games Rating Board .
``However , this rating is not final , as Blizzard will get the chance to object to it . ''
The government attempts to improve gaming behavior and curb compulsive gaming and addictions may also have influenced the over - 18 - rating for StarCraft II .
The measures , which are clearly focused on younger players who are apparently more vulnerable , include requiring games companies to introduce ``fatigue systems , '' which force disadvantages in game play when the advised limit for playing time is exceeded .
Why would I be showing you how implement singletons in PHP ?
Do n't I know that the singleton pattern suffers from obvious shortcomings ?
Of course I do , but I have an ulterior motive .
Singletons are a simple way to show off some of the features of PHP you probably do n't get to see and use too often .
Now we 've got that covered let 's see some code .
If you have n't seen a Singleton before the premise is simple : there should only ever be one instance of our class .
class Greeter { protected $ count ; private function __construct ( ) { $ this -> count = 1 ; } public function hello ( ) { return ' Hi ' .
$ this -> count ++ ; } public static function getInstance ( ) { static $ instance = null ; if ( $ instance === null ) { $ class = get_called_class ( ) ; $ instance = new $ class ( ) ; } return $ instance ; } } class FrenchGreeter extends Greeter { public function hello ( ) { return ' Bonjour ' . $ this -> count ++ ; } } echo Greeter:: getInstance () -> hello( ) ; echo Greeter:: getInstance () -> hello( ) ; echo FrenchGreeter::getInstance ( ) -> hello( ) ;
Now , there are a few fun snippets in this piece of code .
Let 's start at the top :
Private constructors
private function __construct ( ) ;
A private constructor ?
Yep .
That means that only the Greeter class can construct a new instance of itself .
You can try it if you 'd like :
$ bob = new Greeter ( ) ; Fatal error : Call to private Greeter::__construct ( ) from invalid context in C: \Users\Josh\Examples\singletons .php on line 1
Told you so .
So this prevents anyone from sneakily constructing a new instance of the class when we 're not looking .
On to the next snippet .
Static variables
public static function getInstance ( ) { static $ instance = null ;
Defining statically scoped variables within functions is a feature borrowed from C .
All static variables , whether defined in a method or in the class definition , are bound to the function and will persist across calls .
The initial assignment ( setting the variable to null ) is only executed once - when the variable is declared .
You can only assign scalar values on a static variable declaraion so the null assignment and check are necessary to if we are to assign an object or array to the variable .
You can use static variables in instance methods and plain old functions too .
If you do use them in an instance method then remember that the variable is bound to the class and not the instance .
Take a look at the following code :
class Counter { function count ( ) { static $ count = 1 ; return $ count ++ ; } } class SubCounter extends Counter { } $ a = new Counter ( ) ; $ b = new Counter ( ) ; $ c = new SubCounter ( ) ; echo $ a -> count ( ) ; echo $ b-> count ( ) ; echo $ c -> count ( ) ;
Even though $ a and $b are two separate instances the static $ count variable is scoped to the method , which is in turn scoped to the class , so is shared between instances .
When we call the method on $c our static variable is bound to SubCounter so we get the value of 1 .
Fetching the current class name
$ class = get_called_class ( ) ;
The get_called_class method is a long overdue addition to PHP and was added in the 5.3 release with the introduction of late static binding .
The function returns the class which the current method was invoked on .
The older get_class ( when called with no arguments ) and CLASS magic constant always return the name of the class where the current method was defined ( compile time binding ) .
Let 's take a look .
class A { public function who ( ) { echo __CLASS__ ; echo get_class ( ) ; echo get_class ( $ this ) ; echo get_called_class ( ) ; } public static function whoStatic ( ) { echo __CLASS__ ; echo get_class ( ) ; echo get_called_class ( ) ; } } class B extends A { } $ a = new A ( ) ; $ b = new B ( ) ; $ a-> who ( ) ; $ b-> who( ) ; A::whoStatic ( ) ; B::whoStatic ( ) ;
The get_class ( ) function is a kind - of dual purpose function .
If an object is passed to the function then it returns the name of that object 's class .
Otherwise it acts like CLASS .
Instance methods always give us an implicit $ this variable , which we can easily pass to get_class ( ) .
However , static methods have no such luxury .
Before the introduction of late static binding there was absolutely no way to determine which class a static method was called on .
Variable variable functions
$ instance = new $ class ( ) ;
This is one of PHP 's niftier features .
Any variable lookup , function call or class instantiation can be performed on a string value .
PHP calls these Variable variables and Variable functions .
Let 's check out some examples .
$ var = ' city ' ; $ city = ' London ' ; echo $ $var ; $ a = ' foo ' ; $ b = ' bar ' ; $ foobar = ' Found me ' ; echo $ {$a .
$ b} ; $ a = ' b ' ; $ b = ' c ' ; $ c = ' d ' ; $d = ' The end ' ; echo $ $ $ $a ; function greeting ( ) { echo ' Hi ' ; } $ func = ' greeting ' ; $ func ( ) ;
This allows for some neat meta- programming .
Though care should be taken not to abuse the functionality .
So there you have it , four advanced PHP examples from one design pattern ( that you should never , ever use ) .
Romanticism
Artistic and intellectual movement that originated in the late 18th century and stressed strong emotion , imagination , freedom from classical correctness in art forms , and rebellion against social conventions .
Romanticism , attitude or intellectual orientation that characterized many works of literature , painting , music , architecture , criticism , and historiography in Western civilization over a period from the late 18th to the mid-19th century .
Romanticism can be seen as a rejection of the precepts of order , calm , harmony , balance , idealization , and rationality that typified Classicism in general and late 18th - century Neoclassicism in particular .
It was also to some extent a reaction against the Enlightenment and against 18th - century rationalism and physical materialism in general .
Romanticism emphasized the individual , the subjective , the irrational , the imaginative , the personal , the spontaneous , the emotional , the visionary , and the transcendental .
Among the characteristic attitudes of Romanticism were the following : a deepened appreciation of the beauties of nature ; a general exaltation of emotion over reason and of the senses over intellect ; a turning in upon the self and a heightened examination of human personality and its moods and mental potentialities ; a preoccupation with the genius , the hero , and the exceptional figure in general , and a focus on his passions and inner struggles ; a new view of the artist as a supremely individual creator , whose creative spirit is more important than strict adherence to formal rules and traditional procedures ; an emphasis upon imagination as a gateway to transcendent experience and spiritual truth ; an obsessive interest in folk culture , national and ethnic cultural origins , and the medieval era ; and a predilection for the exotic , the remote , the mysterious , the weird , the occult , the monstrous , the diseased , and even the satanic .

Young children who watch a lot of TV are n't just missing out on more stimulating activities .
They may also be destined for problems at school and unhealthier habits later in life , new research suggests .
Each additional hour of TV that toddlers watch per week translates into poorer classroom behavior , lower math scores , less physical activity , and more snacking at age 10 , according to a new study in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine .
" Kids should be doing things that are intellectually enriching : playing with board games , playing with dice , playing with things that will improve their motor skills , reading , " says the lead author of the study , Linda Pagani , Ph.D. , a professor in the School of Psychoeducation at the University of Montreal , in Quebec .
" All that is replaced by sitting on the couch . "
Pagani and her colleagues followed more than 1,300 children for over seven years .
Using parent surveys , the researchers measured the amount of TV the kids watched at age two - and - a - half , and again at age four - and - a - half .
Then , when the children were in fourth grade , the researchers asked the kids ' schoolteachers to rate their academic performance , how well they got along with peers , and how well they listened and followed instructions .
They also asked parents about the child 's diet and level of physical activity .

Each additional hour spent in front of the TV per week at age two - and - a - half corresponded to a 7 percent decrease in classroom engagement , a 6 percent decrease in overall math achievement , and a 10 percent increase in being bullied by peers .
( Interestingly , TV time was not associated with reading skills . )
These findings suggest that kids who watch too much TV are " learning to be just a passive receptacle , " Pagani says .
TV watching also appeared to have negative effects on physical health , with each additional weekly hour resulting in a 9 percent decline in overall physical activity , a 9 percent increase in soft - drink consumption , a 10 percent increase in snacks eaten , and a 5 percent increase in body mass index .

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under the age of 2 watch no television at all , and after age 2 watch no more than one to two hours of quality programming a day .
But nearly half of 1 - to 2 - year - olds and more than 40 percent of 2 - to 3 - year - olds are estimated to watch more than the recommended amount , the study notes .
How does TV harm kids ?
Pagani's study is merely the latest to call attention to the drawbacks of childhood TV - watching .
A number of studies have linked too much TV to a range of negative effects in kids , including shorter attention spans , slower language acquisition , increased aggression , and weight gain .
Experts have suggested several possible explanations for these findings .
One theory is that time spent in front of the tube is time that could be spent on more enriching activities .
As Dr. Jeffrey Brosco , M.D. , a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine , puts it , " Every hour that you 're watching TV , you 're not talking to someone , not playing a game , not building something with your blocks . "
Health.com :
Too much TV linked to earlier death
Another theory is that the act of watching television can harm developing brains .
A child 's brain triples in size within the first three years of life in response to external stimulation , says Dr. Dimitri Christakis , M.D. , a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington and the country 's foremost expert on the health effects of TV in childhood .
" Early exposure to [ television ] can actually be over - stimulating for the developing brain , and that can lead to shorter attention spans [ and ] cognitive difficulties , " says Christakis , the author of " The Elephant in the Living Room : Make Television Work for Your Kids . "
The rapid edits and quick sequences found in many of today 's TV shows may be especially harmful in this respect , Christakis adds .
" The hypothesis we have is that this conditions the mind to expect high levels of input , and by comparison , reality is boring -- it does n't happen fast enough , " he says .
Yet another possibility is that the negative effects of TV that have been reported in studies are in fact a symptom of broader family and household dynamics .
In the new study , for instance , the children whose mothers were less educated and children from single - parent families tended to watch more television .
Although Pagani and her colleagues controlled for these and other factors in their analysis , household habits can shape studies like this in ways that can be difficult to tease out .

Make play areas greener and safer for kids
" It 's always possible that what you 're measuring is not TV itself , but families that are more likely to let their kids watch TV versus families that do n't want them to watch TV , or maternal education , " says Brosco .
" No one really understands what the effects of TV truly are , but so many studies -- like this [ one ] -- suggest TV is just plain bad for you . "
Some TV shows are better than others
Watching television is n't necessarily harmful , however , and it does n't have to be a mindless activity , says Christakis .
He points out that Pagani and her colleagues did not ask about the specific programming that kids watched , which may weaken the findings .
" The results of this study probably in some ways misrepresent the reality , " Christakis says .
" Studies that we 've done find that what kids watch -- and how they watch -- is as important as how much they watch . "
Health.com :
Is it baby fat or obesity ?
Christakis believes that children should watch no more than an hour of television a day at any age .
But , he says , parents should distinguish between mind - numbing cartoons and educational programs such as Sesame Street .
" Parents need to know that the best - quality shows have a curriculum , " he says .
" They 're trying to teach your child something , anything from the letter k to skills like how to share or how to handle a conflict . "
According to Christakis , the best way for young children to watch TV is with a parent .
This allows parents to use potentially negative content ( such as violence or advertising ) as a learning experience , and also provides an opportunity to engage with the children and reinforce the message of educational shows .

appears in a cameo as a celebrity in a distractingly terrible wig who likes to fuck midgets .
He only exists in this movie to have sex with midgets in ways that shake up the plot , and that is precisely what he does .
Wait for it .
The Conflict
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Boom !
You already know the conflict : Carol and Steve are pregnant with a baby that might be a midget .
What you do n't know is that this movie has a quota of people who despise midgets that must always be maintained .
In the beginning , as stated , it 's Carol , who is n't sure if she 's morally okay with bringing another dwarf into the world .
Once she realizes she 's confusing " dwarves " with " mobile AIDS unit , " she softens and learns to love all things tiny .
When that happens , a switch is flipped and Steve , who up until that point was fine with dwarves , considering he was raised by them , turns into a self - hating almost - dwarf .
Here he is reacting to the news that his baby is a dwarf .
The Script
He screams and punches a hole in the wall of the hospital room that holds his wife , newborn son and their doctor who , yes , is also a little person .
There are a lot of tear - filled arguments and , eventually , Steve has to leave because ( ready ? ) he does n't love and understand dwarves the way Carol does .
She has to raise their baby on her own , because of Steve 's prejudice and hitherto concealed anger issues .
I 'll be honest , I 'm not sure there was one .
A lot of the scenes in this movie play like improvisation exercises .
Imagine you had a scene partner , and whatever that partner said of you , you had to accept it without question and continue the scene with your new information , even if that information conflicted with previous information .
Either that or the director is bored off screen and occasionally shouts " CHANGE ARGUMENTS . "
I 'll give you an example , this is towards the end of the movie .
Steve and Carol had the baby , but Steve 's already decided it 's best for the baby if he 's not around to bother it with his anger .
Several months later , this scene takes place .
Keep in mind these lines are just about verbatim ( except the director 's , which I 've clearly added based on assumption ) .
Just watch how many times " Steve 's Problem " changes throughout :

A Loudoun County man died Saturday after a freak accident on the softball diamond .
Well - known custom home builder George Crisp , 55 , was pitching in adult softball game when a ball was batted back at him .
" George pitched the ball , the guy hit a line drive toward him , he turned his head to avoid it -- just like you would , tried to put his glove up , " said Crisp 's friend David Pittman , a pastor at Temple Baptist Church in Herndon , Va .
" Did n’t get his glove up in time and it hit him right here , right underneath the ear . "
The line drive hit Crisp in the throat , just below his jaw , rupturing his carotid artery .
Blood flooded his brain in seconds .
Crisp , a father of six , died a few hours later in a local hospital .
" It happened so quickly , " Pittman said .
" In just one 12 - hour period and he ’s gone from being the life of the party to being in home in heaven . "
Crisp actually talked about dying on the softball field , according to his son - in - law , George Kall .
He thought it would be ideal to have it happen when you 're " doing something you love , " recalls Kall .
Crisp is most being remembered for his humanitarian work and sense of humor .
" He ’d get everybody laughing , " Pittman said .
" There were times I would say , ' George , stop .
I ca n’t breathe , ' everybody was just holding their sides .
He had that knack .
Some people try to be funny .
George did n’t try , he just was funny . "
A longtime member of Temple Baptist , Crisp went on a church mission to Papua New Guinea in January .
He and his fellow missionaries also built churches , clinics and orphanages in places like Uganda , Brazil , Mexico and Japan
" I almost had people pass out yesterday when I told them that George had died , " Pittman said .
" He was so fun loving that , well I can tell you this , planning for the funeral , we plan for hundreds to come . "
As you may have heard , Viacom and YouTube have been having a little tift lately , in the form of a major lawsuit by the former over copyrighted material posted on the video portal .
It 's a lawsuit that , according to YouTube , will cause such video sites to " cease to exist in the current form " -- but more importantly , it 's a lawsuit that leads to some rather hilarious behind - the - scenes details .
Here 's a really juicy one that the official YT blog published today by Chief Counsel Zahavah Levine .
Word has it that Viacom had hired over the years at least 18 different marketing firms to inconspicuously upload content .
We can't really say it better than the posting :
" [ Viacom ] deliberately " roughed up " the videos to make them look stolen or leaked .
It opened YouTube accounts using phony email addresses .
It even sent employees to Kinko's to upload clips from computers that could n't be traced to Viacom . "
Wait , it gets better .
According to Levine , Viacom 's tactics were so good that the company itself did n't even know which videos it had uploaded , prompting multiple occasions where it would demand a clip removed , only to later ask for its reinstatement .
" In fact , " she claims , " some of the very clips that Viacom is suing us over were actually uploaded by Viacom itself . "
Hit up the source link for all the details .
Honestly , we can't wait to see what else is dug up in these proceedings .
Of course , that 's not the whole story .
Also revealed in court documents today was discussions by Viacom to -- get this -- purchase YouTube before News Corp .'s Rupert Murdoch got the chance to do it himself .
Let 's be thankful for that judge 's decision to unseal all court documents , shall we ?
Sev­er­al years ago , dur­ing their ​“ annu­al argu­ment about abor­tion , ” doc­u­men­tary film­mak­er Faith Pennick ’s pro-life friend assert­ed that as African Amer­i­cans , they should n’t be argu­ing in the first place , since abor­tion is a ​ “ white woman ’s issue ” and black women have more impor­tant things to wor­ry about .
Black women frequently feel a tension between asking for government support for access to family planning and opposing efforts by policymakers to use birth control to limit family size .
Shocked by this state­ment , Pen­nick start­ed doing exten­sive research to dis­pute her friend ’s asser­tion , and the result was Silent Choic­es , an award - win­ning doc­u­men­tary that explores black women ’s expe­ri­ences with abor­tion – a top­ic Pen­nick and oth­er black repro­duc­tive rights activists say is blan­ket­ed in silence .
“ White women not only allow them­selves to talk about this issue , but will­ing­ly own it and take it on as the bell­wether of pol­i­tics , of why they vote , ” Pen­nick says .
​ “ But as black women , we feel if we acknowl­edge we have abor­tions , or even con­sid­ered hav­ing an abor­tion , we ’re going to be looked down upon not only as women , but as a race . ”
This silence is sig­nif­i­cant , Pen­nick says , when one con­sid­ers a recent study by the Guttmach­er Insti­tute that shows black women obtain abor­tions at rates three to five times high­er than white women .
Through her research , she dis­cov­ered not only a per­va­sive hush on black abor­tions in the pub­lic sphere , but , per­haps more sur­pris­ing­ly , with­in black fam­i­lies and their communities .
This silence , Pen­nick says , cuts across all class lines .
​ “ In my expe­ri­ence , both in research­ing and mak­ing Silent Choic­es as well as in my per­son­al cir­cles ” she says , ​“ mid­dle - class , col­lege - edu­cat­ed black women are just as uncom­fort­able talk­ing about abor­tion or acknowl­edg­ing that they had abor­tions as poor work­ing - class black women . ”
Pen­nick says the rea­sons for this self - cen­sor­ship are com­pli­cat­ed , and are root­ed in the his­to­ry , mythol­o­gy and stereo­types that sur­round African - Amer­i­can women and their repro­duc­tive rights , as well as a deeply reli­gious culture .
Accord­ing to a 2009 report by the Pew Forum on Reli­gion & Pub­lic Life , near­ly eight in 10 African Amer­i­cans claim that reli­gion is very impor­tant in their lives , com­pared with just over half of all U.S. adults .
And while black church­es have his­tor­i­cal­ly served as bea­cons of polit­i­cal activism in this coun­try , most of them have remained mute on the issue of abor­tion .
​ “ Black church­es are very left as far as their polit­i­cal views on cer­tain issues , ” Pen­nick notes , ​ “ but when it comes to some­thing like abor­tion , there ’s this weird sort of break , like a split personality . ”
One of the most per­va­sive stereo­types attached to this issue , Pen­nick says , is the image of the black woman as sex­u­al­ly promis­cu­ous .
​ “ If we talk about abor­tion , ” says Pen­nick , ​“ it might make peo­ple think we ’re freaks who just love sex .
Not that there ’s any­thing wrong with lov­ing sex , but we ’re giv­ing the racists ammu­ni­tion to say , ​‘See , look at those sluts . ’ “
To illus­trate how this stereo­type con­tin­ues to thrive in con­tem­po­rary soci­ety , Pen­nick points to the dis­cov­ery in 2008 that Bris­tol Palin – the 17 - year - old , unwed daugh­ter of the GOP ’s vice - pres­i­den­tial can­di­date – was preg­nant .
​ “ Some­how , for con­ser­v­a­tive whites , it rein­forced their tra­di­tion­al fam­i­ly val­ues because she kept the baby and got engaged , ” Pen­nick says .
​ “ But if that had been Sasha or Malia Oba­ma , if they had been 16 or 17 and had got­ten preg­nant , oh my , every con­ser­v­a­tive in this coun­try would have been say­ing , ‘[ The Oba­mas ] have no fam­i­ly val­ues , they ’re hor­ri­ble parents . ’ “
Dorothy Roberts , a law pro­fes­sor at North­west­ern Uni­ver­si­ty and author of Killing the Black Body : Race , Repro­duc­tion , and the Mean­ing of Lib­er­ty , traces the promis­cu­ity stereo­type direct­ly to the orig­i­nal defens­es of slav­ery that ​“ paint­ed Africans more like ani­mals than human beings , peo­ple who were sex­u­al­ly licen­tious and did n’t have the intel­lect to con­trol their bod­i­ly drive . ”
His­tor­i­cal­ly , black women ’s child­bear­ing has been por­trayed as irre­spon­si­ble and in need of gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tion , Roberts says .
Prac­tices reflect­ing these stereo­types have includ­ed such things as fam­i­ly caps for wel­fare recip­i­ents , forced ster­il­iza­tion , and the dis­tri­b­u­tion of risky birth - con­trol med­i­cines such as Nor­plant and Depo - Provera to poor black women .
​ “ It ’s no won­der black peo­ple would think there ’s an effort to stop us from hav­ing chil­dren , and that affects how we think about abor­tion , ” Roberts says .
Anoth­er rea­son for the silence may be a lin­ger­ing belief that grew out of the 1960s black nation­al­ist move­ments : that abor­tion and birth con­trol are tools of whites in pow­er to lim­it the black pop­u­la­tion .
​ “ Even if peo­ple are n’t nation­al­is­tic , ” says Roberts , ​“ there ’s a sense that child­bear­ing is a pos­i­tive thing that con­tributes to your whole com­mu­ni­ty , and there­fore hav­ing an abor­tion vio­lates that . ”
Because of this com­pli­cat­ed his­to­ry , Roberts says , black women fre­quent­ly feel a ten­sion between ask­ing for gov­ern­ment sup­port for access to fam­i­ly plan­ning and oppos­ing efforts by pol­i­cy­mak­ers and oth­ers to use birth con­trol to lim­it their fer­til­i­ty .
It has also cre­at­ed schisms between black and white repro­duc­tive rights activists .
One exam­ple , Roberts says , is the bat­tle in the late 1970s over ster­il­iza­tion .
“ [ Pri­or to reg­u­la­tions ] there were cas­es where doc­tors would refuse to ster­il­ize white women even if they begged for it , because in the doctor ’s view , why would a young white woman not want to have chil­dren ?
Where­as they were ster­il­iz­ing black women with­out their con­sent and some­times even knowl­edge , ” she says .
In 1978 , fed­er­al rules put into place to restrict ster­il­iza­tions includ­ed a 30 - day wait­ing peri­od and guar­an­teed con­sent .
To many white women , these reg­u­la­tions inter­fered with their con­sti­tu­tion­al rights , yet women of col­or want­ed assur­ance they would n’t be ster­il­ized with­out permission .
In recent years , Robers says , anti-abor­tion groups have been attempt­ing to label abor­tion as ​ “ black geno­cide . ”
In 2008 , Rep. Trent Franks ( R‑Ariz . ) pro­posed the Susan B. Antho­ny Pre­na­tal Nondis­crim­i­na­tion
Act , which would ​“ pro­hib­it dis­crim­i­na­tion against the unborn on the basis of sex or race . ”
His pro­pos­al died in part because women of col­or orga­nized to opose it .
Byl­lye Avery , founder of the Avery Insti­tute for Social Change and the Nation­al Black Women ’s Health Imper­a­tive , says that while it ’s true the black com­mu­ni­ty has remained large­ly hushed on the issue of abor­tion , lead­ing black women ’s repro­duc­tive rights activists have been speak­ing loud­ly about it for years .
The prob­lem , she main­tains , is that women ’s rights orga­ni­za­tions – run large­ly by white women – have not been recep­tive to their ideas .
“ One of the many fights we had with them … is when we said , ​‘Expand your agen­da to include all repro­duc­tive rights issues .
Do n’t just talk about abor­tion .
What about infant mor­tal­i­ty rates , or access to birth con­trol , or ster­il­iza­tion abuse ? ’
When peo­ple hear these things linked togeth­er , they have a hard­er time iso­lat­ing you as just being pro-choice , ” Avery says .
​ “ But that ’s not some­thing they want­ed to do . ”
In 1974 , Avery cofound­ed the Gainesville ( Fla . ) Women ’s Health Cen­ter , a women ’s gyne­co­log­i­cal cen­ter that was also a first - trimester abor­tion clin­ic .
​ “ It was very impor­tant to me for peo­ple to under­stand that abor­tion does n’t exist in iso­la­tion , that it ’s includ­ed in the whole repro­duc­tive spec­trum , ” Avery says .
​ “ So when peo­ple saw [ birthing and abor­tion cen­ters ] hooked togeth­er , it made it much more accept­able and they were bet­ter able to understand . ”
Lori Hyl­ton , a mar­ried moth­er in New York who speaks in Silent Choic­es of hav­ing two abor­tions after becom­ing preg­nant with the same man while on birth con­trol in col­lege , says she too was acute­ly aware of cul­tur­al pres­sures to keep her expe­ri­ences secret .
​ “ A lot of it stems from this idea of , ​‘ Why would you put your busi­ness in the street so white Amer­i­ca can judge you ?
Do n’t they spend enough time judg­ing us as it is ? ’ , ” says Hylton .
Even so , Hyl­ton believes it ’s impor­tant that she con­tin­ue to share her sto­ry .
​ “ Hav­ing a choice is some­thing peo­ple take for grant­ed in this coun­try , and we need to be able to stand up for it .
It does n’t mean anyone ’s push­ing any­one to get an abor­tion , ” she says .
​ “f I keep my secrets , then no one can learn from my experience . ”

The Fed and its friends and enablers in power , most recently Rahm Emanuel , are fighting tooth and nail to beat back the Audit the Fed amendments to pending financial reform legislation .
That ’s unfortunate and misguided .
Even a cursory inspection of the Fed ’s disclosures of its extraordinary rescue operations shows them to have been made only under duress , and then to be incomplete and deliberately unhelpful .
The reason this matters , is that , contrary to the Fed ’s claims of independence , it has been operating as an extra-legal off balance sheet entity of the Treasury , circumventing normal Constitutionally - stipulated budget processes .
And rather than make adjustments in its practices to reflect its enlarged and now overtly political role , the Fed has instead been engaging in cynical , blatant misrepresentation , giving lip service to the idea of greater transparency in public , while fighting disclosure tooth and nail .
Since the Fed has entered into an openly political stance ( and this dates back to Greenspan ) and cannot be relied upon to make truthful and complete disclosures , the only recourse is to put it on a much shorter leash , which includes greater scrutiny , including third party validation .
The Fed has brought on the audit demands via the unabashed and repeated abuse of its privileged role .
The case study is its Maiden Lane disclosures .
Readers may recall that the original Maiden Lane was a new entity formed to hold dodgy Bear Stearns assets , a backstop to induce JP Morgan to take the balance of the failed investment bank .
JPM took a thin first loss position ; the bulk of the capital came via a loan from the Fed , which means the Fed would lose money if losses exceeded the JP Morgan slice , which was a mere $ 1.15 billion out of $ 30 billion .
Even though the backdoor subsidy to JP Morgan elicited a great deal of criticism , even from the normally taciturn Paul Volcker , the Fed was apparently so pleased with this idea that it used the same approach with AIG .
The central bank created Maiden Lane II to hold dubious AIG mortgage assets , and Maiden Lane III for CDOs ( alert readers may recall that Maiden Lane III was part of the mechanism that the New York Fed used to take various dealers that had credit default swap exposures to the Fed out at 100 cents on the dollar ) .
All these vehicles are managed by BlackRock .
The Fed , aided and abetted by BlackRock , has long been publishing rosy valuations of the assets of the various Maiden Lane vehicles .
Accuracy of valuation matters for a host of reasons .
First , the public has a right to know how large the various government subsidies to the banking industry are , irrespective of Fed and Treasury efforts to camouflage them .
Second , losses on the Fed ’s accumulation of dreck may well rise to the level that it will require Treasury ( meaning taxpayer ) recapitalization of the Fed ( the central bank can in theory “ print ” its way out of any shortfall , but as former central banker , now Citigroup chief economist Willem Buiter has pointed out , the Fed ’s anti inflation mandate puts limits on how far it can go down that path ) .
Third , this willingness to bend facts reveals troublingly cavalier attitude from a bank regulator .
If the Fed thinks fudging its own marks is OK , it is likely to be unduly tolerant of truth - bending by the institutions it supervises .
Our own look at Maiden Lane III at the end of last year suggested the valuations were too high , but without more disclosure , we could n’t reach any hard and fast conclusions .
The Fed seems to be raising artful dodging to an art form , engaging in the form of disclosure when it fact is it simply providing impressive - looking data that is virtually useless from an analytical perspective .
Let ’s look at a simple example .
The Fed provided a juicy - looking list of the transactions in Maiden Lane , the Bear bailout vehicle .
It would be nice to spot check some of the valuations , particularly since the portfolio was exposed to hotels ( 82.3 % of the CMBS were “ hospitality ” ) .
Hotels , unless they are in very prime locations , tend to be worth a lot less dead than alive .
They are often built for particular hotel chains , and if that operator gets in trouble , the options for disposition of the asset are limited .
The building may have no value to other users and has to be razed , leading to serious losses to lenders .
Now the Fed does report impaired assets for Maiden Lane , and it appears to mark them down aggressively ( the year end report shows non-performing assets at 13.5 % of par value ) but it simultaneously appears to have gotten more liberal as to when it deems an asset to be non-performing :
In 2009 the LLC changed its classification of Non performing / Nonaccrual loans to include loans with payments past due greater than 90 days or when the LLC has doubts about the future performance of the loan assets .
The prior year presentation disclosed all loans greater than 60 days past due .
This change in presentation was made to conform with industry standards and did not have a material effect on the LLC ’s consolidated financial statements .
Hhhm .
It might be nice to see how Maiden Lane is carrying particular impaired assets .
A recent Wall Street Journal story tells us a lot of hotels are in trouble right now .
In particular , Red Roof Inns has had delinquencies since last June , plenty of time for it to be picked up in the 1/29/10 transaction level reports just released .
But what do we see ?
Click to enlarge ; see p. 21 ) :
Now why is this significant ?
The values here foot with that of a prospectus on the “ RRI Hotel Portfolio ” prepared by Bear Stearns .
From page d-14 :
The Loan .
The third largest loan ( the “ RRI Hotel Portfolio Loan ” ) is a $ 186,000,000 pari passu portion of a $ 465,000,000 first mortgage secured by the borrowers ’ fee interests and leasehold interests in 79 Red Roof Inn hotels ( the “ RRI Hotel Portfolio Properties ” ) … .
The Borrowers .
The borrowers , R - Roof I LLC , R - Roof II LLC and R - Roof III LLC , each a Delaware limited liability company , are single purpose entities , each with an independent director , that own no material assets other than its respective properties in the RRI
Yves here .
So what did the Fed give us ?
The stupid par value of the loans .
We have no idea , nada , of the current carrying value .
So there is no way for third parties to inspect the reasonableness of the marks .
The reported non-performing commercial balance is well in excess ( $ 1.1 billion ) than the par value of the Red Roof loans .
So there is more junk in there , but which deals ?
And are the values plausible ?
The central bank ’s Maiden Lane disclosure is a prime example of adhering to the form of disclosure while giving as little ground as possible on the substance .
It ’s a certainty that BlackRock ’s reports to the Fed are more transparent and informative .
We have pages of “ HTL ” entries with no balances ( so if there are no assets , why are they listed ? ) and some isolated entries with amounts indicated , like the remarkably informative “ HTL OWNED MEZZ I - II LLC ” with a $ 22.932 million balance ( p. 14 ) .
But the real fun starts on p. 87 ( of 131 ) with “ Swaps and Hedges ” .
If mystery hotels were entertaining , imagine what a party mystery credit default swaps are .
BlackRock can say these instruments are worth whatever it bloody pleases , and who in the chump public will be the wiser ?
The Fed seems awfully keen to steer clear of the fate that befell Lehman .
Lehman was grossly and verifiably misvaluing some investments , namely Archstone and SunCal , that confirmed doubts about the veracity of its accounting .
If you ca n’t check any particular valuations , it ’s a lot harder to ask difficult questions .
And unlike Lehman , the Fed can continue to account to no one .
The Fed is engaging in same practices that caused the crisis : failure to make timely disclosures , obfuscation , use of off balance sheet vehicles to distance itself from losses .
This posture alone should disqualify the central bank from assuming a greater regulatory role .
The Fed and Treasury ’s three card monte operation is anti-democratic and possibly illegal , and to add insult to injury , voters are treated as if they have no right to know when they are ultimately footing the bill .
The Fed ’s persistent stonewalling and deep seated hostility toward the public provide ample proof of the need for an audit .
Row over extension of Dutch troops ' tour of duty in Afghanistan forces Labour out of Jan Peter Balkenende 's ruling coalition
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The Dutch government has ­collapsed over disagreements on whether or not to extend troop deployment in Afghanistan .
The prime minister , Jan Peter Balkenende , said the Labour party – the second - largest party in his ruling coalition – was quitting .
He tendered his government 's resignation to Queen Beatrix , the Dutch ceremonial head of state , in a telephone call .
Balkenende has been weighing up a request from Nato for Dutch troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond 2010 .
Just under 2,000 Dutch personnel have been serving in the southern Afghan province of Uruzgan , where 21 Dutch soldiers have been killed .
Balkenende 's Christian Democratic
Alliance wants to keep a trimmed - down military presence in the region , but the Labour party has demanded the Netherlands sticks to a scheduled withdrawal .
The troops should have returned home in 2008 , but their stay was extended to August 2010 because no other Nato country offered replacements .
" A plan was agreed when our soldiers went to Afghanistan , " said the Labour leader , Wouter Bos .
" Our partners in the government did n't want to stick to that plan , and on the basis of their refusal we have decided to resign from this government . "
In Brussels , Nato spokesman James Appathurai said the military alliance did not comment on the internal political debates of member countries .
" Of course , Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen continues to believe that the best way forward would be a new , smaller Dutch mission , including a provincial reconstruction team in Uruzgan . "
He added that this would consolidate the success that the Dutch have had and ease the transition of peacekeeping to Afghan forces .
Any Dutch withdrawal would be a worrying sign for the alliance , which has struggled to raise the 10,000 additional troops that its top commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , has demanded to accompany the 30,000 US reinforcements being deployed there .
The Labour withdrawal leaves the Dutch coalition government with just 47 seats in the 150 - member parliament .
Elections can be held as early as May under Dutch law – one year ahead of schedule .
The answer at this point is — nobody knows , or could possibly know .
Solicitor General Kagan has almost no paper record of scholarship on Indian law , no judicial opinions , and little else in the way of a paper trail .
Her most intimate association with Indian Country is her membership ( now likely former ) on the board of the American Indian Empowerment Fund ( as noted here ) , which probably came about as a concomitant duty related to her Harvard deanship and duties in filling the Oneida Chair at Harvard Law .
As is well known , Harvard Law has had some difficulty in completing the requirements of the Oneida endowment ( hiring a full - time Indian law prof ) , as the Chair is always filled by visitors .
What this means is anyone ’s guess , though some of my former law school colleagues are certain it is a bad thing she had trouble hiring minority law profs .
The only known impact of Kagan ’s nomination if she is confirmed , is that she will likely be forced to recuse herself in the 2010 Term ’s lone ( so far ) Indian law case , United States v. Tohono O’odham Nation ( No. 09 - 846 ) .
Who knows how that will affect the decision , though the T.O.N. would only have to find four Justices to prevail ( as would happen in a 4 - 4 tie ) .
Once the T.O.N. case is decided , we may hear much more from a Justice Kagan , who perhaps will be tapped write some of the Indian law decisions ( as junior Justices often are ) .
Which leads to my final comment .
A Justice Kagan is yet another player from the elite of the legal profession , an elite that rarely has even more than a passing interest in Indian law and Indian Country .
From Justice Brennan referring to Indian law cases as “ chickenshit ” ( page 435 of The Brethren ) , to the modern and open hostility of most Justices to Indian cases , this does not bode well .
It could , if a Justice Kagan is open - minded and willing to listen and learn , but more likely than not , she ( as do most or all of the other Justices ) may find her Indian law assignments a burden .
That would be a shame .
Perhaps we ’ll see .

Elmer ’s Island Wildlife Refuge , even after all the warnings , looks worse than I imagined .
Pools of oil black and deep stretch down the beach ; when cleanup workers drag their rakes along an already - cleaned patch of sand , more auburn crude oozes up .
Beneath the surface lie slimy washed - up globules that , one worker says , are “ so big you could park a car on them . ”
It ’s Saturday , May 22nd , a month into the BP spill , and I ’ve been trying to get to Elmer ’s Island for the past two days .
I ’ve been stymied at every turn by Jefferson Parish sheriff ’s deputies brought in to supplement the local police force of Grand Isle , a 229 - year - old settlement here at the very southern tip of Louisiana .
Just eight miles long and so narrow in some spots that you can see from the Gulf side to the inland side , Grand Isle is all new clapboard and vinyl - sided bungalows since Katrina , but still scrappy — population 1,500 , octuple that in tourist season .
It ’s also home to the only route to Elmer ’s , a barrier island to the west .
I arrived on Thursday with my former University of New Orleans lit prof , John Hazlett ; a tandem kayak is strapped to his Toyota Tacoma .
At the turn to Elmer ’s Island Road , a deputy flags us down .
Ca n’t go to Elmer ’s ; he ’s just “ doing what they told me to do . ”
We continue on to Grand Isle beach , where toddlers splash in the surf .
Only after I ’ve stepped in a blob of crude do I realize that the sheen on the waves and the blackness covering a little blue heron from the neck down is oil .
The next day , cops drive up and down Grand Isle beach explicitly telling tourists it is still open , just stay out of the water .
There are pools of oil on the beach ; dolphins crest just offshore .
A fifty - something couple , Southern Louisianians , tell me this kind of thing happened all the time when they were kids ; they swam in rubber suits when it got bad , and it was no big deal .
They just hope this does n’t mean we ’ll stop drilling .
The blockade to Elmer ’s is now four cop cars strong .
As we pull up , deputies start bawling us out ; all media need to go to the Grand Isle community center , where a “ BP Information Center ” sign now hangs out front .
Inside , a couple of Times - Picayune reporters circle BP representative Barbara Martin , who tells them that if they want passage to Elmer they have to get it from another BP flack , Irvin Lipp ; Grand Isle beach is closed too , she adds .
When we inform the Times - Pic reporters otherwise , she asks Dr. Hazlett if he ’s a reporter ; he says , “ No . ” She says , “ Good . ”
She does n’t ask me .
We tell her that deputies were just yelling at us , and she seems truly upset .
For one , she ’s married to a Jefferson Parish sheriff ’s deputy .
For another , “ We do n’t need more of a black eye than we already have . ”
“ But it was n’t BP that was yelling at us , it was the sheriff ’s office , ” we say .
“ Yeah , I know , but we have …a very strong relationship . ”
“ What do you mean ?
You have a lot of sway over the sheriff ’s office ? ”
“ Oh yeah . ”
“ How much ? ”
“ A lot . ”
When I tell Barbara I am a reporter , she stalks off and says she ’s not talking to me , then comes back and hugs me and says she was just playing .
I tell her I do n’t understand why I ca n’t see Elmer ’s Island unless I ’m escorted by BP .
She tells me BP ’s in charge because “ it ’s BP ’s oil . ”
“ But it ’s not BP ’s land . ”
“ But BP ’s liable if anything happens . ”
“ So you ’re saying it ’s a safety precaution . ”
“ Yeah !
You do n’t want that oil gettin ’ into your pores . ”
“ But there are tourists and residents walking around in it across the street . ”
“ The mayor decides which beaches are closed . ”
So I call the Grand Isle police requesting a press liason , only to get routed to voicemail for Melanie with BP .
I call the police back and ask why they gave me a number for BP ; they blame the fire chief .
I reach the fire chief .
“ Why did the police give me a number for BP ? ” I ask .
“ That ’s the number they gave us . ”
“ Who ? ”
“ BP . ”
When I tell Chief Aubrey Chaisson that I would like to get a comment on Barbara ’s intimations — and my experience so far — that BP is running the show , he says he ’ll meet me in a parking lot .
He pulls in , rolls down the window of his maroon Crown Victoria , and tells me that I ca n’t trust the government or big corporations .
When everyone saw the oil coming in as clear as day several days before that , BP insisted it was red tide — algae .
Chaisson says he ’s half - Indian and grew up here and just wants to protect the land .
When I tell him BP says the inland side of the island is still clean , he spits , “ They ’re fucking liars .
There ’s oil over there .
It ’s already all up through the pass . ”
The spill workers staying at my motel later tell me they ’ve been specifically instructed by BP not to talk to any media , but they ’re pissed because BP tried to tell them that the crude they were swimming around in to move an oil containment boom was red tide , dishwashing - liquid runoff , or mud .
The next morning at breakfast , the word at Sarah ’s Restaurant is that the island will have to be shut down ; the smell of oil was so strong last night one lady had to shut all her windows and turn on her AC ; if her asthma keeps up like this , she ’ll need to go on her breathing machine tonight .
I ’ve corralled Irvin Lipp , who drives me and a few wire photographers out to Elmer ’s .
( He tells me ruefully that he has history with Mother Jones , having once been a flack for DuPont . )
The shoreline is packed with men in hats and gumboots and bright blue or white shirts .
Nearly all are African - American , many hired from around New Orleans .
They tell me they ’ve been standing in these exact same spots for three days .
It ’s breathtakingly hot .
They rake the oil and sand into big piles ; other workers collect the piles into big plastic bags , and still other workers take them to a plant where the sand is separated out and sent to a hazardous - waste dump and the oil goes on for processing .
Then the tide comes in with more oil and everybody starts all over again .
Ten dollars an hour .
Twelve hours a day .
When I joke with one worker that he should pocket the solid gobs of oil he ’s digging up to show me how far beneath the sand they go , he stops dead and asks me if BP ’s still trying to use the oil they all collect .
“ Aw , I knew it ! ” he says .
Another leans on his rake to ask me , “ Have they at least shut the oil off yet ? ”
He randomly picks three spots in a three - foot - wide expanse of sand that he ’s already raked clean and drops his rake in an inch deeper to show me how the oil bubbles up from underneath .
He ca n’t count how many times he ’s raked this same spot in the 33 hours he ’s worked it since Thursday , but one thing he ’s sure of , he says , is that he ’ll be standing right here tomorrow and the next day , too .

Third - year Harvard Law student Stephanie Grace sent a mass email about whether black people are categorically less intelligent than white people .
Now her campus , legal blogs , and the Black Law Students Association are up in arms , and Stephanie is hiding .
In the spring of her third and final year at Harvard Law , Stephanie Grace knows she shot herself in the foot .
Coming home after a dinner debate with a group of law students over whether race determines intelligence , Stephanie fired off an email to her companions eugenics - lite email screed about " the possibility that African Americans are , on average , genetically predisposed to be less intelligent . "
Which was the bigger mistake : thinking this audience would n't take offense , or thinking they would n't be cutthroat enough to take her down ?
Someone forwarded the email to Harvard 's Black Law Students Association , and the email made its way to Black Law Students Associations ' email lists nationwide .
Then legal blog Above the Law printed the email with her name redacted .
As comment moderators fought to keep her name off their site , Stephanie apparently navigated to Facebook and began scrubbing herself from the internet , presumably to minimize how closely the imbroglio would be tied to her name , face , and reputation .
She ignored our requests for comment , giggling , " That 's not me , " when she hung up on us on the phone .
( It was her .
The outgoing voice message said so . )
Stephanie graduated from Princeton in 2007 with a degree in — wait for it — sociology .

BREAKING : NHL on NBC Does Pretty Solid Business This Weekend
April 19 , 2010 by Stephen M. Lepore
NBC Sports told Puck the Media that the two broadcasts on NBC managed the same average rating this weekend , with one game up and one down , while overall both telecasts were respectable for NHL numbers .
The Saturday telecast of Boston / Buffalo drew a 1.2 overnight rating .
This is up ( if my math is correct ) 20 % from last year ’s NY Rangers / Washington telecast , which drew a 1.0 rating .
The game drew a 20.7 rating in the Buffalo market , in case you were wondering if that market would n’t be back in a big way .
The game also did a 5.3 local rating in Boston .
The Sunday broadcast of Phoenix / Detroit drew a 1.5 overnight rating , the highest of any indoor NHL game this season .
While this is down ( again , fingers crossed with my math ) 12 % from last year ’s Pittsburgh / Philadelphia telecast , which drew a 1.7 rating .
The game drew a 13.4 in Detroit , and a 5.3 in Phoenix .
That ’s right , kids , Phoenix and Boston drew the same local rating for hockey this weekend .
Still , the fact that a game featuring the Phoenix Coyotes drew the NHL ’s highest non-Winter Classic rating this season is very impressive .
Thanks to NBC Sports for the numbers .
LOS ANGELES — President Obama will send up to 1,200 National Guard troops to the Southwest border and seek increased spending on law enforcement there to combat drug smuggling after demands from Republican and Democratic lawmakers that border security be tightened .
The decision was disclosed by a Democratic lawmaker and confirmed by administration officials after Mr. Obama met on Tuesday with Republican senators , several of whom have demanded that troops be placed at the border .
The lawmakers learned of the plan after the meeting .
But the move also reflected political pressure in the president ’s own party with midterm election campaigns under way and with what is expected to be a tumultuous debate on overhauling immigration law coming up on Capitol Hill .
The issue has pushed Janet Napolitano , the secretary of homeland security , into something of a corner .
As governor of Arizona , she demanded that Guard troops be put on the border .
But since joining the Obama administration , she has remained noncommittal about the idea , saying as recently as a month ago that other efforts by Mr. Obama had made the border “ as secure now as it has ever been . ”
With the announcement of Elena Kagan as nominee for the open seat on the Supreme Court , comments both sound and foolish are sure to flood the media .
In the prior category is the observation that Ms. Kagan is a brilliant legal scholar with a superb record of service in the federal government and as a law school dean .
In the foolish category , we are already hearing a replay of an attack critics used against her when she was being considered for her current position as solicitor general .
That attack goes ...
Has there ever been a better moment for tween girls ?
“ Hannah Montana ” and “ Wizards of Waverly Place ” reign on the Disney Channel .
Tween idol Taylor Swift rules the radio .
There are even tween girls in the White House .
Since mega- successes like “ High School Musical , ” Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers showed execs the way , pop culture has been flooded with tween girl entertainment .
And yet another promising series about a cool teen girl , “ Victorious , ” debuts on Nickelodeon on Saturday .
But what about the boys ?
Some parents are asking whether the TV landscape has undergone a tween gender shift that leaves boys in the lurch .
“ Is it just me , or does it seem when it comes to what ’s going on in the tween world , it ’s mostly about the girls ? ” asked a parenting blogger at the website Charm City Moms .
Many of the nominees for “ Nickelodeon ’s 23rd Annual Kids ’ Choice Awards ” ( airing at 8 p.m. Saturday ) seem more like girls ’ choice .
In the favorite TV show category , nominees are “ iCarly , ” “ Sonny With a Chance , ” “ The Suite Life on Deck ” and “ Wizards of Waverly Place , ” all of which have a majority female viewership , according to the Nielsen Co .
The Kids ’ Choice favorite TV actress nominees -- Miranda Cosgrove , Miley Cyrus , Selena Gomez and Keke Palmer -- are all tween girl icons .
And favorite TV actor nominees Cole and Dylan Sprouse and Joe and Nick Jonas are tween girl crush objects .
Among the nominees are some shows with boy appeal , such as “ SpongeBob SquarePants , ” “ Phineas and Ferb ” and “ Penguins of Madagascar ” -- but these are cartoons .
While the range of aspirational , live - action female main characters grows , there are few real , live male heroes in evidence .
Yes , tween boys ( ranging in age from 6 or 9 to 12 or 14 , depending on whom you ask ) have some traditionally boyish media favorites , like YouTube sensation Fred Figglehorn ( who ’s getting his own Nickelodeon movie later this year ) , and “ Weird Al ” Yankovic , who ’s reaching a new generation of guffawing 11 - year - olds via the Web and a production deal with the Cartoon Network .
But boys are n’t dreaming of becoming “ Weird Al ” the way girls are Miley Cyrus .
Where are the boys ’ boys ?
Executives at Disney argue that the issue is n’t that boys are n’t being served enough boy characters , but that boys have changed and now have no problem relating to strong female leads .
In other words , the world is becoming more coed , and tween TV is reflecting that .
Just look at Nick ’s hit comedy “ iCarly , ” now in its third season , about a girl ( Cosgrove ) who creates a Web show with her friends Freddie and Samantha .
Nick ’s strategy with shows like “ iCarly ” and new series “ Big Time Rush ” has been to reach both genders with the same programming .
It ’s been paying off : “ iCarly ” is the No. 1 live - action program on TV with all boy demos , bringing in 3,113,000 viewers on average last year , according to the Nielsen Co. , of which 440,000 were tween boys and 481,000 were tween girls .
“ Big Time Rush , ” a comedy about four teen boys who become a pop sensation , also approaches a fifty - fifty male - female tween viewership .
Marjorie Cohn , executive vice president , original programming and development for Nickelodeon , said , “ We do n’t feel like boys are just about action and fighting shows .
We ’ve found that boys , especially in recent years , have become more emotionally intelligent .
They love shows about relationships and humor . ”
Could it be that what we ’re seeing is not a dearth of programming for boys , but social progress ?
“ In the same way we should celebrate Hillary Clinton , ” Cohn said , “ we should celebrate boys being able to talk about relationships . ”
But some cultural observers argue that TV , and American culture generally , is neglecting tween boys ’ developmental needs .
Peg Tyre , author of the bestselling book “ The Trouble With Boys : A Surprising Report Card on Our Sons , Their Problems at School , and What Parents and Educators Must Do , ” believes that series like “ iCarly ” show boys only the way girls want to see them .
“ What they want and how we see them are very different , ” Tyre said .
“ We misunderstand boys ’ fascination with violence .
They ’re playing with issues of loyalty , bravery and standing up for their friends -- big moral questions .
These days , playing nicely and quietly is considered a ‘ better ’ form of play than shooting each other with sticks .
I ’m not sure that ’s true . ”
And where do boys go to shoot each other with sticks nowadays ?
To video games .
By not offering alternatives to girl culture , Tyre said , we force boys into “ the fantasy world of Grand Theft Auto , which is really unsavory . ”
Disney and Nickelodeon executives insist that they know tween boys just fine , and can offer up mountains of research to justify their emphasis on relationship - driven shows .
“ These [ tween boys ] are complex beings who are evolving , ” said Gary Marsh , the president , entertainment and chief creative officer of Disney Channels Worldwide .
“ They are looking for support systems -- teammates , if you will .
They ’re in the process of trying out new skills , sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing .
It ’s this sense of trying to ‘ level up , ’ in game language . ”
To better serve this demographic , Disney launched a new boy - centric channel in February 2009 called Disney XD , with an emphasis on programming around teamwork and this idea of “ leveling up ” through effort .
According to Disney XD literature , DXD has a 60 - 40 male - female viewership that complements Disney Channel ’s 40 - 60 .
The network is a work in progress .
The average viewership of all airings of flagship show “ Aaron Stone ” so far this year , according to the Nielsen Co. , was 237,000 per episode .
Compare that with “ Hannah Montana ” on the Disney Channel , which brought in 2,233,000 .
But other Disney XD shows have taken off , such as the cartoons “ Phineas and Ferb ” and “ Kick Buttowski , ” and the live - action shows “ Zeke and Luther ” and “ I ’m in the Band . ”
Marsh said the network has an “ audacious ” long - term strategy : “ To become the go - to destination for boys 6 - 14 , both on TV , online and everywhere that boys consume media . ”
Does that mean there ’s a male Hannah Montana on the way ?
“ These iconic heroes need to emerge from the connection the audience has to them , ” Marsh said .
“ You ca n’t create a phenomenon by gritting your teeth and trying hard . ”
But he is hopeful that , “ a year from now , we will have aspirational boy heroes emerge . ”
So what is the future image of cool boyhood ?
The apparent consensus : renaissance men .
Nick ’s Marjorie Cohn , who has two sons , said : “ My boys play fighting games and then they ’ll talk about their feelings . ”
She ’s optimistic that the well - roundedness of today ’s boys bodes well for the future of their media and our society .
“ Our boys , ” she said , “ are going to be great citizens . ”

Catherine Hakim argues that " erotic capital " — a " combination of physical and social attractiveness " — is more important for women than a college degree .
Arguments for women's " soft " ( read : sexual ) power are n't new — but here 's why they suck .
Advertisement
They rely on generalizations .
The idea that feminine wiles give women enormous social power ( and even that these wiles " outweigh educational qualifications , " as Hakim claims in her Prospect article ) typically rests on a lot of unexamined assumptions about men , women and sex .
Here are some from Hakim 's piece :
[ W] omen have long excelled at such arts : that 's why they tend to be more dressed up than men at parties .
They make more effort to develop the " soft skills " of charm , empathy , persuasion , deploying emotional intelligence and " emotional labour . "
[ S] urveys around the globe find that women over 30 steadily lose interest in erotic games .
This is an implicit rebuttal to feminist thinkers ( like Sylvia Walby , Mary Evans , Monique Wittig or most recently Kat Banyard ) who argue that men and women are " equal " in their sexual interest , as in everything else .
This is obviously not true , which is why it should not surprise us that some women do use sex , and their erotic capital more generally , to get what they want .
Advertisement
It 's notoriously difficult to determine people 's sexual desire from surveys , and all too easy to make blanket statements like " women make more effort to develop charm . "
It 's certainly true that women can exert sexual influence over men , but to assume that the arrow of influence always goes one way not only ignores the many women under and over thirty who have done dumb shit to fuck a dude , it also reinforces the reductive notion of sex as something women have and men want .
This is true for some people some of the time , but it 's almost impossible to make the case for " erotic capital " as a major cultural force without some pretty sweeping generalizations .
" Erotic capital " depreciates .
Though Hakim generously includes some over - 40 ladies in her list of erotic - capitalists ( notably Michelle Obama and Carla Bruni ) , it 's still true that society views female sexual attractiveness as a depreciating asset .
Those " beautiful and elegant women who grace the advertisements for products of all kinds , from cars to detergent " are usually young , and in the case of many high - end fashion models , very young indeed .
Hakim even makes the connection between youth and " erotic capital " explicit : " the final element of erotic capital is unique to women : bearing children .
In some cultures , fertility is an essential element of women 's erotic power . "
A woman 's beauty and attractiveness do n't necessarily dim with age , but her ability to a ) have kids and b ) look like the ladies in car ads certainly do .
So really , it makes less sense to think of socially - defined sexiness as " capital " — it 's more like a really crappy investment .

" Erotic capital " does n't guarantee actual capital .
Sure , being hot might land you a rich husband , but if he only likes you for your " erotic capital , " he could easily leave for someone who has more .
And then you 're SOL — especially if there 's a prenup .
And while Hakim makes much of the " beauty premium " by which pretty people are paid more ( while oddly downplaying the role of the employer discrimination in this ) , she does n't acknowledge the double - bind women can get into in the workplace , in which they find themselves caught between being " too feminine " and " not feminine enough . "
Any how - to article on dressing for work reveals that breasts are often as much a liability as an asset at the office , and anyone who thinks it 's easy for women to flirt — or sleep — their way to the top should look at research showing that focusing on a woman 's appearance makes people see her as less competent .
The bottom line is that " erotic capital " is all about others ' perceptions of women , rather than about things women themselves can do or acquire .
That 's the main reason " soft power " is n't real power — because when your influence is based on someone else 's desire , he 's the one who 's really in control .

Have You Got Erotic Capital ?
[ Prospect ]
Hello , my name is Kiven and I live in New Zealand
New Zealand is the most beautiful country in the whole world and one day I will be king of it because my mum says that people with red hair are descended from royalty .
New Zealand Facts
Captain Hook discovered New Zealand in 1964 .
After a brief bout of scuffles known affectionately as the Maori Land Wars , a treaty was signed between the two granting gifts to the Maori such as immortality , Harley - Davidson motorcycles and replica Tag Heuer watches .
There are currently more New Zealanders living in Australia than New Zealand due to the fact that New Zealanders cannot stand being around New Zealanders .
82 % of New Zealanders think that New Zealand is not a state of Australia .
Due to the cold climate , New Zealanders have a five millimetre coating of body lice for insulation which they call their " wiggly skin . "
The omission of New Zealand from recently published world maps was expected to cause much controversy but nobody noticed or cared .
Due to the earths plate movement , each year New Zealand moves several metres closer to Australia .
Each year , Australia spends billions of dollars moving several metres further away from New Zealand .
Hello , my name is Kiven and I live in Wellington , the capital of New Zealand .
It is the best village in the whole world and a thriving metropolis with seventy four residents .
When I grow up I want to drive the village car .
My plan is to drive to the neighbouring village of Auckland in the middle of the night and steal their fire .
The residents of Wellington will probably build a mud statue in my honour like they did for my uncle Robert when he caught a pig .
Every day I play the national sport of ' throw a stick ' where you throw a stick .
It is so much fun and often I will spend the entire day throwing a stick .
When I climb into bed for the night , I practice by throwing twigs across the room in preparation for the next days game of throw a stick .
When I am not playing throw a stick , I play a game called find where the stick went .
Alhough New Zealand is the best country in the whole world , I dream of one day traveling to exotic lands such as Australia .
I have heard they have magic boxes called " tilevesion . "
My Dad , who is also my brother and the local wife punching champion , told me that the best part of traveling is coming home so as I am approaching the beach in my canoe , I will call out the traditional Maori homecoming greeting " wheresmydinnerbitch " and the villagers will rush out to greet me and listen to tales of my exciting adventures .
I will then be classed as a man and given my choice of sheep from the village flock .
I have been courting one named Betty for several months and have managed to save almost thirty dollars in sea shells , our local currency , to buy her a necklace made of sea shells .
My auntie , who is also my second cousin and the village prostitute , pays me to sit on her porch and watch out for uncle Robert .
The current currency conversion of US$ 1.00 = NZ 9000.072 means I have a lot of shells .
I keep them on the beach .
My uncle Robert , who is also my nephew , official village pig catcher and head of New Zealand tourism ( famous for the catch phrase " At least it 's not Adelaide " ) has initiated several projects aimed at increasing tourism to New Zealand .
These include an annual four day ' look at the sheep ' festival , sheep rides , a ' famous sheep through history ' exhibition and a guided tour in the village car to view local highlights such as sheep .
If I was a sheep , I would write something in the dirt , becoming a famous communicating sheep and the subject of much scientific and media interest .
I would be rich and buy a Porsche .
Every seventy four days , when it is my turn to wear the village shoes , I go hiking through the sheep paddocks , enjoying the feeling of not having sheep droppings between my toes , then climb a hill to sit at the top singing .
My favourite song is called ' Kahadanhibrakahana ' which roughly translated from Maori means ' I am sitting on a hill ' .
As I share a bedroom with seventeen siblings , this solitude is something I look forward to .
Sometimes I play throw a stick but usually I just masturbate .
Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is taking fire from the prominent conservative think tank Cato Institute for criticizing President Barack Obama ’s health care plan despite having enacted an “ essentially identical ” bill as governor of Massachusetts in 2006 .
“ As President Obama himself has pointed out , Romney is the guy who created the prototype for ObamaCare , ” said Cato ’s executive vice president David Boaz , in a new video posted at the institute ’s Web site .
“ How can he lead the charge against a health care plan that is modeled on his own ? ”

With opposition to health reform a key rallying point for the GOP , Romney ’s landmark accomplishment as governor of Massachusetts has turned into a potentially fatal threat to this 2012 presidential ambitions .
“ When you run down this list of elements in the Obama plan and the Romney plan , they are all identical , ” said Michael Cannon , Cato ’s director of Health Policy Studies .
Both plans comprise a series of insurance regulations , subsidies and mandates to extend coverage to the uninsured .
Both create insurance exchanges that allow individuals and small businesses to pool risk , and neither includes a government - run option .
The Wall Street Journal ‘s conservative editorial board called the Obama and Romney measures “ fraternal policy twins “ , noting that the former governor “ signed a prototype of ObamaCare into law in Massachusetts . ”
The media has taken note , too .
The Associated Press recently ran a story last week headlined , “ Romney attacks health care law similar to his own . ”
The Christian Science Monitor wondered , “ Who is the father of health care reform : Obama or Mitt Romney ? ”

Romney is widely considered the leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 .
He won the Southern Republican Leadership Conference straw poll last weekend and came in second behind long - shot candidate Ron Paul at CPAC in February .
This story was first reported by Reid Wilson of the National Journal .
The video is from the Cato Institute .
Maher is saying some important things , things that people in Europe are afraid to say to the increasing Muslim population .
It might just sound like shock humor but it's the truth , do some research !
Islam is kind of in a fucked up period where they are in a modern world with dark age - era laws and rules .
It seems that wherever a Muslim population increases , so do honor - killings and other odd culture related behavior .
Not everything in Islam is weird but the subjugation of women is a mental problem , not a cultural trait .
Ayaan Hirsi discusses this in her biography Infidel .
Its an incredible book and I recommend people check it out to understand the controversy behind south park and why Comedy Central was so afraid .
Hirsi was Muslim ( fixed ) but became Christian after escaping Kenya for Europe and then , finally , she became an Atheist in America .
In her book , she chronicles the death of Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh .
Hirsi worked with him on the film Submission .
It criticized Islam 's treatment of women .
It greatly angered some people and a man ran up to Van Gogh on the street and killed him with a butcher 's knife .
Starting to understand Comedy Central 's fears ?
Ayaan tells the honest truth about Islam , in 2007 she came on the Colbert Report to talk with Stephen :
Torontonians are less active than other Canadians , a new study has found .
Some 57 per cent of Torontonians aged 12 and older were inactive during their leisure time in 2007 - 08 , compared to a national average of 50 per cent , according the 2010 Get Active Toronto Report on Physical Activity .
The Toronto number is up six percentage points since 2005 .
The report , to be released Tuesday , was prepared by Get Active Toronto , a coalition of public and private organizations , including Toronto Public Health , the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario and the Toronto District School Board .
The most frequently cited barrier to physical activity is lack of time , according to the report .
“ Work - life balance is a major factor , ” said Cat Girotti , manager of Get Active Toronto , explaining why the city ’s residents have less time for physical activity .
“ Toronto likes to work .
It ’s the centre of commerce and that comes first . ”
An “ active ” person is someone who walks at least an hour , jogs a minimum of 20 minutes or expends the equivalent amount of energy daily .
An “ inactive ” person expends less energy on all leisure time activities than is required to walk for half an hour a day .
A moderately active person is in between .
Activity levels are particularly low for immigrants , the report found .
While 49 per cent of Canadian - born Torontonians are inactive , that number jumps to 64 per cent for immigrants .
“ Many immigrants who have come to Toronto are struggling of the first few years .
Maybe physical activity takes second place for awhile , ” said Doug Norris , senior vice - president of Environics Analytics , another member of the coalition .
Girotti said immigrants tend to live in poorer neighbourhoods with limited access to recreational spaces .
“ The actual physical environment is constructed in such a way that it ’s difficult to be physically active .
They live in an apartment , they have to get an elevator , the playgrounds are n’t always safe , ” she said .
The findings in the report are derived from a variety of data sources , including the 2006 Census , the Canadian Community Health Survey , and school board and city studies .
After lack of time , Torontonians offered the following reasons for not being active : lack of willpower ( 20 per cent ) , physical discomfort ( 12 per cent ) , social isolation ( 8 per cent ) , intimidation ( 9 per cent ) , and embarrassment ( 7 per cent ) .
Norris said many people do not feel comfortable joining gyms or activities at recreational centres .
They may not know how to use equipment or do workout routines .
They may feel embarrassed about their strength and coordination or have issues with body image .
And they may not feel they are part of the target audience for such activities , he said .
Sometimes , even clothing plays a role .
The report found that the majority of students from grades 7 to 12 say they do not participate in any sports , neither at nor after school .
Girls and children of low - income parents and immigrants are among the least active here .

Girotti said many families can’t afford to enrol their children in extracurricular activities .
For girls , peer pressure and social situations make physical activity less popular , she said .
The organization says the report can be a valuable tool in building a healthier city .
Measuring and analyzing physical activity can help government and community agencies find ways to encourage active lifestyles .
A blunt slogan and a simple image : these basic elements of persuasion , protest , propaganda or making a point have been used in tandem and to great effect for as long as anyone reading this has been alive .
Presumably , these messages have always been received in a variety of ways .
But these days , it seems , when a slogan and an image reach a significant audience , that ’s not the end of the process .
In fact it ’s just the beginning .
For example , when red posters bearing the sans - serif slogan “ Keep Calm and Carry On ” underneath a simple crown icon started catching on in Britain a few years back , Bex Lewis knew their provenance .
Now an associate lecturer in history and media studies at the University of Winchester , Lewis wrote her Ph.D. thesis on British propaganda posters devised for the home front during World War II .
The “ Keep Calm ” poster , meant to be distributed in the event of a German invasion , was extremely obscure for many decades .
So she was interested , she recalls , to see it turning into “ sort of a consumer item . ”
That process began with a fluke : in 2000 , Stuart and Mary Manley , owners of a shop called Barter Books in north England , found one of the original posters folded up in the bottom of a box of old books and framed it .
Customers liked it , and eventually the Manleys decided to sell reproductions .
“ Part of it is that it does have this sort of intrinsic British feel about it , ” Mary Manley says , adding that the poster evokes a “ nostalgia for a certain British character , an outlook . ”

On a less romantic note , the design is in the public domain , meaning it can be remade and sold by anybody .
A British freelance television - production manager named Mark Coop , for one , decided it “ would be a brilliant idea to put it on a T - shirt . ”
In 2006 , he bought the domain name keepcalmandcarryon.com , and offers the slogan and design on a variety of goods , including cuff links and duffel bags .
Around the same time , Victoria Smith , a San Francisco Bay Area design blogger and photographer , bought one of the Barter Books posters secondhand and ended up producing her own silk - screen “ Keep Calm ” prints in a variety of color variations that she sells on Etsy.com .
Barter Books has added mugs and mouse pads to its lineup .

CHALLENGES do n’t get much bigger than trying to create artificial consciousness .
Some doubt if it can be done – or if it ever should .
Bolder researchers are not put off , though .
“ We have to consider machine consciousness as a grand challenge , like putting a man on the moon , ” says Antonio Chella at the University of Palermo in Italy and editor of the International Journal of Machine Consciousness .
The journal was launched last year , a sign of the field ’s growing momentum .
Another landmark is the recently developed “ Conscale ” , developed by Raúl Arrabales of the Carlos III University of Madrid in Spain to compare the intelligence of various software agents – and biological ones too ( see diagram ) .
Perhaps the closest a software bot has come so far is IDA , the Intelligent Distribution Agent built in 2003 by Stan Franklin at the University of Memphis in Tennessee .
IDA assigns sailors in the US navy to new jobs when they finish a tour of duty and has to juggle naval policies , job requirements , changing costs and sailors ’ needs .
Like people , IDA has “ conscious ” and “ unconscious ” levels of processing .
At the unconscious level she deploys software agents to gather data and process information .
These agents compete to enter IDA ’s “ conscious ” workspace , where they interact with each other and decisions get made .
The updated Learning IDA , or LIDA , was completed this year .
She learns from what reaches her consciousness and uses this to guide future decisions .
LIDA also has the benefit of “ emotions ” – high - level goals that guide her decision - making . …
Last week , we summarized a Labor Department report on hours worked and earnings by state , which found that Nevadans work the longest hours and workers in the District of Columbia had the highest hourly wage .
Over at The Atlantic , Richard Florida has parsed the data to focus on what makes a state ’s labor force more or less likely to work longer weeks and get higher pay .
His result : Education seems to play a big role in how long a state ’s average resident works , and for what wage .
In the chart below , Mr. Florida , director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto , plotted states according to human capital — here defined as what share of their work force had at least a bachelor ’s degree — and how much their average worker earned per hour .
Richard Florida and Charlotta Mellander
As you can see , states with more college graduates tended to have higher wages ( with a correlation of 0.65 ) .
And that ’s not all .
He also looked at the relationship between human capital and hours worked .
Generally speaking , states with more highly educated workers worked shorter weeks ( with a correlation of negative 0.59 ) .
Richard Florida and Charlotta Mellander
Of course , correlation is not causation .
But plenty of research indicates that a more educated local economy is a healthier economy , as one of our Daily Economists , Edward L. Glaeser , has written .
So it does not seem such a stretch to find a pattern between human capital and earnings or more convenient hours .
Another provocative trend that Mr. Florida found is between immigration and state pay .
Economists have long debated how immigration affects the American job market , with some believing that it depresses ( at least some ) native workers ’ wages and others arguing that immigration is a boon to the American economy and average worker earnings .
This scatterplot suggests that state hourly earnings are positively associated with the percentage of immigrants ( correlation of 0.64 ) .
Richard Florida and Charlotta Mellander
Again , correlation is not causation , and there may be all sorts of confounding variables here that skew the results .
But even so , it ’s food for thought .
From the first moments that the Deepwater Horizon oil rig sank last month , it has been apparent that the blooming Gulf oil spill has been an oil disaster unlike any other .
But the full truth of that statement is perhaps only now beginning to become apparent .
The oil that can be seen from the surface is apparently just a fraction of the oil that has spilled into the Gulf of Mexico since April 20 , according to an assessment the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology .
Significant amounts of oil are spreading at various levels throughout the water column , says the report , which was posted online a week ago but first published by The New York Times Saturday .
IN PICTURES : Louisiana oil spill
The research , combined with other emerging data , could fundamentally alter researchers ’ understanding of the oil spill .
It suggests that vastly more oil than previously reported could be spilling from the wellhead and the attached riser pipe that now lies crumpled on the seafloor like a kinked and leaking garden hose .
Moreover , it suggests that serious environmental degradation could take place in the open ocean , creating massive “ dead zones ” where no creature can live because of the lack of oxygen in the water .
The spread of oil at all levels of the Gulf also could become a concern for shore communities in hurricanes , which stir up the water column as they come ashore .
Scientists looking at video of the leak , suggest that as many as 3.4 million gallons of oil could be leaking into the Gulf every day – 16 times more than the current 210,000 - gallon - a - day estimate , according to the Times .
The depth of the problem
The fact that the spill could possibly be so radically misunderstood nearly a month after it began speaks to the unique nature of this spill .
In particular , its depth – 5,000 feet below the ocean surface – makes it both unprecedented and difficult to study .
For experts , “ most of their experience is with shallow - water spills that quickly bleed black goo onto beaches that are cleaned up relatively quickly , ” says the Los Angeles Times .
That is clearly not what has happened in the Gulf , where shorelines have , so far , emerged relatively unscathed .
The nature of the oil in the Gulf oil spill could be relevant – it is of a lighter grade than that in the Exxon Valdez spill , for example .
More relevant could be the dispersant that BP is applying to the oil at the source .
BP officials have hailed the process as a success , noting diminishing oil at the surface .
But the dispersant breaks the oil into smaller drops , which might instead be spreading throughout the water column , instead of rising to the surface .
It is not clear what this would mean environmentally , though past research indicates that oil can be trapped in the seabed for decades after oil on the surface is cleaned away .
Complicating projections
It would , however , make predictions for the spill far more complex .
" We have no idea where the oil that is n't reaching the surface is going , " James Cowan Jr. , an oceanography professor at Louisiana State University , to the Los Angeles Times .
" It could go everywhere .
The Gulf currents operate differently at different levels , making the exact location and spread of the oil at different depths hugely important to predictions of where it might end up .
Indeed , the system so complex that in time , oil could be taken anywhere from the Mexican Coast to Florida ’s Palm Beach , research suggests .
BP has so far rejected any efforts toward pinpointing the exact amount of oil entering the Gulf , saying that effort would detract from other containment efforts , such as the current effort to stopper one of the leaks with a siphon .
But getting a more accurate sense of how much oil in leaking could be vital to trying to account for all of it , scientists say .

To this end , we conducted 18 FDG - PET scans in 13 PD patients in pre- and post - STN DBS conditions and correlated changes in their glucose metabolism with modified performances on the Eyes test , a visual ToM task requiring them to describe thoughts or feelings conveyed by photographs of the eye region .
Postoperative PD performances on this emotion recognition task were significantly worse than either preoperative PD performances or those of healthy controls ( HC ) , whereas there was no significant difference between preoperative PD and HC .
Conversely , PD patients in the postoperative condition performed within the normal range on the gender attribution task included in the Eyes test .
As far as the metabolic results are concerned , there were correlations between decreased cerebral glucose metabolism and impaired ToM in several cortical areas : the bilateral cingulate gyrus ( BA 31 ) , right middle frontal gyrus ( BA 8 , 9 and 10 ) , left middle frontal gyrus ( BA 6 ) , temporal lobe ( fusiform gyrus , BA 20 ) , bilateral parietal lobe ( right BA 3 and right and left BA 7 ) and bilateral occipital lobe ( BA 19 ) .
There were also correlations between increased cerebral glucose metabolism and impaired ToM in the left superior temporal gyrus ( BA 22 ) , left inferior frontal gyrus ( BA 13 and BA 47 ) and right inferior frontal gyrus ( BA 47 ) .
All these structures overlap with the brain network that mediates ToM .
Accordingly , the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of STN DBS on the ToM abilities of PD patients .
We hypothesized that STN DBS would impair ToM , because of the overlap between the limbic system , which is modulated by STN DBS in PD , and the brain network that mediates ToM .
A further aim of this study was to correlate these ToM modifications with changes in glucose metabolism .
To this end , we conducted an 18 FDG - PET investigation of thirteen PD patients in pre- and post - STN DBS conditions and correlated changes in their glucose metabolism with modified performances on a ToM task : the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test .
A number of positron emission tomography ( PET ) studies of humans have confirmed these hypotheses , demonstrating modifications in cerebral activation and associating them with changes in cognitive function [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] and emotional impairment following STN DBS [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
These results suggest that the STN may be part of a broadly distributed neural network involved in associative and emotional processing , either via computation within the STN itself or by virtue of its impact on other associative / limbic territories .
This network seems to encompass not only cortical regions , including the orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) , temporal sulcus , temporal poles , cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex , but also several subcortical regions , such as the amygdala and ventral striatum .
Interestingly , these structures appear to overlap with the brain network that mediates theory of mind ( ToM ) .
This is the cognitive ability to represent one 's own and other people 's mental states [ 15 ] , and seems to be sustained by the areas described above [ 16 ] .
Second , the SPM software established correlations between post - vs. preoperative changes in the ToM score and post - vs. preoperative changes in brain glucose metabolism .
To identify those regions that correlated significantly with impaired ToM , a general linear “ single subject , covariates only ” model was tested for every voxel , with the ToM score as a covariant .
This yielded a regression coefficient which was then transformed into a t-value .
Two t- tests were performed , revealing correlations between decreased cerebral glucose metabolism and impaired ToM , and between increased cerebral glucose metabolism and impaired ToM .
Next , t - statistic SPMs were calculated and clusters of at least 30 contiguous voxels with a threshold at p<0.005 , with multiple comparison correction , were considered to be significantly different .
First , the SPM software pinpointed significant modifications in cerebral metabolism in the 13 PD patients by comparing their 18 FDG - PET scans pre- and post - surgery .
As before , the effects of differences in overall metabolism were removed by normalizing each voxel to the same whole - brain value ( proportional scaling in SPM ) .
To determine the direct effects of STN stimulation , we used the “ population main effect , 2 conditions , 1 scan / cond ( paired t test ) ” routine .
Clusters of at least 20 contiguous voxels , with a threshold two - tailed p-value of 0.001 ( corrected for multiple comparisons ) , were considered to be significantly different .
Because of the small sample sizes , nonparametric analyses were carried out .
For the intergroup comparisons , paired comparisons were performed using the nonparametric Mann - Whitney U test for two independent groups ( pre vs. HC , post vs. HC ) .
For the intragroup comparisons , the Wilcoxon test for paired groups was used to measure the effect of the experimental condition ( before vs. after surgery ) .
Behavioural correlations between ( 1 ) neuropsychological background , control task and ToM , and ( 2 ) psychiatric tests and ToM , were assessed using Spearman 's rank correlation coefficient .
The p-value was significant if less than 0.05 .
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0 software .
All subject images were first realigned and spatially normalized into standard stereotactic space in accordance with the Talairach and Tournoux atlas [ 42 ] .
Affine transformation was performed to determine the 12 optimum parameters for registering the brain image to the template , and the subtle differences between the transformed image and the template were then removed using a nonlinear registration method .
Finally , spatially normalized images were smoothed using a 12 - mm full width at half - maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel to compensate for interindividual anatomical variability and to render the imaging data more normally distributed .
All subjects were studied using 18 FDG PET in a resting state with eyes open .
They underwent two scans : the first was performed 3 months before surgery and the second 3 months after surgery , with the stimulator switched on and with their antiparkinsonian medication .
PET measurements were performed using a dedicated Discovery ST PET scanner ( GEMS , Milwaukee , USA ) in 2D mode , with an axial field of view of 15.2 cm. A 222-296 MBq injection of 18 FDG was administered intravenously under standardized conditions ( in a quiet , dimly - lit room with the patient 's eyes and ears open ) .
During acquisition , the patient 's head was immobilized using a head - holder .
A cross-laser system was used to achieve stable and reproducible positioning .
A 20 - minute 2D emission scan was performed 30 minutes post- injection and after X - ray based attenuation correction .
These studies were performed with the subjects positioned at the centre of the FOV .
Following scatter , dead time and random corrections , PET images were reconstructed using 2D filtered back - projection , providing 47 contiguous transaxial 3.75 mm - thick slices .
Control task :
To check that the early processing stages of face perception were intact , and to supplement the gender attribution task included in the Eyes test , the Benton Facial Recognition Test [ 37 ] was administered to all participants .
This task requires participants to match pictures of the same individuals ' faces taken from different angles and in different lighting conditions .
None of the patients included in the study presented any aperceptive prosopagnosia , as measured by the Benton recognition test .
In addition , to check that their verbal abilities were intact , the abridged version of the Token Test [ 38 ] and the verbal modality of the Pyramids and Palm Trees Test ( PPTT ) [ 39 ] were administered to all participants .
The former assesses syntactic comprehension and requires participants to point to tokens corresponding to a verbal instruction ( e.g . “ Touch the large red square ” ) , while the latter measures semantic access from words and requires participants to match one item ( word ) with one of two others ( e.g. a pyramid with a palm tree or a pine tree ) .
None of the patients included in the study presented any deficit either in syntactic comprehension , as measured by the Token Test , or in semantic access , as measured by the verbal PPTT .
Scoring :
The test was scored by adding up the number of items ( photographs ) that were correctly identified by the participant , i.e. the number of correctly identified mental states .
The maximum “ Emotion score ” on the test was therefore 17 , which was converted into a percentage of correct responses .
In addition , a control score was calculated by adding up the number of correct responses in the gender attribution task .
The maximum “ Gender score ” on the test was therefore 17 , and scores were once again converted into a percentage of correct responses .
A French adaptation of the revised version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test was used [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
We administered a shortened computerised version , comprising 17 photographs of the eye region of the faces of male and female actors .
An example of the items in the Eyes test is available in Figure S1 .
In order to avoid a list effect between the pre- and post - treatment conditions , two versions of the Eyes test were used and counterbalanced .
In the pre-treatment condition , half the participants were assessed with version “ a ” of the task and half with version “ b ” .
In the post - treatment condition , the first half were assessed with version “ b ” and the second half with version “ a ” .
The stimuli were depicted on separate slides and presented one after the other .
Four adjectives corresponding to complex mental state descriptors ( e.g. hateful , panicked ) were printed on each slide , with one adjective in each corner and the photograph in the middle .
One of these words ( the target word ) correctly described the mental state of the person in the photograph , while the others were included as foils .
It was possible for these three foils to have the same emotional valence as the target word .
Participants were required to decide which of the four words best described what the individual in the photograph was thinking or feeling , and there was no time limit .
Participants were instructed to read the chosen word aloud .
This task is regarded as an advanced ToM task , as participants have to try and put themselves in the shoes of the people shown in the photographs and attribute a relevant complex mental state to them .
As a control task , participants judged the gender of the person shown in the photograph ( gender attribution task ) .
Before the test , participants read through a glossary which contained the meanings of the words describing the mental states .
If necessary , the glossary could be used during the assessment [ 35 ] .
Prior to the ToM assessment , a short neuropsychological and psychiatric battery was administered to the two groups ( i.e. the PD group and the HC group ) .
The battery included the MDRS [ 21 ] and a series of tests assessing executive functions : the Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( MCST ) [ 28 ] , the Trail Making Test ( TMT ) [ 29 ] , categorical and literal fluency tasks [ 30 ] , the Action ( Verb ) Fluency task [ 31 ] and the Stroop test [ 32 ] .
Depression was assessed using the MADRS [ 22 ] .
The MADRS was chosen because of the predominance of psychic items over somatic ones , thus limiting interference with Parkinson 's symptoms .
Finally , the State - Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) [ 33 ] was used to assess anxiety .
In all patients , chronic stimulation was monopolar , using a single contact of the quadripolar electrode chosen for the best motor improvement .
The stimulation characteristics were as follows : mean pulse width 60 µs for the right side ( SD = 0 ) and 60 µs ( SD = 0 ) for the left side , mean frequency 138.1 Hz ( SD = 13.5 ) for the right side and 139.2 Hz ( SD = 13.0 ) for the left side , and mean voltage 2.2 V ( SD = 0.6 ) for the right side and 2.3 V ( SD = 0.6 ) for the left side .
The contacts ' coordinates were expressed as millimetres along three axes originating from the middle of the bicommissural line : the first axis was parallel to the bicommissural line , the second axis was perpendicular to the AC - PC line and the third axis was perpendicular to the midsagittal plane .
The mean ( ± SD ) coordinates of the left selected contacts were 13.1 ( ±1.3 ) mm lateral to the AC - PC line , 0.8 ( ±2.0 ) mm below AC - PC and 3.9 ( ±1.5 ) mm posterior to the midpoint of the AC - PC line .
The mean coordinates of the right selected contacts were 11.1 ( ±1.2 ) mm lateral to the AC - PC line , 1.5 ( ±1.8 ) mm below AC - PC and 4.5 ( ±1.6 ) mm posterior to the midpoint of the AC - PC line .
Quadripolar ( from “ 0 ” for the most ventral contact to “ 3 ” for the most dorsal one ) deep brain stimulation electrodes ( 3389 Medtronic , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) were implanted bilaterally in the STN .
The overall methodology was similar to that previously described by Benabid and colleagues [ 27 ] .
The location of the two selected electrode contacts ( one on the left and one on the right ) was determined using the stereotactic coordinates of a ventriculogram performed at the beginning of the surgical procedure .
During the operation , the final locations of the electrode were determined by the best effect obtained on rigidity with no side effects and at the lowest voltage .
A three - dimensional CT brain scan performed a few days later confirmed the position of the electrodes .
All the patients were assessed three months before and three months after surgery , using motor , PET and neuropsychological assessments .
These evaluations were all performed the same week .
All the patients were on stimulation and on dopa for the PET and neuropsychological evaluations .
Prior to the STN DBS , all patients were neuropsychologically assessed to rule out cognitive impairments , using the MDRS [ 21 ] and executive tasks , and depression , using the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) [ 22 ] .
After surgery , they were followed up clinically by a movement disorder specialist .
None of the patients included in this study suffered from dementia ( Mattis : mean ( ± SD ) = 141.4 ( ±1.7 ) ) or depression ( MADRS : mean ( ± SD ) = 3.4 ( ±4.2 ) ) .
The patient group consisted of a series of 13 consecutive patients with medically intractable PD , who underwent bilateral STN DBS at Rennes University Hospital ( France ) .
Standard selection and exclusion criteria for surgery were applied to all patients [ 18 ] .
In particular , brain atrophy was excluded on the basis of a preoperative MRI scan and a radiological analysis .
There were eight men and five women .
Mean ( ± SD ) age at surgery was 53.3 ( ±8.5 ) years .
Mean ( ± SD ) education level was 12.7 ( ±3.1 ) years .
All 13 PD patients were right - handed , according to the criteria of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ 19 ] .
Mean ( ± SD ) disease duration at surgery was 10.5 ( ±3.6 ) years .
The total levodopa - equivalent dose ( LED ) was calculated on the basis of the following correspondences adapted from [ 20 ] : mean ( ± SD ) 1,081.1 mg ( ±605.3 ) before STN DBS and 625.8 mg ( ±600.9 ) after STN DBS .
Participants ' performances on the ToM task are presented in Table 2 .
In the preoperative condition , no significant difference was found between the PD and HC groups for any of the variables of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test ( all measures p>.5 ) .
In the postoperative condition , a significant difference was found between the PD and HC groups for the Emotion score of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test ( U = 42.50 , p = .03 ) .
There was no significant difference between the PD and HC groups in the postoperative condition for the Gender score of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test ( U = 63.00 , p = .3 ) .
Within the PD patient group , analyses revealed a significant difference between the pre- and postoperative conditions for the Emotion score of the Eyes test ( z = − 2.14 , p = .03 ) .
There was no significant difference between the pre- and postoperative conditions for the Gender score of the Eyes test ( z = − 1.24 , p = .2 ) .
Performances by the participants on the neuropsychological and psychiatric tests are presented in Table 2 .
In the preoperative condition , no significant difference was found between the PD and HC groups for neuropsychological background and psychiatric tests ( all measures p>.1 ) .
In the postoperative condition , no significant difference was found between the PD and HC groups for neuropsychological background and psychiatric tests ( all measures p>.1 ) .
Within the PD patient group , no significant difference was found between the preoperative and postoperative conditions for neuropsychological background and psychiatric tests , except for the number of categories and errors on the MCST ( z = 1.89 , p = .05 and z = − 2.50 , p = .01 ) , and for Action ( Verb ) Fluency ( z = − 2.05 , p = .04 ) .
It should be noted that analyses revealed a trend towards significance for the improvement in the number of perseverative errors on the MCST ( z = − 1.72 , p = .08 ) and in the categorical fluency score between the preoperative and postoperative conditions ( Z = − 1.75 , p = .08 ) .
No significant difference was found between the PD and HC groups for the Benton Facial Recognition Test in either the preoperative condition ( U = 70.50 , p = .4 ) or the postoperative one ( U = 74.00 , p = .6 ) .
Within the PD patient group , no significant difference was found between the preoperative and postoperative conditions for the Benton recognition test ( z = 0.00 , p = .1 ) .
Discussion
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of STN DBS on the ToM abilities of PD patients .
We hypothesized that STN DBS impairs ToM because of the overlap between the limbic system , which is modulated by STN DBS in PD , and the brain network that mediates ToM .
A further aim of this study was to correlate these ToM modifications with changes in cerebral glucose metabolism .
Results confirmed our initial hypothesis and provided a preliminary demonstration of ToM impairment following STN DBS .
Postoperative PD performances were significantly worse than HC and preoperative PD performances on the emotion recognition task of the Eyes test , whereas there was no significant difference between preoperative PD and HC performances .
Conversely , in the postoperative condition , the PD patients scored within the normal range on the gender attribution task of the Eyes test , which was used as a control task .
As far as the metabolic results are concerned , there were correlations between decreased cerebral glucose metabolism and impaired ToM in several cortical areas : bilateral cingulate gyrus ( BA 31 ) , right middle frontal gyrus ( BA 8 , 9 and 10 ) left middle frontal gyrus ( BA 6 ) , temporal lobe ( fusiform gyrus , BA 20 ) , bilateral parietal lobe ( right BA 3 and right and left BA 7 ) and bilateral occipital lobe ( BA 19 ) .
There were also correlations between increased cerebral glucose metabolism and impaired ToM in the left superior temporal gyrus ( BA 22 and BA 20 ) left inferior frontal gyrus ( BA 13 and 47 ) and right inferior frontal gyrus ( BA 47 ) .
Furthermore , in this series of patients , we were able to confirm our previous finding of metabolic modifications following stimulation , with hypometabolism in the bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus ( right and left BA 24 ) and left superior frontal gyrus ( BA 8 and 9 ) , and hypermetabolism in the bilateral cerebellum and right inferior parietal lobule ( BA 40 ) [ 13 ] .
As far as behavioural data are concerned , our present result seems to confirm that STN DBS affects the ability to select mental state terms to describe the feelings conveyed by photographs of eyes and , by so doing , impairs the ability to infer the mental states of others .
This is in line with previous studies that have reported reduced recognition of emotional expressions from faces following STN DBS [ 4 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] .
Our present metabolic results indicate that ToM is subtended by a broadly distributed network .
Previous animal , neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies investigating the neural substrates that mediate ToM responses [ 47 ] have consistently suggested that complex cognitive functions , such as ToM , probably involve activity in multiple brain regions rather than being restricted to a single “ critical ” one .
Brothers [ 48 ] hypothesised that the primate social brain is made up of three core regions : the orbitofrontal cortex , superior temporal sulcus and amygdala .
In Carrington and Bailey 's review of fMRI studies exploring the neural bases of ToM [ 16 ] , the authors found that the medial prefrontal cortex , orbitofrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus emerged as “ core ” regions activated by ToM tasks , whereas the amygdala appeared to be less consistently activated ; the temporoparietal junction and anterior and paracingulate cortices also appear to be “ core ” ToM regions .
Interestingly , Carrington and Bailey [ 16 ] calculated the percentage of studies in which modulation of specific brain areas was observed during ToM tasks .
Medial prefrontal cortex activity ( BA 8 , 9 and 10 ) was reported in 88 % of studies , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity ( BA 45 , 46 and 47 ) in 35 % , precuneus activity ( BA 7 ) in 28 % , superior temporal gyrus activity ( BA 22 ) in 45 % , and prefrontal cortex activity ( BA 13 and 47 ) in 35 % .
A number of previous neuroimaging studies have explored the neural bases of ToM using the same Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test that we used in the present study [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] .
Using fMRI in normal adults , Baron - Cohen and colleagues ( 1999 ) reported activity in left frontal regions , including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( BA 44 , 45 , 46 and 47 ) , medial frontal cortex ( BA 8 , 9 and 10 ) , and supplementary motor area .
Activity was also reported in bilateral temporoparietal regions , the insula , and left amydgalar and hippocampal regions .
Hirao and colleagues ( 2008 ) investigated the relationship between ToM impairment in schizophrenic patients and structural brain abnormalities using voxel - based morphometry .
Poor performances were recorded on the Eyes test , in line with the literature [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , [ 53 ] , [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] , [ 56 ] .
This ToM deficit was associated with grey matter reduction in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in the patient group , suggesting that impairment of this structure is a key pathology accounting for the difficulties faced by schizophrenic patients in inferring the mental states of others .
In addition , and consistent with the evidence from other neuroimaging studies as well as our own , acquired Eyes test deficits have been reported following damage to the frontal cortex in patients with frontal lobe epilepsy [ 57 ] or the frontal variant of frontotemporal dementia [ 58 ] , [ 59 ] , [ 60 ] .
Amygdala damage has also been associated with impaired ToM , as measured by the Eyes test [ 61 ] .
When we compared the present results with those of our previous investigations of cognitive - metabolic correlations between recognition of facial expressions and 18 FDG - PET in STN DBS PD patients , we found that we had highlighted a more broadly distributed brain network this time .
We believe that there are several reasons why such large brain regions were identified in the present study .
At the behavioural level , ToM encompasses several elementary processes .
The same is true at the cerebral level , insofar as ToM relies on several different brain structures .
Although each elementary structure is specific to a given process , the involvement of all these structures together would appear to be specific to ToM .
As indicated earlier , this is consistent with Brothers ' theory that social cognition is subtended by a network of interconnected regions , as well as with a recent review of fMRI studies exploring the neural bases of ToM [ 16 ] .
In order to avoid specific biases , the two participant groups were statistically comparable for age and education level .
Similarly , in order to rule out an overall visuospatial information processing deficit that has already been described in PD [ 62 ] , the Benton Facial Recognition Test [ 37 ] was administered to all participants in addition to the control task included in the Eyes test ( i.e. the gender attribution task ) .
As the Eyes test involves lexical access , verbal abilities were also evaluated : syntactic comprehension was assessed with the Token Test and semantic access from words with the PPTT .
All the participants performed within the normal range ( Table 2 ) .
A general cognitive deficit resulting from brain damage [ 63 ] between the pre- and postoperative situations can be excluded , given the absence of any significant difference in performances on the general neuropsychological tests .
In addition , the absence of any significant correlation between variations in ToM performances and variations in executive scores indicates that possible impairment of the patients ' executive functioning cannot explain the modifications in ToM performances in the postoperative condition .
Similarly , the absence of any significant correlation between variations in ToM performances and mood score variations ( MADRS and STAI ) suggests that neither depression nor anxiety can account for the modifications in ToM performances in the postoperative condition .
Finally , the absence of any significant correlation between variations in ToM performances and LED suggests that these two parameters are completely independent .
Taken together , these data lead us to conclude that STN DBS itself may contribute to the ToM impairment observed in the postoperative condition .
There were several limitations to the present study that need to be acknowledged and addressed .
First , the task we administered , the Eyes test , has been poorly described in terms of the cognitive processes it involves in addition to ToM [ 34 ] .
Accordingly , even though we took care to assess verbal abilities and the PD patients performed within the normal range both before and after surgery ( Table 2 ) , failure on this task may have stemmed not only from a deficit in the decoding of the mental state but also from a deficit in access to explicit lexical knowledge of mental state descriptors .
Moreover , there is an overlap between the cerebral network that subtends verbal and nonverbal tasks involving ToM [ 16 ] and the one that subtends tasks requiring the manipulation of social concepts [ 64 ] .
As a consequence , it is possible that the cerebral network identified in the present study was partly subtended by social lexicon processes rather than by ToM per se .
Second , as our design did not feature a crossover scheme [ 65 ] including a postoperative condition with the stimulator turned off , we cannot assign the changes we observed ( either at the neural or the behavioral level ) to stimulation per se .
For example , Pourfar and colleagues [ 66 ] have recently suggested ( with N = 6 PD patients ) that the microlesion effect of the surgery may be sufficient to trigger changes in brain activity when the stimulator is turned off , as long as 20 months after surgery .
In the present study , a similar microlesion effect may have been behind the metabolic and behavioral changes we observed in the patients .
Nevertheless , the results obtained by Pourfar and colleagues [ 66 ] could also reflect a longlasting effect of the stimulation rather than any microlesion effect .
Current observations suggest that a one - hour interval ( which is the interval that Pourfar and colleagues [ 66 ] chose between the time when they turned off the stimulator and the time when they conducted the scan ) is not long enough to dispel the effects of chronic stimulation on motor symptoms .
This hypothesis was corroborated by a study conducted by our team , where we investigated the recognition of facial emotions by comparing the results of “ off - stim ” versus “ on - stim ” assessments ( with a one - hour interval ) in PD patients ( N = 15 ) [ 46 ] .
We failed to find any difference between the two conditions : in the postoperative condition , the patterns of performances on the recognition of facial expressions were identical both before and after the stimulator had been turned off .
The longlasting effect of the stimulation also seems to be supported by recent neurophysiological evidence [ 67 ] .
Here , the authors recorded local field potentials ( LFPs ) from the STN ( with N = 16 PD patients ) and showed that longer periods of DBS reduced beta power for longer , suggesting that there may be long - lasting functional changes to networks in the STN in PD after chronic DBS .
Finally , it should be noted that Table 3 lists several clusters with exactly the same voxel count ( e.g. 5877 ) .
SPM yields significant results with different cluster sizes .
Some are fairly voluminous , such as the 5877 cluster .
This cluster features multiple anatomical regions , including the right parietal lobe , postcentral gyrus ( BA 3 ) , right parietal lobe , precuneus ( BA 7 ) , right and left posterior cingulate gyrus ( BA 31 ) , and left frontal lobe and left middle frontal gyrus ( BA6 ) .
This explains why different anatomical locations belonging to the same cluster have the same voxel count .
The ToM impairments observed in the present study may therefore have been the result of a dysfunction induced either by STN microlesions or by STN stimulation per se within the broadly distributed neuronal network that subtends ToM abilities , although it remains to be said whether the STN itself actually belongs to this network .
In addition , the mechanisms by which STN stimulation interferes with the functioning of the brain areas that mediate ToM have yet to be determined .
Given the small size of the STN , the stimulating current flow may not be restricted to the targeted sensorimotor STN compartment , but may also affect other STN compartments , in particular the limbic one , as well as the closely connected limbic territory of the basal ganglia and afferent or efferent connections to subcortical and cortical limbic regions , in line with the findings of several neuroimaging studies [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 68 ] .
Another possible explanation , which in no way precludes the previous ones , is that the functional partitioning of the STN is not absolute , with probable interactions between its subterritories [ 5 ] , [ 69 ] .
As some authors have suggested , the STN may act as an integrator , combining the motor , cognitive and emotional components of behaviour .
This may explain why stimulation of this core structure has effects not only on motor functions but also on limbic and / or associative ones [ 5 ] .
Our study is , to our knowledge , the first to suggest that STN stimulation affects ToM abilities and to correlate this impairment with cerebral metabolic changes .
It provides a preliminary account of the modulation induced by stimulation of a broadly distributed neuronal network of cerebral areas mediating ToM , although the exact nature of the STN 's role within this network remains to be elucidated .
These results confirm the role played by the STN in the human limbic system and suggest that this basal ganglia structure makes a key contribution to social cognition .

The Minnesota Republican congresswoman who claimed that President Barack Obama nationalized “ 51 percent ” of the economy has concocted a yet stranger fiction .
She believes former President Bill Clinton is trying to “ take me out . ”
“ Because I ’m using a statement like ‘ gangster , ’ I ’m responsible for creating the climate of hate that could lead to another Timothy McVeigh and another Oklahoma City bombing , ” Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) remarked at a recent fundraiser , referencing an earlier comment she made in which she called the Obama Administration a “ gangster government . ”

She continued : “ I ’m in my second term as a Congresswoman and the former president of the United States decides I ’m important enough to take me out ! ”
Bachmann was speaking in a broader context of Democratic efforts to reclaim her congressional seat .
She asserted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi committed nearly $ 10 million to defeat her in her first race .
The Minnesota congresswoman also referred to the League of Conservation voters as “ radical extremists . ”
“ It was just announced this week that the League of Conservation voters — the kind of radical extremists on the enviro side have made me their number one target to get rid of this year . ”
“ They ’re all in to make sure I go down , ” she added , to applause .

Writing about Bachmann ’s remarks in a Minnesota paper , one writer wryly asserted that Bachmann had a “ very unusual form of persecution complex : she imagines the entire Democratic party as an L.A. - style street gang that has her in their cross-hairs . ”
Let the examination begin .
Senators pledged to scrutinize Solicitor General Elena Kagan in the weeks ahead after President Obama on Monday nominated her to the Supreme Court , choosing a candidate with no judicial experience but a reputation as a consensus - builder to succeed retiring Justice John Paul Stevens .
Calling Kagan a " trailblazing leader , " the president praised her as a " superb " solicitor general and a " beloved " former dean of Harvard Law School .
He acknowledged her background in academia but said her experience and passion for the law are not confined to campus .
" Elena is widely regarded as one of the nation 's foremost legal minds , " Obama said , calling for the Senate to act in a swift and bipartisan fashion .
The selection of Kagan reflects the president 's desire to nominate someone who has already been vetted and confirmed by the current Senate .
Kagan earned modest Republican support when she was confirmed by a vote of 61 - 31 last year for solicitor general .
Kagan , calling it a " special honor " to be nominated to fill Stevens ' seat , said Monday that she looked forward to working with the Senate in the weeks ahead .
She described her term as solicitor general as " the most thrilling and the most humbling task a lawyer can perform . "
She is known as sharp and politically savvy .
At 50 years old , Kagan would be the youngest justice on the high court , giving her an opportunity to extend Obama 's legacy beyond his administration .
Though her nomination signals that Obama is looking to avoid a protracted fight with the Senate over her confirmation , some groups and lawmakers have raised concerns about Kagan 's history .
One trouble spot will likely be her lack of a paper trail -- Kagan has never judged a case in her life .
This could shorten the amount of time the Senate Judiciary Committee takes to review her record in advance , but lead to heavy questioning at the hearing .
" Given that Ms. Kagan does not have a judicial record , it will be especially important for senators to inquire as to her views on the Constitution and the role of the court , " Sen .
John Thune , R - S.D. , said in a written statement .
Still , some lawmakers since last year have called for Obama to choose a nominee from outside the appeals court system , and her background could give her valuable outsider status .
She received widespread praise from Senate Democrats on Monday , and Majority Leader Harry Reid called her a " worthy nominee . "
The last high court nominee with this profile was David Souter , who had a strong history in New Hampshire state law but no record to speak of on federal law .
The last two without any judicial experience were William H. Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell Jr. , both of whom joined the court in 1972 .
The focus of much early criticism will be Kagan 's attempt at Harvard to keep military recruiters off campus because of objections over the Pentagon 's " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy barring gays from serving openly in the military .
Kagan signed a friend - of - the - court brief to the Supreme Court arguing against a Clinton - era law mandating that college campuses that accept federal funding also allow military recruiters .
The Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Kagan 's position and in favor of the law .
Despite her lack of a judicial record , Kagan has an impressive resume .
She clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall , worked for President Clinton and earned a stellar reputation as a student , teacher and manager of the elite academic world .
Her standing has risen in Obama 's eyes as his government 's lawyer before the high court over the last year .
She was the first female dean of Harvard Law School and first woman to serve as the top Supreme Court lawyer for any administration .
The three finalists she beat out for the nomination are all federal appeals court judges ; all nine of the current justices served on the federal bench before being elevated .
Kagan 's fate will be up to a Senate dominated by Democrats , who with 59 votes have more than enough to confirm her , even though they are one shy of being able to halt a Republican stalling effort .
For the second straight summer , the nation can expected an intense Supreme Court confirmation debate ; but barring a surprise , Kagan is likely to emerge as a justice .
Republicans have shown no signs in advance that they would try to prevent a vote on Kagan , but they are certain to grill her in confirmation hearings over her experience , her thin record of legal writings and her objections to the military 's policy about gays .
When she was confirmed as solicitor general in 2009 , only seven Republicans backed her .
Democrats went 15 years without a Supreme Court appointment until Obama chose federal appellate judge Sonia Sotomayor last year to succeed Souter .
Just 16 months in office , Obama has a second opportunity with Kagan , under different circumstances .
Obama 's decision last year centered much on the compelling narrative of Sotomayor , the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice , who grew up in a housing project and overcame hardship .
Kagan , who is unmarried , was born in New York City .
She holds a bachelor 's degree from Princeton , a master 's degree from Oxford and a law degree from Harvard .
She and Obama both taught at the University of Chicago Law School in the early 1990s .
In her current job , Kagan represents the U.S. government and defends acts of Congress before the Supreme Court and decides when to appeal lower court rulings .
Kagan would be the fourth woman to serve on the Supreme Court , following current Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sotomayor and retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor .
If Kagan is confirmed , it will be the first time there are three women on the court .
She also would be the third Jewish justice , along with six Catholics .
With Stevens ' retirement , the court for the first time will have no Protestants , the most prevalent denomination in the United States .

Un groupe militant pour la santé des travailleurs indiens accuse le premier ministre Jean Charest d'avoir une attitude qui frise le racisme en continuant de défendre les exportations québécoises d'amiante en Inde .
Un groupe militant pour la santé des travailleurs indiens dénonce la position du gouvernement québécois , qui continue de défendre les exportations de l'amiante en Inde malgré les risques cancérigènes de ce minerai .
Dans une lettre virulente envoyée cette semaine , Mohit Gupta , coordonnateur de Occupational & Environmental Health Network of India ( OEHNI ) , soutient que le premier ministre Charest considère les travailleurs indiens comme des citoyens de seconde classe .
Il accuse le premier ministre québécois de démontrer une « profonde apathie , qui frise le racisme , envers les travailleurs et les communautés de l'Inde » .
Vous semblez avoir vendu votre esprit , votre coeur et votre âme à l'industrie de l'amiante .
Nous ne comprenons pas pourquoi vous appliquez deux poids , deux mesures .
Mohit Gupta , coordonnateur de l'OEHNI
L'OEHNI n'a visiblement pas apprécié une lettre envoyée en mars par le bureau de Jean Charest , dans laquelle était réitérée la position québécoise selon laquelle il est possible d'utiliser l'amiante de façon sécuritaire .
Dans cette lettre , le gouvernement québécois reconnaît que l'amiante chrysotile peut avoir des effets négatifs sur la santé si les normes scientifiques établies ne sont pas respectées .
Selon M. Gupta , le premier ministre Charest s'appuie à tort sur une résolution de l'Organisation internationale du travail ( OIT ) lorsqu'il affirme que l'amiante peut être utilisée de manière sécuritaire .
« Nous sommes choqués de voir que vous nous envoyez promener de la sorte avec cette excuse fallacieuse » , écrit-il , rappelant que l'Organisation mondiale de la santé ( OMS ) et l'OIT se sont toutes deux prononcées en faveur de l'élimination de ce minerai .
La lettre de l'OEHNI demeurera sans réponse , a averti mercredi Hugo D'Amours , l'attaché de presse de M. Charest .
« Notre lettre était très correcte , on a échangé , sur un ton cordial , nos points de vue étayés , a - t - il dit .
Ce n'est pas vrai qu'on va rentrer dans un débat avec des gens qui nous insultent . »
En janvier dernier , M. Gupta figurait parmi les signataires d'une première lettre qui réclamait à M. Charest la fin des exportations d'amiante en Inde où , indiquaient - ils , le minerai est manipulé par des travailleurs extrêmement pauvres dans des conditions dangereuses .
La FTQ plaide pour l'amiante
Michel Arsenault , président de la FTQ , a plaidé en faveur de l'exportation de l'amiante dans les pays en développement .
« Nous , on est pour l'utilisation sécuritaire du chrysotile .
L'amiante , c'est un animal dangereux , mais c'est un animal qu'on a dompté au Québec . [...]
Ce que je sais des producteurs d'amiante au Québec , ils prennent soin de vérifier où leur amiante va et qu'elle [ sic ] soit utilisée correctement . »
Roger Valois , vice - président de la CSN , a de son côté déploré que personne n'explique aux gens des pays en développement comment manipuler l'amiante .
L'amiante , tueuse en série
Année après année , les maladies reliées à l'amiante constituent la principale cause de décès des travailleurs québécois .
Les nouveaux chiffres de la CSST indiquent qu'en 2009 , au Québec , sur 123 décès dus à des maladies professionnelles , 102 étaient étaient attribuables à l'amiante .
Il s'agissait essentiellement de mineurs et de travailleurs de la construction ayant oeuvré à une époque où l'amiante était considérée sans risques .
Un dossier qui colle à la peau de Jean Charest
En février dernier , des groupes de travailleurs indiens ont interpellé Jean Charest sur les dangers du chrysotile à deux reprises lors de sa mission économique en Inde .
Des dirigeants de la Trade Union Centre of India , puis de la Building and Wood Workers International , des centrales syndicales représentant plus de 2 millions de travailleurs , ont réclamé qu'il en fasse cesser les exportations .
Un des dirigeants a estimé que près de 25 % des travailleurs indiens exposés à la poussière d'amiante , qui sert dans le secteur de la construction et entre dans la fabrication de pièces de voitures , développaient des maladies pulmonaires , comme l'amiantose ou le mésothéliome .
Les défenseurs des travailleurs faisaient également valoir que 94 % des emplois en Inde sont de petits boulots , où il est difficile de faire respecter des normes de sécurité .
Alors qu'il participait à un sommet sur le développement durable , à Delhi , M. Charest avait refusé d'élaborer sur la possibilité d'une contradiction entre ses positions environnementales et le fait qu'il refuse d'agir dans le dossier des exportations d'amiante chrysotile .
Il s'était limité à dire que le gouvernement de l'Inde était responsable de l'utilisation du produit sur son territoire .
En janvier , une centaine de scientifiques de 28 pays ont pressé le premier ministre de reconnaître les risques liés à l'utilisation de l'amiante chrysotile et de cesser son exportation .
Quelques semaines plus tard , une dizaine de scientifiques canadiens l'ont accusé de travestir la vérité lorqu'il soutenait que l'OMS jugeait que le chrysotile pouvait être utilisé de façon sécuritaire .
L'American Journal of Industrial Medecine a par ailleurs publié une enquête démontrant que l'amiante qu'exporte le Québec a des conséquences dévastatrices sur la santé des travailleurs mexicains .
En février , le Parti québécois et Québec solidaire ont tenté en vain d'inciter le gouvernement à débattre des risques liés aux exportations québécoises d'amiante dans les pays en développement .
Over the past few months , Arianna Huffington has initiated a grass roots campaign called " Move your money " whose purpose is to forcefully shift an allocation of the deposit base from the TBTFs which have captured the government via the Wall Street - D.C. lobby complex .
While we hope this campaign succeeds , we are somewhat skeptical that it will achieve its goal .
First , the logistics of transferring one 's account are non-trivial and can be daunting to most people .
Second , the overarching problem lies not so much with the banks themselves , as with the one supreme enabler of not just artificial " profitability engineering " but of the broad range of market interventions , which will ultimately result in the collapse of America .
Just today we demonstrated that the US monthly budget deficit hit an all time record , which , paradoxically , and completely counter - intuitively was accompanied by a record drop in the interest rate paid on public marketable debt .
This is an artificial and perverted relationship which will soon breaks , and when it does the suffering will truly begin .
Yet therein lies the rub : as the Administration , with the full complicity of the Treasury , borrows deeper into the red and consigns America 's future to a 3rd world fate , can now only be stopped by precipitating a full systematic reset of a Treasury - Fed duopoly set on testing whether or not America can default .
Unfortunately , the guinea pigs in this experiment are some 300+ million Americans .
We suggest a simpler solution to facilitate this the much needed reset : increase your tax withholding exemptions ( a far simpler process to moving one 's deposit account ) , thereby forcing the treasury to tip its hand on just how much debt it will need , as it pretends to have some semblance of authority over an out of control budgetary situation .
This is a perfectly legal practice : here is the IRS itself providing a useful primer on how taxpayers can bump up their withholding exemptions all the way up to 10 , in this way forcing the Treasury to delay receipt of tax funds via paycheck withholdings well into the post April 15th future .
We are confident that the capital reallocation that the banks will experience as a result of " Move your money " , coupled with the need to run a much more balanced budget ( which we now realize is impossible , and the only alternative is eventual sovereign default or complete dollar devaluation ) once tax withholdings dwindle , will finally force this administration and the banking cartel to listen to the silent majority of 95 % +
Americans which are not on the list of burgeoning millionaires , and who could n't care less if the market shot up 100 % today on some algo gone wild , yet which is somehow supposed to indicate that the economy is getting better .
Just look at today 's record budget deficit number to make your own determination just how much " better " the economy is getting .
South Park made jokes about the Prophet Muhammad .
An Islamic group , Revolution Muslim , retorted with thinly veiled threats , and the show was censored .
Fans were outraged — and they seem to have fought back by mocking the group 's website .
Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are forbidden in some interpretations of Islam .
Extreme adherents of the faith have a long history of threatening violence when they feel their faith is being mocked .
So when South Park skirted the rule by showing him in a bear costume , and dressed as Santa Claus , a Brooklyn - based Islamic group were enraged .
Revolution Muslim said that the show had " outright insulted " Muhammad , and posted addresses for South Park and Comedy Central alongside a picture of the Dutch film director Theo Van Gogh lying dead , stabbed and shot .
Van Gogh was murdered for making a documentary film about the abuse of women in some Islamic countries .
" We have to warn Matt and Trey , " said the post , written by a member named Abu Talhah Al - Amrikee , of the show 's creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker , " that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show .
This is not a threat , but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them . "
Comedy Central censored the next episode — blocking out any non-depictions of Muhammad , bleeping any mentions and even , paradoxically , censoring a speech about free speech and censorship .
Jon Stewart was not happy .
UPDATED : Now Younus Abdullah Mohammed , of Revolution Muslim , has confirmed to us that hackers briefly redirected the group 's website to revolutionislam.com , a site that hosts the image above — a cartoon depiction of the Prophet , originally published by Danish newspaper Jyllands - Posten in 2005 .
" But it was pointless , " said Mohammed of the brief prank .
" Our website is down with the amount of traffic now anyway .
If these hackers want to show their support for the filth and trash that is America then that is fine by us .
We already know the outcome as Muslims . "
That outcome ?
" Islam will take over the world . "
Mohammed also directed us to a longer version of the post about South Park on their blog , and added that he felt the press coverage of the scandal was unfair .
" It was typical of the mainstream media .
It was senseless , " he said , " they never cover any of the other crimes against Islam we write about . "
Most Americans , he said , are " dumbed down , stupid and pathetic .
They 're worried more about missing their favourite TV show than they are about the world . "
He stands by his group 's prediction of violence against the South Park creators .
" It 's very justifiable to act violently against Western aggression , " said Mohammed , who added that his group did not " condone or condemn " terrorist acts against Americans .
" We did not start the war on September the 11th 2001 .
You started the war . "
Mohammed implied that he has previously had some contact with the FBI regarding a trip to an Islamic country , but he would not give specific details of the incident .
" It is American oppression , " he said .
But , he added , we probably would n't understand such issues as we are " Darwinist faggots who are as despicable as the rest , walking around eating your Triscuits . "
( Why Triscuits ?
We investigate here . )
: Wright 's Writing Corner : Putting
In the Stuff People Skip .
Today , I am going to tackle another of Elmore Leonard ’s Ten Rules For Writing :
10 .
Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip .
A rule that came to mind in 1983 .
Think of what you skip reading a novel : thick paragraphs of prose you can see have too many words in them .
What the writer is doing , he ’s writing , perpetrating hooptedoodle , perhaps taking another shot at the weather , or has gone into the character ’s head , and the reader either knows what the guy ’s thinking or does n’t care .
I ’ll bet you do n’t skip dialogue .
Before I continue , I want to emphasize that I am not criticizing Mr. Leonard ’s writing style .
He does what he does very well .
I am just touching on why not all of us may want to write like him .
What is the number one thing that people skip ?
( Come on , admit it , you probably skip stuff , too… unless the “ you ” in question happens to be my husband , who probably never skips anything . )
The answer , of course , is description .
Some modern authors respond to this by leaving it out .
They have almost no description .
I read one recently , it practically seemed indecent , as if the story was not wearing enough garments .
These stories read like a screenplays .
Only most of us do not read screenplays .
We watch movies full of rich backgrounds and imagery .
Sure the descriptionless books read quickly , but , to me anyway , they fell empty , like cotton candy — easy to eat , but gone in a moment leaving either nothing or a stomach ache .
This is not so bad if they have something else to offer , a hairraising plot , edge of your seat action , and — and this is the important thing — if they take place in a familiar landscape , such as modern day America , where the reader has no trouble filling in what is being left out .
But this minimum description method breaks down if the story either takes place in an exotic location ( real or imaginary ) or requires a delicately painted mood .
Most of my favorite books are loaded with description , even top - heavy with it .
Description that fills in the details of what is around you and helps anchor you to the story and surroundings .
Detail that makes the book much more like a steak dinner with potatoes , corn smothered in butter and garlic , and a crisp salad .
Books like that stick with you .
Years later , I still remember then and reread them .
Do I read these descriptions , savoring every word ?
Well , often no .
Even I do not .
But I SKIM them .
Skimming is different from skipping .
When you skip , you miss it all .
When you skim , you get some of it , a taste .
The mood and gist of it settles into your thinking , helps color the experience .
When you skim , the fact that the description is there matters … it improves the story .
Let me tell you a story that explains why I feel description is important .
As most of you know , John and I are roleplayers .
If you do not know what that means , picture your favorite book , imagine that there was someone who could portray the characters as if they were real people , so that you could talk to them and interact with them .
That is what it is like .
John , when he is moderating ( running the game , being the storyteller ) often pauses to describe things — sometimes at length .
Often , these periods of description come at the beginning , before we get to engage in the action .
Often , very often , they are boring .
I remember one time that a friend and I were groaning out loud , begging him to please move past the description to the part where we got to talk and act .
But , do you know what ?
I still remember that description .
It made a big difference to the game , to the way the scenes felt , to my memory of the occasion .
In retrospect , I really appreciated the description , even though at the time , I did not want to do the work of having to listen to it and picture it .
Books are like this , too .
Good description enhances the experience , even if it is hard .
Which brings us to a question :
Are descriptions harder to read than quick dialogue ?
Yes .
Is hard bad ?
No .
It is harder .
Some readers are too lazy , but it is not bad .
In fact , good readers occasionally enjoy the books that make them work a little harder more .
But it is not bad .
Often it is good .
Believe it or not , some people actually like descriptions .
Real people .
Not just statistics out there some where in a national poll .
I even know a few myself .
Now , that being said , are there things we can do to both have description and make it easier for the reader ?
Sure …polish our description to make it easier to read , for one thing .
Also , keeping one ’s paragraphs shorter can help … I mean here both that short bits of description can be added sometimes instead of long ones , but also that long descriptions can be broken up more , to make it easier for the eye to follow .
( You can probably tell by looking at this that I like the short paragraph thing .
Only use that if it works for you . ;-)
So , yes , description may be harder to read , it may slow us down , the reader may skim it , or even skip it .
But that does not mean that the writer should leave it out !
And , by the way , Mr. Leonard , I do not necessarily know what the character is thinking and , I do care !
Americans have a more positive response to the word “ progressive ” than they do “ capitalism , ” according to a new Pew research poll .
The poll , conducted Apr. 21 - 26 attempted to gauge Americans ’ honest responses to various concepts .
Strikingly — perhaps due to the recent financial crisis , repeated bank bailouts and ire at Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs — more Americans have positive views of liberals than they do of capitalists .

“ There is a substantial partisan divide in views of the word ‘ progressive , ' ” Pew researchers note .
“ However , majorities of Democrats ( 81 % ) , independents ( 64 % ) and Republicans ( 56 % ) have a positive reaction to ‘ progressive . ' ”
“ Family values ” scored highest in the poll with 89 percent support , followed by “ civil rights , ” with 87 percent .
“ State ’s rights ” also received more positive responses than “ progressive . ”
The poll ’s findings were first highlighted by Think Progress .
Capitalism scored highest among white college graduates with family incomes above $ 75,000 .
Socialism did best among those between the ages of 18 - 29 who approve of President Barack Obama and have incomes below $ 30,000 .
“ More than twice as many blacks as whites react positively to Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ socialismÃ¢â‚ ¬Â ( 53 % vs. 24 % ) , ” Pew ’s pollsters note .
“ Yet there are no racial differences in views of Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ capitalismÃ¢â‚ ¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 50 % of African Americans and 53 % of whites have a positive reaction .
“ Those with a high school education or less are evenly divided over Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ capitalismÃ¢â‚ ¬Â ( 44 % positive vs. 42 % negative ) , ” they continue .
“ Among those with some college experience , 49 % react positively to Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ capitalismÃ¢â‚ ¬Â as do 68 % of college graduates .
Those with a high school education or less are more likely to express a positive view of Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ socialismÃ¢â ‚
¬
Â than do those with more education .

“ People with family incomes of $ 75,000 or more are the only income group in which a clear majority ( 66 % ) reacts positively to the word ‘ capitalism , ' ” Pew adds .
“ Views of ‘ socialism ’ also are much more negative among those in this income category ( 71 % negative ) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and those with incomes of $ 30,000 to $ 75,000 ( 64 % negative )
Ã¢â‚¬â€œ than those with incomes of less than $ 30,000 ( 46 % negative ) . ”
What is The Fundamental Value of Housing ?
The spectre of housing bubbles is starting to raise its head again , along with discussions about what the central banks , regulators and / or governments should do about it .
House prices have been going through the roof in China , there is talk about a bubble in Australia and yet over there prices keep rising , Canadian house - prices are looking “ toppy ” and in Riyadh they are insane .
It ’s not as if there are no tools for combating a bubble .
Many countries that did not have the option of controlling the money supply via the blunt instrument of interest rates ( typically because their currency is tied to the US dollar ) , have used those tools successfully for decades .
A good example is Hong Kong which controls both the supply of land , the maximum LTV that mortgages can we written at , and also the amount of exposure that the banking system can have to residential real - estate .
America ( and other countries ) that suffered from exploding house - price bubbles , had no excuse , the tools were there , just they chose not to use them .
The reason was mainly because there was no agreement on what is the correct or fundamental value of a house ; even though some people were warning about potential problems with housing in USA and also in UK in 2003 , there was no consensus .
Alan Greenspan spoke of a “ bit of froth ” in 2005 , but he had no courage in his convictions , and even as late as early 2008 , just before the slump really started in UK , Gordon Brown was saying that housing in UK was “ affordable ” , and so there was no risk of catching the American disease .
Even now , after a cataclysmic wake - up call , there is no consensus about what is the “ right ” price for housing .
What is the right price ?
At it ’s simplest level ( it gets more complicated ) , the “ right ” price for housing is that which allows the population to spend a fixed proportion of their income on “ shelter ” , that proportion is broadly well - known , it works out somewhere between 20 % and 30 % ( and I ’m not going to argue - the - toss about exactly where it is , although there is a broad consensus in that the calculation of the weighting of “ shelter ” in the CPI analysis provides good base - line ) .
So in a stable population , the expenditure by people per house should be a function of the aggregate income , whether that ’s disposable or not is debatable , or for example nominal GDP .
Personally I like nominal GDP because it is ( a ) checked three ways when it is measured ( b ) you require no further soul - searching about what element of “ income ” to consider .
Thus the “ right ” price “ ought ” to be a function of the “ expenditure ” divided by the number of houses .
And historically , wherever I ’ve looked , it is , plot nominal GDP per house in USA against house prices ( annually ) , going back 100 years , and you get a 95 % R - Squared ( that means that 95 % of changes in house prices in USA since 1910 can be explained simply by changes in nominal GDP per house ) .
Put in disposable income per house and you get a pretty similar result ( although not quite as good which is one reason I like nominal GDP ) .
A nice clean example of how that works is Hong Kong :
That ’s a rough and ready chart I put together a few months ago , the “ Equilibrium ( Other Than Market Value ) is nominal GDP divided by the number housing units and then multiplied by a constant to get it on the same scale .
http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article15108.html
So yes there was a bit of a bubble in 1997 / 8 and like all bubbles bursting there was an “ overshoot ” in 2003 , with the 70 % drop caused more by a decline in nominal GDP than by the bubble burst ; and now , yes it looks like a bit of a bubble .
And the government of Hong Kong , as we speak , is doing something about that ( pushing up the LTV and releasing more land for building ) .
Over there the situation is slightly complicated by the fact that a lot of the money going into housing is from China - proper , but that ’s another story .
Of course that is n’t the whole story , because the annual expenditure ( by owners ) on their house , only gets you to price if you apply a discount factor , i.e. you do an income capitalization valuation .
That sounds simple and rough and ready it is .
The “ price ” ought to be the “ income ” ( how much goes to the house ” divided by a yield which is the cost of money ( i.e. the relative cost of for example living in the house , as opposed to selling it , putting the money in the bank ( or buying a long - term bond ) , getting the interest and sleeping in your car ) .
You can make it a lot more complicated than that , to do a proper income capitalization valuation you need to project the future “ income ” ( ideally you travel into the future and do measurements – and if “ income per house ” is likely to go up in the future , then you need to account for that ) , plus you need to decide what discount factor to use .
There are plenty of choices ; you could use the mortgage rate , the base rate , the 10 - Year Treasury , the 30 - Year treasury .
Personally I have found that a function of the 30 - Year Treasury gets the best result , but there ’s not much in it and the algorithm is not linear ( it ’s an “ S - Curve ” ) , but that ’s “ technical ” .
Another complication is whether mortgages are fixed or adjustable , I suspect that the “ ” bounce ” in house prices in UK had a lot to do with the fact that mortgages are adjustable measured from the base rate , so dropping the base rate raised the “ fundamental ” , whereas in USA where a lot of mortgages are fixed rate , the lowering of the base rate did n’t help .
There are other issues , for example in Hong Kong and London , foreigners like to buy houses , but their income is not measured ( or captured ) in the city ; so that can push house prices higher than the “ fundamental ” which would apply if the foreigners did n’t have a nice little pied de terre on the Edgware Road .
Effectively what happens there is that the foreigners push up house prices ( nice if you own one ) , typically more than the extra revenue that they bring in , and effectively close out some of the supply ; so to account for that you need top work out how many foreigners own second - homes but declare their income elsewhere ( if at all ) .
Another thing is taxation , in USA it made a lot of sense to buy a bigger house than you needed and pay a bigger mortgage because a big part of the interest you paid was tax - deductable ( renters did n’t get that break ) , and also you did n’t pay capital gains tax ( in the days when was a capital gain ) .
That meant the “ cost ” of ownership was distorted , as was ( effectively ) the discount factor in the income capitalization valuation .
House - prices can also get distorted by rent - control , when a portion of the population are paying much too little for housing ( compared to what they “ should ” be paying if the market was not manipulated ) , the rest of the population ( typically new - arrivals ) , ends up paying more , and house prices ( or the residual ) get artificially inflated , that was the main reason for the Dubai house - price bubble .
Rental properties also distort the market in other ways , for example in many European countries it is impossible to get a tennant out , if the property was rented without furniture - so that type of property is held back from the market leaving only " furnished " property which gets a premium .
For that reason and others , rent to price comparisons can be meaningless .
Equally the rental market can under report the real economic dynamic , for example in USA leading up to the bubble , there were huge incentives put in place to penalise renters and reward ownership , intriguingly in that case the cost of shelter in the CPI calculation was benchmarked against the rental market , which resulted in a massive under - reporting of the inflationary effect of soaring house prices .
Another way that house - prices get out of synch with the “ fundamentals ” is by hoarding of potential building land ( which is what is happening in Riyadh ) , or by distortions in supply of building land which is what happened ( happens in UK ) .
The issue there is that incumbents know that if the supply of housing goes up in their little micro-economy , the price of their house will go down .
It a simple “ anti- trust ” play ( except it ’s legal – and they come up with all sorts of reasons why not to allow building next - door … often environmental , you can get those to run for years ) , and the point is that once 70 % or so of the voters own their own houses , the majority wants house prices to go on going up forever and forever .
Except in the long - run that ’s often unsustainable , because it increases the cost of doing business , and acts as a break on economic growth .
It also bleeds the country dry as people realise they can sell their incredibly expensive house in UK ( for what you get ) , and buy something three times nicer in Florida , Spain , France , Croatia , or Dubai , for half the price .
The decision that governments need to take in such situations , is whether they want to have a country full of very - very expensive houses , with the poor people living ten to a room ( and charging a fortune for their “ services ” ) , with all of the spare income and potential of the country drained away bit by bit , leaving a wonderfully rich gated community , and no poor people and no old people ( except rich ones ) , or not .
The Labour Government under the dream - team of Blair / Brown decided on the latter , even though they had promised to build affordable housing for the less wealthy ( which would have pushed prices down ) .
In the event many of the Members of Parliament elected to represent the best interest of the “ unwashed rabble ” , decided to represent the best interests of the incumbent house - owners , and many of them also made a fortune “ buying and selling in the marketplace ” , particularly Tony Blair .
With regard to the potential “ bubbles ” around the world , it ’s very hard to work out the fundamental without a lot more data than is made available , particularly if you are looking at individual cities .
USA is quite easy thanks mainly to Professor Shiller who lets you download his house price index for the past 100 years , plus getting 100 years of nominal GDP on USA is a synch , UK is OK although there were distortions due to the war and bursts of socialism .

The reason I claim to be an “ expert ” on Dubai is that I ’ve been collecting data and building models for nearly twenty years , and even then , it takes easily twenty man-days to get hold of the data and where there is n’t any , build proxies , to update a model .
Anywhere else and well , it ’s tough ; I ’ve been trying to get hold of decent historical statistics on Australia , I ’m coming to the conclusion they do n’t exist ; and although I ’m on record saying there is a bubble ( based on a back - of the envelope calculation ) , if you look at the nominal GDP growth you can go a long way to explaining the rise in prices ; there again , how sustainable is that ?
And China , well that ’s a mystery , although I suspect that a good part of the “ bubble ” there may be an adjustment to a market economy .
But the data exists , and if you have the data , the other analysis is not hard , even if you argue about the details of the data , even using rough numbers it ’s not hard to get within 10 % which is “ ” good enough for government work ” .
And there is no reason why you ca n’t do it on a city - by - city basis ( I ’ve got perfectly respectable models for Dubai that have pretty much worked for fifteen years plus or minus 10 % ) .
You would have thought that given the unpleasantness of the fall - out from the recent housing boom , for all the money they are throwing at the problem , the guardians of the taxpayers money , might consider spending say 1 % of what they spend on fire - fighting after the event , on prevention ?
But of course , incumbents all make money out of house price bubbles , and if they control the political process , well … who wants to know ?
But that ’s not the price , that ’s just what the population spends

What is the fundemental value of housing ?
Andrew - it is pleasing to see you mentioning the supply aspect of this important issue and would suggest you refer to the Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Surveys ( www.demographia.com ) for further guidance .
Theses annual surveys which cover the major urban markets of what is loosely termed the Anglo world , employ the Median Multiple ( Median house price divided by gross annual nedian household income ) .
On my website Performance Urban Planning ( www.PerformanceUrbanPlanning.org )
I provide a definition of an affordable housing market .
In short - housing should not exceed 3 times household income and new housing stock must be allowed to be supplied on the urban fringes at 2.5 times annual household income of specific urban markets .
It is particularly pleasing in how economists globally are increasingly recognising that the " supply issue " is the major one .
Bubbles can only occur if there is scarcity .
This did not happen in Atlanta , Dallas Fort Worth and Houston as 3 examples of in excessof 100 in North America .

Should Libertarians Oppose " Capitalism " ?
By Bryan Caplan
Yesterday my long - time friend Sheldon Richman spoke before the GMU Econ Society on “ Capitalism versus the Free Market . ”
( The video was streamed here , but it does n’t seem to be archived anywhere ; if you ’ve got a link , please let us know ) .
His main thesis : Libertarians should say that they favor the “ free market , ” not “ capitalism . ”
Why ?
Because for many people , “ capitalism ” simply refers to the status quo economic system outside of explicitly Marxist nations .
Sheldon elsewhere goes on to argue that libertarians should actually say that they oppose capitalism :
We are a group of libertarians who understand that historically the
word “ capitalism ” has meant , not the free market , but crony capitalism
— that is , collusion between business and State at the expense of
consumers / workers .
Thus we refuse to use the word “ capitalism ” to
describe what we favor : individual liberty in all respects and free ,
competitive markets .
We believe that what we have today IS capitalism
— and we oppose it .
I ’m not convinced .
If we were starting from scratch , I agree that it would be great to scrap both “ capitalism ” and “ socialism . ”
Etymologically , capitalism does sound like a system of rule by capitalists for capitalists – and socialism sounds like a system of rule by society for society .
Since neither etymological suggestion is true , I wish the terms had never been coined .
As Sheldon admits in his talk , however , changing words is like changing currencies .
If they ’re already widely accepted , you need a really good reason to abandon them .
Awkward etymology notwithstanding , I think the concepts of capitalism and socialism are good enough to keep using .
Sheldon ’s right that people often use capitalism and socialism as binary terms ; if you ’re not Cuba or North Korea , you ’re “ capitalist . ”
But this problem is easy to correct :
Just emphasize that there ’s a continuum from pure laissez - faire capitalism to totalitarian socialism , and that most nominally “ capitalist ” countries are a lot less capitalist than they pretend .
Once you make this conceptual point , the Fraser and Heritage indices of economic freedom are great ways to continue the conversation .
When you “ advocate capitalism , ” do n’t you risk alienating all of the people who hate the status quo but might come to love the free market ?
It ’s possible , but I doubt it .
Yes , opponents of the free market habitually associate it with “ pro-business ” economic policies .
But this is usually a deliberate rhetorical strategy on their part .
Almost all self - styled “ anti-capitalists ” hate free markets per se .
But it ’s easier to incite outrage against visible injustices than against the invisible hand , and they take the path of least resistance .
Do n’t believe me ?
Try going to an anti-globalization rally .
Tell people you ’re for free trade , but against government subsidies for exports .
Tell them you favor freedom to form unions – and the freedom to fire workers for joining unions .
See what happens .
I bet it wo n’t be pretty .
If Sheldon were merely saying that libertarians ’ noun of choice should be “ the free market , ” rather than “ capitalism , ” he ’d have a decent case .
But for libertarians to reject “ capitalism ” as an alternate noun is overly defensive – and to announce that we “ oppose capitalism ” is completely confusing .
The New South Wales Premier is urging people to be aware of the risks of meeting people online .
On Friday police found the body of 18 - year - old Nona Belomesoff in Sydney 's south west , two days after she went to meet a man she had befriended on Facebook .
The Premier Kristina Keneally , says it is a tragic reminder that people do not always represent themselves truthfully online .
" People may not be who they purport to be on social networking sites and that can be the case , " she said .
" It is a reminder to us all no matter what our age that we should be careful of the people that we meet online . "
Ms Belomesoff left her Cecils Hill home on Wednesday morning to meet two men she had befriended on Facebook .
Detective Russell
Oxford says the teenager believed she was going on a trip to work with an animal welfare organisation .
" She was obviously excited to perhaps start work in an area with animals , which she loved , " he said .
Detective Oxford says police have been shaken by the murder and that the scene was devastating .
" I 've been doing this for a long time and we all got very upset with what we found last night , " he said .
" We go out in the dark with torches and we find this young girl , 18 years old lying in a creek bed - it 's just terrible . "
On Friday night 20 - year - old Chris Dannevig was charged with her murder .
He has been refused bail and will appear at Campbelltown Local Court in the next week .
Police say they will allege that the second man Ms Belomesoff believed she was meeting did not exist .

Big News from the Nano - World of Graphene Means New Life for Moore ’s Law
April 2nd , 2010 by Tina Casey
Almost 50 years ago , Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore came up with a little idea called Moore ’s Law , which basically says that computer processors roughly double in efficiency every two years due to advances in technology along with affordability .
So how much smaller , faster and cheaper can computers go ?
Lots , if graphene , the nanomaterial of the new millennium , has anything to say about that .
[ social_buttons ]
Discovered just a few years ago , graphene is only the thickness of one atom but it scores on strength and it can function as a conductor .
One difficulty to overcome , though , is manipulating “ raw ” graphene on an atomic level to create a useful material .
With support from the National Science Foundation , researchers at the University of South Florida have accomplished a breakthrough of sorts by developing a way to form precise graphene “ nanowires ” that are just a few atoms across .
Graphene Nanowires and Sustainable Computers
The ability to construct nanoscale components for electronic devices can’t come a moment too soon .
The world is already awash in e-waste , and energy use by computers and data centers is surging .
That trend will continue as computers become integrated into more aspects of life in the developed world , and as more people in the developing world enter the consumer marketplace — unless electronic devices become significantly smaller , lighter and more energy efficient .
Graphene – What ’s the Catch ?
Yes , there is always a catch .
Although some researchers have developed methods for producing graphene in bulk , the material is difficult to manipulate with precision .
One possible solution has been devised at the University of Illinois at Chicago , where researchers have used nano - sized water droplets as chaperones to coax graphene into complex shapes .
At the University of South Florida , researchers were able to construct nanowires by bonding two half - sheets of graphene edge to edge .
Instead of forming a seamless whole , the two halves are separated by a defect that emerges in the atomic structure of the graphene sheet , forming a continuous line just a few atoms across .
The researchers were able to confirm that this line functions as a nanowire , with its own periodic atomic structure and metallic properties .
Do n’t Forget about Carbon Nanotubes
With all the excitement over graphene it ’s easy to forget that other new - millenium nanomaterial , carbon nanotubes .
Though the two materials handle quite differently , there are some parallels in the emerging developments .
Researchers are finding ways to produce carbon nanotubes of different types in bulk , which could significantly lower the cost of production , and at the University of San Diego researchers have found that defective carbon nanotubes can be more efficient at storing energy than their flawless counterparts .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
As CA readers , CRU , the Met Office and a couple of other UK institutions had more or less stonewalled David Holland ’s FOI requests .
One of Holland ’s particular interests is one that is perhaps a little appropriate / inappropriate for Easter Sunday – Caspar and the resurrected Jesus paper .
Holland had tried for some years to determine exactly how IPCC had determined that Wahl and Ammann 2004 2005 2006 2007 met IPCC deadlines .
In a letter to Keith Briffa of April 1 , 2008 ( circulated by Briffa to various IPCC cadres ) , Holland had asked :
6 . Why is their no mention of the fact that Mann et al. fails R2 verification in the important 15th century step ?
Who made the decision to reject comment 6-750 on the SOD by the reviewer for the Government of the United States of America who objected to the unpublished paper of Wahl and Ammann because as reviewed it did not include the table of verification data required for it be finally accepted for publication and which actually corroborated the criticism of McIntyre and McKitrick ?
To which Briffa had answered ( May 15 , 2008 ) :
6 . Your question conflates a number of complex issues and makes statements with which I do not necessarily concur .
However , in answer to the question of who made the decision to “ reject comment 6-750 on the SOD ” , this decision , as with all decisions related to specific reviewers ’ comments , was made by multiple Chapter 6 authors and sanctioned by all of them .
More on this later .
SOD Review Comment 6-750 had stated :
6-750 A 29:41 :42
The use of Wahl and Ammann ( accepted ) does not comply with WG1 ’s deadlines and all text based on this reference should be deleted .
WG1 ’s rules require that all references be “ published or in print ” by December 16 , 2005 .
Wahl and Ammann was “ provisionally accepted ” on that date , and not fully accepted until February 28 , 2006 , at which time no final preprint was available .
Substantial changes were made in the paper between December 16 , 2005 and February 28 , 2006 , including insertion of tables showing that the MBH98 reconstruction failed verification with r-squared statsistics , as had been reported by McIntyre and McKitrick in 2003 .
These tables were not available in the draft considered by WG1 when developing the second - order draft .
[ Govt. of United States of America ( Reviewer ’s comment ID # : 2023-415 ) ]
To which Briffa as IPCC Author had answered :
See response to comment 6-1158 .
SOD Comment 6-1158 had made a similar point to Comment 6-750 :
6-1158 B 29:41 29:41 Wahl and Ammann 2006 did not meet several publication deadlines .
Is it fair to use this study when other studies also not meeting publication deadlines were not used ?
It was not accepted by December 13 - 15 .
TSU did not have a preprint by late February .
The version available for review was not the same as the accepted verion – in particular , the version made available omitted critical information that MBH98 failed cross-validation r2 and CE statistics .
[ Stephen McIntyre ( Reviewer ’s comment ID # : 309-119 ) ]
To which Briffa as IPCC Author stated :
Rejected - the citation is allowed under current rules .
The Bergen Lead Authors ’ meeting in late June 2006 appears to have prompted a decision by WG1 to change their deadlines .
On July 3 , 2006 , the WG1 TSU sent an email to Lead Authors and Reviewers , notifying them that they could propose “ additional ” articles that met certain criteria as follows ( I received this email ) :
Dear Colleague , Following the Government and Expert review of the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report , the attached guidelines are being provided to clarify how recent scientific literature related to review comments may be included in the final draft .
Please feel free to distribute this information among your colleagues .
Thank you for your interest in the work of the IPCC .
Best regards ,
WG1 TSU
The guidelines stated as follows ;
Guidelines for inclusion of recent scientific literature in the Working Group I Fourth Assessment Report .
We are very grateful to the many reviewers of the second draft of the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report for suggestions received on issues of balance and citation of additional scientific literature .
To ensure clarity and transparency in determining how such material might be included in the final Working Group I report , the following guidelines will be used by Lead Authors in considering such suggestions .
In preparing the final draft of the IPCC Working Group I report , Lead Authors may include scientific papers published in 2006 where , in their judgment , doing so would advance the goal of achieving a balance of scientific views in addressing reviewer comments .
However , new issues beyond those covered in the second order draft will not be introduced at this stage in the preparation of the report .
Reviewers are invited to submit copies of additional papers that are either in - press or published in 2006 , along with the chapter and section number1 to which this material could pertain , via email to ipcc-wg1@al.noaa.gov , not later than July 24 , 2006 .
In the case of in - press papers a copy of the final acceptance letter from the journal is requested for our records .
All submissions must be received by the TSU not later than July 24 , 2006 and incomplete submissions can not be accepted .
1 see report outline at http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/doc/wg1_outline.pdf
I submitted two documents in response to this notice : the Wegman Report and the NAS Report .
My submission was acknowledged by the WG1 TSU .
Holland has been trying for a couple of years to verify Briffa ’s statement that Wahl and Ammann 2004 2005 2006 2007 had met these revised rules – had “ a copy of the final acceptance letter from the journal ” been obtained for WG1 TSU records , for example – particularly given the explicit statement by WG1 TSU that “ incomplete submissions can not be accepted ” .
On November 28 , almost immediately after Climategate , Holland re-visited this outstanding question .
He had noticed that a July 26 email from WG1 TSU to Coordinating Lead Authors and a July 28 email from Overpeck to Briffa ( both in 725 .
1154353922.txt ) referred to a spreadsheet containing a list of additional articles relevant to chapter 6 , submitted under the new rules .
Holland ’s new round of requests are online here .
Here is the salient portion of his Nov 28 , 2009 FOI request :
On 28 July 2006 at 6:32 PM UEA / CRU received an email from Jonathan
Overpeck , to which a spreadsheet was attached “ listing : the
submitter , file name of the paper , its acceptance date , and the
chapter and section which the submitter feels is relevant . ”
These
were expert comments received pursuant to an email sent to
Reviewers on 5 July 2006 , soliciting additional reviewers comments .
Please send me an electronic copy of the spreadsheet .
In December 2009 , the UEA reverted saying that they would consider the request under EIR ( Environmental Information Regulations ) – this may be an interesting precedent since the decision between EIR and FOI has been disputed in a number of other cases .
Holland ’s view is that EIR is applicable ; the institutions prefer to respond under FOI which has more exemptions .
UEA :
In short , we will consider your request and provide information under EIR , not FOIA .
On January 26 , 2010 , the UEA refused on the interesting basis that the document was held by the police and they did n’t have a copy :
Your request for information received on 28 November 2009 for a spreadsheet sent as an attachment to an email of 28 July 2006 from Jonathan Overpeck has now been considered , and , upon consideration , it is , unfortunately , not possible to meet your request .
In accordance with Regulation 14 of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 this letter acts as a Refusal Notice , and I am not obliged to supply this information and the reasons for exemption are as stated below : Exception
Reason
Reg. 12( 4 ) ( a ) – Information not held
The requested information was not held at the time of the request Reg. 12( 5 ) ( b ) – Disclosure would adversely affect a criminal enquiry Information is held by the police in connection with a current investigation We believe that Regulation 12 ( 4 ) ( a ) applies to your request because the only location that this information was held on was on a backup server as the original information had been ‘ deleted ’ some years ago .
Pursuant to an investigation carried out by the Norfolk Constabulary , the server upon which the requested information resided was taken from the University grounds on 24 November and now resides with the police
forces conducting an investigation into a possible criminal offence .
Therefore , at the time of the request , we did not hold the requested information , and we currently have no access to either the server or any of the material on it .
Regulation 12 ( 5 ) ( b ) also applies to the data requested because the requested data is part of a larger set of data that is the subject of an ongoing police investigation .
Such information is now under an embargo by the investigating forces and any disclosure would adversely affect the ability of that public authority to conduct the criminal enquiry .
Regulation 12 ( 1 ) ( b ) mandates that we consider the public interest in any decision to release or refuse information under Regulation 12 ( 4 ) and Reg. 12( 5 ) .
In the case of Regulation 12 ( 4 ) ( a ) , there really is no consideration of the public interest as we simply did not , at the time of the request , nor do not now , have the requested information .
Turning to Regulation 12 ( 5 ) ( b ) , we feel that there is a strong public
interest in protecting the ability of police forces to investigate criminal offences and that we should abide by established procedures by which evidence is gathered and used .
Overall , we therefore believe that the public interest in non-disclosure of the information outweighs that in favour .
I should note that whilst we believe that it is possible that this material is already in the public domain due to the illegal penetration and use of University computing facilities , this does not relieve us of our obligations to address any request on its merits under the Regulations .
The above comment is interesting in considering claims that people had n’t “ deleted ” emails and documents .
A few days ago ( March 26 , 2010 ) , the UEA notified Holland that they had located the requested information in another location and sent him a copy .
UEA FOI officer Palmer ;
Further to my letter of 26 January 2010 responding to your request of 28 November 2009 for a spreadsheet sent as an attachment to an email of 28 July 2006 from Jonathan Overpeck , I am writing to advise you of recent developments in this matter .
By my letter of 26 January , you were informed in good faith that the requested information was not held at the time of the request .
It was the University ’s belief that the only location that this information was held on was on a backup server and that the original information had been ‘ deleted ’ some years ago .
I further advised that , pursuant to an investigation carried out by the Norfolk Constabulary , the server upon
which the requested information is held was taken from the University ’s grounds on 24 November 2009 and is being held by the police forces conducting an investigation into a possible criminal offence .
It has come to the University ’s attention that the University does hold the spreadsheet in question otherwise than on the backup server .
We only made this discovery very recently .
Accordingly , I enclose with this letter a copy of the spreadsheet in fulfilment of your request of 26 January 2010 .
No excuses this time that the provision of the spreadsheet would cause the demise of international relations between the UK and the rest of the known universe .
The spreadsheet consisted of four articles :

The Thompson et al ( PNAS 2006 ) article prompted some discussion in the Climategate letters ( indeed , the WG1 TSU letter is a trailer to this discussion . )
Interestingly , neither the NAS report nor the Wegman Report were forwarded from the WG1 TSU to the Chapter 6 Authors , though both had been properly submitted .
Needless to say , Wahl and Ammann 2004 2005 2006 2007 was n’t on the list .
Once the owners of this playful puppy left him at home where he managed to find a sack with laundry blue …
Today we will consider a model for replacing our current form of government with an insurance - based model .
In step one of this hypothetical future , the government of the United States buys every insurance company in the country at estimated current values .
In this imagined future , the government becomes the insurance provider for the country , and perhaps the rest of the world .
The profits from selling insurance will eventually replace taxes .
Our government would become a for - profit enterprise .
In a way , the U.S. is already sort of a big insurance company .
When something catastrophic happens , from hurricanes to war , the government steps in .
I ’m suggesting we formalize the arrangement and try to monetize it , with most of our profits coming from international sales .
Remember that an insurance company does more than just collect premiums and pay out for losses .
They also work to reduce risks .
This is similar to what a government tries to do for its people .
Governments urge you to quit smoking , and they force you to wear seatbelts .
Governments form armies to keep the homeland safe .
Governments fund schools to keep future generations from needing aid .
For all practical purposes , the government is already a big insurance company .
All I ’m suggesting is that we become more efficient at it , and make some money in the process .
Think how much the rest of the world would pay for our military protective services .
It has to be a lot more expensive for a country to have its own military than it would be to pay for insurance against unlikely attacks .
Obviously some countries would keep their own armies out of pride , or fear , or tactical preference .
But I can imagine a few hundred smaller countries preferring to pay insurance for military and diplomatic protection .
The U.S. probably has the best disaster emergency resources in the world .
We should be selling those services in the form of insurance policies .
If the tsunami hits , we swoop in and rebuild towns and provide emergency services up to some predetermined limit .
Perhaps we would still help the uninsured , just to be good neighbors , but at a lower level , and funded only by donations .
The thing I find interesting about insurance as a new model for the government is that it would lead to practical laws , especially if law makers had some sort of profit motive .
For example , you might see the legalization of any activity that lowered financial risks .
I think you ’d find that in most cases , the majority of citizens coincidentally support just about every policy that saves money in the long run .
That ’s because the best way to save money in the long run is to keep citizens safe and healthy and prosperous .
Obviously there would be danger in allowing a profit motive for government officials .
The press would have to be our watchdogs .
Assuming some transparency of decisions , based on published actuarial tables and budgets , there should n’t be too many surprises in what choices the government makes .
In this imagined future world , politicians are still elected by the people .
And the big moral issues could still be decided based on cultural preferences over profits .
The difference is that the voters would always have an estimate at hand to see how much those preferences might cost them .
For example , if the majority of citizens prefer to keep doctor - assisted suicide illegal on moral grounds , that ’s fine .
But citizens would have access to a government - provided estimate on how much that decision costs the economy .
Another benefit of the United States of Insurance is that citizens would have just one policy for all sorts of risks , including automobile , health , home , personal liability , and so on .
Your premium costs would depend on your specific situation .
Just check all of the appropriate boxes on a web page , and enter your bank account number for automatic deductions .
You just paid your taxes and handled all of your insurance needs in ten minutes .
I can imagine that becoming the United States of Insurance would make the world safer in the long run .
Imagine two smaller countries spoiling for a fight , and one of them is an insurance client .
The plodding and ineffective United Nations would be irrelevant , but the United States of Insurance would step in fast to protect its investment .
No one would ever misjudge its intentions because its motives would be entirely transparent .
The insurance model would also remove unproductive emotions from international affairs .
Many of our problems in the world seem to revolve around which leaders have bruised egos , who is getting snubbed , and that sort of thing .
If the United States of Insurance started making decisions based on actuarial tables , other countries would find it hard to find any negative emotion other than boredom .
The biggest leap of faith in this thought experiment is that the government could do anything right .
But consider that 90 % of private businesses eventually go belly up .
If you could measure the performance of your government the way you measure the performance of private companies – by profits , and the government leaders themselves had a profit motive , how efficient could government become ?
The United States of Insurance would allow that sort of profit measurement and incentive .
I agree that this imagined future can never happen .
We do n’t have the sort of government that can change .
It ’s just interesting to think about .

Things appear to go in cycles .
The Montauk Monster received so much publicity in 2008 , it was inevitable that more washed - up carcasses would get their own share of media moments and minutes .
Although the Montauk Monster most assuredly turned out to be a raccoon , in the months that followed , more ( briefly ) unexplained decaying bodies turned up in the New York , the UK , Alaska , Panama , and elsewhere to befuddle the press .
The animals were discovered to be everything from marine mammals to an unfortunate sloth .
This year ’s first candidate to be compared to the Montauk Monster , of course , has been the Bald Beast of KI , or the Kitchenuhmaykoosib monster ( also called “ Omajinaakoos , ” “ Big Trout Lake Monster , ” and “ The Ugly One ” ) .
It was a dead animal ( almost 12 inches or 30 centimeters long ) that was discovered and photographed on May 8 , 2010 by two female nurses and their dog in a creek on or near Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nation , Ontario .
Some elders have said it is a creature called oomajinakoos ( ugly one ) , the appearance of which is said to be a sign of bad luck .
Beyond the unrealistic speculation that it was a relative of Ogopogo , Nessie , or even a baby Sasquatch , the more logical thinking has produced a mundane answer to this brief mystery .
At first , thoughts moved in the direction of a bear cub , a muskrat , or an otter .
But recent indications point to the animal having been a rather commonplace species , a mink .
The American mink , Neovison vison , are found throughout North America , in Canada and the United States of America .
They are dark - colored , semi-aquatic , carnivorous mammals of the family Mustelidae , which also includes the weasels and the otters .
The well - known silky soft fur of a mink , when wet , can take on an even more intense glossy appearance .
The head of a mink would look similar to that of an otter .
The key are the feet , which are webbed in otter and unwebbed in mink .
The American mink and its skull .
While some individuals writing to Cryptomundo have suggested the mink species specifically as the answer , let me quote from the opinion of an authority consulted by Forgetomori , via biologist Maria Guimarães , who shared the thoughts of James L. Patton , Curator and Professor Emeritus , Museum of Vertebrate Zoology , University of California : “ [ The ] mystery critter looks more like a mink than an otter to me ( longer fingers , without any evidence of webbing ) .
It clearly was dead in the water for a prolonged period , hence the defurred face and head , and somewhat swollen appearance … .
If anyone had bothered to look at the teeth , the identification would have been easy , but …. ”
As Patton , Forgetomori , and all of us have noted , identification in such cases are difficult from web - posted photos , when more secure positive identification could have been obtained with an actual body .
But we sometimes have to work with what we have .
In the case of the Bald Beast of KI , once again , the actual carcass has disappeared .
From what is available , the photographs a reportedly foot - long dead body pulled from a creek in Ontario , it appears to have been a dead mink .
About Loren Coleman
Loren Coleman is one of the world ’s leading cryptozoologists , some say “ the ” leading living cryptozoologist .
Certainly , he is acknowledged as the current living American researcher and writer who has most popularized cryptozoology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries .
Starting his fieldwork and investigations in 1960 , after traveling and trekking extensively in pursuit of cryptozoological mysteries , Coleman began writing to share his experiences in 1969 .
An honorary member of Ivan T. Sanderson ’s Society for the Investigation of the Unexplained in the 1970s , Coleman has been bestowed with similar honorary memberships of the North Idaho College Cryptozoology Club in 1983 , and in subsequent years , that of the British Columbia Scientific Cryptozoology Club , CryptoSafari International , and other international organizations .
He was also a Life Member and Benefactor of the International Society of Cryptozoology ( now - defunct ) .
Loren Coleman ’s daily blog , as a member of the Cryptomundo Team , served as an ongoing avenue of communication for the ever - growing body of cryptozoo news from 2005 through 2013 .
He returned as an infrequent contributor beginning Halloween week of 2015 .
Coleman is the founder in 2003 , and current director of the International Cryptozoology Museum in Portland , Maine .
Scientists have found bovine TB in a feral wild boar for the first time in the UK .
The discovery may raise fears among farmers that boars , along with badgers , could be contributing to bovine TB in cattle – but the researchers say the porcine species poses a low risk of spreading the disease to livestock or humans .
Tests on a 60kg female boar believed to be 7 - 9 months old revealed tissue lesions consistent with the disease .
The wild boar joins the growing list of wildlife hosts for TB .
The threat from badgers is now judged so great that the new coalition government is preparing for England to follow Wales in culling the animals , despite conflicting scientific advice on whether the measure would be effective .
The boar died while under anaesthesia as part of an ongoing study of the animals in Herefordshire , an area where there is a high prevalence of TB on farms .
The study is being conducted for the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) by the Food and Environment Research Agency .
Boar in the wild probably became extinct in England about 300 years ago but a series of escapes and deliberate releases from farms since the 1980s have meant small feral populations have become re-established .
A letter in today 's Veterinary Record says any potential role wild boar may have in spreading bovine TB in the UK remains unclear , although the disease has been found in farmed wild boar twice .
In parts of Spain and Portugal the disease in boar is already at a level that is self - sustaining but in Italy they are " spillover " hosts .
The government already encourages landowners to increase routine culling of wild deer when there are high levels of TB and confirmation of the disease in cats , dogs , pigs and camelids , although still very low , appears to be increasing .
Fewer than 1 % of human TB cases are thought to be linked to bovine TB infections .
Defra said last night : " ' This finding does not change our risk assessment of the roles of other wildlife at present and we continue to monitor confirmed cases of TB in all animals , including wildlife , as part of our ongoing TB surveillance . "
The spokesman added : " The main risk of human M. bovis [ bovine TB ] infection arising from wild boar is probably occupational , for those handling live infected animals or their carcasses in the field .
" We continue to advise basic personal hygiene practices , including wearing protective equipment to prevent cuts in the skin and to prevent exposure to infectious aerosols . "

One of the Tea Party ’s top leaders was recently paid $ 7,500 by a campaign run by a California Republican group to promote one of their ballot initiatives .
Mark Meckler is a spokesman for the Tea Party Patriots and had publicly distanced himself from the Republican Party .
But state records show that he accepted the money for “ petition circulation management ” from the “ Citizen Power Campaign Supported by the Lincoln Club of Orange County . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The Lincoln Club is a key player in state politics and this latest initiative is an ambitious act of political skullduggery .
The Citizen Power Campaign is trying to put a measure on the ballot come November that would make it illegal for taxpayer money for political activity .
Why ?
Because that would remove a key source of funding for the public employees union , making it more difficult for pro-labor candidates to get elected .
But the Lincoln Club needs enough signatures to get the measure on the ballot in the first place , which is why they paid Meckler to use his Tea Party influence to help gather signatures .
The initiative has been championed for years by top California Republicans including Carly Fiorina and Steve Poizner , even though it has been voted down in two previous ballots .
Talking Points Memo reported yesterday that Meckler was involved several years ago with a political consulting firm that has ties to the GOP .
Meckler has long been seen as one of the Tea Party ’s key spokesman , but his ties to the GOP could stoke fears among the movement ’s followers that their grassroots group is being assimilated by the Republican party .

Tea Party activists created the Web site SaveOurMovement.com after accusing Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele of trying to “ hijack ” their movement for political purposes .

An Ohio sheriff known for taking extreme steps to crack down on undocumented immigrants and a Republican state representative are urging the state to pass an immigration law similar to the controversial one in Arizona .
Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones and state House Rep. Courtney Combs have sent a letter to Ohio Governor Ted Strickland asking him to pass a law that “ mirrors ” the one in Arizona , reports WLWT channel 5 in Cincinnati .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Our federal government has failed us when it comes to securing the border and stopping the flow of thousands of illegals entering this country on a daily basis , ” WLWT quoted Rep. Jones as saying .
“ If the federal government wonÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t do it , it is time that states take that responsibility upon themselves . ”
Arizona ’s law allows police to stop and question anyone they suspect of being an illegal immigrant , even if they do n’t suspect that person of any other wrongdoing .
Critics say the bill will lead to racial profiling , and some commentators have even compared the measure to race - based laws in Nazi Germany .
For Sheriff Jones , the push to allow police greater powers to combat illegal immigration may be partly personal .
Last week , his office paid $ 100,000 to settle a lawsuit brought against Jones by a man who said he was unconstitutionally detained by deputies during a 2007 illegal immigrant raid on a construction site .
According to the Hamilton , Ohio , Journal - News , Luis Rodriguez had been living in Ohio for 11 years when he was arrested by Jones ’ deputies , charged with providing false identification , and deported to Mexico .
The charges against Rodriguez were later dropped .
In a 2006 profile of Butler , Right Wing Watch described the sheriff as “ running his own personal campaign against undocumented immigrants .
… HeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s taken out newspaper ads , he put up six billboards in the area with his personage warning ‘ Hire an IllegalÃ¢â‚¬â€ Break the Law ! ’ and he even started his own blog on the web site of the sheriffÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s office to organize a boycott of businesses that hire undocumented immigrants . ”

Rep. Combs , a Republican whose district includes the Cincinnati suburb of Hamilton , also has a track record of fighting undocumented immigrants .
Last year he introduced a bill that would require employers to check the Social Security numbers of new employees to ensure they are in the US legally .
“ Combs said in May 2009 the bill [ is ] about giving jobs to Americans and taking away a paycheck from illegal immigrants during tough economic times , ” the Dayton Daily News reports .
WLWT reports that Combs and Jones hope to travel to Arizona to meet with Gov. Jan Brewer , who signed the state ’s immigration bill into law last week .

Since the Arizona law came into force , it has been criticized by commentators and politicians who believe it goes too far .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , who was Arizona ’s governor until last year , has said her department will “ review ” the law .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has said the law will lead to racial discrimination and hate , and his government has issued a travel warning for Arizona .
Even Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has said he believes the law may be unconstitutional .
People who live in urban areas where particulate air pollution is high tend to have higher blood pressure than those who live in less polluted areas , according to researchers from the University of Dusiburg - Essen in Germany .
The researchers used data from the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study , an ongoing population - based cohort study of almost 5,000 individuals that focuses on the development of heart disease .
They analysed the effects of air pollution exposure on blood pressure between 2000 and 2003 .
While some earlier studies have shown that acute increases in particulate air pollution , such as day - to - day fluctuations , can raise blood pressure , little was known about medium - and long - term exposure .
" Our results show that living in areas with higher levels of particle air pollution is associated with higher blood pressure , " said Barbara Hoffman , M.D. , M.P.H. , head of the Unit of Environmental and Clinical Epidemiology , University of Duisburg - Essen , and senior author of the study .
The results were presented at the ATS 2010 International Conference in New Orleans .
The authors used a dispersion and chemistry transport model to estimate long - term exposure to particulate pollution .
For the blood pressure measurement , they used an automated oscillometric device that detects the blood 's movement through the brachial artery and converts the movements into a digital reading .
They found that average arterial blood pressure rose by 1.7 mmHg for an increase of 2.4 µg / m³ in the exposure level to fine particulate matter ( under 2.5 μm ) , which mostly originates from combustion sources in urban areas ( traffic , heating , industry , power plants ) .
They found a similar association for coarser particulate matter under 10 μm , which contains more earth crust material and roadway pollution .

" Both , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , are higher in people who live in more polluted areas , even if we take important factors that also influence blood pressure like age , gender , smoking , weight , etc. into account .
Blood pressure increases were stronger in women than in men , " explained Dr. Hoffman .
High blood pressure increases the risk for atherosclerosis , a hardening of the arteries , which leads to cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes .
" Our results might explain why people who live in more polluted areas are at a higher risk to suffer and die from these diseases , " said Dr. Hoffman .
It has also been shown that chronic noise exposure , for example from living close to major roads , is associated with higher blood pressure or with diseases of the heart .
" In our study , air pollution levels represent averaged background concentrations which were not related to nearness to busy streets , " said Dr. Hoffman .
" Therefore , the observed increase in blood pressure is not likely due to noise exposure .
" This finding points out that air pollution does not only trigger life threatening events like heart attacks and strokes , but that it may also influence the underlying processes , which lead to chronic cardiovascular diseases .
It is therefore necessary to further our attempts to prevent chronic exposure to high air pollution as much as possible . "
Dr. Hoffman and colleagues intend to study whether living in areas with higher levels of air pollution leads to a faster progression of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries , which supply the heart with fresh blood , and of the carotid arteries , which supply the brain with fresh blood .
Several large studies in Europe and the United States are already under way and are expected to shed more light on the chronic effects of living in polluted areas .
“ I was right 70 percent of the time , but I was wrong 30 percent of the time , ” said Alan Greenspan as he testified last week on Capitol Hill .
Greenspan  a k a the Oracle during his 18 - year - plus tenure as Fed chairman  could not have more vividly illustrated how and why geniuses of his stature were out to lunch while Wall Street imploded .
No doubt he applied his full brain power to that 70 - 30 calculation .
But the big picture eludes him .
If the captain of the Titanic followed the Greenspan model , he could claim he was on course at least 70 percent of the time too .
Greenspan was testifying to the commission trying to pry loose the still incomplete story of how the American economy was driven at full speed into its iceberg .
He was eager to portray himself as an innocent bystander to forces beyond his control .
In his rewriting of history , his clout in Washington was so slight that he was ineffectual at “ influencing the Congress . ”
The “ roots ” of the crisis , he lectured , dated back to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 .
In other words :
Wherever the buck stops , you had better believe it ’s not within several thousand miles of the Oracle .
As he has previously said in defending his inability to spot the colossal bubble , “ Everybody missed it  academia , the Federal Reserve , all regulators . ”
That , of course , is not true .
In last Sunday ’s Times , one of those who predicted the bubble ’s burst  Michael Burry , an investor chronicled in “ The Big Short ” by Michael Lewis  told in detail of how Greenspan and others in power “ either willfully or ignorantly aided and abetted ” the reckless boom and the ensuing bust .
But Greenspan is nothing if not a representative leader of his time .
We live in a culture where accountability and responsibility are forgotten values .
When “ mistakes are made ” they are always made by someone else .
This syndrome is hardly limited to the financial sector .
The Vatican hierarchy and its American apologists blame the press , anti-Catholic bigots and “ petty gossip ” for a decades - long failure to police the church ’s widespread criminal culture of child molestation .
Michael Steele , the G.O.P. chairman , has tried to duck criticism for his blunders by talking about his “ slimmer margin ” of error as a black man .
New York ’s dynamic Democratic duo of political scandal , David Paterson and Charles Rangel , have both attributed their woes to newspapers like The Times , not their own misbehavior .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Addicted to smoking and unable to quit ?
Your genes may be partly to blame , according to a trio of studies published Sunday in Nature Genetics that link several gene variants to a range of smoking habits , as well as increased risk for lung cancer .

Collectively , the researchers on the studies analyzed the DNA profiles of more than 140,000 people -- smokers and nonsmokers .
They also studied whether genetic variants affect whether people start smoking , how much they smoke and whether they are able to quit .
In one study , researchers found that a single - letter change in the DNA code of chromosome 11 was strongly associated with taking up smoking and another on chromosome 9 was associated with quitting smoking .
( Humans have 23 pair of chromosomes ) .
“ This lends support to the idea that smoking is not just a question of will power alone , but that genetics plays a role in how much a person smokes and their ability to quit smoking , ” Dr. Helena Furberg from University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , who was involved in the research , noted in an email to Reuters Health .
“ We hope that our findings will help pave the way for better treatments that will help people quit smoking , ” said Furberg .
She emphasized , however , that more research needs to be done before the findings will benefit people directly .
“ At this time , getting tested for these variants will not tell you anything meaningful about your risk of smoking or ability to quit smoking , ” the researcher noted .
In another study , a team of researchers led by scientists at deCODE Genetics in Reykjavik , Iceland , found that smokers who carry specific gene variants on chromosome 8 and 19 smoke more -- about half a cigarette extra each day -- and run a 10 percent higher risk of getting lung cancer compared to non-carriers .
The third study confirms and refines a discovery made two years ago by deCODE scientists and others of a gene variant on chromosome 15 associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of lung cancer .
“ These are fairly common variants , ” deCODE chairman and senior investigator Kari Stefansson told Reuters Health .
NATURE VERSUS NURTURE
“ There is debate about the relative importance of nature ( genes ) versus nurture ( environment ) in the development of common diseases , ” Stefansson added .
Studies have shown that while environment plays a key role in whether or not someone takes up smoking , genetics plays a role in whether or not they continue to smoke and how much .
“ Our research shows that there is a genetic predisposition to become addicted to nicotine , ” Stefansson said .
Smoking causes 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer , but only a small proportion of smokers actually develop the disease , further evidence , researchers say , that a person ’s genetic makeup is a factor .
“ Smoking is bad for anyone ’s health , Stefansson noted in a written statement .
“ It is even worse for some , and today ’s discoveries continue to strengthen our ability to identify who those people are and give them a compelling reason to quit .
We plan to incorporate these ( variants ) into our testing products to do that . ”

Background : A few years ago , I decided that I wanted to make a trilogy of books , with Lockpick Pornography being the first .
I got the idea from watching Sympathy for Mr Vengeance , Oldboy and Lady Vengeance .
And so , this is book 2 : We All Got it Coming .
I 'm going to serialize it online for free again , though this time , instead of asking for donations if you like it , I 'll ask you to buy a copy of One Bloody Thing After Another , which is my new novel , coming out in May 2010 .
It has lesbians and dead moms and headless ghosts .

A federal judge granted class - action status to a lawsuit filed by members of Quinnipiac University ’s volleyball team alleging gender discrimination in the university ’s athletic programs .
Judge Stefan Underhill ’s ruling means if he finds Title IX violations , he can order remedies for all current and future female athletes at Quinnipiac , not just the five members of the team who sued .
He rejected an attempt to add nonstudents who would have been deterred from enrolling at Quinnipiac as part of that class .
Quinnipiac , a private university in Hamden , Conn. , with 5,400 undergraduate and 2,000 graduate students , last year sought to drop volleyball and add women ’s cheerleading as a sport , prompting the lawsuit from several players and Robin Sparks , the volleyball coach .
For most people , one time being killed by the United States is plenty .
Even the most hardened insurgent can rarely claim to have been killed more than a couple of times before it takes on an air of permanence .
But Hakimullah Mehsud , the leader of the Tehreek-e Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) , has them all beat with the apparent confirmation of his latest survival , his seventh overall .
Hakimullah Mehsud
According to a senior member of Pakistan ’s Inter Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency Hakimullah , who was “ confirmed ” killed in January and then assumed to be gravely wounded , and who was “ confirmed ” the have died of his injuries in February , is alive and “ basically ok . ”
Hakimullah has not been seen publicly since a late February video was released , though with the Pakistani military attacking the TTP in several agencies across the tribal areas and with so many threats against his life it is perhaps unsurprising that he is keeping a low profile .
Hakimullah took power of the TTP in August after the US successfully assassinated his predecessor , Baitullah Mehsud , in an air strike .
Baitullah ’s death was initially thought to be a serious blow to the group but the aggressive and charismatic Hakimullah has made the group arguably far more dangerous , launching several major attacks and orchestrating the bombing of a CIA base in neighboring Afghanistan .
Bud Selig Should Tell You the Truth About Pace of Game
What ’s My Point ?
If Bud Selig shot fans straight and told them that the reason the pace of baseball is slow is because of the time in - between innings , the fans would understand .
Why Does it Matter ?
He is blaming players and umpires , but he does n’t consider that most players are waiting to start an inning from the commercial break .
First Game
I ca n’t believe I am playing in the Big Leagues !
This is amazing !
Look at how big this stadium is .
Man , there have to be 30,000 fans here .
Dude , I ca n’t feel my legs .
It does n’t matter .
Look at this infield that I am taking ground balls from .
Oh , Bagwell is throwing me ground balls in - between innings for goodness sake !
Oh , here comes the ball … Yup , pick it up , and throw it back to Bagwell .
Dude I am on the field with Bagwell and Biggio .
Crazy .
Ok , looks like Brad Ausmus is throwing the ball down to second base .
I ’ll go over to Roy ( Oswalt ) and just flip him the ball while I tell him that I have the bunt on the third base side .
“ Here you go Roy .
I have this whole side , ” I say , showing him with my hands and arms .
Run back to third .
Ok I ’m here and I ’ll get on the grass so I can cover this bunt .
I ’m ready !
What ’s going on ?
Why is Roy looking at second base ?
I ’ll look over there .
Are you kidding me ?
We have to wait for the commercial break ?
Dude at least 10 seconds have passed .
I always wondered why the 3rd out was made and the pitcher would just sit on the bench while his defense ran out on the field .
Is Everybody Looking at Second Base ?
No .
We are not looking at second base , we are looking at the second base umpire with the stopwatch .
You see , we have to wait 2 minute and 5 seconds in - between innings for commercials .
Tim Brown of Yahoo sports says that FOX , ESPN , and TBS get an additional 30 seconds .
It is common knowledge in the dugouts that there is no sense of urgency getting back on the field because of this rule .
As the time approaches its end , the second base umpire will point to the home plate umpire and the inning will start .
Did You Ever Notice That You Made it Back JUST in Time to See the Pitch ?
Man these guys are good !
You just got back from running to the fridge to get a beer and some low calorie organic fiber enhanced protein chips and just when you sit down , BOOM !
the inning starts .
You think Nailed it Again !
Dude it ’s your year bro !!!!
You ’re on fire !
Wooohooo !
Let me tell you what I was doing as you started moving back to your living room chair .
I say to the third base umpire , “ Al ”
“ Hey Al ! ” “ Hey Moe . ” “ How is your kid ? ” “ Oh , he is good .
Just started Kindergarten so we have a lot going on . ”
“ Dude , I hear that .
Our boys are the perfect height to hit me in the nuts .
I feel like I have to wear a cup around the house . ”
“ Been there Moe . ” “ So when is your break ? ”
( Remember , umpires are NEVER at home .
They pack for a season !
They get 2 weeks each season to go home and spend time with their families .
It is the worst travel schedule in baseball .
Your job is to get yelled at by players , managers , and fans , then when you had a bad game you get to go back to a hotel room and just sit and stare at the ceiling and go back over the game trying to figure our how you are not going to make the same mistake next time .
Did you ever think about the umpire ’s life ?
It is hard . )
“ Well I have one week coming up in about a month , and the second week is in the middle of August . ”
“ What are you going to do ? ” “ Just go home and see my family .
I really miss them . ”
“ This 2 minute 5 second thing is killing me . ”
“ They force us to hold the game until the time is up . ”
“ Oh , I know .
I just love the fact that this is the one thing that players and umpires agree on 100 % of the time .
Waiting around like this stincks . ”
“ Good call Moe . ” “ Well looks like we are about to start again . ”
“ Hey , next inning is the 2 minute 30 second commercial break . ”
“ Thanks for that , Joe .
I will stay in the dugout for a minute . ”
“ Yeah , I always go to the bathroom during that one , Moe . ”
8 seconds … . Now Get in the Box !
I am sitting on deck waiting to bat .
Lance Berkman just gets another hit and this is when I hear Kanye West ’s song , Jesus Walks :
Chorus : “ Je-sus Walks . ”
Kanye : “ God show me the way , ’ cause the Devil ’s trying to bring me down . ”
Chorus : “ Je-sus walk with us . ”
And done !
That was my allotted 8 seconds of intro music .
A couple of years ago , MLB told us that we will get 8 seconds worth of intro music .
MLB felt like that was the reason the pace was so slow .
But we know it was secondary to the commercial breaks .
Everybody Shut Up! 40 Year Umpiring Vet Joe West has Something to Say… .
“ It ’s pathetic and embarrassing , ” West told The Bergen ( N.J. ) Record .
“ They take too long to play .
They ’re the two clubs that do n’t try to pick up the pace . ”
( Speaking of the Red Sox vs. Yankees game . )
Yeah !
You tell ’em Joe !
It ’s the players and managers !
No doubt !
I ’m with you on that !
There is no other factor involved !
Just slow , lazy play .
Oh … and maybe the fact that umpires have to stand and wait with players to start our slow play from the commercial break .
Maybe there ’s a slight issue with the fact that all that waiting helps to cause the flow of the game to come to a screeching halt !
But hey , we gotta get paid !
Check Me Out !
I ’m Totally on TV !
Look at Me !!
I Rule !
This is my favorite quote from Bob Watson , MLB ’s Vice President of Rules ,
“ They ’re getting mug time , ” he said .
“ Batters step out of the box .
Pitchers back off .
They ’re talking to the ball , all kinds of stuff , because they ’re on TV .
It takes time . ”
Business Week
Yup !
Check me out !
I ’m batting .200 !
Have n’t slept in 8 years from sheer panic .
Sure , John Smoltz is throwing 100 mph , but I ’m not thinking of his slider or his split .
I ’m going to try and get a little face time .
Mr. Watson , guys are not trying to get face time .
Guys are trying to compose themselves and prepare for the next pitch .
You were a great player and you understand taking a step back to refocus .
And do n’t give me the :
“ We did n’t take a step back and regroup in my day . ”
Bob Gibson was throwing 98 mph right under your chin .
You and I are the same .
I know how you felt and you know how I felt .
We are trying to compete in a game that takes concentration and focus .
So What Do You Think Bud ?
Bud loves committees .
For Bud , there is nothing better than a consensus .
He rounds up some baseball people and they talk about the issue .
Then they type up a report that confirms their rhetorical thoughts .
Now Selig can take this report and hold it in the air and say that the experts have confirmed what we knew .
Unfortunately , it seems like these reports are n’t always the most honest and straightforward way of getting information out to the fans .
A Letter To the Fans
Dear Fans , Baseball is about making money .
There , I said it .
Players play the game because we can make a fortune while we are young and healthy .
Owners own teams so they can make money .
But I think you understand that .
That ’s just capitalism at work .
I think that when push comes to shove , you would play this game also for exorbitant sums of money .
Now , we do n’t want you to think we hate playing .
Not by a long shot .
We love the game and we ca n’t believe that we make this much money playing something we love .
Fans , you understand that baseball is unique in the world of sports because there is no set clock .
You also understand that it is expensive to go to a baseball game .
But you do n’t understand why we are lying to you .
I am here to tell you .
We get paid from commercials , television rights , MLB trademarks , tickets , concessions , and a bunch of other sources that I am too dumb to think of right now .
One aspect that you are going to have to live with is that TV commercials pay the largest portion of the bills and if they say 2 minutes and 5 seconds , then 2 minutes and 5 seconds it is .
You see , I do n’t think fans are completely stupid .
The guy at Wrigley who spit on me was stupid , but the rest of you are n’t so dumb .
Would you riot in the streets if I told you the truth ?
I do n’t think you would .
I think you would just say , “ Oh , ok .
I do n’t like that I have to wait longer , but I understand why they wait 2 minutes and 5 seconds in - between innings .
I would do the same thing .
Well , I am going to get another hot dog then . ”
Bud , just tell the fans that the pace is slow because of money .
People wo n’t think you are a jerk .
They wo n’t think you are some money hungry Commissioner who is trying to squeeze out every last cent possible .
They will finally hear something honest and when you are straight with people they can place themselves in your shoes .
Fans , we play for money .

Beyonce on a triple - word score ?
Scrabble to upset purists with ' dumbing down ' rule change
Any Scrabble fan will tell you that knowing how to spell Beyonce , Timbuktu , or Quorn would never help you win the game .
But now , to the horror of the purists , the game 's makers are throwing out the old rule book and allowing proper nouns .
Worse still , not only will the names of places , trademarks and people be permissible , but even words spelled backwards or placed unconnected to other pieces .
Celebrity squares : How a Scrabble board might look under the new rules
Nice stats : Miss Knowles could get you off to a flyer
The decision , by games giant Mattel , will allow the celebrity , geographic and sports worlds to invade the most popular word game , leaving many a Scrabble fan bemused , or as the regular player may prefer , bumbazed .
For why memorise some of the 30,000 eight letter words in our rich and quirky English language when the names of pop stars such as Jay - Z or sportsmen like Zico may get you many more points .
Anyone with a keen knowledge of football has a distinct advantage .
For example Zhirkov , as in the Chelsea footballer Yuri Zhirkov , scores a standard 26 points .
If your Zhirkov falls on a triple word score and you use all seven of your tiles it will net you a massive 131 points .
It would even beat the highest ever score granted in the opening play of a championship match which was 126 point ' muzjiks ' .
A muzjik is a Russian peasant , as utilised by Jesse Inman at the U.S. National Scrabble Championship in 2008 .
Mattel defends its decision to make the game easier by saying it will level the playing field between experienced players and novices .
But the announcement has caused outrage among regular players with accusations that the company is ' dumbing down ' the game .
Richard Lyon , chairman of the Cambridge Scrabble club , will not be playing by the new rules , even though his college Fitzwilliam becomes the highest scoring Cambridge college with a minimum 28 points .
SCRABBLE ? GAME ON !
Some 53 per cent of all homes in Great Britain have a Scrabble set .
Versions of Scrabble have been sold in 29 different languages .
The latest addition is the Welsh language Scrabble introduced in 2006 .
There are around 4,000 Scrabble clubs around the world , organising hundreds of competitions - including three separate World Championships for elite players in English , French and Spanish .
UK players have their own organisation , the Association of British Scrabble Players which was taken to court in 1995 by a player for allowing too little time for him to go to the toilet between games .
There are over 260,000 legal words allowed under British Scrabble rules , including 124 permissible two - letter words containing every letter in the alphabet except V .
The highest number of points that can be scored on the first go is 128 - with ' muzjiks ' ( Russian peasants ) .
The highest score for one game is 1049 by Philip Appleby from Lymington in 1989 .
He said : ' These changes go against the core tenets of the game .
Avoiding names is a discipline .
And floating words make it even easier .
Why play a game that does n't challenge you ?'
Keith Churcher , chairman of the Reading Scrabble Club , was dismayed .
He said : ' Players like myself have spent decades memorising words in the dictionary .
' To be trumped by someone with knowledge of the current top ten pop chart is not a welcome prospect .
' They 're dumbing down a classic . '
When U.S. architect Alfred Butts invented the game in 1948 he banned the use of proper nouns .
Players have adhered to his rules ever since .
They govern world championship tournaments as well as club games played across the world .
A spokesman for Mattel admitted the new rules would not be popular but added : ' The new quirks will level the playing field .
' Experienced players with a vast vocabulary could be equally pitted against players with a love of celebrity or football .
' Obviously some people will want to continue playing the old rules so we will still be selling a board with the original rules . '

It ’s election week here in the UK ; on Thursday , we ’ll be going to the polls to choose our next government .
At Resolver Systems , thanks to energy and inventiveness of our PR guys over at Chameleon , we ’ve been doing a bunch of things related to this , including some analysis for the New Statesman that required us to index vast quantities of tweets and newspaper articles .
Last week I was looking at the results of this indexing , and was reminded of the fun I had playing with NLTK back in February .
NLTK is the Python Natural Language Toolkit ; as you ’d expect , it has a lot of clever stuff for parsing and interpreting text .
More unexpectedly ( at least for me ) , it has the ability to take some input text , analyse it , and then generate more text in the same style .
Here ’s something based on the Book of Genesis :
In the selfsame day entered Noah , and asses , flocks , and Maachah .
And Joseph said unto him , Abrah and he asses , and told all these things are against me .
And Jacob told Rachel that he hearkened not unto you .
And Sarah said , I had seen the face of the air ; for he hath broken my covenant between God and every thing that creepeth upon the man :
And Eber lived after he begat Salah four hundred and thirty years , and took of every sort shalt thou be come thither .
It was the work of a moment to knock together some code that would read in all of the newspaper articles that we ’d tagged as being about a particular subject , run them through a Beautiful Soup - based parser to pull out the article text , and feed that into NLTK , then to dump the results into a WordPress blog ( after a little manual polishing for readability ) .
The result ?
REABot , the Resolver Electoral Analysis Robot .
Here ’s a sample of what I think is its finest post , which was based on articles about the Nick Clegg :
They ’re interested in local government , free TV licences , pension credits and child trust fund , Carrousel Capital , run by local Liberal Democrats .
TV Exclusive Trouser Clegg Nick Clegg , but clashed on how the vexing issue of honesty , principles and policies of electric shock .
It is easy to do .
" Louis Vuitton advertising used to pay back your debts " , he declared that he has delivered his strongest warning yet on the party first place and still obsessed with outdated class structures .
Inspired by Barack Obama ’s repertoire , they advise you to send a message to voters at home .
" You have n’t want to try to counter the threat of it yet , " he says .
So , what does the code look like ?
It ’s actually trivially simple .
Let ’s say that we ’ve downloaded all of contents of the newspaper articles ( I sha n’t waste your time with HTML - munging code here ) and put them into objects with content fields .
Here ’s what REABot does :
import nltk tokenizer = nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer(r'\w +|[ ^\w\s ] +' ) content_text = ' '.join(article.content for article in articles ) tokenized_content = tokenizer.tokenize( content_text ) content_model = nltk.NgramModel(3 , tokenized_content ) starting_words = content_model.generate( 100 ) [ - 2 :] content = content_model.generate(words_to_generate , starting_words ) print ' '.join ( content )
It ’s a bit of a hack — I ’m sure an NLTK expert could write something much more elegant — but it works :-)
What this does is generate a single string , which is formed of the text of all of our relevant articles , and runs it through a tokeniser , which splits it up into words and punctuation symbols , so that ( for example ) the string " I spent some time this afternoon playing with NLTK , the Python Natural Language Toolkit ; the book is highly recommended . " would be turned into the list [ ' I ' , ' spent ' , ' some ' , ' time ' , ' this ' , ' afternoon ' , ' playing ' , ' with ' , ' NLTK ' , ' , ' , ' the ' , ' Python ' , ' Natural ' , ' Language ' , ' Toolkit ' , ' ; ' , ' the ' , ' book ' , ' is ' , ' highly ' , ' recommended ' , '. ']
This is then fed into an NgramModel .
This is nothing to do with Scientology ; Ngram is a word created by extension from “ bigram ” and “ trigram ” to refer to collections of n tokens .
What we ’re doing with the expression nltk .
NgramModel ( 3 , tokenized_content ) is creating an NLTK object that , in effect , knows about every three - token sequence ( trigram ) that occurs in the tokenised text ( [ ' I ' , ' spent ' , ' some ' ] , [ ' spent ' , ' some ' , ' time ' ] , [ ' some ' , ' time ' , ' this ' ] , and so on ) , and knows how frequently each one occurs .
Once we ’ve got the set of all possible trigrams and their respective frequencies , it ’s pretty easy to see how we can generate some text given two starting words and a simple Markov - chain algorithm :
Let ’s say that we start off with [ ' The ' , ' tabloid ' ] .
.
Our analysis might tell us that there are three trigrams starting with those two tokens , [ ' The ' , ' tabloid ' , ' headlines ' ] 50 % of the time , [ ' The ' , ' tabloid ' , ' newspapers ' ] 10 % of the time , and [ ' The ' , ' tabloid ' , ' titles ' ] 40 % of the time .
50 % of the time , 10 % of the time , and 40 % of the time .
We generate a random number , and if it ’s less than 0.5 , we emit “ headlines ” , if it ’s between 0.5 and 0.6 , we emit “ newspapers ” , and if it ’s between 0.6 and 1.0 , we emit “ titles ” .
Let ’s say it was 0.7 , so we now have [ ' The ' , ' tabloid ' , ' titles ' ] .
.
The next step is to look at the trigrams starting [ ' tabloid ' , ' titles ' ] ; we work out the probabilities , roll the dice again , and get ( say ) [ ' tabloid ' , ' titles ' , ' have ' ]
; we work out the probabilities , roll the dice again , and get ( say ) Repeat a bunch of times , and we can generate any arbitrarily long text .
This is pretty much what the NgramModel ‘s generate method does .
Of course , the question is , how do we get two words to start with ?
By default , the method will always use the first two tokens in the input text , which means that every article we generate based on the same corpus starts with the same words .
( Those who know the Bible will now know why the bit from Genesis started with the words “ In the ” . )
I worked around this by telling it to first generate a 100 - token stream of text and pick out the last two :
starting_words = content_model.generate( 100 ) [ - 2 :]
… and then to generate the real output using those two as the starting point :
content = content_model.generate(words_to_generate , starting_words )
It ’s kind of ( but not really ;-) like seeding your random number generator .
And that ’s it !
Once the text has been generated , I just copy and paste it into a WordPress blog , do a bit of prettification ( for example , remove the spaces from before punctuation and — perhaps this is cheating a little — balance brackets and quotation marks ) , add appropriate tags , and hit publish .
It takes about 5 minutes to generate an article , and to be honest I think the end result is better than a lot of the political blogs out there …
[ An aside to UK readers : does anyone know if the business news in The Day Today was generated by something like this ? ]
At present the molecular mechanisms involved in adult stem cell pluripotency and self renewal remain largely unknown .
Furthermore , they appear to lack a blueprint of transcription factors proposed to be involved with ' stemness ' , as described for ES cells [ 26 ] .
It is not unreasonable to assume however , that similar gene patterns may exist for adult stem cells .
The focus of this work was to ascertain whether human adult stem cells , specifically c-kit isolated cells from UCB were capable of expressing transcription factors described for ES cell pluripotency .
The impetus for the study arose over controversy following the number of recent reports suggesting genes such as Oct4 play a role in regulation of adult stem cell multipotency [ 4 – 12 ] and the proposed pre-disposition of developmentally active genes to retro-transposition events [ 13 ] .
From our initial results , it became clear that reliance on RT - PCR technology was highly dependent on the specificity of primer sequences and was an unreliable method of analysing ES cell pluripotency genes in adult stem cells .
Amplification of ' Oct4 ' transcripts in differentiated cell types such as hepatocytes and various cell lines ( together with c - kit+ progenitor cell populations ) , revealed the difficulty in designing primers capable of recognising only genuine Oct4 .
On examination of several published primer sequences , all aligned with Oct4 pseudogene sequences in addition to genuine Oct4 , as determined using the NCBI BLAST alignment tool [ 10 , 11 , 21 , 23 , 24 ] .
This raised the possibility that artefacts generated by Oct4 pseudogenes may have contributed to false identification of Oct4 and our current knowledge of adult stem cell gene expression .
Recently , Liedtke et al [ 27 ] approached this problem by alignment of Oct4 to all its known pseudogene sequences with design of exact primers incorporating a polymorphism unique to genuine Oct4 .
They demonstrated that their primers could discriminate between cDNA and genomic DNA .
Furthermore , in accordance with our data , Liedtke et al [ 27 ] showed that Oct4 was not expressed in human cord blood mononuclear ( MN ) cells or peripheral blood MN cells , contradicting other recent reports [ 5 , 7 , 28 ] .
In both ES and EC cell types , pseudogene expression appears less of a contaminating factor in such cell populations .
This may be attributed to events which occur during early development , whereby genes which are not involved in embryonic patterning are silenced by promoter methylation .
Genes such as Oct4 have an ' anti- silencing ' promoter which prevents methylation during this stage of embryonic development [ 29 ] .
Hence , lack of pseudogene expression in these cells may likely be due to such generic gene silencing .
Our sequencing results however , suggest that neither freshly isolated nor cultured c- kit + progenitor cells ( nor cell lines HepG2 , Hek293T and HMC1 ) undergo such tight regulation of Oct4 pseudogene expression , whilst they also appear to be incapable of genuine Oct4 transcription .
The reason why the frequency of retro-transposition events in ES cell - specific genes far exceeds those of non-ES cells is not known [ 13 ] .
Interestingly , this may have particular significance with regard to recent findings by Elliman et al [ 30 ] who have detected pseudogene expression of Dppa3 / Stella in human adult tissue types including bone marrow , peripheral blood , pancreas , adrenal and thyroid gland .
This supports the fact that developmental pseudogene expression in differentiated tissues is more widespread than previously thought and reiterates the need for caution regarding use of such genes as markers of adult stem cell pluripotency .
Our subsequent strategy was to select published primers designed to specifically amplify genuine Oct4 gene expression [ 25 ] .
Unfortunately , our sequencing results confirmed that in non ES cell samples , these too detected pseudogene expression .
On inspection of where these primers aligned on genomic DNA from chromosome 6 , the reason why they may have failed to preclude pseudogene amplification became apparent .
The anti-sense primer sequence taken from Pickering et al [ 25 ] had not incorporated an additional guanine base present in the Oct4 sequence obtained from NCBI , accession number NC_000006 .
Subsequent ' BLASTing ' with the new primer sequence generated alignments to several pseudogene transcripts , thus providing an explanation for our unexpected RT - PCR false positives .
( NB : the Oct4 DNA sequence used to identify primer sequences was NCBI version GI : 51511722 which replaced version GI : 42406225 on 24 august 2004 ) .
Therefore , it is possible that the previous DNA sequence had omitted the guanine base identified and may have influenced original primer design .
Our sequencing results revealed that only the EC cell positive control expressed the genuine Oct4 transcript with 100 % sequence homology to the 647 bp product .
All the other cell types examined expressed a selection of the various Oct4 pseudogene mRNAs found on chromosomes 1,10 and 12 , all which have > 97 % homology to genuine Oct4 [ 19 ] .
Recently , several reports have proposed that pseudogene transcripts may act as regulators of protein synthesis and mRNA stability , particularly during carcinogenesis [ 31 , 18 , 19 ] .
Kandouz et al [ 18 ] revealed that a Connexin43 pseudogene [ ψ Cx43 ] plays a functional role in some tumour cells .
The protein Connexin43 , involved in intercellular communication is often deregulated in many cancers .
Interestingly , in some cancer cells ψ Cx43 becomes translated into a functional protein , playing a role in growth inhibition .
This appears to contradict the common concept that pseudogenes represent a version of a gene mutated to inactivity .
If however , the mutation is within a regulatory region which prevents transcription , perhaps under certain cellular conditions the pseudogene may be expressed .
This putative role of Oct4 pseudogene transcripts in regulation of the parent gene has been proposed by Suo et al [ 19 ] who identified two pseudogenes transcribed in conjunction with the apparent genuine Oct4 in HepG2 , MCF - 7 and Hela cell lines .
Nevertheless , this is speculative and recent work by Mueller et al [ 32 ] , using a variety of techniques and in excess of 30 somatic tumour cell lines , have concluded that functional Oct4 is not expressed .
As with our results , they also demonstrated that the only cells to exhibit genuine Oct4 expression were EC cell lines [ 32 ] .
Although sequencing data in the present study revealed no genuine Oct4 expression in c -kit + cells , we wished to investigate whether these cells were capable of utilising an exogenous Oct4 promoter construct .
The reasoning was that if levels of pseudogene transcripts were relatively high in comparison to their genuine Oct4 counterparts , the pseudogenes may have been preferentially amplified .
Our results corroborated the sequencing data in that the only cells able to express genuine Oct4 were the EC 2102 Ep cells , with no GFP observed in c -kit + HSCs or cell lines HepG2 and Hek203T .
In summary our results suggest that Oct4 does not appear to be involved in adult stem cell multipotency , in human UCB progenitor cells .
In support of our findings , work by Lengner et al [ 33 ] have shown recently the same appears true for a variety of mouse somatic stem cells , using Oct4 gene ablation .
They show that Oct4 is dispensable for self - renewal in intestinal epithelium , bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and HSC , hair follicle , brain and liver in contrast with previous findings utilising mainly RT - PCR analysis .
In conclusion , together with a number of recent reports [ 27 , 32 , 34 , 35 ] on the controversy surrounding the role of Oct4 in ASCs , our study has underlined the necessity of utilising more than one approach to identify embryonic genes involved in pluripotency before hypothesising their involvement in ASC multipotency .
We were unable to substantiate recent reports that Oct4 is involved in the self - renewal of somatic stem cell populations , reiterating the need for caution in the interpretation of results , especially RNA derived when investigating genes prone to high level pseudogene expression .

This atheist actually believed he knew for a fact that there was no God .
I found that position to be interesting and , quite honestly , not possible .
Also , he and I discussed faith a bit towards the end .
Atheist :
As to religious arguments I have n't found one that can stand up to the logic of atheism .
Matt :
Are you a strong atheist or a weak one ?
Atheist : Never heard of a weak atheist .
Matt : I ’ll explain .
A strong atheist states that there is no God .
He knows there is no God .
A weak atheist , basically , ' lacks belief ' in a god of any sort .
Atheist :
Then I am a strong atheist .
Matt :
Then you know there is no God ?
Atheist :
As much as knowledge can tell us yes . . .
Maybe it's you who have to catch up on your atheism . . .
Agnostic fits the description pretty well of a weak atheist . . .
Matt :
That is what I said . . . which are you ?
Atheist : I am a strong .
Characteristic human thought , coupled with hope is what religion boils down to , the unexplained tried to be explained . . .
Matt :
So , you know there is no god ?
Atheist : Yes .
Matt :
How can you know that ?
Atheist :
It 's a reasonable assumption .
If you want a definitive answer .
Does any Christian bother to look in the dictionary to what truth actually means ?
There is no 100 % anything .
Only close to it .
Matt :
Then you cannot KNOW there is no God .
Your strong atheism is illogical .
Atheist : Let 's look at Christianity .
It runs on faith .
Faith is not logical .
It gives credence to unicorns , goblins and thing s that go bump in the night .
Matt : Nope .
The subject is your atheism .
Please do n't try to change the subject .
Atheist :
The subject can jump where ever .
Matt : Your atheism is illogical .
You cannot know there is no God .
To do that , you 'd have to know All things to know there is no God .
Atheist : I will defend , but also place in attack .
Try to defend faith
Matt :
One subject at a time . . .
You'd have to have seen all evidences to know there is no God .
You cannot claim this ; therefore , your atheism is illogical .
Atheist :
You can never see all evidences but that does not mean there is a god .
Matt : Correct .
Atheist :
No , that means there is not enough information for a conclusion .
So we make assumptions as best we can according to our knowledge . . .
Matt :
But you must concede that your claim to strong atheism ( that you know there is no God ) is not logical .
Atheist :
My knowledge of the human brain leads me to believe there is no god . . .
Matt :
Then that means there MIGHT be a God because you do n't know all the evidence .
Therefore , you must logically be an agnostic .
Atheist :
And so must you . . .
But you picked a side .
Matt :
Then it [ your atheism ] is not logical but only assumptions you base your atheism on .
Your atheism is untenable . . .
You must admit that agnosticism is more logically viable .
If you admit that , we can discuss my faith .
Atheist : I 'm not ignorant to say I do n't use faith .
But only the usage of faith in a situation that remains provable .
Matt :
So , are you agnostic or atheist ?
which is it ?
Atheist : Atheist .
Matt :
You 've lost the argument .
Sorry . . .
Atheist : Wrong .
What you 're doing is a ploy .
You bring me over . . . but you stay the same .
Either you must move over as well or the argument is mute in the first place .
One can not keep faith and call his beliefs logical .
For a bit I will stray over to the agnostic side .
But I am willing to state instances where I believe prove my contention that there is no god .
Matt :
You have been cornered . . .
It is not logical for you to claim strong atheism .
You have not seen all the facts .
Therefore , the possibility of God 's existence is real .
Therefore , you must admit that agnosticism is more logical in this situation .
Alright , Let 's talk faith .
Atheist : Alright faith .
you first .
Matt : I believe God exists .
I have faith that he exists .
Atheist : Proof .
Matt : I have none .
Atheist :
No proof with faith .
So , do you always believe in things that you can not prove ?
Matt : No . . . not at all . . .
I have evidences , but they cannot lead to 100 % proof or else all could be forced to believe .
But , if there is enough evidence , I do believe .
Atheist :
So you must be agnostic in that sense as well .
Matt : No . . . because I make choices .
Though it is possible for my faith to be proven wrong , I still rest on the evidences and draw logical conclusions .
Atheist : Evidence . . .
Matt : Yes . . .
Atheist :
Then you disregard one of the most fundamental rules of the game . . .
Matt :
Which is ?
Atheist : " Where ever knowledge is incomplete , there is a place for " faith ; " but where ever knowledge and " faith " conflict , it is " faith " which must be modified or abandoned . "
Matt :
Or the understanding must be reevaluated . . . ' Facts ' have been found to be wrong before .
Atheist : Facts are not Truths .
They are reasonable assumptions .
I will get a dictionary definition for that one . . .
Matt :
That 's fine .
So what about it ?
What kind of evidence would be sufficient for you to conclude there is a god ?
Atheist : Fact - Reality or actuality as distinguished to from conjecture or fantasy ; Something known by observation or experience to be true or real .
Matt :
That 's good . . .
Now . . . what would constitute evidence for God 's existence ?
Atheist :
An instance of superiority . . .
Something humans could not do . . .
OR not be able to explained through phenomena but event then . . .
Matt :
That 's good . . . now . . . what would constitute evidence for God 's existence ?
Atheist : A universal movement .
A stoppage of the planet .
Nothing earthly .
Matt :
If that were to happen , would you conclude there was a god ?
Could n't it be explained in other ways ?
Atheist : I would of course doubt it at first .
I would look for an explanation . . .
And for something like that I would probably find no reasonable explanation . . .
Matt :
If you had could not find one , what would you conclude ?
Would you conclude that there is a god ?
or that you simply do n't have all the facts ?
Atheist :
You never have all of the facts . . .
Reasonable assumptions , remember ?
Matt :
Then you could not safely conclude it was the hand of God , could you ?
Atheist : Nope . that would be the only explanation that I could think of that would have the three means , opportunity .
( forget motive ) [ I did not understand him here . . . ]
Matt :
Then you could n't know anything for sure , right ?-- that is , if you do n't have all the facts -- all of them .
Atheist :
Have n't we already agreed you can never have all the facts ?
Matt :
What you are telling me is that you have no real way of proving or disproving God .
So then , does n't it come down to faith based upon evidence ?
I have evidence . . .
Atheist : I have to go .
Friends just arrived .
Can we finish this later ?
Matt :
If you want . . .
I 'm not sure how it went with this atheist .
But I hope some seeds were planted .
Apple ’s recently updated iPhone developer agreement explicitly states that apps for the platform must be originally written in C , C++ , and Objective C.
This new rule , which naturally created a firestorm of controversy , put a damper on Adobe ’s plans to get apps developed in Flash onto the iPhone via its new Flash - to - iPhone compiler .
In response to Apple ’s new developer agreement , Adobe Flash project manager Mike Chambers wrote in a blog post yesterday that Adobe would cease development on their Flash to iPhone compiler and would instead focus on other mobile platforms , like Google ’s Android .
Chambers went on to call out Apple for attempting to keep the iPhone platform closed and locked down :
The primary goal of Flash has always been to enable cross browser , platform and device development .
The cool web game that you build can easily be targeted and deployed to multiple platforms and devices .
However , this is the exact opposite of what Apple wants .
They want to tie developers down to their platform , and restrict their options to make it difficult for developers to target other platforms …
As I wrote previously , I think that the closed system that Apple is trying to create is bad for the industry , developers and ultimately consumers , and that is not something that I want to actively promote .
And as luck would have it , Apple actually responded to Chambers comments via spokeswoman Trudy Miller .
“ Someone has it backwards–it is HTML5 , CSS , JavaScript , and H.264 ( all supported by the iPhone and iPad ) that are open and standard , while Adobe ’s Flash is closed and proprietary . ”

Hi All :
Attached for your interest is an announcement and abstract of my lecture to be presented next Tuesday at the " Café Scientifique " of Summit County , Colorado .
Dr. Martin Hertzberg
Hockey Sticks and “ Climategate ” : a Death of Scientific Integrity
Dr. Martin Hertzberg of Copper Mountain , a retired research scientist and consultant in the causes and prevention of accidental fires and explosions , will present the above titled talk at this month ’s meeting of the Café Scientifique .
The meeting will be held at 7:00 PM on Tuesday , April 27th at the Summit County Senior and Community Center , 151 Peak One Blvd , Frisco , Colorado .
Dr. Hertzberg also served as a forecasting and research meteorologist while on active duty with the U. S. Navy .
He has been studying the “ global warming / climate change ” issue for over twenty years and has published papers and articles on the subject .
The presentation will be in two parts : the first will discuss the theory that human emission of CO2 is causing dangerous global warming or climate change and that drastic measures of “ carbon control ” are needed .
That discussion will be prefaced by a showing of a condensed version of the documentary “ Not Evil , Just Wrong ” , followed by a summation of the available data that shows that the theory is false .
The evolution of two fraudulently concocted “ hockey sticks ” is revealed : one for the average temperature of the earth ’s atmosphere , and the other for the atmospheric CO2 concentration .
They are discussed in the context of the recent disclosures of the e-mail correspondence among the various global warming advocates : the so - called “ climategate ” scandal .
The e-mails reveal an appalling lack of scientific integrity on the part of those advocates .
The second part of the presentation will be prefaced by a showing of a brief film entitled “ Unstoppable Solar Cycles ” , which will be followed by a summation of much of the available data that elaborates on the real causes of global warmings , global coolings and climate change .
Those cycles are controlled by solar activity on the time scale of decades to hundreds of years , and by variations in the properties of the earth ’s orbit around the sun on the longer time scale of tens to hundreds of thousands of years .
Variations in solar activity modulate the intensity of cosmic rays impacting the earth ’s atmosphere .
Cosmic ray ionization provides nucleating agents for cloud formation .
The cosmic ray flux measured at our own Climax mine correlates precisely with the earth ’s total low level cloud coverage , as measured from satellites .
Dr. Hertzberg ’s analysis of the radiative equilibrium between the sun , the earth , and free space , confirms that all the temperature variations of the last century are readily explained in terms of those modest changes in cloudiness that are observed to correlate with solar activity .
Global warmings result in an increase in atmospheric CO2 as warmed oceans emit their dissolved CO2 .
Global coolings result in a decrease in atmospheric CO2 as cooling oceans absorb atmospheric CO2 .
Temperature variations precede those CO2 variations by several hundred to a thousand years , thus indicating that it is the temperature variations that cause atmospheric CO2 changes and not the reverse .
The human contribution to the cycle is trivial and furthermore the so - called “ greenhouse effect ” , touted as the mechanism by which atmospheric CO2 controls weather , has long been known to be devoid of physical reality .
Accordingly , proposed measures of “ carbon control ” will have no effect on the weather but instead will seriously damage the Nation ’s economy and the reliability of its electric generating capacity : a system that is currently working quite satisfactorily and is entirely independent of foreign sources of energy .
Clearly , that system for supplying the Nation with its essential need for reliable electricity “ ai n’t broke ” … and “ if it ai n’t broke , do n’t fix it ! ”

It is perhaps little known that the beautiful county of Wiltshire , famed for Stonehenge and the white horses carved into its hills , is the most active area for crop circles in the world , with nearly 70 appearing in its fields in 2009 .
It is unsurprising then , that the appearance of a phenomenally complex 300 ft design carved into an expanse of rape seed on a Wiltshire hillside has caused excitement .
But it 's not just the eye - pleasing shape which has drawn attention to it .
The intersected concentric pattern has been decoded by experts as a “ tantalising approximation ” of a mathematical formula called Euler ’s Identity ( e ^ ( i * Pi ) + 1 = 0 ) , widely thought be the most beautiful and profound mathematical equation in the world .
The design ( pictured above ) appeared beside Wilton Windmill late on Friday night .
Lucy Pringle , a founder of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies , was one of the first on the scene .
She says : “ What has happened in this particular crop circle is that there are 12 segments and within each segment there are 8 partly concentric rings .
Each of these segments indicates a binary code based on 0 and 1 .
If you use an Ascii Table [ computer calculation system ] , the pattern transposes itself into a tantalising approximation of Euler ’s equation . ”
The average person finds such complex mathematical talk utterly confounding , so The Independent Online asked Dr John Talbot , a maths research fellow at University College London , for his take on the matter .
He said : “ Looking at the crop circle , the link with Euler ’s most famous identity seems to make perfect sense .
However , the way the formula has been executed is partially incorrect .
One of the discrepancies is that one part of the formula translates as ‘ hi’ rather than ‘ i ’ , which could be somebody ’s idea of a joke . ”
The Wilton Windmill circle is not the first to have provoked mathematical exposition .
In July 2008 a photograph of a crop circle near Barbary Castle ( also in Wiltshire ) caught the attention of retired American astrophysicist Mike Reed when he saw it in a national newspaper .
He was struck by its shape and eventually concluded that it was a coded image representing the first ten digits of Pi ( 3.141592654 ) , a conclusion declared to be a “ seminal event ” by Pringle at the time .
Sceptics dismiss crop circles as utter rubbish , but despite decades of research nobody knows conclusively how they ’re made .
As Francine Blake of the Wiltshire Crop Circle Study Group , explains : “ The difficulty is that we do n’t know the answer .
It ’s something that needs to be treated with great respect , but is too often talked about flippantly in the media which , I think , closes the subject rather than opens it . ”
There has been extensive scientific exploration into the affect the circles have on nearby wildlife .
Flowers and soils inside crop circles are dramatically altered , Blake explains .
Pringle observed in a 2003 experiment that seed samples taken from inside a crop circle had 40 per cent higher protein levels than those taken from outside it .
Another interesting element is the nature of the soil on which the circles appear .
Pringle says that 93.8 per cent of crop circles are made on chalk , " a worldwide phenomenon " recorded in 54 different countries .
She says the significance may be connected to underground springs called aquifers commonly found in chalk : " It is thought that the originating force probably originates in the ionosphere ( an area of atmospheric electricity ) .
The force then spirals to earth in the form of a vortical plasma and hits the ground with some 100 of 1000's of volts per metre for just a nano second only , else the crop would be burnt .
Occasionally we do see evidence of scorched flattened crop inside certain circles .
The electromagnetic fields of both the underground springs and the descending force work in harmony or conjunction with each other . "
Blake also remarks on the significance of the chalk , which she says the ancients often built their monuments on - an observation which the existence of Neolithic sites like Stonehenge and Avebury attest .
She says the ancients also built their temples on “ energy lines ” and has observed that “ crop circles always appear on or near these lines . ”
Blake was impressed with the Barbary Castle circle and its derivations because the shape itself was “ like a Labyrinth , ” which “ gives it a spiritual as well as a mathematical tradition . ”
Nobody knows for sure how crop circles are made .
Reports of strange mists creating the complicated patterns in a matter of minutes , their connotations with little green men and Midwich Cuckoos and elaborate hoaxes have fostered a widespread unwillingness to take the idea seriously .
This approach both feeds the mystery around the concept and prevents further exploration of it , as it is an area of research that is unlikely to be awarded large research grants or space on university courses .
But , as Blake remarks : “ There ’s neither rhyme nor reason , they just keep coming . ”
And with crops nearly at their full height , the UK ’s crop circle season is upon us .
If you want to see for yourself Wiltshire is your best bet .
What are some of your favorite Worf quotes ?
Worf may very well be my favorite Trek character , and often he says something that makes me laugh or brings a smile to my face .
One of my favorites is from DS9 when a group was wondering what Klingons dream about : Kira : What do Klingons dream about ?
Worf :
Things that would send cold chills down your spine , and wake you up in the middle of the night .
No , it is better you do not know .
And they could n't tell if he was joking or not , lol .
Another great one from DS9 - Children of Time : Kid : Are you the Son of Mogh ?
Worf : Yes , I am .
Kid :
Is it true you can kill someone just by looking at them ?
Worf :
Only when I am angry .
Worf : The Son'a wish to negotiate a cease - fire .
It may have something to do with the fact that we only have three minutes of air left .
HAHA
That was GREAT !!!
I had forgoten all about that !!
Worf and Q played great off of each other in that one .
Maybe you remember Alabama gubernatorial candidate Tim James ' flag - waving " We Speak English " ad .
This spot from Republican Alabama Agricultural Commissioner candidate Dale Peterson makes James look like a gay Commie terrorist .
Dramatic music !
Guns !
Horses !
Drawling !
God Bless America .
The ad opens with a shot of Peterson 's dog tags and Marines badge superimposed on the Constitution .
I mean , what !?
Was Peterson looking at the original copy of the Constitution at the National Archives and just happened to leave his dog tags lying on top of it ?
Maybe he uses replicas as placemats , and he uses his dog tags as spoons .
Regardless , this image shows that Dale Peterson is the most American of all Americans :
He has his Fourth of July barbecue on top of Mount Rushmore while lighting off fireworks with the bloody clothes of terrorists he killed with his bare hands and writing all - caps letters to members of congress reminding them about the Americans who are still missing in Vietnam .
Peterson then declares that the " thugs and criminals " who currently run the Alabama Agricultural Commision " do n't give a rip " about the people of Alabama as the soundtrack to Braveheart or something swells in the background .
Peterson accuses his opponents of " stealing yard signs in the dark of night " from his supporters , and then says , " We 're Republicans , we should be better than this . "
He hoists a rifle into frame , and leads his horse away , presumably to shoot the people stealing his yard signs in the buttocks .
What is it with Alabama politicians ?
( Commenter Artie Fufkin points out that there is also a candidate for Alabama treasurer named " Young Boozer " )

Inter 2 - 0 Juventus – Stats / Lineups
Serie A Fixtures / Results
The first half was a dull affair , only heated up by Momo Sissoko 's silly foul on 37 minutes that earned him his marching orders for picking up two yellow cards .
But Inter dominated the second half , and took home all three points thanks to Maicon and Eto'o .
The build - up to the game had been dominated by the explosion of Calciopoli II , spicing up an already heated rivalry .
The much - awaited Derby d'Italia between Inter and Juventus ended in a 2 - 0 win for the hosts , clinched by a brilliant volley from Maicon with just 15 minutes remaining and an injury time Samuel Eto'o tap - in .
The first half was a dull affair , only heated up by Momo Sissoko 's silly foul on 37 minutes that earned him his marching orders for picking up two yellow cards .
But Inter dominated the second half , and took home all three points thanks to Maicon and Eto'o .
The build - up to the game had been dominated by the explosion of Calciopoli II , spicing up an already heated rivalry .
The Nerazzurri were without Davide Santon and the the suspended Cristian Chivu .
Jose Mourinho fielded a full strength side , despite the upcoming Champions League clash with Barcelona , as Goran Pandev , Wesley Sneijder and Samuel Eto'o supported Diego Milito in attack .
Juventus ' horrific injury situation showed no sign of slowing down as David Trezeguet and Sebastian Giovinco were also ruled out during the week .
Alberto Zaccheroni unleashed the ' rombo ' with Diego playing trequartista behind Alessandro Del Piero and Vincenzo Iaquinta .
The visitors had chances within the first few minutes as Jonathan Zebina crossed for Iaquinta , who shot weakly at Julio Cesar .
Then the Brazilian beat away a 25 - yarder from Del Piero , and Claudio Marchisio curled over .
Sneijder had Inter 's first effort as he lashed a free kick over the bar from range .
On 15 minutes , the hosts twice went close .
First Gianluigi Buffon flew to his right to superbly push away Thiago Motta 's thunderbolt , then Maicon 's goalbound shot was charged down .
There was a dangerous moment on 25 minutes as Eto'o ran towards goal , but just as he wound up to shoot he was denied by a brilliant Momo Sissoko recovery tackle .
Buffon then got his body behind a Sneijder 20 - yarder .
On 37 minutes Juventus received a huge blow as Sissoko was sent off for a second yellow card for an idiotic lunge at Javier Zanetti .
Juve had been playing on level terms , but it was now an uphill task for them .
Inter made one change at half - time as Dejan Stankovic replaced Thiago Motta in midfield .
Juventus had the first attempt of the second period , but it was a disappointing dragged shot from Poulsen that Julio Cesar watched wide .
Down the other end , Stankovic also thrashed well off target .
On 53 minutes Inter created the first clear chance of the game as Eto'o ran clean through on goal , but with just Buffon to beat he blazed horribly over .
Mourinho reacted by swapping Pandev with Mario Balotelli .
Milito then also squandered a glorious opportunity by hooking inches wide from close range after Maicon had capitalised on a Fabio Grosso mistake .
Despite their man disadvantage , Juventus threatened occasionally and Fabio Cannavaro headed straight at Julio Cesar from a Diego corner .
Inter also had a chance from a corner , as Walter Samuel headed wide .
On 64 minutes , Buffon came to Juventus ' rescue with a superb acrobatic save from Stankovic 's swerving long shot .
Maicon then hit a daisycutter just wide as Inter upped the ante .
Inter were creating chances , and Milito missed another great opportunity on 68 minutes as he headed wide from yards out following a corner .
Sneijder also fired just over .
The deadlock was finally broken on 74 minutes with a brilliant goal from Maicon .
The Brazilian controlled a high ball on the edge of the box , sombrero'd over Amauri , and then volleyed into the top corner .
It was almost 2 - 0 with 10 minutes to go as Balotelli left Buffon stranded with a super free kick , only to see the ball crash back off the crossbar .
Cambiasso also wasted a fine chance , while in the 90th minute Milito missed another one - on - one .
Inter finally put gloss on the scoreline in injury time .
Muntari 's miss - hit was tapped home by Eto'o to cap off a dominant second half display .
Inter return to the top of the table , two points ahead of Roma who play Lazio in the derby on Sunday evening .
Juventus are now looking more and more likely to miss out on Champions League qualification , as Palermo and Sampdoria can move six points clear of them in fourth place with wins this weekend .

A version of the following correction is published in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday 13 May 2010
The column below referred to the " psychotic personality of a long - range military sniper " .
The Guardian 's style guide states that terms such as psychotic should be used only in a medical context .
So the other day I had to appear on live television several times throughout the evening , as the polls closed and the votes were counted and my guts turned to cold cream .
Not because of the exit poll ( although that was pretty depressing ) , but because appearing on live television is so profoundly scary .
Since most of my contributions were prerecorded , I did n't have to do much except turn up , state my name and introduce some VTs – but nevertheless the fact remains that you , sir , are on LIVE TELEVISION .
And this does very strange things to your brain .
Having lived through the experience , I can now only assume that every single one of the nation 's favourite live telly faces has the ice - blooded , psychotic personality of a long - range military sniper .
That nice Christine Bleakley ?
Bet she could emotionlessly blast a hole through your forehead while linking to a report on wind farms .
On the morning itself , I was fine .
I 'd been up until 5 am in an edit suite , where we were cutting one of the VT packages I 'd written ( to make two of them , totalling just over eight minutes , took roughly 40 hours ; viewers , of course , are blissfully unaware of the slog involved , and often assume it takes as long to create something as it does to watch it ) .
Therefore I was too knackered to really think about the LIVE aspect of the LIVE show that I was taking part in .
It was only during a cautionary pre-broadcast talk from the lawyer that it began to sink in .
The lawyer 's job is to remind you not to say anything libellous or illegal while the camera 's pointing at you , because , y'know , it 's live .
As he ran through an exhaustive list of things that could potentially go wrong , my mind began to cry .
Five minutes before the broadcast , I suddenly realised I could n't see properly .
Or rather , I could see perfectly well – objects and surfaces and people and all that – but nothing I looked at made sense .
At one point , I stared at my shoe and wondered if it was real .
Just as a spider in a bathtub will repeatedly run up the sides yet inexorably slide back to the same spot , my brain pounced in all sorts of oblique directions but always returned to the same thought : you are about to die .
All of which means that , by the time you walk out in front of an audience , in front of a camera , you are n't really " you " any more , but a vaguely human - shaped cloud of screaming nerves .
This is actually quite a useful state of mind : you essentially become someone else .
And since whatever 's happening is no longer happening to you , an eerie calm descends .
Not for long , though .
As the countdown begins , a comprehensive list of fears spools through your head .
Your primary concerns , in order of repulsion : 1 You might vomit with sheer terror while everyone 's looking .
2 You might snap and start bellowing obscenities or gibberish or violent threats against named individuals until a cameraman has to physically wrestle you to the floor .
Trust me , given the addled mindstate you work yourself into , this is not as unlikely as it appears on paper .
3 There might be a technical hitch that forces you to fill in , live , without a script .
( Later , backstage , Armando Iannucci told me that halfway through the 1997 Election Night Armistice – which has to rank as one of the best live TV comedy events of all time – he looked at the camera to discover his autocue was completely blank .
" The VT 's gone down , " said a producer in his ear .
" Just talk for two minutes . "
So he did .
Because he had no choice .
" It 's amazing what comes out , " he told me .
In the event , I got through my first weeny link without a hitch .
But moments before doing my second link , much later in the night , something completely unexpected happened .
I did a piss .
Only a little one – a mere eighth of a teaspoon at most – but nevertheless : I did a piss .
Not backstage either , but right there on the set , nanoseconds before I was due to start speaking .
Fortunately , I was wearing black trousers and sitting down so I got away with it , but inside my head it was pure nuclear war .
You see , by that point I 'd largely managed to convince myself that the nervous energy I was experiencing was actually just excitement in disguise .
The micropiddle was my body 's way of reminding me that , even if my head deluded itself , the rest of me was still petrified .
Do rookie news anchors piss their pants on day one ?
Did Phillip Schofield launch his career by soiling the broom cupboard chair ?
If you 'd asked me a week ago , I 'd have said no .
Now I 'm not so sure .
It did n't end there .
Later , I had to take part in a brief roundtable discussion during which I realised my hands were now urinating .
Well , kind of : they were virtually pissing sweat .
And although my vision had sorted itself out , my hearing was now proving troublesome ( everything everyone said sounded like an incomprehensible jumble of vowels ) .
It really is amazing how the human brain responds to high - stress situations .
Specifically , it 's amazing how it conspires to mess you up .
What with all that self - indulgent terror coursing through my veins , I hardly had time to digest the outcome of the election itself , which started out depressing before turning deeply weird .
So weird , in fact , that I 'm becoming convinced I actually died of a heart attack during my first live piece to camera , and am dreaming all of this on my way to the afterlife .
Cameron suggesting a Lib Dem coalition ?
Naaah .
That 's the Twilight Zone .
CAIRO , Egypt — I can watch Al - Jazeera live on my iPod Touch anywhere on earth with an internet signal , but I ca n’t watch CNN .
I can view EuroNews in real time from my office computer in Cairo , but not Fox News .
I can watch BBC ’s Arabic network live in my lap on a Wi-Fi-enabled jet 30,000 feet above the Atlantic , but not NBC .
American TV news organizations may claim to embrace the digital age , but this is studio - concocted nonsense .
Not a single major cable or broadcast news network in the United States consistently streams their programming in real time .
The only U.S. - based news network I ’ve found that streams live content is Al - Hurra , the U.S. government ’s news channel in the Middle East .
Meanwhile , networks from countries all over the world are offering their content free and live to anyone with an internet connection .
Haber Turk and TRT - Haber , two of Turkey ’s most popular news networks , offer free streams of their programming .
Germany ’s Deutsche - Welle network freely streams their English - language network as well as an Asia - focused network in German .
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation similarly webcasts its evening news program live , and three of Italy ’s largest news networks , Rai News 24 , Sky and Mediaset , afford live viewing online .
There seem to be two main reasons American TV networks do n’t care to do the same .
First , cable networks fear streaming their content online will eat into subscription fees they collect through companies like Comcast and Brighthouse .
This claim may have some merit , but what ’s to stop a network like CNN from charging internet users around the world $ 10 - $ 20 a year to stream their content live and around the clock ?
This would lessen the need for traditional cable providers , with whom news organizations squabble anyway , and the networks may come out making more money .
I ’m willing to bet that an attractive number of the more than 5 million Americans living outside the U.S. , as well as others , would be willing to pay $ 10 to stream CNN live on their laptops or handheld devices , not to mention the obvious fact that more eyeballs equals more advertising proceeds .
And in any event , mobile provision of TV content is the direction the industry is headed — and it ’s the direction some networks around the world have already gone — so CNN and Fox News should just spare their heels the friction and accept the inevitable .
The second reason American TV networks cling to the old model is an absurd fear that people around the world will steal and misuse their content .
TV news executives : Stop flattering yourselves .
Selling news reruns is no racket .
People around the world do n’t want to steal your news content .
They want to watch it today to make better decisions tomorrow .
( Oh , and they ’ll watch your ads , too . )
Exhibiting this fear are executives at " 60 Minutes , " who offer an audio - only podcast of their weekly newsmagazine .
Who wants to listen to " 60 Minutes " without seeing their great interviews and footage from the field , or Andy Rooney ’s dancing eyebrows ?
Few people , I suspect , but " 60 Minutes " is convinced that providing vodcasts ( video podcasts ) to news consumers around the world will somehow lead to its ruin .
American sports ’ broadcasting is even more miserly .
NBC provided a free iPhone app for the 2010 Winter Olympics that offered some events streaming in real time , but blocked streams of this content from people outside the United States .
The Olympics represents the most international assembly on the planet , but NBC made sure iPhone users around the world were n’t part of it .
Even more absurd , NBC did n’t give iPhone users outside the U.S. the option of paying for such access .
American news networks can’t claim profit motives for such ignorance .
In an even more foolish display of insularity , CBS sold for $ 10 an iPhone app streaming live games from the 2010 NCAA men ’s basketball tournament but , again , fans outside the U.S. were kept in the dark .
I do n’t have an MBA , but I feel confident that blocking millions of people from purchasing a product is a shortsighted business practice .
ESPN seems to be the only American channel regularly offering live sports content to viewers around the world , and they ’re making good money through online subscription fees .
To be fair , there are occasional legal restrictions dictating what sports content American TV networks can steer online , but the simple fact remains that TV news networks in the U.S. are deeply resisting the call to go truly global and mobile , while the rest of the world is warmly responding .
In his book " The Post - American World , " journalist Fareed Zakaria wrote that “ just as the world is opening up , America is closing down , ” which is precisely what American TV networks are doing .
“ We are becoming suspicious of the very things we have long celebrated , ” Zakaria wrote , “ free markets , trade , immigration and technological change . ”
I ’m not arguing that Turkish and German news networks are going to bury CNN and MSNBC , but journalism is wireless and increasingly borderless , and only news organizations that acknowledge this can become the world ’s information providers .
The New York Times is the world ’s global newspaper .
The BBC is the world ’s largest and most multilingual newsgathering organization .
Non-Americans all over the world access NPR for its diverse global coverage .
These outlets are industry leaders because they ’ve seized the web ’s capabilities for mobile content delivery .
American TV networks , though , are confining themselves into global irrelevance .
As the world ’s digital news consumers come calling , American TV networks have barred the door .

Men who help with housework have happier marriages
Teamwork : Couples are more likely to stay together if the husbands help with chores around the house
Forget boxes of chocolates and romantic weekends away .
The secret to a happy marriage is to roll up your sleeves and help your wife with the housework .
Research shows that unions in which the men muck in with the chores and childcare are more likely to last the course .
And the more elbow grease a man puts in , the lower the odds of him heading to the divorce courts .
The results of the study of thousands of British couples will be music to the ears of millions of women .
Men , however , are likely to be a little less keen on the idea that they should be taking on their share of ' women 's work ' .
Researchers from the renowned London School of Economics , normally used to dealing with more weighty academic affairs , have turned their minds to the hoovering and washing up .
They tracked the fortunes of 3,500 married couples who had their first child during one week in 1970 - an age when most women with young children stayed at home .
When the children were five years old , the women were asked about how much their husbands did around the house , including helping with housework , childcare and shopping .
Just over half did n't help at all - or only assisted with one task .
A quarter carried out two tasks , and the remaining quarter did three or four , the journal Feminist Economics reports .
Around 7 per cent of the couples had divorced by the time the child was ten , rising to 20 per cent by the youngster 's 16th birthday .
When the two pieces of information were crunched together it became clear that the more a man helped out , the more stable his marriage was .
It showed that although divorce became more common when the mother went out to work , this increase could be kept to a minimum by the father pulling his weight around the house .
Researcher Wendy Sigle - Rushton said : ' The results suggest the risk of divorce among working mothers , while greater , is substantially reduced when fathers contribute more to housework and childcare . '
Marriages in which the father stayed at home and took responsibility for the childcare and chores were as stable as those which followed traditional gender roles .
The finding , claimed Dr Sigle - Rushton , exploded the theory that marriages work best when comprised of a stay - at - home mother and a working father .

She added : ' The structure of the labour market , rates of female labour market participation , rates of divorce , and expectations about men's and women 's gender roles have all changed considerably since 1975 .
' But this study underscores the importance of taking into account relationships between men's behaviour and marital stability . '
Latest figures show that single women put seven hours into housework , while wives and live - in girlfriends do more than 12 hours every week .
Men , however , only put in four or five hours a week .
As President Obama considers nominees to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens , a debate bubbles as to whether religion should play a role in his choice .
This is a no-brainer .
The religious views of the next justice of the high court must absolutely be a decisive factor .
Though the court without Stevens will be left with six Catholics and two Jews , the open seat should not go to either domination .
Nor should it go to a Presbyterian , a Lutheran , a Methodist , a Muslim or even a Zoroastrian .
If it did , that would make nine people who all have one religious principle in common : a belief in religion .
Clearly , the next person to take the bench should be an atheist .

While few sitting politicians have the political courage to name a declared nonbeliever , it is something that Thomas Jefferson ( and several others among the founders ) might well have done .
In an 1823 letter to John Adams , Jefferson was forthright about his views of religion , and Christianity specifically .
“ And the day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus , by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerve in the brain of Jupiter , ” Jefferson wrote .
“ But may we hope that the dawn of reason and freedom of thought in these United States will do away with this artificial scaffolding , and restore to us the primitive and genuine doctrines of this most venerated reformer of human errors . ”
In other words , Jefferson liked what Jesus , the man , stood for , but could definitely do without the rest of the bunk .
That ’s right .
Bunk .
There are n’t a lot of us , but something like one out of six Americans calls himself a nonbeliever .
Holy moly !
That means we would still be underrepresented with just one justice .
But those of us who refuse to subscribe to any religious hocus - pocus would be happy to take what we can get in a country where seemingly no politician , from either party , can resist the temptation of ending a speech with the empty phrase “ God bless America . ”

It ’s rather staggering to consider that more than two centuries after our Constitution codified the absolute separation of church and state , we ’ve never had a single top court justice who was an atheist .
The closest we ever got were a handful of Unitarians .
Close but no cigar .
Having an atheist justice , however , would not primarily be a matter of identity politics and some sort of equal representation .
Rather , a nonbeliever justice would be a mighty blow in favor of the secular principles of “ reason and freedom ” of which Jefferson spoke .
Heaven knows we could use some more of that stuff .
Religion plays far too influential a role in our political and civic life as is .
I personally do n’t care what sort of superstition makes you sleep better at night , but I think we would all benefit if you left it behind closed doors and kept it as far away as possible from public policy .
How about a policy of do n’t ask , do n’t tell ?
We ’ve got quite a way to go to get even close to the stark separationism that is constitutionally enshrined but far too often ignored .
We ’ve recently been humiliated by a spate of local school boards dominated by fundamentalist Christians , undermining the teaching of science and inching us back into the shadows of ignorance .

While the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1961 that atheists cannot be denied elected office , there are currently seven states — including Pennsylvania , Texas and Tennessee — that retain laws keeping infidels out of government .
These moldy statutes are , indeed , unconstitutional , and when challenged eventually fail .
But “ eventually ” can be a long time .
In the meantime , they are used , as is currently the case with a North Carolina councilman , to force an elected official to spend outsized legal fees defending himself or herself for not believing in God .
When it comes to some Sunday soul - searching introspection , or when faced with a personal crisis that haunts your nightmares , it ’s your constitutional right to ask yourself , “ What would Jesus do ? ”
When it comes to deciding who will be the ultimate arbiters and defenders of the most advanced and enlightened governing document in history , we would all be a lot better off if , instead , we asked ourselves , “ What would Jefferson do ? ”

Solar - powered plane that aims to fly around the world takes off on historic 90 - minute flight ... at 28mph
Advertisement
A solar - powered plane that has been built to fly around the world took to the skies yesterday on an historic 90 - minute flight using not one ounce of fuel .
Four propellers lifted the massive ' Solar Impulse ' off the ground at a maximum speed of 28 mph on the runway at a Swiss military airport .
The test flight by Swiss adventurer Bertrand Piccard 's team was to see if the plane , which has the wingspan of a Boeing 747 and the weight of a small car , could keep a straight path .
The team plans to fly it around the world in 2012 .
Test pilot Markus Scherdel took the prototype plane to 3,280 feet before descending at a snail 's pace and touching down smoothly to cheers from spectators .
Solar Impulse slowly takes to the air after trundling along the runway at a maximum speed of 28mph
Despite months worth of rumors , Verizon is no longer interested in carrying Google 's Nexus One Android handset .
Instead , the company will focus its efforts on other Android phones , like the Droid Incredible , which launches this Thursday .
Nexus
One sales have remained disappointing , and despite plans to come to Sprint and new support from AT&T , the phone is n't gaining much traction .
Given the technical similarities between the Droid Incredible and the Nexus One ( both are built by HTC and share many of the same features and components ) , it is n't a big surprise that Verizon is choosing to avoid being associated with a flop and instead focusing its efforts on a phone it can promote under its own brand ( Droid ) and also offer in stores and to authorized retailers .
The Nexus One will finally make its UK debut on April 30 via Vodafone .
It will be interesting to see how it fares against the HTC Incredible , which will likely show up on a number of carriers .
Verizon owners :
Given the imminent release of the Droid Incredible , do you care that Google 's branded phone wo n't be available on your carrier ?
Let us know .
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court rejected the National Football League 's request for broad antitrust law protection Monday , saying that it must be considered 32 separate teams -- not one big business -- when selling branded items like jerseys and caps .
" Although NFL teams have common interests such as promoting the NFL brand , they are still separate , profit - maximizing entities , and their interests in licensing team trademarks are not necessarily aligned , " said the retiring Justice John Paul Stevens , writing for a unanimous court .
The high court reversed a lower court ruling throwing out an antitrust suit brought against the league by one of its former hat makers , who was upset that it lost its contract for making official NFL hats to Reebok International Ltd .
American Needle Inc. sued , claiming the league violated antitrust law because all 32 teams worked together to freeze it out of the NFL - licensed hatmaking business and gave Reebok an exclusive 10 - year license .
The company lost and appealed to the Supreme Court , but the NFL did as well , hoping to get broader protection from antitrust lawsuits .
American Needle 's antitrust lawsuit now heads back to the lower court .
The NFL said in a statement released after the ruling Monday that it was confident it would ultimately be victorious .
In its statement , the NFL noted that the Supreme Court 's decision pertained only to merchandise and did n't affect " collective bargaining , which is governed by labor law . "
" In today 's decision , the Supreme Court recognized that ' special characteristics ' of professional sports leagues , including the need for competitive balance , ' may well justify ' business decisions that among independent competitors would otherwise be unlawful .
The court noted that the NFL teams ' shared interest in making the league successful and cooperating to produce NFL football provide ' a perfectly sensible justification for making a host of collective decisions , ' " the NFL said .

The last few days , an increasing number of people have been sending us complaints about those pesky " census " mailers we wrote about – the ones that the Republican National Committee had been sending out .
We were under the impression that the Prevent Deceptive Census Look Alike Mailings
Act took care of that issue when it passed both houses of Congress unanimously last month .
Apparently not .
That law , sponsored by Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D - N.Y. , requires that any mailer that uses the word " census " on the envelope also include the sender ’s name and address along with a disclaimer that says the survey is " not affiliated with the federal government . "
But the RNC got around the new law by removing the word " census " from the envelope itself , and instead putting it on a document inside the envelope that could still be seen through the envelope ’s clear plastic window , according to TPMmuckraker .
This brought a backlash from a number of lawmakers , including Republicans .
Rep. Maloney and Rep. Lacy Clay , D - Mo. , sent a letter to the postmaster general urging him to investigate the RNC mailer .
Rep. Jason Chaffetz , R - Utah , wrote a letter to Michael Steele , the RNC chairman , asking him to " seriously reconsider the use of such deceptive and misleading tactics . "
But Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif , went one step further :
He drafted a new piece of legislation to close the loophole .
" We thought we had ended this , " Issa said on the floor of the House as the bill was being discussed this morning .
" We are making it clear here today that we will plug any perceived loopholes … whether it ’s the Republican National Committee or the Democratic National Committee or [ anybody else ] , do n’t use the census .
Do n’t even thinking about using the census , because it ’s wrong . "
The bill expands the prior law to mandate the disclosure requirement for any mailer where the word " census " is visible from the outside .
It unanimously passed the House this morning , and is now on to the Senate .
One of the web 's " 25 most influential people " says that camera phones will soon make digital SLRs obsolete .
" There will be no need to carry around those heavy lenses , " Nokia 's marketing EVP Anssi Vanjoki told a gathering in Helsinki , according to Reuters .
Citing continuing improvements in cameraphone technology , Vanjoki said : " They will in the very near future revolutionise the market for system cameras . "
And he was n't Vanjoking .
Do remember , however , that Nokia does n't make and sell DSLRs , they make and sell phones .
There are three major components to digital photography : the image sensor , the lens , and the hardware - software processing component .
In each of these areas , DSLRs have essentially insurmountable advantages for the foreseeable future .
And you notice that megapixelage is not on that list .
Perhaps the most overrated spec in cameraland , the sheer number of pixels that a camera claims does have an impact on the size of the image you get to play with , but how those pixels are captured matters far more to image quality .
And those pixels are captured by an image sensor .
A good rule of thumb is that the larger the sensor , the less noise in the image .
The CMOS sensor in a prosumer - level Nikon D90 , for example , is 15.8 by 23.6 mm , and the sensor in a pro-level Canon EOS - 1Ds Mark III is 36 by 24 mm .
Fitting a sensor of that size into a Nokia cameraphone would n't only be difficult space - wise , but achieving the necessary lens - to - focal plane distance in a pocketable device would result in one frightfully lumpy pocket .
A lens does n't only let in light - in most cases , the more the merrier - it also carefully collimates that light , adjusts for chromatic aberration , and ensures that no geometric image distortions occur at varying zoom lengths .
Until the laws of physics change , you 're not going to get quality zoomable lenses into a thin , tiny device .
And let 's not even talk about " digital zoom , " which even a rank amateur photographer soon discovers is a cruel pixelating joke .
We 'll pass over the the hardware - software processing component of a DSLR versus a camera phone for now , seeing as how most pro photographers - unless they 're on a heinous deadline - prefer to shoot in raw mode .
When " shooting raw , " pure pixel data is read from the image sensor and stored on the memory card , to be retrieved later and manipulated by a far more - powerful PC or Mac with dedicated image - editing software .
While OmniVision has announced a 6.35 mm , 5 - megapixel raw CMOS image sensor , the OV5647 , the overwhelming majority - if not all - current cameraphones provide images in compressed JPEG format , despite some kludges being available .
JPEG images are plenty good for snapshooting and even advanced amateur photography , but if you want total control over such image niceties as white balance , effective exposure , fill light , lens corrections , and the like , raw is the way to go .
And if you want raw , you want a DSLR - or , at minimum a high - end pocket camera such as the Canon Power Shot G11 .
You do n't want a cameraphone .
Vanjoki was , however , accurate in one of his Helsinki comments : " It will not take long , less than a year , when phones can record HD quality video and you can transfer it directly to your HD television set . "
With small - sensor pixel counts increasing and the power required to operate them decreasing , he may very well be correct .
It will , however , be crappy - looking HD video . ®
EXCLUSIVE : Universal is making a deal to finance and distribute The Man With The Iron Fists , a stylized martial arts film that will mark the feature directorial debut of RZA , the Wu - Tang Clan co-founder who has written the screenplay with Eli Roth .
RZA will play the title character , a blacksmith who forges weapons for the inhabitants of a village in feudal China .
They are forced to defend themselves , and before you know it , everybody is kung fu fighting .
Roth will produce with Strike Entertainment ’s Marc Abraham and Eric Newman .
RZA will also produce the soundtrack .
The film shoots in September in Hong Kong at a budget under $ 20 million .
Roth , the Hostel helmer who made an acting splash playing the Bear Jew in Quentin Tarantino ’s Inglourious Basterds , does n’t know if he will bring his baseball bat and play a part in this film , but said that Iron Fists was forged under the creative godfathering of Tarantino and has the stylized period vibe present in Kill Bill .
“ It started with a trip RZA and I took with Quentin to Iceland in 2005 , ” Roth said .
“ We flew back , ended up snowed in in Boston , staying at my parents ’ house in Newton .
Turned out that my dad and RZA grew up in Brooklyn and went to the same Brownsville junior high school and swam in the same public pool .
He hooked me on his dream of directing and reinventing the Kung Fu movie genre .
It reminded me of my love of horror .
RZA went to the set of Kill Bill , and got a master directing course from Quentin .
Nothing was happening with the script , and I formed this company , Arcade , with Eric Newman , that made Last Exorcism , a film that comes out in August through Lionsgate .
We were looking for projects and I suggested RZA ’s script .
I wrote the latest draft with him .
While I was away shooting Inglourious Basterds , RZA went to China to shoot test footage on his own , with all the choreography .
It was very visual and I think he will bring to life a script that mixes kung fu with a spaghetti Western mindset and a hip hop influence .
“ RZA has imagined every tribe , every fighting style , every costume , ” Roth said .
“ He knows kung fu like I know horror . ”
Update :
The search for truth goes on : yesterday morning , I blogged a study from the Cornucopia Institute on the use of the neurotoxin hexane in production of soyburgers , which sparked a controversy n the comment thread about the science , focusing mostly on the question of whether any of the volatile hexane would still be present after the burgers made it to your shelf .
For the record : I 'm dubious about this objection , since in the absence of a study to the contrary , I think it makes sense to assume that the substances you put into food during production are still present at consumption .
And of course , the release of hexane into the environment as part of the production of these " healthy alternatives " undermines the whole cause of improving health .
I posted a followup last night , after Xeni emailed me with a tip that the Cornucopia study had been funded by an agriculture think - tank / lobbying group called the Weston A Price Foundation .
Based on that tip , I believed that I 'd been had — just another example of a corporate subsidized " science " that concludes that the company 's products are just dandy ( or that its competitors ' wares are bad for you ) .
But I was wrong .
I 've just spoken to Kiera Butler from Mother Jones , who has followed up with Cornucopia .
Cornucopia promises that the Price foundation did not fund its research ( and further , that none of its research is ever substantially funded by any concern or individual ) , and the principal researcher repeated her concern that there is no evidence that the hexane boils off before consumption , and that in any event , " health food " companies have no business emitting terrible toxic waste into the atmosphere ( here 's her update ) .
And I agree .
And we were wrong .
Xeni and I offer our sincerest apologies to both Cornucopia and the Price Foundation for publishing inaccurate information .
Looks like I got spoofed : the study in this morning 's post about neurotoxins in soyburgers turns out to have been funded by an anti-vegetarian , pro-meat lobbying group , the Weston A Price Foundation .
These are also the folks who say lard is good for you .
Maybe the science is good , maybe it is n't ( read the comments for good debate on it ) , but I sure feel a lot more suspicious about it than I did this morning .
( Thanks , Xeni ! )
Protests outside Dail Eireann this morning over UK case against the Irish state
The British Government ’s Business Secretary , Lord Voldemort , today announced that he had “ no choice ” other than to take the Irish government to court for their “ blatant and shameless copyright violation ” of the UK copyright bill , the Digital Economy Act.
Voldemort also branded the Irish Justice Minister , Dermot Ahern , “ a ridiculous leprechaun “ .
In a move which shocked the technology industry and markets today , the UK government made good on its recent promise to aggressively pursue illegal file - sharers and copyright infringers , by slapping a Â£ 30 billion lawsuit on the Irish Government for what it called “ the Irish Government ’s shameless copyright violation ” of the UK ’s Digital Economy Act .
“ This has gone on long enough ” fumed Lord Voldemort at a Whitehall press - conference this morning .
‘ These bastards have been violating our copyright since the early 1920s .’ he raged at gathered journalists .
“ Every time we introduce a piece of legislation before parliament , as sure as eggs is eggs , about three weeks later the Irish are ripping it off , re-packaging it as their own and then crowing about what utter geniuses they are .
Bastards ! ” he added through a volley of spittle .
“ Asbos ?
They stole ’em .
Company law ?
Nicked it .
Tax law ?
Had that they did .
I ’m terribly sorry to say it but enough is enough .
When it gets to the stage when one government is stealing another government ’s legislation on copyright infringement , well , the piss has been well and truly taken .
Ya basta .
This stops here .
You shall not fucking pass ! ”
Lord Voldemort went on to explain that this was only the beginning .
“ We ’re serving notice right here and now that this ridiculous leprechaun in the Irish justice ministry has gone too far and we intend to sue the bastard until he quite literally stops breathing .
And before any of you yellow - tie wearing , Nick Clegg - loving fairies raise an objection , as I understand it we ’ll probably be doing the Irish a favour “ .
The Irish Goverment has yet to comment , but a Blather source close to Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern disclosed there is some confusion over whether the copyright legislation had been sourced from Wikileaks or Pirate Bay .
More as we get it .

“ WITH iPods and iPads and Xboxes and PlayStations — none of which I know how to work — information becomes a distraction , a diversion , a form of entertainment , rather than a tool of empowerment . ”
In a speech to students at Hampton University on May 9th , Mr Obama did not just name - check some big brands ; he also joined a long tradition of grumbling about new technologies and new forms of media .
Socrates 's bugbear was the spread of the biggest - ever innovation in communications — writing .
He feared that relying on written texts , rather than the oral tradition , would “ create forgetfulness in the learners ' souls … they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves . ”
Enos Hitchcock voiced a widespread concern about the latest publishing fad in 1790 .
“ The free access which many young people have to romances , novels and plays has poisoned the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promising youth . ”
( There was a related worry that sofas , introduced at the same time , encouraged young people to drift off into fantasy worlds . )
Cinema was denounced as “ an evil pure and simple ” in 1910 ; comic books were said to lead children into delinquency in 1954 ; rock 'n'roll was accused of turning the young into “ devil worshippers ” in 1956 ; Hillary Clinton attacked video games for “ stealing the innocence of our children ” in 2005 .
Mr Obama is , at least , bang up to date with his reference to the iPad , which now joins the illustrious list of technologies to have been denounced by politicians , and with his grumbling about the crazy theories circulated by the combination of blogs and talk radio .
But such Luddism is particularly curious in Mr Obama 's case , given that he is surgically attached to his BlackBerry , his presidential campaign made exemplary use of the internet , and he has used YouTube to great effect to deliver his message directly to viewers , circumventing the mainstream media in the process .
Presumably all those are examples of good information ( the empowering sort ) rather than bad ( the distracting or misleading sort ) .
This distinction , of course , is bogus .
Anybody who has ever taken a meeting knows that trying to hold the attention of people with BlackBerrys is like trying to teach Latin to delinquent teenagers .
And the devices Mr Obama denounces have many constructive uses .
Lectures , language lessons and course materials are among more than 250,000 educational audio and video files available on iTunes .
iPads and their ilk may yet turn into a practical alternative to textbooks .
Video games are widely used as educational tools , not just for pilots , soldiers and surgeons , but also in schools and businesses .
And Larry Katz , a Harvard economist , suspects that video games and websites may have kept the young and idle busy during this recession , thus explaining the surprising lack of an uptick in crime .
Devices and desires
Mr Obama complained that technology was putting “ new pressures on our country and on our democracy ” .
But iPods , iPads and suchlike are not to blame for the crazy theories — about , for instance , politicians ' birth certificates — that circulate in the blogosphere .
People have always traded gossip : the internet just makes it easier and quicker .
The culprit is human nature , not technology .
And new communications technologies tend to strengthen democracy , not weaken it , as revolutionaries have known ever since Thomas Paine and others used the printing press to argue for American independence .
At least Mr Obama got one thing right : the idea that educating people is the best way to enable them to adapt to technological change , and use it for good .
But technology is not an alternative to education and empowerment ; it can , in fact , help deliver them .
America 's first web - savvy president should understand that .
Bared teeth are a prominent and eye - catching feature on many historical and archaeological artifacts , and are commonly interpreted as representing death , aggression and the shamanic trance .
But a study in the forthcoming issue of Current Anthropology argues that the bared - teeth motif often expresses something a bit less sinister : the smile .
Alice V. M. Samson , Faculty of Archaeology at Leiden University , the Netherlands , and Bridget M. Waller , Department of Psychology , University of Portsmouth , examined the bared - teeth motif ( BTM ) of the Taíno , who lived in the Greater Antilles ( the Caribbean ) from AD 1000 to the early decades of European contact ( 1492 -1550 ) .
Here the BTM was used on bodily adornments and items associated with healing and shamanic practices , usually as part of decorations depicting human and animal faces .
Interpretations of the BTM by early European observers reflect a western religious and cultural worldview rather than an understanding of indigenous practices .
Some of these interpretations stem from eyewitness accounts of the first European observers , who feared the indigenous people and their idols .
They described the BTM as " diabolical and associated with ferocity or aggression or the expression of malevolent deities who need to be appeased . "
These interpretations have never been challenged and as a consequence , the bared - teeth motif has mostly been interpreted negatively .
However , Samson and Waller argue that the negative interpretation misses the mark .
" Exposed and clenched teeth are not common features of the universal facial expression of anger , which is instead characterized by widened eyes , tensed lower eyelids , and lowered , furrowed brows , " they write .
" Studies of facial expression in human and non-human primates have shown that the bared - teeth expression is used in social contexts as an unambiguous signal of non-aggression , affiliation and benign intent . "
The Greater Antilles were home to several different societies .
Samson and Waller believe that pendants and other adornments that carried the BTM " acted as a sort of Taíno social grammar , allowing the indigenous peoples of the islands to engage with each other and facilitating interactions while retaining their differences . "

Doctors say scars will be concealed A team of 30 Spanish doctors say they have successfully performed the world 's first full face transplant .
A man injured in a shooting accident received the entire facial skin and muscles - including cheekbones , nose , lips and teeth - of a donor .
The man is recovering well after the 22 - hour operation , said a spokesperson from Vall d'Hebron University Hospital .
Another 10 face transplants have been carried out around the world , but this is believed to be the most complex .
Hospital spokesperson Bianca Bont told the BBC : " This is the first total face transplant .
" There have been 10 operations of this kind in the world - this is the first to transplant all of the face and some bones of the face . "
Face transplants
Face from dead donor is removed in four hour operation Veins , arteries , skin , muscles , and bones are taken
The patient is anaesthetised partway through surgery on the donor and any previous skin grafts are removed
The donor face and accompanying blood vessels are stitched to the patient using complex microvascular surgery
The man was operated on in March , but details of the operation have only just been revealed .
He had been left unable to breathe , swallow , or talk properly after an accident five years ago .
He was considered for a full face transplant after nine previous operations failed .
A team of 30 experts carried out the operation on 20 March at the hospital in Barcelona .
The man has since seen himself in the mirror and was calm and satisfied , the leader of the medical team , Joan Pere Barret , told a news conference .
' Achievement '
The first partial face transplant was carried out by doctors in Amiens , France , in 2005 .
Isabelle Dinoire , a 38 - year - old woman who had been mauled by her dog , received a new nose , chin and lips .
Doctors revealed details at a news conference Hospital )
Since then partial face transplants have been carried out in China and the US .
British experts say the Spanish operation may be the most complex yet .
It appears to include more bone and much more of the lower part of the face .
A spokesperson for the UK's Facial Transplantation Research Team , which has ethical permission to carry out a full face transplant , said it was " a tremendous achievement " .
" This appears to be the most complex facial transplant operation carried out so far worldwide , " he said .
" It once again shows how facial transplantation can help a small number of people who are the most severely facially injured and for whom reconstructive surgery cannot and has not worked . "
HOW SURGEONS REBUILT PATIENT'S FACE 1 .
Patient lost jaw , nose and other parts of his face in shooting accident .
2 . Donor 's facial skin , muscles , nose , cheekbones , teeth and jawbone used to rebuild patient 's face .
Metal plates used to support new facial structure , which included reconstructing the roof of the mouth .
3 . Donor 's nerves , blood vessels and skin connected to patient .
Patient will have to take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of his life .

Labour is battling to avoid a disastrous third place in next week 's election , according to the latest Guardian / ICM poll .
It suggests Labour support – 28 % in today 's poll – has not yet hit bedrock and could fall below 20 % .
The ICM figures show the Liberal Democrats ' surge is sustained , with all three party scores identical to last week 's Guardian / ICM poll .
The Conservatives retain a narrow three - point lead on 33 % ahead of the Lib Dems on 30 % .
Labour is close behind on 28 % .
Compared with the most recent ICM poll , published on Sunday , Conservative support is down two , Labour up two and the Lib Dems down one – but those movements are small and all results are within the margin of error .
Support for other parties is eight points , with no sign of an advance by the Greens or Ukip .
Conservative support is at the same level as the party achieved in the 2005 general election and would leave the party far off a majority .
That will add to anxiety within the Tory campaign .
On today 's figures , Labour could theoretically become the largest party in parliament despite coming third in votes .
In practice it is likely to lose more seats than uniform national swing suggests .
Today 's poll shows Conservative support is holding firm , with 83 % of supporters saying they do not expect to change their mind before polling day .
By contrast , only 69 % of Lib Dems and 68 % of Labour voters say they will stick with their current choice .
Almost a third of people supporting Labour say they might end up backing another party instead .
If that happens , Labour 's vote would fall to a minimum of 18 % .
Its maximum potential vote – all current supporters plus people who say they may decide to back it – is 33 % .
That is three points lower than the party achieved in 2005 .
By contrast , the Tory minimum is 27 % , and maximum 37 % – a level which would probably give the party a small majority .
The Lib Dems vote is the most volatile : the party 's minimum current support is 23 % and its maximum 40 % – which if achieved would give the party first place in votes if not seats .
Some people who say they support the Lib Dems also say they are far from certain to vote , and some did not vote at the last election .
Figures for party support are weighted to reflect the likelihood of each party 's supporters actually turning out on the day .
Nick Clegg is thriving as the party leader least tainted by spin and most associated with political change .
But many voters are sceptical of his ability to lead a government and see voting Lib Dem as a protest against the other parties .
Overall , 58 % agree with the statement " the Liberal Democrats represent something new and different " , against 37 % who disagree .
That includes 56 % of current Labour supporters and 39 % of Conservatives .
The Lib Dems are appealing most of all to young voters – 64 % of 18 - 24 s think the party is different .
Pensioners are the least impressed , with only 49 % agreeing .
Meanwhile , 40 % of all voters say they can imagine a Liberal Democrat government led by Nick Clegg as prime minister , while 55 % say they cannot .
Lib Dem supporters overwhelmingly see Clegg as a potential PM : 80 % say he could run the country .
But only 16 % of Conservatives and 31 % of Labour supporters agree .
However voters reject the idea that the Lib Dems are only a protest party : 51 % reject the idea .
There is also evidence that the bandwagon effect is helping the party pick up votes : 31 % of all voters , including 26 % of Labour supporters , say knowing that other people are switching to the Lib Dems encourages them to do the same .
However Clegg 's party lags behind on policy .
On the economy , the subject of this week 's final leaders ' debate , the Tory team of David Cameron and George Osborne are narrowly ahead of Labour 's team of Brown and Alistair Darling , 30 % to 29 % .
Clegg and Vince Cable are third , picked by 23 % .
Among Liberal Democrats ' supporters , 21 % think the Labour team is better placed to run the economy .
That tight race is reflected in the battle over cuts : 50 % say spending should start to fall now ( up four since March ) while 44 % say it should not ( down four ) .
Supporters of cuts now narrowly outnumber opponents , but only Conservative voters are in favour .
Most Labour and Lib Dem voters do not want immediate cuts , suggesting Cameron may not pick up support if he repeats his call for them in the debate .
Finally , there is some sign Cameron is recovering support : 38 % say he is campaigning best for people like them , up five on last week .
That is nine points ahead of Brown but nine behind Clegg , who leads on 38 % .
Meanwhile 35 % say Cameron is the most competent potential prime minister ( up three ) , against 29 % who say Brown and 22 % Clegg .
The Lib Dem leader is overwhelmingly seen as the most honest leader : only 17 % say he is more spin than substance ( up four on last week ) against 24 % who say Brown ( down five ) and 44 % who say Cameron , unchanged .
ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1031 adults aged 18 + by telephone on 23 - 25 April 2010 .
Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults .
ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules .
The heat is finally getting to the Vatican because they finally posted guidelines on their website to add some clarity on the issue of how they should handle sex abuse case .
An issue that should not need any clarity at all .
The Vatican responded Monday to allegations that it had concealed years of clerical sex abuse by making it clear for the first time that bishops and other high - ranking clerics should report such crimes to police if required by law .
Victims have charged that the Catholic Church created what amounted to a conspiracy to cover up abuse by keeping allegations that priests raped and molested children secret and not reporting them to civil authorities .
The Vatican has insisted that it has long been the Catholic Church 's policy for bishops , like all Christians , to obey civil laws .
In a new guide for lay readers posted on its Web site , the Vatican explicitly spells out such a policy .
'' Civil law concerning reporting of crimes to the appropriate authorities should always be followed , '' the Vatican guidelines said .
That phrase was not included in a draft of the guidelines obtained Friday by The Associated Press .
The rest of the guidelines follow previously known and public procedures for handling canonical investigations and trials of suspected abuse ... read on The Vatican offered no explanation for the addition .
Does n't that make everyone feel so much better ?
Ross Douthat actually tries to make the case that the new Pope is better than the old Pope because the abuses happened under his watch .
The church ’s dilatory response to the sex abuse scandals was a testament to these weaknesses .
So was John Paul ’s friendship with the Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado , the founder of the Legionaries of Christ .
The last pope loved him and defended him .
But we know now that Father Maciel was a sexually voracious sociopath .
And thanks to a recent exposé by The National Catholic Reporter ’s Jason Berry , we know the secret of Maciel ’s Vatican success :
He was an extraordinary fund - raiser , and those funds often flowed to members of John Paul ’s inner circle .
Only one churchman comes out of Berry ’s story looking good : Joseph Ratzinger .
Berry recounts how Ratzinger lectured to a group of Legionary priests , and was subsequently handed an envelope of money “ for his charitable use . ”
The cardinal “ was tough as nails in a very cordial way , ” a witness said , and turned the money down .
Sorry , no sale .
So Ratzinger did n't take an envelope with cash .
The fact that he was handed an envelope stuffed with money shows how the Catholic church was operating like a group from a Mario Puzo novel rather than a religious institution .
And MoDo makes sense in her latest column about being a woman and living as a Catholic .
Worlds Without Women
When I was in Saudi Arabia , I had tea and sweets with a group of educated and sophisticated young professional women .
I asked why they were not more upset about living in a country where women ’s rights were strangled , an inbred and autocratic state more like an archaic men ’s club than a modern nation .
They told me , somewhat defensively , that the kingdom was moving at its own pace , glacial as that seemed to outsiders .
How could such spirited women , smart and successful on every other level , acquiesce in their own subordination ?
I was puzzling over that one when it hit me :
As a Catholic woman , I was doing the same thing .
I , too , belonged to an inbred and wealthy men ’s club cloistered behind walls and disdaining modernity .
I , too , remained part of an autocratic society that repressed women and ignored their progress in the secular world .
I , too , rationalized as men in dresses allowed our religious kingdom to decay and to cling to outdated misogynistic rituals , blind to the benefits of welcoming women ’s brains , talents and hearts into their ancient fraternity .
To circumscribe women , Saudi Arabia took Islam ’s moral codes and orthodoxy to extremes not outlined by Muhammad ; the Catholic Church took its moral codes and orthodoxy to extremes not outlined by Jesus .
In the New Testament , Jesus is surrounded by strong women and never advocates that any woman — whether she ’s his mother or a prostitute — be treated as a second - class citizen .
Negating women is at the heart of the church ’s hideous — and criminal — indifference to the welfare of boys and girls in its priests ’ care .
Lisa Miller writes in Newsweek ’s cover story about the danger of continuing to marginalize women in a disgraced church that has Mary at the center of its founding story : ... read on .
Growing up a Catholic and reading all this new information about sexual abuse cases and how the church poobahs did their best to cover them up again has infuriated me .
I thought I could n't get any angrier than I was the last time , but that 's not true .
And if their behavior indicates one thing --- it will be that I 'll be staying mad for a very long time .
McConnell has been burning up the news wires lately to complain that Democrats are overtly partisan :
So what 's behind McConnell 's sudden burst of partisanship ?
He blamed the Democrats , saying that the White House told them to stop cooperating with Republicans over how to police the market for derivatives , the complex financial instruments that helped trigger the global debacle .
Several powerful interests that deal in derivatives , including energy , financial and agricultural groups , are wary of the Democrats ' plan .
That is SUCH a huge shock to me !
Major corporations are worried about financial reform hurting their bottom line ?!
Hurry !
Hurry !
Bring the smelling salts , quick !
I may faint here !
From the same McClatchy article above :
" The White House is running everything with this bill , and they 've decided to take a political tack , " said Tripp Baird , once an aide to former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott , R - Miss .
" What you 're seeing from McConnell is we 're not going to be a part of this .
Republicans have finally seen the light after health care . "
/ big breath
HA ! BWA HA HA HA HA HA !
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !
/ grasping stomach
HA HA HA HA !
OO WEE BOY HA HA HA HA FUCKING HA I'D BE CRYING IF I WASN'T LAUGHING HERE !
/ wipes tears
Also :
" He 's raising money from investment bankers and hedge fund managers in return for policy , " said Larry Forgy , a Lexington , Ky. , political observer and attorney .
" I have always felt these decisions of a major policy nature should not be combined with fundraising campaigns as he appears to be conducting in New York .
I do n't think the average person in Kentucky has a damn bit of sympathy for hedge fund managers . "
Just who is this alarmingly sexy senator , this McConnell fellow from Kentucky , you ask ?
Well , I 'll tell ya !
He 's a draft - dodger
After induction at Fort Knox , Kentucky , McConnell was released early from his active - duty military service in August 1967 .
John Cooper , a U.S. Senator from Kentucky ( for whom McConnell had interned ) wrote a letter in August 1967 to the commanding general at Fort Knox , asking when McConnell would be " cleared " from active duty so as to attend New York University .
and a corporate whore
McConnell is also well known for his opposition to campaign finance regulation on First Amendment grounds .
He argues that regulations reduce participation in political campaigns and protect incumbents from competition .
He spearheaded the movement against the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act ( known since 1995 as the " McCain–Feingold bill " and from 1989 – 1994 as the " Boren–Mitchell bill " ) , calling it " neither fair , nor balanced , nor constitutional . "
His opposition to the bill culminated in the 2003 Supreme Court case McConnell v. Federal Election Commission and the 2009 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission .
and a war monger
The minority leader is a strong supporter of the war in Iraq .
He supported giving George W. Bush the authority to wage the war in 2002 , backed the 2007 troop surge and has consistently blocked measures to rescind the president ’s authority to use force .
" If the Senate does n't support the mission in Iraq , it has only one option , and that 's to decide whether or not to fund that mission , " McConnell said .
He has also continued to push measures that would fund the war without setting a timeline for withdrawal of U.S. troops , calling a timeline a " surrender deadline . "
and a tone - deaf " master " strategist
The question now is how much of an enduring gain Republicans might get from Mr. McConnell ’s blocking strategy .
For all his efforts , Democrats could very well pass a health care overhaul in the next week .
( heh ) While he has drawn sharp ideological contrasts that have rallied conservatives after their Congressional defeats in 2006 and 2008 , Mr. McConnell is a long way from capturing control of the Senate in November .
More fundamentally , Mr. McConnell ’s strategy has left Republicans at risk of being tagged as pure obstructionists and a party without a positive agenda .
and a little weasel
Last week , Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R ) squared off in a debate with Democratic challenger Bruce Lunsford .
But on Lunsford 's podium a GOP operative had placed a small voice recorder , presumably to pick up some off - mic comments Lunsford might make -- apparently a violation of the debate rules .
( The recorder itself -- sans recording -- was eventually returned . )

Second - tier types would do well to follow some of the trailblazing efforts in recent years of Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao .
Take a look , for example , at the walls of your own building or even your own floor .
Not long ago there were , by one count , 130 or so photos on the second - floor executive offices of the Labor Department headquarters .
These depicted workers in various professions .
Now there are basically the same number of photos , but 58 of them include a shot of the secretary out there on the job , we 're told .
and a corrupt bastard .
The Department of Justice ( DOJ ) has an ongoing investigation into British defense contractor , BAE Systems , concerning allegations that the company bribed members of the Saudi Royal family , including the Saudi Ambassador to the United States , in support of an arms - for - oil barter .
The United Kingdom ’s Serious Fraud Office ( SFO ) , which was also investigating BAE over those same allegations of bribery , dropped the investigation when ordered to do so by then Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2006 , amid concerns that it would tread too close to members of the Saudi Royal family and endanger national security .
Approximately half of BAE ’s business is now done with the United States government , but the decision of the SFO to drop its investigation into the company has hampered the DOJ probe .
The United States government lodged two official diplomatic protests over the scuttling of the SFO ’s investigation .
The Austrian government , is expected , however , to bring charges in connection with its investigation of BAE .
That investigation concerns the action of an Austrian aristocrat who secretly worked for the defense contractor and made " aggressive incentive payments to key decision - makers . "
For fiscal year 2010 , Sen. McConnell requested three earmarks for BAE worth a combined $ 17 million dollars .
The requests are for various gun assemblies manufactured by BAE at its Louisville , Kentucky facility .
Since the third quarter of 2008 , employees of BAE Systems have donated $ 3,400 to Sen.
McConnell ’s campaign committee .
I 'd include more in this bio of sorts , but my head is starting to hurt and I like Senator McConnell now even less than I did when I started this diary , 3 hours ago .
Which was exactly 0 % before I started , and he's now polling with Shiz at - 15 % .
I have a headache .
Also , if you can answer my question in the title , succinctly and efficiently , you 'll receive a big smooch from me and a lifetime supply of Turtle Wax !

Specific dioxins derived from the antibacterial agent triclosan , used in many hand soaps , deodorants , dishwashing liquids and other consumer products , account for an increasing proportion of total dioxins in Mississippi River sediments , according to University of Minnesota research .
The study appears online in the May 18 issue of the journal Environmental Science and Technology .
The researchers , from the university 's Institute of Technology ( soon to be College of Science and Engineering ) , found that over the last 30 years , the levels of the four dioxins derived from triclosan have risen by 200 to 300 percent , while levels of all the other dioxins have dropped by 73 to 90 percent .
In April , the Food and Drug Administration announced it would study the safety of triclosan , which has been linked to disruptions of hormonal function and may also play a role in the evolution of bacterial resistance to antibiotics .
In papers published in 2003 and 2009 , university civil engineering professor William Arnold and his colleague Kristopher McNeill , a former professor in the university 's Department of Chemistry , discovered that triclosan , when exposed to sunlight , generated a specific suite of four dioxins .
In the current study spearheaded by Jeff Buth , a recent Ph.D. graduate in chemistry ( supervised by Arnold and McNeill ) , the researchers examined sediment core samples from Lake Pepin , an enlargement of the Mississippi River 120 miles downstream from the Minneapolis - St.
Paul metro area .
The sediment cores , containing a record of pollutant accumulation in the lake for the past 50 years , were analyzed for triclosan , the four dioxins derived from triclosan , and the entire family of dioxin chemicals .
The study was a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of Minnesota , Pace Analytical ( Minneapolis ) , the Science Museum of Minnesota and Virginia Tech .
" These four dioxins only come from triclosan .
They did n't exist in Lake Pepin before triclosan was introduced , " Arnold said .
" In the most current sediments , these triclosan - derived dioxins account for about 30 percent of the total dioxin mass . "
Triclosan was first added to commercial liquid hand soap in 1987 , and by 2001 about 76 percent of commercial liquid hand soaps contained it , researchers say .
About 96 percent of triclosan from consumer products is disposed of in residential drains , leading to large loads of the chemical in water entering wastewater treatment plants .
Triclosan is incompletely removed during the wastewater treatment process , and when treated wastewater is released to the environment , sunlight converts some of the triclosan ( and related compounds ) into dioxins .
Triclosan and the dioxins ended up in Lake Pepin sediments by sticking to organic particles in the river , which then sank when they reached the calmer waters of the lake .
The toxicity of the dioxins derived from triclosan currently is not well understood , nor is the extent of their distribution in the environment at large , Arnold says .

BP has challenged widespread scientific claims that vast plumes of oil are spreading underwater from its blown - out rig in the Gulf of Mexico .
The denial comes as the oil giant prepares for a new operation to put an end to the worst oil spill in US history – which could see the leak get worse before it gets better .
The company 's challenge to several scientific studies is likely to put it further at odds with an increasingly angry Obama administration , which has accused it of playing down the size of the leak in an effort to limit possible fines .
BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , said it had no evidence of underwater oil clouds .
" The oil is on the surface , " he said .
" Oil has a specific gravity that 's about half that of water .
It wants to get to the surface because of the difference in specific gravity . "
Hayward 's assertion flies in the face of studies by scientists at universities in Florida , Georgia and Mississippi , among other institutions , who say they have detected huge underwater plumes of oil , including one 120 metres ( 400 ft ) deep about 50 miles from the destroyed rig .
BP 's claim is likely only to further anger environmentalists and the White House , which has grown increasingly suspicious of the company 's claims to be frank and transparent on developments .
The president 's environmental adviser and director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy , Carol Browner , has accused BP of misstating the scale of the leak .
" BP has a vested financial interest in downplaying the size of this , " she said on CBS television .
" They will pay penalties at the end of the day , a per- barrel per-day penalty . "
Ed Markey , chairman of the House of Representatives environment committee , has also accused BP of underplaying the scale of the disaster and suggested that it may have a criminal liability .
" The fine that can be imposed upon them is based on how many barrels [ pour in to the sea ] .
It could wind up in billions of dollars of fines , " said Markey .
" They had a stake in low - balling the number right from the beginning .
They were either lying or they were incompetent . "
In the White House , under increasing criticism for not taking charge of the effort to stop the spill , some officials are saying they have been misled by the company or kept in the dark at key moments .
The Politico website reported that the Obama team was incensed that the company failed to inform it for a day and a half after suspending the failed " top kill " operation to plug the spill using rubber tyres and mud .
Obama is expected to hold his first meeting today with the leaders of an oil spill commission he established to make policy recommendations about US offshore oil drilling .
The commission will be similar to those that looked into the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986 and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 .
Also today , US attorney general Eric Holder will meet federal prosecutors and state attorneys general in New Orleans .
It will be Holder 's first trip to survey the damage before what legal experts believe will be a criminal investigation into the disaster .
The dispute between the administration and BP comes as the company readies its latest effort to contain the flow of oil in to the sea , following the failure of top kill .
The new plan involves an intricate operation to cut the top off the damaged riser that brought oil to the surface of the destroyed rig .
The intention is to create a flat surface to which to attach a valve that would divert the oil into a pipe and on to a ship .
But slicing the top off the damaged pipe may result in oil flowing into the sea at a faster rate until the new valve is fitted .
Even if successful , the operation would only limit , not entirely stop , oil from flowing into the sea .
If this measure failed , BP 's best hope of halting the oil would remain the drilling of a relief well that would ease the pressure on the damaged one .
But the US government has warned that the spill could continue into August .
The attempts to stop the oil flow have been given added urgency by the start of the hurricane season tomorrow .
Forecasters are predicting an unusually high number of storms over the next six months .
If the oil is still spread across the sea , a hurricane is likely to disperse it over a much wider area and push it deeper into marshlands and other inland areas , making the environmental disaster even worse .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is predicting between eight and 14 hurricanes this season , with perhaps a similar number of smaller storms .
The US military has ruled out taking charge of the operation to stem the flow of oil from the blown - out BP rig .
The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , today said that military chiefs had looked at the available equipment and concluded that " the best technology in the world , with respect to that , exists in the oil industry " .
A day earlier , the former US secretary of state , Colin Powell , said the military should step in because the crisis was now " beyond the capacity " of BP to stop .

EXCLUSIVE : Quaids In Court , Case Continued – They Get Served With Lawsuits
Ich bin seit einer Woche in Griechenland ( ein Nebenprodukt der Reise liest man hier ) , und einer Sache war ich mir sicher :
Die unterirdische Qualität der Berichterstattung in Deutschland über die Krise lag aus meiner Sicht auch daran , dass die deutsche Presse in der Post - Korrespondenten - Ära einfach zu wenig oder gar keine Leute im Land hat , zu wenig Experten , zu wenig Journalisten , die ihre Geschichten nicht einfach voneinander abschreiben .
Denn es gibt in Deutschland nur eine handvoll Kollegen , die von diesem komplizierten Land eine Ahnung haben ( aus dem Stand fallen mir ein : Gerd Höhler , Niels Kadritzke , Eberhard Rondholz , Michael Thumann und Christiane Schlötzer ) .
Sie berichten deshalb kein bisschen weniger kritisch , aber auf der Grundlage von Tatsachen , nicht von den
Thesen , die sich manche Redaktionen mit einem eher begrenzten Blick auf die Welt ausdenken .
Wenn Journalisten vor
Ort sind und sich ein Bild von der Lage machen können , selbst mit Menschen sprechen und wirklich wissen wollen , was passiert , dann – das habe ich mir vorgestellt – ist die Griechenland - Krise immer noch eine Herausforderung , aber eine für einen Journalisten beherrschbare .
Aber ich habe mich getäuscht .
Heute morgen lese ich auf Spiegel Online eine Geschichte mit der Überschrift „ Sanierungspaket : Griechen verzweifeln an der Schuldenkrise “ .
Der Reporter berichtet aus Athen .
Aus dem Fünf - Sterne - Hotel Grande Bretagne schräg gegenüber dem Parlament , um genau zu sein , und er hat tatsächlich mit einem Griechen gesprochen : Einem Kellner im Restaurant auf der Dachterrasse des Hotels .
Sollte er das Gebäude je verlassen haben , dann findet sich dafür kein Hinweis in seinem Text .
Eine „ beispiellose Serie von Protesten “ steht seiner Recherche nach bevor , und dafür gibt es zwei Indizien in seinem Text : Zum einen die Zusammenstöße zwischen Demonstranten und der Politei am 1 .
Mai , die natürlich auch die Bebilderung des Textes hergeben , und eine repräsentative Umfrage , nach der fast 86 Prozent der Griechen sich „ unsicher fühlen “ .
Dass gleichzeitig je nach Umfrage zwischen 70 und 80 Prozent der Griechen das Sanierungspaket für alternativlos halten bleibt unerwähnt .
Ich hätte nicht einmal erwartet , dass sich der Reporter die Demostration mit eigenen Augen aus der Nähe ansieht .
Ich kann verstehen , dass eine Horde aufgebrachter Männer , deren Sprache man nicht versteht , einen Reporter Abstand halten lassen .
Aber vielleicht hätte ein Blick auf die roten Fahnen der Demonstranten genügt , um sich einen zweiten Gedanken darüber zu machen , wer da demonstriert .
Einen Hinweis darauf gibt er selbst : „ Raus , IWF “ sei „ jetzt schon auf etlichen Plakaten in Athens Stadt zu lesen “ .
Die Gewerkschaften hätten für Mittwoch zu einem Streik aufgerufen .
Tatsächlich heißt das Bündnis , das zu diesen Streiks aufruft und die Demonstrationen organisiert PAME ( es ist eine Abkürzung , das Wort bedeutet aber auf griechisch „ gehen wir “ , hier in etwa im Sinne von „ auf geht ’s “ ) .
Und PAME bezeichnet sich selbst als „ Militante Arbeiterfront “ und als „ Allianz der klassenbewussten Gewerkschaften in Griechenland “ .
Sie gehört zu stalinistischen kommunistischen Partei KKE , die jedes Programm jeder Regierung als Angriff des Kapitals auf das Proletariat begreift .
Und , muss man es sagen , sie repräsentiert nicht die Mehrheit der Bevölkerung .
Von ihnen auf den Seelenzustand „ der Griechen “ zu schließen ist vergleichbar mit dem Versuch , aus den Mai-Krawallen in Berlin - Kreuzberg und im Hamburger Schanzenviertel Rückschlüsse auf die Meinung der deutschen Bevölkerung zu ziehen .
Es ist falsch .
An der SpOn - Geschichte haben zwei Journalisten gearbeitet .
Ich weiß nicht , ob einer von ihnen Griechisch spricht ( der Name des zweiten , unter „ Mitarbeit “ geführten Autoren ist an sich türkisch , aber es gibt sehr viele Griechen mit türkischen Namen .
Lange Geschichte ) .
Aber das wäre nicht einmal nötig gewesen : PAME veröffentlicht ihre Pressemitteiliungen regelmäßig später auch auf Deutsch .
Man müsste es nur wissen wollen .
Recherche auf der Dachterrasse eines Luxushotels reicht da nicht aus .
PS .
Um noch ein Positiv - Beispiel zu geben ( und tatsächlich ebenfalls auf SpOn ) : Hier beschreibt Gerd Höhler die Gründe der Krise sehr gut – und das vor anderthalb Jahren !
Preeclampsia is a high blood pressure syndrome in pregnant mothers that is caused when the blood supply in the placenta of the developing baby is restricted .
The blood - deprived placenta releases factors that cause the raise in blood pressure in the mother .
Doctors have to monitor these women closely and they may be forced to deliver the baby early to protect the mother and the baby .
Most women 's blood pressure returns to normal levels after they deliver the placenta .
A Risk With Benefits
Women that develop preeclampsia paradoxically seem to have reduced incidence of developing breast cancer .
But why this serious condition may have other beneficial effects is unknown .
Anne Gingery of the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at the University of Minnesota Medical School , Duluth , MN , has investigated how specific factors released from the placenta of women with preeclampsia inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells .
Gingery is presenting her latest findings at the 2010 Experimental Biology meeting in Anaheim , CA from April 24 - 28 .
Her presentation is entitled " Soluble Endoglin Inhibits Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation . "
Dr. Gingery 's research uses a rat model with preeclampsia , which they induce by restricting the blood flow to the rat 's placenta with clips .
The placenta has many blood vessels , so the factors released during preeclampsia end up in the blood stream .
The serum -- what is left after the cells are filtered out of the blood -- of these animals possesses anti-cancer properties .
Gingery tested an array of breast cancer cells treated with the serum that resulted in decreased growth of cancer cells .
The Factors Involved
Gingery studies two factors released during preeclampsia : s Flt - 1 and soluble endoglin .
s Flt - 1 is a soluble version of a protein called VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) , which regulates the growth of cells .
The other factor , soluble endoglin , is a co-receptor for TGF -β ( transforming growth factor beta ) .
The TGF -β pathway controls growth and Gingery proposes that soluble endoglin inhibits cell growth by reducing the signaling of this pathway .
The TGF -β signaling pathway is an important factor in breast cancer development and progression .
According to Gingery , at the early stages of cancer this pathway often suppresses tumor growth , but in advanced cancer it can actually promote cancer progression .
Things Are Complicated : The Factors Only Protect the Mothers
Gingery 's work expanded to look at the pups born from mother rats with preeclampsia .
Surprisingly , the preliminary results reveal that the pups born from the mother 's with preeclampsia are more likely to develop breast tumors .
The group is examining the time it takes to develop tumors and the characteristics of the tumors .
On - going research is evaluating whether the mothers with the preeclampsia will have a reduced incidence of breast tumors .
Gingery speculates that perhaps the factors released during preeclampsia affect the stem cells of the mammary gland in some way that changes how the cells develop , which may affect protection against cancer .
But she reiterates that this research is in its early stages and much is still unknown .
By studying the affects of preeclampsia on the protection against breast cancer , Gingery hopes to identify new targets that can be used in prevention and the development of therapeutics .
" Preeclampsia is not a condition we want any mother to endure , " explains Gingery .
" We are simply using a unique way to find factors to be used for care and treatment of cancer .
Sometimes it just takes looking at a question differently . "
LUCKNOW : Darul Uloom Deoband , the self - appointed guardian for Indian Muslims , in a Talibanesque fatwa that reeked of tribal patriarchy , has decreed that it is " haram " and illegal according to the Sharia for a family to accept a woman 's earnings .
Clerics at the largest Sunni Muslim seminary after Cairo's Al - Azhar said the decree flowed from the fact that the Sharia prohibited proximity of men and women in the workplace .
" It is unlawful ( under the Sharia law ) for Muslim women to work in the government or private sector where men and women work together and women have to talk with men frankly and without a veil , " said the fatwa issued by a bench of three clerics .
The decree was issued over the weekend , but became public late on Monday , seminary sources said .
At a time when there is a rising clamour for job quotas for Muslims in India and a yearning for progress in the community that sees itself as neglected , the fatwa , although unlikely to be heeded , is clearly detrimental .
Even the most conservative Islamic countries , which restrict activities of women , including preventing them from driving , do not bar women from working .
At the peak of its power , the Taliban only barred women in professions like medicine from treating men and vice versa .
But there was a never a blanket ban on working , although the mullahs made it amply clear that they would like to see the women confined to homes .
The fatwa , however , drew flak among other clerics .
" Men and women in Sharia are entitled to equal rights .
If men follow the Sharia , there is no reason why women can't work with them , " said Rasheed , the Naib Imam of Lucknow 's main Eidgah Mosque in Aishbagh .
Mufti Maulana Khalid Rasheed of Darul Ifta Firangi Meheli -- another radical Islamic body which also issues fatwas -- criticized the Deoband fatwa as a retrograde restriction on Muslim women .
The fatwa was in response to a question whether Muslim women can take up government or private jobs and whether their salary should be termed as `halal ' ( permissible under the Sharia ) or `haram ' ( forbidden ) .
Well - known Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad , however , justified the fatwa .
" Women in Islam are not supposed to go out and earn a living .
It 's the responsibility of the males in the family , " he said .
" If a woman has to go for a job , she must make sure that the Sharia restrictions are not compromised , " he added , citing the example of Iran , where Muslim women work in offices but have separate seating areas , away from their male counterparts .
In Lucknow , a city with strong secular and progressive traditions , where Muslim families train their daughters to be doctors , engineers and executives , there was a sense of shocked disbelief even in conservative quarters that such a decree could come from those who consider themselves to be advocates of the community .
" I am also a working woman and also ensure that my Sharia is not compromised , " said Rukhsana , a lecturer at a girl 's college in Lucknow and a member of the executive committee of All India Muslim Personal Law Board ( AIMPLB ) .
" It 's not necessary that one would have to go against the Sharia when going to work . "
" Name one Islamic country which does not have a national airline and does not hire airhostesses ?
If I know correctly , even the Saudi Airlines has hostesses and they do n't wear a veil , " said Shabeena Parveen , a computer professional in the city .

Meditation research explores how the brain works when we refrain from concentration , rumination and intentional thinking .
Electrical brain waves suggest that mental activity during meditation is wakeful and relaxed .
" Given the popularity and effectiveness of meditation as a means of alleviating stress and maintaining good health , there is a pressing need for a rigorous investigation of how it affects brain function , " says Professor Jim Lagopoulos of Sydney University , Australia .
Lagopoulos is the principal investigator of a joint study between his university and researchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ( NTNU ) on changes in electrical brain activity during nondirective meditation .
Constant brain waves
Whether we are mentally active , resting or asleep , the brain always has some level of electrical activity .
The study monitored the frequency and location of electrical brain waves through the use of EEG ( electroencephalography ) .
EEG electrodes were placed in standard locations of the scalp using a custom - made hat
Participants were experienced practitioners of Acem Meditation , a nondirective method developed in Norway .
They were asked to rest , eyes closed , for 20 minutes , and to meditate for another 20 minutes , in random order .
The abundance and location of slow to fast electrical brain waves ( delta , theta , alpha , beta ) provide a good indication of brain activity .
Relaxed attention with theta
During meditation , theta waves were most abundant in the frontal and middle parts of the brain .
advertisement
" These types of waves likely originate from a relaxed attention that monitors our inner experiences .
Here lies a significant difference between meditation and relaxing without any specific technique , " emphasizes Lagopoulos .
" Previous studies have shown that theta waves indicate deep relaxation and occur more frequently in highly experienced meditation practitioners .
The source is probably frontal parts of the brain , which are associated with monitoring of other mental processes . "
" When we measure mental calm , these regions signal to lower parts of the brain , inducing the physical relaxation response that occurs during meditation . "
Silent experiences with alpha
Alpha waves were more abundant in the posterior parts of the brain during meditation than during simple relaxation .
They are characteristic of wakeful rest .
advertisement
" This wave type has been used as a universal sign of relaxation during meditation and other types of rest , " comments Professor Øyvind Ellingsen from NTNU .
" The amount of alpha waves increases when the brain relaxes from intentional , goal - oriented tasks .
This is a sign of deep relaxation , -- but it does not mean that the mind is void . "
Neuroimaging studies by Malia F. Mason and co-workers at Dartmouth College NH suggest that the normal resting state of the brain is a silent current of thoughts , images and memories that is not induced by sensory input or intentional reasoning , but emerges spontaneously " from within . "
" Spontaneous wandering of the mind is something you become more aware of and familiar with when you meditate , " continues Ellingsen , who is an experienced practitioner .
" This default activity of the brain is often underestimated .
It probably represents a kind of mental processing that connects various experiences and emotional residues , puts them into perspective and lays them to rest . "
Different from sleep
Delta waves are characteristic of sleep .
There was little delta during the relaxing and meditative tasks , confirming that nondirective meditation is different from sleep .
Beta waves occur when the brain is working on goal - oriented tasks , such as planning a date or reflecting actively over a particular issue .
EEG showed few beta waves during meditation and resting .
" These findings indicate that you step away from problem solving both when relaxing and during meditation , " says Ellingsen .
Nondirective versus concentration
Several studies indicate better relaxation and stress management by meditation techniques where you refrain from trying to control the content of the mind .
" These methods are often described as nondirective , because practitioners do not actively pursue a particular experience or state of mind .
They cultivate the ability to tolerate the spontaneous wandering of the mind without getting too much involved .
Instead of concentrating on getting away from stressful thought and emotions , you simple let them pass in an effortless way . "
Take home message
Nondirective meditation yields more marked changes in electrical brain wave activity associated with wakeful , relaxed attention , than just resting without any specific mental technique .

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) -- Former White House chief of staff Karl Rove was heckled and branded a " war criminal ' at a book signing in Beverly Hills , California , on Monday night .
Rove , who served as senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to President Bush , was at the Saban Theater to discuss his new book , " Courage and Consequences : My Life as a Conservative in the Fight , " to an audience of about 100 people who paid up to $ 40 to hear him .
But the audience members were unable to get their copies of the book signed after Rove was shouted down and forced to leave the stage , reported CNN affiliate KCAL - TV .
The event was heated from the onset as several anti-war protesters interrupted Rove 's talk to accuse him and the Bush administration of lying to Americans about the threat Iraq posed to the United States -- and thus , taking the country into war .
Rove called one heckler a " lunatic . "
He told another to " get the heck out of here . "
At one point , Jodie Evans , the co-founder of the anti-war group Code Pink , rushed toward Rove waving a pair of handcuffs and saying she was there to make a citizen 's arrest .
" Look what you did ... you lied to take us to war .
You ruined a country .
You totally ruined a country , " she shouted .
As organizers tried to keep Evans at bay , another woman stood up and yelled , " The only comfort I take is that you 're going to rot in hell . "
Rove , who defended his administration 's stance on several controversial issues in heated exchanges with other critics , said the interruptions reflected the " totalitarianism of the left . "
" They do n't believe in dialogue .
They do n't believe in courtesy .
They do n't believe in First Amendment rights for anyone but themselves , " he said .
The audience applauded .
But as the event went on , the disruptions showed little signs of abating .
Rove then skipped the book - signing portion of the event and left .
Just like Bill Hewlett and David Packard , Janie and Victor Tsao had a garage .
" Everybody starts with a garage , " Janie says .
Hewlett and Packard 's was a tinker 's shed , a rustic hut that to this day whispers of science - fair projects and woodshop dreams .
It 's the epicenter of technology 's sepia - tinged creation myth , the kind of place where you find a stone and brass monument naming it the " Birthplace of Silicon Valley . "
The Tsaos ' garage , on the other hand , sits on a cul - de-sac in the Woodbridge section of Irvine , Calif . -- the preplanned heart of Orange County -- and dominates a khaki - colored house that faces a park dotted with bolted - down picnic tables .
Framed by brick columns and a basketball - hoop crown , the garage speaks of SUVs , recycling bins , and home repair .
It is an unexceptional place : mass market , suburban , retail .
It is in this garage that , in 1988 , Victor and Janie founded the company that would become Linksys , the computer peripheral company whose seven - year run on the Inc. 500 list culminated last spring with its purchase by Cisco Systems for $ 500 million .
And if the Hewlett - Packard garage symbolizes the quintessence of an inventor 's jolting inspiration , the Tsaos ' garage signifies the other side of entrepreneurship , an immigrant story of hard work and calculated risks .
THE ENTREPRENEURIAL
CLOCK
Two decades after emigrating from Taiwan , Janie and Victor Tsao have created , in Victor 's words , a high - tech version of a " mom - and - pop Chinese restaurant , " dividing the work in half and watching costs with the tight fist of someone who turns out the light on leaving a room .
They are both tall and straightforward and they are steeped in the minutiae of their company , even now with 300 employees .
They are frugal but not cheap ( until recently they drove a 12 - year - old car , but it was a Mercedes ) and they are willing to let their company permeate their life to an incredible degree .
" We never set up any systems or boundaries , like not talking about work at dinner , " says Victor .
Most important , they work hard and fast .
They do n't fancy themselves as inventors ; they are popularizers of technology , which means any advantage they have in a price - slashing , commodity market that includes brutal competitors like NetGear and D - Link comes from making the right intuitive leaps , getting out new products a few weeks faster , keeping costs down , and negotiating tough .
Like not a few business owners before them , the Tsaos heard the entrepreneurial clock ticking :
They were determined to be independent before they reached the age of 40 .
Victor was 37 and Janie was 35 when they decided to put to use their familiarity with Taiwan ( where they 'd met at Tamkang University ) .
They were both working in information technology -- Janie at Carter Hawley Hale and Victor at Taco Bell - - and with Victor a step higher on the corporate ladder they decided that he would continue to punch the clock while Janie launched the business , a consultancy they named DEW International .
The new company mated American technology vendors like Northgate Computer with Taiwanese manufacturers that could make their wares cheaply .
Soon , one of those manufacturers brought them an idea .
At the time , the cables used to connect printers and PCs could extend only 15 feet before the data began to degrade .
To solve this , the manufacturer invented a setup that used telephone wire to extend the reach to 100 feet .
This company needed someone to market the thing in the U.S. " With companies like that , " says Victor , " actual English was not their strength . "
The manufacturer came up with products that connected multiple PCs to multiple printers , and the Tsaos renamed their company Linksys .
Victor quit his job in 1991 , and within two years Linksys had moved twice , eventually to a 2,000 - square - foot office , and each month was selling 8,000 Multishares , as those units were called , through tech catalogs like Black Box .
In these early years , the Tsaos invested $ 7,000 in Linksys , the only capital the company required until it tapped a bank loan for the one and only time , in 2001 .
( They paid that loan off in less than six months . )
Linksys slowly expanded from printer - to - PC connectors to PC - to - PC Ethernet hubs , cards , and cords , gear that let small businesses and nerdy households connect computers so that they could share data .
It was a niche market , and with 1994 revenue of $ 6.5 million the company was far from a behemoth .
But slow growth was the only way the Tsaos could expand without taking on debt or investors .
While Victor managed operations and finances as CEO , Janie handled sales in her job as vice president of business development .
As Mike Wagner , the company 's director of marketing , puts it , " Janie brings the money in , Victor keeps everyone from spending it . "
Frugality and a focus on the future were obvious in the Tsaos early on .
While taking M.B.A. classes at Pepperdine in the mid-'80s , Victor met Bob Klein , who recalls Victor telling him that someday he would move to Newport Coast , far tonier than Irvine .
The Tsaos made that dream a reality in 1997 .
Klein and Victor 's first business lunch occurred at the Japanese fast - food chain Yoshinoya -- and they meet at comparable places to this day ( though , Klein says , Victor has taken to picking up the check ) .
Indeed , on the night the Cisco purchase was announced , there was no celebration .
Instead , Victor ate a $ 5 dinner box at his desk .
" It was n't good at all , " he admits .
With the birth of Linksys , Victor took to working 100 hours a week , with occasional naps on the office floor .
He involved himself in every part of the business , dealing with U.S. operations during the day and Taiwanese manufacturers at night , and his employees still know him for his 3 a.m. e-mails .
He drew no salary until the mid-'90s -- he refers to the preceding years as the " Linksys Peace Corp " era-- while the couple and their two boys got by on Janie 's salary of $ 2,000 a month .
Linksys operated with comparable leanness .
Calvin Liu , a designer who Victor calls " Mr. Linksys Look and Feel , " first worked for the company as a freelancer in 1991 .
As it still does , Linksys produced its own graphics .
Liu would photograph the products , scan the photos , send them to the printer , and later glue the labels to the product boxes .
Linksys caught a crucial break in 1995 .
Until that point , tying computers together with Linksys gear required installing software .
But when Microsoft moved from Windows 3.1 to Windows 95 , it built in networking functions .
Suddenly it was simple for small offices and homes to operate networks .
Instantly Linksys ' potential market expanded .
Janie attacked sales with tenacity .
She went to the opening of a Fry's Electronics store and watched in fascination as customers with full shopping carts queued up a dozen deep at the cashiers .
" That really opened my eyes to the potential of retail , " she says .
By 1995 , Linksys was in Fry 's and revenue almost doubled , to $ 10.7 million .
Still , if catalogs like Black Box and regional chains like Fry 's were good , national retailers were better .
They promised the big score .
The problem was that they were nearly impossible for a tiny company to crack .
Janie wanted to get Linksys into Best Buy , but she called for months to no avail .
Then , in April 1996 , she attended RetailVision , a trade show intended to introduce manufacturers to retail buyers .
Janie set her sights on Best Buy , and when she was n't able to make contact with Best Buy 's buyer -- Wayne Inouye , now CEO of eMachines -- at the scheduled sessions , she and a sales associate tracked him right to his hotel room door .
They presented to Inouye right in his room and , amazingly , he ordered just under $ 2 million of gear .
Janie kept cool until she made her way from Best Buy 's offices to her rented car .
Then , in a move that is difficult to imagine for this sensible , focused woman , she started to scream .
NO SECRETS , NO GENIUS
Revenue doubled to $ 21.5 million in 1996 , then leapt to $ 32.1 million in 1997 and $ 65.6 million in 1998 .
Linksys moved its headquarters to a 20,000 - square - foot office .
But success did not lead to extravagance .
To this day , Victor and Janie file vacation forms like anyone else and all new employees -- even executives -- must endure a 90 - day waiting period for benefits .
No one is allowed to work from home , with the exception of a small mobile sales force .
" Victor and Janie are willing to let good talent walk away if they 're not the right fit , " says the company 's human resources head , Niki Lee .
" We could get the best VP of marketing out there and if Victor and Janie realize that he 's not hands - on , he wants an admin [ administrative assistant ] , and he only wants to give orders and not be in the trenches , then they just wo n't deal with it . "
Not surprisingly , this lean , fast , hard - working environment , coupled with a pay scale that in Lee 's words is not " top dollar , " leads to a young work force ( average age : 27 ) and high annual revenue per employee ( about $ 1.8 million per full - time employee , compared with about $ 560,000 for Cisco ) .
More surprising is that annual turnover is only 5 % , compared with an industry average of 9 % , according to Mercer Human Resources Consulting .
Glen McLaughlin , vice president of North American sales for Linksys , attributes this to a culture in which employees are allowed to run their own projects .
" We 'll give you enough rope to either hang yourself or be successful , " he says .
McLaughlin tells of Victor and Janie letting him switch from 15 regional to three national product distributors in 1996 even though they doubted his rationale .
Other than e-mails from Victor demanding updates , they did not meddle .
Luckily for McLaughlin , it worked .
" Victor and Janie really like to see people execute , " says Mike Wagner .
" They 're not afraid to weed people out . "
As home broadband Internet use began to bloom in the late '90s , at costs significantly higher than those for dial - up connections , Victor realized that people were going to want to hook all their small - office or home computers to one line .
To do so they would need a router , a high - tech cord splitter allowing multiple computers to hook into one modem .
These already existed -- Cisco was making its living off them -- but at $ 500 and up they were too expensive and complicated for a non -techie home .
So Victor ordered up the product that proved to be the turning point for Linksys : a $ 199 four - port router that employed an easy browserlike program to lead people through installation .
After introducing the product at a trade show in late 1999 -- the first sub -$ 300 consumer router to market by three months -- Linksys exploded .
The company 's share of the networking market leapt from 10.8 % in 1999 to 18.6 % the following year , according to NPD TechWorld , an organization that tracks trends and consumer sales in the industry , and revenue went from $ 107.6 million to $ 206.5 million .
" They invented consumer home networking , " says Steve Baker , an NPD analyst .
The introduction of the four - port broadband router was in perfect tune with Linksys ' personality .
The decision to go with it was based on intuition and listening to manufacturers , not drawn - out market studies .
Liu handled the product design in - house , the price was cheap , and the technology was off - the - shelf .
It was not a futurist 's invention but an obvious technology made easy .
" Everyone knew in the late '90s of the broadband explosion , " Victor says .
" It was n't really a secret . "
" I wo n't say Victor has a vision for 10 years , " says Liu .
" But I think he has a vision for two , which gives you a good chance to be successful if you do the right things . "
With the industry 's eyes on them , Janie and Victor had to keep running .
Janie continued to sign up catalogs , distributors , and retailers ( the list now runs from Amazon.com to Radio Shack ) .
Victor kept introducing products around the four - port broadband router -- products such as cards that allowed laptops to connect to routers -- while he looked for the next big thing .
He found it in wireless networking .
The only thing better than letting people connect all their computers to one modem was to let them connect without a cord .
In January 2001 , several months after a wireless transmission standard called 802.11 b ( or , less clumsily , Wi - Fi ) was finalized , Linksys launched a system of wireless routers and computer cards .
Though Linksys was n't first out of the gate this time , the brand was embedded in consumers ' minds , and in 2001 Linksys revenue and market share jumped to $ 346.7 million and 34.2 % , respectively .
Again the Tsaos had capitalized on a known technology by introducing inexpensive products before most of their competitors .
In that way , Victor makes his moves in the open , much as he plays basketball , his only hobby .
According to Roger Bundy , his Taco Bell boss , Victor telegraphs his basketball shots with his eyes .
" Shorter people could block him because he'd announce to the world that he was going to shoot , " Bundy says .
The difference here is that Linksys gets off the shot before its competitors get off the ground .
Liu describes an instance last February when a Taiwanese manufacturer was in town .
Victor asked him to come to a meeting at 10:30 on a Saturday night .
The two men talked about a new design for a small - business product .
The basics were decided that night -- square instead of rectangular , gray and silver instead of blue and black -- and by Monday the design was finalized .
That 's not unusual .
Malachy Moynihan , the company 's vice president for engineering , says Linksys and its Taiwanese partners were recently able to move a product from idea to production in three weeks .
Sometimes Linksys even jumps ahead of itself .
In fall 2002 , while an industry board was finalizing a faster wireless standard called 802.11g , the Tsaos decided that they wanted to have 802.11g products in stores for Christmas , final standards be damned .
After a September meeting with chipmaker Broadcom convinced them that users could easily upgrade the 802.11g chips with free software if the final standard changed , they plowed ahead .
On December 24 , Linksys launched its 802.11g products , beating its competitors by three months .
It sold 300,000 units in the first two months .
Again : no secrets , no particular genius .
The company was fast , frugal , and right , as it had been before .
Victor seems almost proud that his success is not built on something more spectacular .
" There 's not a lot of difference , " he says .
" We all went to business school or read books or listened to lectures .
We all know we need to work hard , make sure capital is coming in , all these things .
Execution is the key . "
Linksys now owns 49 % of the networking market , and Glen McLaughlin says it is aiming for 70 % by 2005 .
Because the brand is so well known , Linksys products fetch a $ 20 or $ 30 premium over competitors ' wares .
" Their dominance is unbelievable , " says CompUSA buyer Doug Lane .
Linksys hit revenue of $ 430.4 million in 2002 , and Ehud Gelblum , a JP Morgan analyst , estimates the company will pull in $ 538 million for the fiscal year ending this June .
But the Tsaos have never stopped sweating the small stuff .
Victor still occasionally answers customer - support calls and Dan Sherman , the Cisco senior vice president who led Cisco 's investigation of Linksys , was shocked when he brought up complaints he'd read on an Amazon.com message board and Victor not only knew the exact problems but had read the same board and responded to several of the posters .
For her part , Janie continues to supply a straightforward approach to negotiating with retailers .
CompUSA 's
Lane describes her sales force as " definitely not shy , " and Todd Magnuson , a buyer at Best Buy , says , " The first time I met Janie , it was a short greeting and right into business .
Very focused and very adamant on protecting their market share . "
She is n't all steel , though .
" Janie impressed me because every year she would call at Christmastime and leave a holiday message , " says John Herr , a former Buy.com buyer who had received plenty of holiday cards before but never a phone call from a company founder .
" It was a nice personal touch . "
STILL DRIVEN
Riding an essentially unbroken string of successes , the Tsaos were n't particularly eager to sell their company .
But it was -- of course - - a practical matter .
More than 90 % of Linksys ' revenue came from the U.S. and Canada , and the company did n't have the cash or the infrastructure to expand overseas .
More important , Dell , HP , and Microsoft are all aiming for the market , and Victor felt certain that eventually somebody would try to crowd Linksys out .
Victor met with bankers from CSFB to examine raising money with a public offering .
CSFB instead suggested a sale , and Victor agreed to consider it .
The attraction for Cisco Systems was obvious :
With a huge share of big - business networking but no small - business and home - office products , Cisco was hungry for a retail company .
Cisco contacted the Tsaos in fall 2002 , and by March 2003 a deal had been announced .
Cisco would pay $ 500 million in stock for the company , which , except for a small employee stock option plan , was owned by Janie , Victor , and their two sons .
As part of the deal , the Tsaos agreed to stay on for two years and Cisco agreed to let the company remain a standalone unit , something it had never done in its 80 other acquisitions .
" Going forward , their biggest risk is that they stop being Linksys and become Cisco , " says NPD 's Baker .
Victor says he wants to quit if that happens , but so far little seems different .
Except for six Cisco transplants , the executives are the same , and the decision - making speed remains that of a small company .
Mike Wagner describes going to the company 's new vice president general manager , a Cisco exec named Tushar Kothari , with plans for a $ 600,000 German ad campaign .
" Within four days he had made the decision , " Wagner says .
" Maybe it 's not one hour , but it 's not six weeks .
He 's definitely got the spirit . "
Linksys has started to sell an 18 - product collection of wireless networking devices , including a wireless router and a wireless adapter that lets people link televisions and stereos to a network so MP3 songs can be streamed from computer to stereo and chosen on TV .
And Cisco has launched Linksys offices in China , India , Australia , Hungary , and Italy , and has made it possible , for the first time , for Linksys to advertise on national cable and broadcast television .
As for Janie and Victor , they 're traveling more to open new markets and Victor is saying he plans to retire in five years and maybe teach , a claim no one believes .
" If there 's a contest for the most boring couple in Orange County , " says Janie , " I think Victor and I would win . "
Victor is now 52 , Janie 50 , and the company has been their life for 15 years .
Victor says he has no significant regrets , except in one area : his children .
His sons are now in college .
Sometimes Victor managed to play basketball with his boys , but too often , quality time together took the form of the kids coming to the warehouse on Saturdays to help ship products .
That 's what 100 - hour weeks will do .
" From age 13 to 15 , they just shot up , taller and taller , " says Victor .
" Whoa , what happened ? "
But the family tries .
Victor started to delegate more two years ago , and he 's down to about 70 hours a week .
Last February he even found time to hook up a home network at his own house .
The Tsaos have even taken a vacation .
Last May the family took a car tour of the Grand Canyon .
" For four days , " Victor says .
" The four of us just drove . "
Linksys '
Irvine headquarters is a modest , two - story structure in a pedestrian - unfriendly office park where people walk in the street because there is a dearth of sidewalks .
Desk - high scuffmarks circle the walls where temporary tables were erected at a time when workers had to cram two to a cubicle , before Linksys opened its new warehouse and call center in 2001 .
An ad hoc photography studio overlooks the old warehouse space , where overflow customer service reps were once housed in temporary heated tents .
In the back , Janie sits in a windowless office unadorned save for four art prints and neat piles of manila folders .
In the front , a temporary divider splits the office that Victor shares with Kothari .
Wearing a monogrammed white button - down , Victor looks surprisingly lively -- considering that less than 24 hours before , he and Janie had returned from a four - day trip to Taiwan .
The trek had started after a sleepless night ( he 'd worked through until morning , with only a 20 - minute break to pack ) and came four days after he'd returned from another 10 - day Asian excursion .
Victor 's dark office is as unadorned as Janie's , except for a burst packing box on the floor and an AARP cord taped to his monitor in a mocking gesture at age .
Soon Cisco will move the headquarters to something grander .
That suburban garage may become legendary yet .

Thanks for visiting !
I 'm at a friend 's wedding this weekend , traveling with my own husband and kids .
The wedding invitation labeled the event as a “ triumph of hope over experience ” .
It is that , and I 'm honored to be invited as a witness .
But it 's also a business arrangement , something I 'm sure my friend ( a respected economist ) is well aware of .
I have n't pried into the monetary details of their union , but I 'm sure they 've talked about it .
There are myriad good approaches to the business of marriage .
J.D. often mentions that he and his wife , Kris , do n't share finances .
By contrast , my husband and I have completely merged our money : Both of our names are on every bank account , asset , and debt we have .
We share every penny , and every decision about what to do with those pennies .
Whether you choose to go all in like we did or hold onto your independence , you live with your spouse 's spending choices — for good or ill .
If you have kids , they 'll inherit the fruits of your shared financial life .
And while research suggests money is n't as responsible for divorce as many experts believe , it can certainly sour goodwill in a relationship .
Trust me on this one .
The really dangerous part is to pretend marriage that marriage has nothing to do with money .
Of course , that 's exactly what nearly every aspect of our culture encourages us to do .
I 've never seen a romantic comedy about a happy couple who fall madly in love as their hands touch at the customer service counter and they realize they 're cashing in the exact same rebate coupon .
Lovers in literature do n't stare deeply into one another 's eyes and murmur sweet nothings about their checkbook balances .
In fact , we 're taught to ignore the financial side of choosing a mate .
Literature and popular culture are full of romantic tales of giving up the wealthy suitor for the poor beloved .
Our language offers an array of derogatory terms like “ gold - digger ” to define someone who cares about their sweetheart 's net worth .
But the bottom line is that we ignore the business side of marriage at our peril .
The day my husband and I got married , the Commonwealth of Massachusetts legally merged our financial lives .
Many states do this , assuming an equal sharing of assets and debts in a marriage .
You can create a prenuptial agreement that will define how assets are divided in the event of a divorce , but to do so you have to acknowledge both the financial side of saying “ I do ” and the reality that half of marriages end in divorce .
Given how driven by romantic love most of our marriages are , it 's perfectly understandable that most couples do n't go to this extreme .
To set a good financial foundation for your future , here are five things you should do before you get married :
Know thyself .
Before you share the details of your bank accounts with your lover , be sure you know them yourself .
If you have debts , know the total amount you owe , and what interest rates you pay on it .
Know where your assets are and what they 're worth .
Your intended should love you regardless of your net worth , but you 'll both need to grapple with that number eventually .
Better to be up front .
Know your partner .
When you 're both in a calm , happy place , sit down together and share your financial information .
Try to be open and non-judgmental about your partner 's financial history and your own .
There 's no need to feel guilty for being in debt , having more money in your savings account than your partner , or having a spotty credit history , but you do need to be honest .
It might help if both of you can think of financial issues as just another challenge of a life together .
You can embrace your partner 's lousy credit and attempt to help him recover in the same way that you could support him in recovering from an illness .
Know your habits
Even if you do n't routinely track your spending , consider doing so together or separately for 3 months before you tie the knot .
You 'll get good information about your spending habits , and if you can share the information you 'll both have a better idea of what you 're in for and what challenges might lie ahead .
Know what you want .
As J.D. so emphatically and elegantly says in Chapter 2 of Your Money : The Missing Manual , the path to wealth is paved with goals .
You need to have some .
Your marriage will be better if those goals are ones you and your partner create and pursue together .
A lot of marriages suffer when couples discover several years in that their long - term visions do n't line up .
If you know your goals include homeschooling five kids , you 'd better make that clear to your spouse .
You do n't want to find out his priority is staying child - free and sailing around the world in a hand - built sailboat after you 've walked down the aisle .
Know how to get there .
Even a single evening spent establishing financial goals can do you tremendous good as a couple .
Better is to have a clear roadmap of how to achieve those goals .
How much do you need to save to pay for that boat ?
How many years until one of you leaves the workforce to become a stay - at - home parent ?
Of course , not all of life 's big events arrive through careful planning .
But laying out a path lets you live and spend with intention from your first days together .
It also gives you more flexibility to handle emergencies and surprises as they come up .
For tips on how to keep communicating well throughout your years together , read my earlier article How To Talk With Your Spouse About Money .
Starting off well will pay dividends in joy and wealth for your whole life together .
That 's a wonderful wedding gift for the person you love .
One little postscript on weddings :
You 'll be married for much longer than you 'll be enjoying your wedding cake .
If you can , sail off on your honeymoon with no wedding - related debt .
My husband and I eloped together over a long weekend in Vermont .
I think the entire project set us back less than many couples spend on invitations .
Seven years later , we 're still happily married while we 've watched couples who got hitched in more style split up .
Do you have any pre-wedding tips or additional ideas on what you need to share based on your own experiences ?
We 'd love to hear them in the comments below !
It 's hard to believe we 've probably seen the last of Fernando Pisani in an Oiler uniform .
He played nearly 300 fewer Oiler games than Todd Marchant .
Scored almost a hundred points fewer than even Kelly Buchberger .
He was n't here forever and he was never a superstar when he was .
He came , he saw , he did n't particularly conquer .
Yet it would be a mistake to let him leave without expressing some appreciation for what he did .
The playoff run of 2006 , when Pisani found a gear we did n't know he had and scored fourteen goals in twenty - four games .
His rookie campaign in 2002 - 03 , coming out of nowhere to score eight goals in the regular season , one more in the playoffs , and even snaring a hat trick against the Washington Capitals .
Or the way he went from the picture of consistency to the picture of frustration : one snap of the ankle November 17 , 2008 against the Red Wings that knocked him out just long enough for ulcerative colitis to bring him down the next two years .
He never had a Cup , never had an individual award , never even won a team skills competition .
He never had a nickname ; at least , not one that stuck : " Pisser " was too irreverant , " San Fernando " perhaps too much the opposite .
A nickname was not necessary , in the same way that an Oilers fan would never refer to " the Great One " or " Moose " before they became memories rather than players .
He was Fernando Pisani .
Any further term of affection would be redundant .
Even the most devout lovers of the splendid # 34 would call him a terrific , if not quite elite two - way forward , somebody who could shut down another team 's best players and pop the occasional goal himself but aside from one glorious spring never the finest player on his team .
But he resonated in the way that a mere star never can , more than Dustin Penner or Ales Hemsky possibly could , partially because of that mortality and partially because of that Glenn Anderson - esque performance when the team needed him most .
The word " clutch " is an epithet in these parts sometimes , dismissed as the result of small sample sizes and misremembered moments blown up into trends .
To hell with that .
Fernando Pisani was clutch .
I do n't know what else to tell you .
What was it that drew us to Pisani ?
A soft - spoken man , seldom making himself known off the ice , not a big scorer , not a big checker , not the sort of flashy player overpaid and underthinking commentators make into MONSTERS and designate for idolatry ?
He was us .
Only 6 ' 1 " and 201 pounds pre-colitis he was no linebacker .
Drafted so late the round he was picked in no longer exists .
Spent four years at Providence College after coming up from the Alberta Junior Hockey League .
Many of us have known guys with Pisani 's career path until his early twenties .
Some of you had it .
But most people grow up and abandon dreams for reality .
Fernando did n't .
He got those little ghosts of a chance , and each time he seized them .
Three years as a Hamilton Bulldog , playing on some solid teams and making his bones as a reliable , no - frills , two - way forward .
He never for a second stopped working hard , never got out of the style of play that made him successful .
Unlike too many defensive forwards before him , a flush of success never convinced him that he was really a scorer and he never made the mistake of playing a style he was n't suited to .
Even the blunders , such as Craig MacTavish 's ill - fated attempt to make him a third - line centre , were forced on him by circumstance .
If I somehow got super powers and became a professional athlete , that 's the sort of athlete I like to think I 'd be .
For three years , Pisani ground out the third line minutes against the best opponents Craig MacTavish could get him up against .
Shawn Horcoff , Michael Peca , Georges Laraque , Ethan Moreau , Marty Reasoner ... who did n't Pisani play with ?
Another non-sticking nickname in those glorious days was " Instant Chemistry " , for he could turn lead into gold like few Oilers since Kurri .
Even Marty Sakic looked like he could earn his forty minutes of ice time a night when Pisani was on his right wing , and Ethan Moreau did n't look so much " young and enthusiastic " as " like Keith Tkachuk on horse steroids " .
Like any modern hero , Pisani also had moments where he transcended mere flesh and blood , when this seeming everyman was weighed in the balances and found exceptional .
His scoring rampage in the 2006 playoffs does not need to be recounted here , for any Oiler fan knows what I 'm talking about without being introduced to it .
Todd Marchant became a hero to a generation for scoring once in 1997 when nobody could have expected it .
Pisani did him thirteen better .
And , unnecessary though it is , let 's look at one of them anyway .
( so many names in that video long gone , and soon one more . )
In the manner of so many heroes , as well , the rise was accompanied by a crashing fall .
Introducing the phrase " ulcerative colitis " to the vocabularies of a million Oiler fans is an achievement of sorts but nothing to match his earlier victories .
Alexander of Macedon wept salt tears that there were no more worlds to conquer : Fernando Pisani had one game left for victory , but fate would snatch from him the chance to take it .
Well , why not ?
Ray Bourque was traded to the Colorado Avalanche for a chance to win his Stanley Cup , but Ray Bourque was just a Hall of Famer .
Fernando Pisani was the common man , and the common man does n't usually win the lottery or hit the big time or catch the lucky break that leads to fame and fortune .
Instead his success is marked by integrity , skill , and determination .
If this is it for Fernando as an Edmonton Oiler , by that measurement he 's one of the most successful we 've ever had .
Protesters responded to a campaign on social networking websites Hundreds of civil society activists have marched on the Lebanese parliament in an unprecedented rally in Beirut .
The protesters are calling on all Lebanese to help bring an end to the country 's divisive sectarian system and replace it with a secular system .
The organisers say it is time to redefine what it means to be Lebanese .
Demonstrators blocked the main road leading to parliament , waving Lebanese flags and chanting " secularism " as security in the city was stepped up .
A leader of the march , which was organised by an independent grassroots movement , Laique Pride , addressed the crowds through a loudspeaker outside the building .
Divided government " Change must come from us , " the organiser said as police set up barricades to prevent protesters from reaching the building in the capital .
" Only we citizens can do this . "
More than 2,000 people joined the march , news agencies reported .
Kinda Hassan , one of the organisers , told Reuters : " We can not live in a country where they divide the chairs of the ministers according to their confessions , not their merits . "
Organisers say being secular in Lebanon comes second to being a Muslim or a Christian , Shia or Sunni , Catholic or Orthodox , the BBC's Natalia Antelava in Beirut reports .
Eighteen groups make up Lebanon 's multi-denominational system , and the civic rights of the members of these groups are determined by their religious leaders rather than the government .
Only religious authorities can register marriages , births or death or rule on matters of inheritance - so all Lebanese end up having different rights .
Muslims , for example , cannot adopt children ; Maronite Christians cannot get divorced , and it is impossible for members of different sects to marry each other , while civil marriage is not an option here .
The government , too , is divided .
Since independence in 1943 , Lebanon 's president has always been a Maronite Christian , its prime minister a Sunni Muslim and speaker of parliament a Shia .
Supporters of this unique system say it gives all the religious communities a voice .
But more and more young people point to its failures - chronic instability , weak central government and sectarian tension which has resulted in civil wars in the past .

The energy needs of the entire human population could potentially be met by converting wind energy to electricity .
While offshore wind power resources are abundant , wind turbines are currently unable to provide steady power due to natural fluctuations in wind direction and strength .
Offshore wind power output can be made more consistent by choosing project development locations that take advantage of regional weather patterns and by connecting wind power generators with a shared power line , according to a paper by researchers from the University of Delaware and Stony Brook University published in the April 5 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Making wind - generated electricity more steady will enable wind power to become a much larger fraction of our electric sources , " said the paper 's lead author Willett Kempton , UD professor of marine policy in the College of Earth , Ocean , and Environment and director of its Center for Carbon - free Power Integration .
The research team -- which also included UD alumnus Felipe Pimenta , UD research faculty member Dana Veron , and Brian Colle , associate professor in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at Stony Brook University -- demonstrated thoughtful design of offshore wind power projects can minimize the impacts of local weather on power fluctuations .
The researchers analyzed five years of wind observations from 11 monitoring stations along the U.S. East Coast from Florida to Maine .
Based on wind speeds at each location , they estimated electrical power output from a hypothetical five - megawatt offshore turbine .
After analyzing the patterns of wind energy among the stations along the coast , the team explored the seasonal effects on power output .
" Our analysis shows that when transmission systems will carry power from renewable sources , such as wind , they should be designed to consider large - scale meteorology , including the prevailing movement of high - and low - pressure systems , " Kempton said .
Colle explained the ideal configuration .
" A north - south transmission geometry fits nicely with the storm track that shifts northward or southward along the U.S. East Coast on a weekly or seasonal time scale , " he said .
" Because then at any one time a high or low pressure system is likely to be producing wind ( and thus power ) somewhere along the coast . "
The researchers found each hypothetical power generation site exhibited the expected ups and downs , but when they simulated a power line connecting them , the overall power output was smoothed so that maximum or minimum output was rare .
In the particular five - year period studied , the power output of the simulated grid never completely stopped .
No wind turbines are presently located in U.S. waters , although projects have been proposed off the coasts of several Atlantic states .
This research could prove useful as project sites are selected and developed .
Reducing the severity of wind power fluctuations would allow sufficient time for power suppliers to ramp up or down power production from other energy sources as needed .
Solutions that reduce power fluctuations also are important if wind is to displace significant amounts of carbon - emitting energy sources , the researchers said .
The study was funded by the Delaware Sea Grant College Program and CAPES , a Brazilian research council .
With Conan O’Brien about to change the calculus of late - night cable programming , the Comedy Central channel has made a move to lock up its two dominant stars , Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert .
The network has signed both hosts — they each attract more young viewers than even the late - night shows on the broadcast networks — to new contracts that will keep them in the 11 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. weeknight slots through the next presidential election in 2012 .
“ That ’s a big deal for us , ” said Doug Herzog , the president of the MTV Networks Entertainment Group , which includes Comedy Central .
“ For us , election years are like Olympic years . ”
The two politically oriented comedy shows hosted by the two stars — “ The Daily Show ” with Mr. Stewart and “ The Colbert Report ” with Mr. Colbert — have both seen big ratings bumps in presidential election years , Mr. Herzog said , “ and some of that carries over each time , so we keep going up . ”
The timing of the new deal was not directly related to the impending arrival in November of Mr. O’Brien , the former NBC late - night star , on the cable channel TBS — but Mr. Herzog noted that his comedy channel could hardly be unaware of it .

PSYCHIC Una Power broke down in tears yesterday as she told an employment tribunal of her shock when a radio station cut her hours and ultimately axed her popular phone - in show .
Ms Power ( 60 ) , who hosted the ' Psychic Zone ' programme on Dublin 's 98 since November 1996 , said she did n't see it coming when the station 's management abruptly cut her hours and then cancelled the show after 12 years on air .
Her twice - weekly show was halved to just one two - hour weekly slot in June 2008 .
The station then cancelled the programme in December 2008 .
Ms Power claims she is still owed € 8,500 in redundancy pay under the Redundancy Payments Act and represented herself at the hearing at the Employment Appeals Tribunal in Dublin .
" It came completely out of the blue , " she told the hearing .
" I was just so stunned .
I had a discussion with the show 's producers a few days before and they urged me to come along to the station 's relaunch , " she said .
But the day after the relaunch , she received a letter from the station 's management advising her that her long - running Friday night show was being cancelled and that she would only present the Sunday night show .
Rebranded
The letter also stated the decision was no reflection of her performance and that her Sunday show would remain intact .
The station , owned by billionaire Denis O'Brien and trading as Radio Two Thousand Ltd , started off as the classic rock station 98 FM .
But it rebranded itself as a pop-music station catering to the 25 - 44 age market and changed its name to Dublin 's 98 in June 2008 .
Ms Power told the panel she was then given two months ' pay , amounting to € 2,500 , which she took as a goodwill gesture from the company in lieu of having her on - air time cut in half .
However , she said the decision left her very " upset and disappointed " .
Ms Power insisted she " did n't want to make a fuss about it " for fear of losing her Sunday night slot as well .
She even thought the Friday night show might be reinstated at a later date .
But her worst fears were realised six months later when she was made redundant .
Ms Power broke down as she recounted her experience to the panel .
" I 'm so sorry .
I feel so embarrassed but I did n't realise I was still so upset about it , " she said .
She claims her redundancy settlement was based on the reduced hours of two hours per week instead of the four hours a week she had worked since 1996 .
The company , represented by solicitor Theresa Howlett , denies her claim .
Ms Howlett -- who tried to have the media excluded from the hearing -- said Ms Power was paid six weeks ' redundancy pay upon cancellation of the show in accordance with the act .
" It 's really a simple issue regarding how to calculate the hours , " she said .
But the panel , chaired by tribunal vice - chairman Dermot McCarthy , reserved judgment , stating the case was " complex " .
Both Ms Howlett and Chris Doyle , the company 's CEO who also attended the hearing , declined to comment .
But after the hearing , Ms Power told the Irish Independent that she took on the " David and Goliath " case as a matter of principal .
" The money is peanuts , but I just thought I did n't want them to get away with it , " she said .
" I loved 98 FM .
They have lovely crews and producers and listeners .
You feel so lucky to be on that show , but the executives have such great power . "
Irish Independent
The complaint has been investigated and
resolved to the customer 's satisfaction CompleteHome — Enrollment scam
CompleteHome and Orchard Bank together are engaging in extremely misleading and false advertising .
I received a " live check " from " Orchard Bank " ( nothing on the exterior about CompleteHome or any other company ) .
I opened the check ( $ 5.00 ) and , again , saw Orchard Bank and nothing in large or regular print about CompleteHome .
So , thinking I was receiving an end - of - the - year refund from my bank , I deposited the check and set aside the literature to read when I got back from work .
When I read through the fine print , I realized the check was an enrollment into CompleteHome and that I would be charge $ 119.99 for this obscure , unclear appliance club , " unless you call [ protected ] to cancel during the 30 - day period , in which case your Orchard Bank credit card will not be charged . "
So , I called the next business day and ended up on hold for a representative and spent half a day trying to get out of the service .
I talked to two reps , a supervisor and I got a lawyer 's ( general ) number before I found an " Executive Supervisor " who helped me .
The others said I did n't have a membership no .
so they cld n't cancel my membership so I 'd have to wait two or three weeks for my packet to arrive and then call to cancel .
I said , why can't I just give you my information and you cancel my membership when the number arrives ?
I also offered to write a $ 5.00 check to the company to refund this " free " check they sent me .
In closing , I 'm still not out of this but the Exec .
Supervisor has promised that I can get out if I call her " directly " ( an 800 number ) in two weeks .
My complaint ?
This is extremely misleading advertising and a trick to get $ 120 and a membership from busy , everyday people .
Some may not read the fine print and end up enrolled and have to try to get out after they are charged .
Other very busy , financially - secure people may NEVER notice this enrollment and end up paying for this " service " for years !!
These types of consumer tricks abound and they should not be allowed .
If the exterior of this check had said " CompleteHome " and not " Orchard Bank , " I never would have cashed it .
As are many working / family people , I 'm extremely busy and should not be " blamed " for not always having time to read fine print on everything that appears to be coming from an institution that I do business with .
Thanks for allowing me to post this complaint .
I hope others will read it and look out for this type of " trick " advertising that takes advantage of consumers .
Turning informant on your fans can be lucrative , if you ’re a shock jock by the name of Hal Turner .
Amid a trial where Turner faces criminal charges for making threats of violence against public servants , he disclosed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation paid him “ in excess of $ 100,000 ” over a five - year period .
Turner , a long - time racist radio host who attracted an audience of white supremacists and neonazis , was first revealed as an FBI informant in 2008 .
After becoming the subject of ridicule on infamous Internet forum 4 chan , Turner was confronted by hackers on his site ’s discussion boards with copies of e-mails he ’d allegedly sent to the FBI , bragging about how he ’d helped in “ flush[ing ] out another crazy . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The arrest came after Turner called for the murder of three judges .
“ Let me be the first to say this plainly : these Judges deserve to be killed , ” he wrote on his Web site , according to MSNBC .
“ He included their pictures , phone numbers , work address and room numbers along with a photo of the courthouse in which they work and a map of its location , the FBI says . ”
“ In gripping testimony on Tuesday , all three Chicago appellate court judges took the stand and said they felt threatened by Turner ’s blog posting … ” NorthJersey.com reported .
The publication also revealed details about Turner ’s compensation on the public ’s dime .
According to Turner ’s lawyer , the shock jock was specially trained to incite fringe individuals .
“ His job was basically to publish information which would cause other parties to act in a manner which would lead to their arrest , ” attorney Michael Orozco said .
Turner ’s famously vile broadcasts began in 2002 , though the one - time Pat Buchanan campaign coordinator did not begin his relationship with the FBI until 2003 .
Before Turner began his work in radio , he was a frequent guest on the Sean Hannity radio show in New Jersey .
Turner ceased broadcasting in 2008 amid an investigation into his increasingly violent rhetoric .

A judge in December declared proceedings against Turner a mistrial after the jury became deadlocked on an argument of whether hate speech is protected under the First Amendment .
The trial was postponed and moved to Brooklyn , where it resumed on March 1 .
Andy 's point was simple .
Older Android devices that can't be upgraded to newer versions of the OS or run newer apps are no different than an iPhone from 2007 not being updated to OS 4 .
It 's not fragmentation -- it 's legacy .
If so , legacy systems are now aging faster than ever before , due to a rate of innovation that has never been seen before in history .
A rate that Google shows no signs of slowing anytime soon .
Does this rate affect Google 's partners who need to produce the devices ?
Absolutely .
The difference is Google believes the partner model is now fundamentally different .
No one pays for Android , and consequently , the partner relationship is n't the same as when vendors pay to license an OS .
One of the issues Microsoft had with Windows Mobile was that as all partners were paying to be part of the ecosystem and license the platform and all were treated equally -- which was n't necessarily a good thing .
Some WinMo vendors produced great devices , while many others produced mediocre devices that made the platform look bad .
Some could n't keep pace with others , forcing Microsoft to sometimes delay key releases so partners could absorb them and create the hardware needed for them .
Android is n't summer camp for handset vendors and not everyone gets a trophy for showing up .
Google has a different view .
Android is n't summer camp for handset vendors and not everyone gets get a trophy for showing up .
Google is treating partners equally , but will not slow the rate of innovation so weaker players can keep up .
By constantly raising the bar , both in terms of reference devices and software , Google aims to keep innovating and drive that innovation as a differentiator .
Google was n't looking for volume sales with the Nexus One , it was looking to raise the hardware bar -- and arguably the best way to do that is to do it yourself .
The net result ?
A pace of innovation that shows no sign of slowing combined with even more reference hardware that keeps raising the stakes of what 's possible .
Keep up or do n't -- what appears to be a fragmented market is merely the result of shortened cycles of innovation .
Older devices seem obsolete faster than before , but this pace also brings speed new innovations to market faster .
Google argues that the reason it does n't permit tablet vendors access to Android Market just yet is to prevent devices that fail comparability tests from actually fragmenting the platform .
The message ?
Keep up -- but do n't try to jump ahead .
I 'd argue perhaps Android is n't fragmented , at least according to the classical definition , but that the practical result is the same .
Devices going obsolete in months and new operating systems released on weekly cycles make it difficult for even Google 's best partners to keep pace .
Worse , users are confronted with a dizzying array of devices , many of which are out of sync from a software perspective at the time of purchase -- causing some to delay purchases in fear of buyer 's remorse or purchase a competing platform .
The open nature of Android is what allows this to happen .
Google wo n't control what partners do with Android , but by constantly raising the bar it controls the platform 's pace as well as the vision .
As with most things , in the end it will be Google 's partners and their customers that will determine whether that pace is acceptable , and that will either become a competitive advantage or provide an opportunity for other platforms to succeed .

[ Editor ’s Note :
As we ’ve noted before , covers are more important for original bands now than they ’ve been in years .
Our newest contributor , Sean McKeown , goes into why ]
Like a haircut , the right or wrong cover choice can make you seem prettier or uglier than you really are .
Choose wrong and you may seem silly , pretentious , lacking chops , or downright offensive .
Choose right and you could make a lot of new fans .
That being said , there are many benefits to playing cover songs for an original band :
# 1 . Covers help introduce your style of music .
Contemporary music has become such a pastiche , with diverse influences and contravening sounds , that it can be hard to latch into music on the first listen .
A cover can serve as a familiar touchstone in the set , letting the audience see you make a song your own , elucidating your band ’s sound .
# 2 Covers make the shows more fun for the audience .
People come to shows to enjoy some exciting new music , of course .
But the conditions are n’t always optimal .
After three opening bands in a poorly lit and ventilated room , anyone ’s attention starts to wander .
Hearing a new take on a familiar song can really rope the audience into your set .
# 3 Covers make the show more interesting for the band .
Usually a band has a predetermined set running anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour .
And if you ’re a new band , this set is comprised of the same songs you ’ve been playing for a year .
As with friends , although you love them , you can grow weary of them after too much time together .
Having some covers hashed out in practice or on the road can give your sets some variety and keep things fun .
# 4 Covers can help with a band deal with the variability of set lengths .
When playing a bill with multiple performers , your set can either be cut short or extended due to circumstance ( and it will be ) .
Having a couple covers in your back pocket does more than keep people in the room .
It makes your band an asset in such scenarios and more desirable for future shows .
# 5 A well - done cover can turn a good show into a great one .
A good show takes many factors – a great set played well , an appropriate venue and an enthusiastic crowd are all key .
But it ’s the little things that push a solid set into the realm of a great one , and make the difference between a forgettable band and a memorable band .
Things like legitimately funny stage banter , outrageous stunts onstage , or costumes and sets that complement the music can keep people coming to your shows even if they ’re not head over heels about the music yet .
Well - chosen covers can function in the same way .
Take for example a Market Hotel show this past February .
Along with headliner Surfer Blood , the bill also featured Beach Fossils , Turbo Fruits , Grooms , and last minute addition The Morning Benders .
Three of the bands – Surfer Blood , Turbo Fruits and the Morning Benders – played covers as parts of their sets .
You can find a few videos of the show here : http://bit.ly/dlakTu.
Morning Benders played a cover of Neil Young ’s “ Bad Fog of Loneliness ” as an encore to a great response from the crowd .
Turbo Fruits ’ excellent high - energy set was capped off with a raucous cover of CCR ’s “ Bad Moon Rising ” that had the whole place belting it out .
And Surfer Blood , deep into their set , teased Weezer ’s “ Undone ” while tuning , and found themselves in an impromptu sing along with the audience .
Moments like these connect the band and the audience and make the night even more memorable .
But when playing a cover , the potential risks are at least as great as the potential rewards .
An overplayed song , an ironic song choice that does n’t resonate , or choosing too popular of a song can suck the energy right out of the room .
Not to mention the ultimate pitfall – what if the cover is far and away the best song you play ?
Still , if you ’re confident both in your set and in your choice of covers , you can make the show more fun and memorable for everyone .
Another fresh shot from Russian parliament “ Duma ” has arrived .

YOU may have heard of RoboCop and Future Cop , but did you know we may soon have our very own Facebook Cop ?
The Australian Federal Police is reportedly pushing for the social networking site Facebook to employ a law enforcement expert in Australia , The ABC reports .
AFP assistant commissioner Neil Gaughan is joining six senior law enforcement officials from around the world in Washington later today for a US Department of Justice meeting about the social networking site , the ABC said .
The ABC reports the AFP wants Facebook to appoint a dedicated officer in Australia to match individual user accounts to internet addresses if they believed they were involved in criminal activity .
Currently , if the AFP wishes to identify a Facebook user , they are required to submit a request via the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters
Act of 1987 which can take up to 18 months to process .
It said the AFP would also push for Facebook 's law enforcement guidelines to match Australian law as well as discuss the possibility of banning anyone under the age of 13 from joining the social network .
The moves would perhaps help stave off crimes such as the death of Sydney teenager Nona Belomesoff , who met her alleged killer via Facebook .
Meanwhile , Facebook has called for a press conference later today ( AEST ) to discuss " enhanced , simpler " privacy controls designed to appease concerns about safeguarding information at the social - networking service .
Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and other senior executives are slated to take part in the briefing , which will be at the firm 's headquarters in the city of Palo Alto , California .
Mr Zuckerberg said yesterday the social network " missed the mark " with its privacy controls and changes were imminent .
" Sometimes we move too fast - and after listening to recent concerns , we 're responding , " he wrote in a column published on the op - ed page of The Washington Post .
Facebook last month sparked criticism from US privacy and consumer groups , US lawmakers and the European Union by adding the ability for partner websites to incorporate data regarding members of the social - networking service .
" The biggest message we have heard recently is that people want easier control over their information , " Mr Zuckerberg said .
" Simply put , many of you thought our controls were too complex .
" Our intention was to give you lots of granular controls ; but that may not have been what many of you wanted , " the 26 - year - old Facebook chief executive said .
" We just missed the mark . "
He stressed that Facebook does " not share your personal information with people or services you do n't want " and does " not give advertisers access to your personal information . "
" We do not and never will sell any of your information to anyone , " Mr Zuckerberg said , adding that Facebook will always remain a free service .

If everyone became vegan and so ate only fruit and vegetables , then the reduction in greenhouse emissions for the whole of food consumption would be a mere 7 % .
The widespread adoption of vegetarianism would have even less impact , while organic food production actually leads to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions .
Those are the conclusions of a research paper published in the journal Progress in Industrial Ecology .
Helmi Risku - Norja and Sirpa Kurppa of MTT Agrifood Research Finland , working with Juha Helenius of the Department of Agricultural Sciences , University of Helsinki , have determined that the cultivation of soil for whatever purpose , whether growing crops or raising livestock is the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions in food production , not fertiliser production , animal husbandry , nor agricultural energy requirements .
The team explains that for current average food consumption , in Finland , emissions from soil represent 62 % of the total emissions .
Greenhouses gases released by cows and sheep account for 24 % , and energy consumption and fertiliser manufacture about 8 % each .
The greenhouse emissions performance for extensive organic production is poor , they explain , despite this approach to farming being considered the " green " option , the lower efficiency requires the cultivation of greater areas of soil , which counteracts many of the benefits .
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through food consumption would require large - scale changes among the entire population , the team points out .
They suggest that rather than stressing the impact of an individual citizen 's dietary choices , we should be paying more attention to social learning and to the notion of working towards food sustainability and security .
In general , sustainable consumption might be possible by introducing services to substitute for material consumption .
Although food itself cannot be substituted , a lot can be done at the household level to improve sustainability of food provisioning and reduce food wastage .
" There is a pressing need to design effective policy measures , " says Risku - Norja .
" Consumer information is important from the viewpoint of food and sustainability education , leading eventually to adopting more sustainable lifestyles in the coming generations , " the team concludes .
Rep. Bart Stupak ( D - MI ) plans to announce his retirement today , Democrats briefed on his decision said .
Stupak , the leader of a pro-life faction within his party , had received death threats and was under intense political pressure after he agreed to support the Democratic health care reform legislation even though pro-life groups insisted that it would allow federal funds to be used for abortion .
Stupak negotiated a compromise with the White House , which resulted in President Obama 's issuing of an executive order clarifying the executive branch 's view of the subject .
For that , Stupak was called a traitor to the pro-life cause .
Stupak has represented Michigan 's first congressional district for 18 years .
He will make public his decision at a press conference later today .
Stupak hinted at this course in a letter to constituents on Wednesday .
His district , representing parts of the state 's upper peninsula , is marginal : President Obama received 50 % of the vote there .
Charlevoix County Commissioner Connie Saltonstall will probably take Stupak 's place as the Democratic nominee , although State Rep. Mike Lahti will appear at Stupak 's press conference today .
The Republican primary may be competitive , too .
Dan Benishek , a doctor who raised $ 200,000 since Stupak 's health care vote , is already running .

Volcano insurers hide behind ' Act of God '
Travellers have accused insurance companies of using an ' Act of God ' defence to avoid paying compensation for personal losses from the volcanic cloud disruption that could top £ 20 m .
Waiting game : Flyers suffer uncertainty over insurance payouts .
Those who have booked flights as part of a DIY package holiday are being offered a refund of their ticket price by their airline , however there is no right to compensation .
Thousands have turned to their insurance company in the hope that they can claim for other losses resulting from flight cancellations , such as car and hotel bookings .
The lack of a standard policy for payouts on damage caused by volcanoes is likely to cause confusion for thousands of ' ash victims ' .
Many travellers have been told by their insurers that they must wait at closed airports on the off - chance that flights are reinstated , or else risk losing any insurance payout .
Emma and Eddie Argyle , who are in their 30s , were forced to make alternative arrangements for their skiing holiday after their flight to Geneva was cancelled and their insurance firm refused to pay .
Mrs Argyle said : ' We rang our insurance company and they said it was an " act of God " , so they wo n't cover us - we 're stuffed . '
However , a spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said : ' There is no " Act of God " exclusion in insurance policies .
The term is usually used in the legal defence sector on the grounds that damage for which you are held liable was caused by circumstances beyond your control .
Insurance policies do not contain such an exclusion . '
He added : ' The policy will set out what is insured and what the main exclusions are .
If loss occurs from an event covered , then the insurer will pay out , in accordance with the terms and conditions . '

With huge deficits , ballooning debts , an aging population , and out - of - control entitlement programs , do you have any doubt about which way tax rates are headed ?
Good .
Neither do we .
But in case you 're not absolutely certain , courtesy of Paul Kasriel at Northern Trust , here 's a snapshot of where taxes ( federal income tax , top bracket ) have been for the past 30 years .
Two quick points :
A modest hike would put us at about average levels .
So do n't go crying about how it 's some crazy new era in which we 're being taxed to death .
A return to the 70s would result in tax hikes for the next generation and lead to a near - doubling of the marginal rate .
THAT would be something to scream about .
One of Paul Kasriel 's points , by the way , is that increasing taxes does tend to act as a brake on economic activity , but not as much as you think .
Other things matter , too :
With regard to tax rates , yes , the top marginal tax rate was coming down - coming down from 70 % ( see Chart 6 ) .
And yes , the top marginal tax rate is likely to rise in 2011 , but not from 70 % but from 35 % .
All else the same , an increase in marginal income tax rates does have negative consequences for economic performance .
But all else seldom is the same .
The economy performed pretty well in the eight years ended 2000 even though the top marginal tax rate was higher in these eight years than it was in the prior eight years .
The economy did not perform better because of the increase in the top marginal tax rate .
Nevertheless , this increase was not sufficient to derail economic progress .
In the eight years ended 2008 , the economy performed relatively poorly despite the lower top marginal tax rate .
The economy did not under - perform because of the marginal tax rate cut .
Nevertheless , the cut in the tax rate was not sufficient to enhance economic performance .
The point of all this is that although tax rates matter , they are not all that matters .
Do drug companies make too much money ?
Imagine being charged with a crime , but an imaginary friend takes the rap for you .
That is essentially what happened when Pfizer , the world ’s largest pharmaceutical company , was caught illegally marketing Bextra , a painkiller that was taken off the market in 2005 because of safety concerns .
When the criminal case was announced last fall , federal officials touted their prosecution as a model for tough , effective enforcement .
“ It sends a clear message ” to the pharmaceutical industry , said Kevin Perkins , assistant director of the FBI ’s Criminal Investigative Division .
But beyond the fanfare , a CNN Special Investigation found another story , one that officials downplayed when they declared victory .
It ’s a story about the power major pharmaceutical companies have even when they break the laws intended to protect patients .
Internal company documents show that Pfizer and Pharmacia ( which Pfizer later bought ) used a multimillion - dollar medical education budget to pay hundreds of doctors as speakers and consultants to tout Bextra .
Pfizer said in court that “ the company ’s intent was pure ” : to foster a legal exchange of scientific information among doctors .
But an internal marketing plan called for training physicians “ to serve as public relations spokespeople . ”
According to Lewis Morris , chief counsel to the inspector general at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , “ They pushed the envelope so far past any reasonable interpretation of the law that it ’s simply outrageous . ”
But when it came to prosecuting Pfizer for its fraudulent marketing , the pharmaceutical giant had a trump card : Just as the giant banks on Wall Street were deemed too big to fail , Pfizer was considered too big to nail .
Why ?
Because any company convicted of a major health care fraud is automatically excluded from Medicare and Medicaid .
Convicting Pfizer on Bextra would prevent the company from billing federal health programs for any of its products .
It would be a corporate death sentence .

Hello everyone ,
This is a post for s390 users to help Gentoo .
Since some months ago the S390 VM ’s we were using for maintaining the s390/ s390 x port were stopped due to a problem with the air conditioner on the room where the machine was running .
So if you or your company are able to provide us an S390 VM , it would be greatly appreciated by the s390 team .
We would need the following :
– SSH access
– At least 10 GB of disk space
Thanks
PS : The Hercules emulator is NOT an option , so please do n’t suggest that .
Update : I ’ve added the requirements we need .

Roadmap to reality
Over the last few years , ECF has been running a process on the transition to a low - carbon economy Europe , in cooperation with a large group of stakeholders in the energy debate .
From Roadmaps to Reality aims to support and progress the thinking around the challenges of the transition of the European power systems from a policy and implementation point of view .
It does so by exploring key questions , identifying key obstacles and mapping out sets of solutions that best supports the decarbonisation of the power sector over different timescales .

Another approach I wanted to explore to Encsé's 9 - digit problem was creating a type - level solution in Haskell .
First I 'll describe what that would entail , and then present a solution to one of its sub-problems : testing special cases of divisibility in a more efficient way than the naïve implementation of repeating subtractions .
Type - level programming
Basically , a type - level Haskell program is to regular Haskell programs what C++ template metaprograms are to C++ proper .
Conrad Parker wrote a great introduction to type - level programming using functional dependencies in issue 6 of The Monad .
Reader journal , titled Type - Level Instant Insanity .
You encode values as types , and then construct an expression whose type , as inferred by the Haskell compiler , encodes the output of your computation .
To actually implement the equivalent of a function , typeclasses are used .
For example , take the following ( value - level ) Haskell definition of length : ( deliberately not using any builtin types , and using unary representation for simplicity ) :
module ValueLength where data Nat = Z | S Nat data List a = Nil | a ::: ( List a ) infixr 6 ::: length :: List a ->
Nat length Nil = Z length ( x ::: xs ) = S ( length xs )
( note that due to technical limitations , both : and :: are reserved names in Haskell , and so we have to use ::: for our cons )
To lift this definition to the level of types , we first need a way to represent actual numbers and lists as types .
This is pretty straightforward using algebraic datatypes .
Since we are ultimately only going to be interested in the type of expressions and not their value , no constructors are defined .
{-# LANGUAGE EmptyDataDecls , TypeOperators , FunctionalDependencies , MultiParamTypeClasses , UndecidableInstances #-} module TypeLength where data Z data S n data Nil data x ::: xs infixr 6 ::: – Continued below
Of course , System F does n't allow for meta - types , only kinds ; so we can't prohibit meaningless types like S Nil or Z ::: Z ( contrast this with the declaration of the S constructor in the first example ) .
Thus , type - level programming in Haskell has to be untyped .
Now comes the clever bit : lifting the definition of length .
Basically , what we are looking for is a way to map types to types .
Typeclasses with functional dependencies are one possibility of achieving this ( type families are another one ) .
First of all , each n - ary operator is rewritten into an n+1 - ary relation between its operands and its result : instead of thinking about length Nil = 0 , we say Nil and 0 are in the relation Length .
We declare a class for each function , and one instance for each equation :
class Length xs n | xs -> n instance Length Nil Z
The xs -> n part of the class declaration is where the magic comes from .
It means that if there are types xs , n 1 and n 2 such that there are instances of Length xs n 1 and Length xs n 2 , then the types n 1 and n 2 must be the same .
To demonstrate why this is useful , consider the following function definition :
liftedLength :: Length xs n => xs -> n liftedLength = undefined
What is the type of liftedLength ( undefined :: Nil ) ?
The declaration of liftedLength says that the answer is whatever type n such that an instance of Length Nil n exists .
But the functional dependency of Length says that there can be at most one such n .
Consulting the list of instances above , we find instance Length Nil Z , and thus , n has to be the type Z .
We can test this using the interpreter GHCi :
* TypeLength > :t liftedLength ( undefined :: Nil ) liftedLength ( undefined :: Nil ) :: Z
So far , so good .
But what about the length of non-empty lists ?
To translate the other equation of length , we need a way to tackle recursion .
Viewing the recursive definition of length through our relational glasses , it is simply an inductive definition of the relation Length :
instance ( Length xs n ) => Length ( x ::: xs ) ( S n )
Again , we can try this out with GHCi , by asking for the length of [ 0 , 0 ] :
* TypeLength > :t liftedLength ( undefined :: Z ::: Z ::: Nil ) liftedLength ( undefined :: Z ::: Z ::: Nil ) :: S ( S Z )
Towards a type - level solution of the 9 - digit problem
Now that the basics are covered , it should be clear what a type - level solution to the original 9 - digit problem should entail .
I 've decided to directly translate Lőry 's solution because it does n't use any fancy infrastructure like list monads .
Take a moment to look at its code because I 'm going to explain what I had to change to write its type - level counterpart .
The first version , using unary arithmetics like in the introduction above , was , unsurprisingly , unusably slow ( anything beyond the 3 - digit sub - problem of the 9 - digit problem was hopeless ) , so I looked around for something better .
Péter Diviánszky pointed me to the type - level package , which , promising enough , features decimal arithmetics .
However , the direct transliteration of the value function that converts from a list of digits into its decimal value , and testing for divisibility using type - level 's DivMod both proved to be highly inefficient .
So instead , I decided to write a faster divisibility checker that exploits the fact that for the 9 - digit problem , the divisor is always less than the base of the representation ( since we 're using base - 10 , and checking for divisibility by 2 , ... , 9 ) .
The basis of the algorithm is how you do division with pen & paper : you take the most significant digit , calculate its reminder , then glue this in front of the next digit , and so on .
Here 's the Haskell code for a very simple implementation of this idea :
q `divides` [ ] =
True q `divides` ( 0:ds ) = q `divides` ds q `divides` ( d:ds ) | d ≥ q = q `divides` ( ( d - q ) : ds ) | otherwise = case ds of [ ] ->
False ( d ' :ds ) -> q `divides` ( (d * 10 + d ' ) :ds )
The repeated subtraction part may seem scary , but we 're only ever glueing digits less than q in front of the next digit , so at most 9 subtractions are needed to eliminate a digit .
To actually lift this algorithm to the world of types requires writing quite a bit of boilerplate code , because the most efficient way to branch on d ≥ q is to write out all the 92 cases .
Fortunately , my girlfriend just wrote a report on Template Haskell for a university assignment the other day , so I learned of its existence and was able to use it to generate most of the instances of my Divides class .
Results
Using this special - case division algorithm , I was able to push the program to 7 digits , but solving the 9 - digit problem proper is still out of reach , as GHC eats up all my memory before dying ( but I 'm curious if it will work , unchanged , on my 7 - Gig box at work ) .
But the 7 - digit problem is still roughly 10,000 times larger than the 3 - digit one , so the improvement is evident .
You can check out the full type - level 9 - digit program ( including the fast divisibility checker ) on GitHub , at http://github.com/gergoerdi/typeprog.
The Gulf of Mexico oil rig disaster will develop into one of the worst spills in US history if the well is not sealed , the coast guard officer leading the response warned .
British Petroleum , which leases the Deepwater Horizon platform , has been operating four robotic submarines some 1,500 meters ( 5,000 feet ) down on the seabed to try to cap two leaks in the riser pipe that connected the rig to the wellhead .
ADVERTISEMENT
But the best efforts of the British energy giant have yielded no progress so far , and engineers are frantically constructing a giant dome that could be placed over the leaks as a back - up plan to try and stop the oil spreading .
Time is running out as a huge slick with a 600 - mile ( 965 - kilometer ) circumference has moved within 21 miles of the ecologically fragile Louisiana coast despite favorable winds .
Photos released by U.S. space agency NASA revealed the spread had become so great , it was visible from space .
The US authorities said they were considering a controlled burn of oil captured in inflatable containment booms floating in the gulf to protect the shorelines of Louisiana and other southern states .
“ I am going to say right up front : the BP efforts to secure the blowout preventer have not yet been successful , ” Rear Admiral Mary Landry told a press conference , referring to a 450 - tonne machine that could seal the well .
ADVERTISEMENT
Asked to compare the accident to the notorious 1989 Exxon Valdez oil tanker disaster , Landry declined but said : “ If we do n’t secure the well , yes , this will be one of the most significant oil spills in US history . ”
The US government promised a “ comprehensive and through investigation ” into the deadly explosion that sank the platform and pledged “ every resource ” to help stave off an environmental disaster .
The rig , which BP leases from Houston - based contractor Transocean , went down last Thursday 130 miles southeast of New Orleans , still burning off crude two days after a blast that killed 11 workers .
ADVERTISEMENT
The widow of one of the dead crew members has filed a lawsuit accusing the companies that operated the rig — BP , Transocean and US oil services behemoth Halliburton — of negligence .
The blast created a slick that could reach Louisiana ’s wetlands — which are a paradise for rare waterfowl and other wildlife — within days if the winds change .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It is the closest it ’s been to shore through this response , ” said Landry .
BP has sent a flotilla of 49 skimmers , tugs , barges , and recovery boats to mop up the spill , but their efforts were hampered at the weekend by strong winds and high seas .
A rig is on stand - by to start drilling two relief wells that could diverting the oil flow to new pipes and storage vessels .
ADVERTISEMENT
But BP officials say the relief wells will take up to three months to drill , and with oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico at the rate of 42,000 gallons a day , the dome is seen as a better interim bet .
US coast guard spokesman Prentice Danner told AFP the dome will take two to four weeks to build .
“ This is the first time this has ever been done .
This idea did n’t exist until now .
It has never been fabricated before , ” he said .
The exact dimensions and design of the dome were still being worked out , but officials said it would be similar to welded steel containment structures called cofferdams that are already used in oil rig construction .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If you could picture a half dome on top of the leak and the oil collects inside of this dome and is pumped out from there , that is the idea behind it , ” explained Danner .
BP chief executive Tony Hayward expressed confidence an environmental disaster would be averted as he acknowledged that strong first - quarter results Tuesday had been overshadowed by the “ tragic accident . ”
According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) experts participating in the spill response , the slick is “ very thin ” and consists of “ 97 percent sheen . ”
Northwest winds blowing the oil away from Louisiana were predicted to keep the slick from reaching shore through Thursday at least .
ADVERTISEMENT
Communities in southern US states along the Gulf of Mexico were nonetheless bracing for the possibility of polluted beaches and fisheries that are crucial to the region ’s economy .
Landry noted that the deadly rig accident has not disrupted offshore gulf oil production — which accounts for one - third of the US energy supply .
Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal , meanwhile , ordered all flags over state buildings to fly at half - staff through sunset May 3 as a token of respect for the 11 crew members who remain missing and are presumed dead .

Remember a few weeks ago when the Oklahoma Senate passed an amendment declaring that the state would not cooperate with any federal hate crimes investigation and even mandating that files of potential hate crimes be withheld or destroyed so that they can not be used to assist in any such investigation ?
The purpose of the amendment was to ensure that the state did not have to abide by the expansion of the federal hate crimes laws to cover things like sexual orientation … only it turns out that there was a problem with the text of the amendment in that it actually stripped protections for race and religion :

Nigeria 's acting President Goodluck Jonathan has been sworn in as head of state following the death of President Umaru Yar 'Adua after a long illness .
Mr Jonathan , in charge since February , will appoint a deputy and serve out the rest of the current presidential term until elections due next year .
Mr Yar 'Adua died late on Wednesday in the capital Abuja .
Thousands attended the funeral in his home town of Katsina .
Nigeria has declared seven days mourning .
Mr Jonathan took the oath of office in front of government ministers and other officials in Abuja almost 12 hours after Mr Yar 'Adua died .
The ceremony was performed by Chief Justice Alloysius Katsina - Alu .
AT THE SCENE Ahmed Idris , BBC News , Katsina
Tens of thousands of men shoved and pushed their way into the stadium in Katsina to pay their respects to Nigeria 's later President Umaru Yar 'Adua .
Chants of " Allahu Akbar " ( God is great ) began as his body - on a bamboo stretcher and wrapped in a Nigerian white and green flag - was carried in by military men .
Former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari and Ibrahim Babangida were among the mourners .
Other dignitaries included Niger 's interim prime minister .
There was also a government delegation , but Mr Yar 'Adua 's deputy , newly sworn - in President Goodluck Jonathan , was not among them .
Security was tight during the prayers , which lasted about 30 minutes in the 40 degree heat ; and the mood was sombre as the body was removed to the cemetery for a burial mainly attended by those close to the late president .
Presidential race is now on Reactions in quotes
In pictures : Nigeria mourns Nigerians on Yar 'Adua 's death Afterwards he made a brief address , saying his administration was committed to pursuing electoral reform and the fight against corruption " with greater vigour " .
" While this is a major burden on me , and indeed the entire nation , we must - in the midst of such great adversity - continue to gain our collective efforts towards upholding the values which our departed leader represented , " Mr Jonathan said .
He added : " One of the true tests will be that all votes count , and are counted , in our upcoming presidential election . "
The BBC's Karen Allen says that all eyes will now be on the figure President Jonathan - who is from the largely Christian south - appoints as his deputy .
By tradition the presidency alternates between the mainly Muslim north and the south , and whomever he selects is likely to be seen as the presidential candidate for the ruling People 's Democratic Party ( PDP ) , she says .
The north is due another presidential term , however some analysts believe that Mr Jonathan could still strengthen his political power base , defy political convention and run for office himself .
Condolences paid Mr Yar 'Adua , who was 58 , was buried in a Muslim ceremony in Katsina state .
Businesses and shops closed down as a sign of respect .
UMARU YAR'ADUA
Born in northern Katsina state in 1951 University chemistry professor before entering politics Married , with nine children Elected president in 2007 promising reforms
Fell ill repeatedly while in office
Obituary : President Umaru Yar 'Adua Profile : Goodluck Jonathan Yar 'Adua dead :
Your comments Soldiers and police officers accompanied his body on the flight to the northern town of Katsina .
There , mourners carried his body on their shoulders on a bamboo stretcher into a football stadium for a service .
Among chants of " God is great " , the body - in a simple coffin - was buried at a cemetery near his home .
Mourners carried Yar 'Adua 's body , covered by Nigeria 's green and white flag , on a bamboo stretcher to the open field for prayers and then burial at a nearby cemetery .
" The death of President Yar 'Adua is a great loss to democracy and a loss to the country and the whole of Africa in general , " Ibrahim Ahmed told Reuters news agency .
Political limbo Mr Yar 'Adua 's election in 2007 marked the first transfer of power from one civilian president to another since Nigeria 's independence in 1960 .
He promised a string of reforms in Africa 's most populous nation , including tackling corruption and reforming the inadequate energy sector and flawed electoral system .
Analysts say he made the most progress in tackling unrest in the oil - rich Niger Delta by offering amnesties to rebels .

His long absence and the lack of detailed information about his health led to a political limbo in Nigeria , which was only filled when Mr Jonathan was named as acting president .
However , there was constant tension between supporters of Mr Yar 'Adua and Mr Jonathan and in March the acting president dissolved the cabinet and later put his own team in place .
During Mr Yar 'Adua 's absence , Nigerian Nobel prize - winning author Wole Soyinka was involved in the campaign to resolve the power vacuum .
On Thursday he said Mr Yar 'Adua 's illness had been manipulated by politicians who had concealed the fact he was in a vegetative state while making arrangements for the forthcoming election .
He told the BBC the late president had been a victim of a macabre game over his succession and not been allowed to be ill in dignity .

Do We Have Too Many Choices ?
Last week I asked you all what was the biggest obstacle to your frugality .
I revealed that one of my struggles was lack of planning .
I gave the example of being out of bread and running to the nearest store to pick up a loaf , rather than planning ahead , so I could hit the least expensive store .
Cfish made the following comment , which was very thought provoking for me .
I am 59 years old and grew up in a small town in the midwest .
There was no fast food , and we did n’t have much money .
When we went out to eat it was a special occasion that was carefully planned .
My mother did not like to cook but made a hot meal for her family every night .
Currently , we live 10 miles from town .
By the time we could drive in , I would have been able to make a simple meal , like frittata or pancakes or french fries with gravy .
My husband , bless him , considers a batch of popcorn an adequate meal .
That ’s the way we were brought up .
We eat out about 5 times a year .
Being frugal is not a choice for us ; it ’s just the way we live .
I think the problem with younger urban and suburban families ( and I hate sounding like a geezer ) is that you have too many choices .
No bread ?
Deal with it instead of running to the closest minimart .
I think she has a good point .
We do have a lot of choices these days .
Sometimes that ’s a great thing .
Sometimes , though , it hinders us .
The Way Things Used to Be
I love to read the Little House on the Prairie series .
So much that my husband bought me the entire set of books for Christmas one year .
One thing you realize when you read those books is how much our ancestors needed to prepare for the future .
If you lived out on the South Dakota prairie , you knew there would be months where you could n’t get to town , because of the weather , so you needed to have enough food on hand to last the winter .
There was no other option .
When I was in high school , I interviewed my grandparents for a paper I wrote on the Great Depression .
Before the advent of easy credit , if you had no money , you did n’t buy something .
You did without .
Again , there was no other option .
People had to think ahead .
They had to be creative in dealing with problems .
Do n’t get me wrong .
I ’m glad we have more choices and opportunities now , but I think there ’s something to be learned from the past .
What Happened ?
I ’m not an expert in history , but here ’s my take on a couple of changes that got us where we are today .
As advances in modernization occurred , more opportunities arose .
Cars made it easier to go places quickly .
As the population increased , stores became available in smaller towns , and people did n’t need to go as far to get supplies .
Eventually it was possible to make a quick run to the store .
And then credit became widely available .
Suddenly people could “ afford ” things they could n’t afford before .
And then came entitlement .
The attitude of “ I deserve to go to a restaurant every once in a while . ”
The line between wants and needs was blurred .
What Can We Learn ?
Though I have no desire to live like people in the 1800s with no electricity or indoor plumbing , I think there are things to be learned from the past .
We do have a lot of choices these days .
It ’s important to evaluate how these choices impact our lives and reject the choices that impact us in a negative way .
We do n’t need to have it all .
We are n’t entitled to having it all .
I do n’t mean to say that in a preachy way , as this is something I sometimes struggle with , too .
This week I decided to experiment with not running to the store .
I ’m not super - organized ( working on it ) , so I knew I ’d be faced with needing something .
Sure enough , I ran out of bread again .
This time , though , instead of hitting the store , I realized I had all the ingredients for bread on hand .
I made a yummy loaf of homemade bread that tastes much better than the stuff in the store .
And it was cheaper than buying a loaf , even at the least expensive store in the area .
Plus I saved money on gas by not driving to the store .
I ’m taking Cfish ’s comment as a personal challenge in my own life .
Especially as I wrap up our homeschool year and have an opportunity to take time to get a little more organized , I ’m going to try to live like I do n’t have many choices .
If I do n’t feel like cooking ( cooking is n’t my favorite activity ) , I ’ll cook anyway , as if a restaurant is n’t an option .
If I forget to pick up an ingredient , I ’ll find a way to do without , as if there were no grocery stores nearby .
I actually think this could be a fun summer project for the whole family .
Maybe we ’ll read through the Little House books , discuss them , and decide what lessons we can take from them and apply to our lives today .
One day I hope to get to the point in life that being frugal is n’t a choice for us .
I want to be able to say it ’s just the way we live .
So what do you think ?
Do we have too many choices today ?
Federal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott says it takes stamina , grit and willpower to complete an ironman .
The 52 - year - old has completed the Ironman Australia in Port Macquarie , on the New South Wales mid-north coast , taking just under 14 hours to swim 3.8 kilometres , cycle 180 kilometres and then run a 42 kilometre marathon .
Before the race , experts - along with Mr Abbott himself - claimed he had not put in enough training for a full ironman .
But he said he would " be a very happy man " if he could finish the race in 14 hours , and he managed that , with about two minutes to spare .
After a brief rest he even had enough energy to joke and speak with the waiting media .
Mr Abbott arrived on the course about 6 am ( AEDT ) and said he was feeling ready for the challenge .
" I'm feeling pretty toey , this is going to be a huge challenge , but there 's about 1,500 other people in it and it's just as big a challenge for them as it is for me , " he said .
" I hope we all make it through OK . "
He said the swim leg would be his toughest leg as he " swims like a brick " .
" I think it will all be hard , you get out of the water , and then you 've got a big challenge , and you get off the bike and then you 've got another big challenge , " he said .
" The thing is there 'll be 1,500 people on the track - they are all heroes and legends in a sense and I am looking forward to their company . "
As Mr Abbott predicted , it took him around an hour and a half to finish the swim , before looking stronger on the bike leg , which took him six hours and 43 minutes , finally completing the run in about five and a half hours .
It was a hot afternoon , with a brisk sea breeze and in the transition between the bike and the run legs , Mr Abbott said his body was starting to hurt and he expected to be " more like a tortoise than a hare " in the final leg .
Mr Abott used chocolate chip muesli bars , hot cross buns and smoked salmon and avocado sandwiches , as well as water and sports drinks to sustain himself during the gruelling race .
He looked relieved and happy as he crossed the finish line about 9 pm , and after a brief rest the Opposition Leader spoke to the waiting throng of reporters and cameramen .
" John Howard was described as a man of steel by George Bush , why should n't I be an ironman in my own way , " he said .
" Margaret Thatcher was the Iron Lady of British politics , why should n't Australian politics have an ironman . "
Mr Abbott was easily recognisable on the course , especially during the bike leg when he wore black and bright pink riding gear .
He was a clear crowd favourite , receiving loud cheers and encouragement from spectators who lined the scenic and challenging course .
Mr Abbott says the level of support he received was " exhilarating " .
" There are few things more exhilarating than the kind of crowd support you get at an event like this - if an election was held tomorrow in Port Macquarie , I think I 'd win , " he said .
He says running the country or running an ironman are both tough in their own way .
" In the end what you need is stamina and grit and willpower frankly - now I am not suggesting for a second that Kevin Rudd does n't have all three of them - but I guess in my own way I have had to dig deep into wells of stamina and grit and willpower . "

Pressure drop ( Image : NASA )
Sadly we know how long humans can survive if suddenly exposed to the vacuum of space .
Three Soviet cosmonauts died in 1971 when a faulty valve caused their Soyuz 11 capsule to depressurise at an altitude of 168 kilometres , shortly before re-entry into the Earth ’s atmosphere .
Investigations revealed that the cabin pressure dropped to zero for 11 minutes and 40 seconds , until the capsule hit the atmosphere .
The crew died within 30 to 40 seconds from hypoxia .
“ You need both oxygen and air pressure to deliver oxygen to the brain , ” says Jonathan Clark , a former space shuttle crew surgeon .
It is possible to recover from shorter spells in a vacuum , however .
In 1966 a NASA technician was testing a spacesuit in a vacuum chamber when the pressure dropped to the level you would experience at an altitude of 36,500 metres .
He passed out after 12 to 15 seconds .
The last thing he recalled was the saliva boiling off his tongue ; that ’s because water vaporises at low pressure .
He regained consciousness within 27 seconds when the chamber was repressurised to the equivalent of an altitude of 4200 metres .
Although he was pale , he suffered no adverse health effects .
When the external pressure reduces , gas bubbles form in the blood , leading to lung damage within minutes .
And the nervous system can be damaged within hours due to nitrogen dissolving out of the blood .
A sudden drop in pressure can be devastating : air trapped in the lungs explodes within seconds .
However , if you approach near - vacuum in a more gentle fashion and with intensive medical care standing by , it …

I n a statement made to TechCrunch Scribd ’s CTO , Jared Friedman said that Scribd has been working on the project to move everything from Flash to HTML5 for six months .
As of today about 200.000 documents published with the service will be available to iPad users , without the requirement of having Flash .
This is a clear win for Apple as it makes all this content accessible to iPad owners .
While this project obviously was n’t related to the iPad ’s introduction , it certainly benefits the device and its users as it makes an enormous number of documents available to them .
Scribd is more company to declare in favor of technologies that are part of the HTML5 specification for use in place of Flash , in addition to all the companies that have been removing Flash from their websites so that they can accessed through iPhone and now iPads .
The release of the iPad and the speed with which it is selling must have been a powerful incentive to complete this project and make the service available to Apple customers .
Scribd ’s CTO pointed out that they had a simpler task than those that need to handle video as the specifications required to implement great looking documents with elegant typography and formatting has already been completed for a while and is already deployed in browsers .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Just how many barrels of oil are gushing into the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon spill is a billion dollar question with implications that go beyond the environment .
It could also help determine how much BP and others end up paying for the disaster .

A clause buried deep in the U.S. Clean Water
Act may expose BP and others to civil fines that are n’t limited to any finite cap -- unlike a $ 75 million limit on compensation for economic damages .
The Act allows the government to seek civil penalties in court for every drop of oil that spills into U.S. navigable waters , including the area of BP ’s leaking well .
As a result , the U.S. government could seek to fine BP or others up to $ 4,300 for every barrel leaked into the U.S. Gulf , according to legal experts and official documents .
So far , analysts and experts calculating potential oil spill liabilities have mostly concentrated on the cost of the clean - up and compensation for economic damages to affected parties .
Some have also discussed criminal liabilities .
But the potential for civil fines has received scant attention -- and they could add up very quickly , depending on how aggressive the U.S. government is in pursuing them .
The threat of hefty fines underscores the importance of quantifying how much oil is pouring into the Gulf .
As BP seeks to staunch the leak that has now been gushing for at least 33 days , it has estimated a spill rate of 5,000 barrels per day .
But some experts say the volume -- and hence the fines -- could be more than 10 times higher .
The little - known , seldom applied clause in the Clean Water Act was added in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska , and was intended to beef up the arsenal of penalties the government can apply to oil spillers to deter future disasters .
“ These civil penalties could be staggeringly high , possibly running into the billions , ” said Professor David Uhlmann , director of the Environmental Law program at University of Michigan .
Total liability -- including civil fines as well as the cost of clean - up , economic damages and potential criminal liability -- “ will run into the billions and may be in the tens of billions , ” Uhlmann said .
Under the Clean Water Act , the Environmental Protection Agency can seek in federal court to fine any party whose negligence results in an oil spill in U.S. federal waters .
Other companies involved at the Horizon platform and the oilfield could share liability with BP , experts said .
They include rig -owner Transocean Ltd , cementing contractor Halliburton Co. , blowout preventer manufacturer Cameron , and Anadarko and Mitsui , which also hold stakes in the oilfield .
SHARP RISE IN FINES
The basic fine , according to the act , is $ 1,100 per barrel spilled .
But the penalty can rise to $ 4,300 a barrel if a federal court rules the spill resulted from gross negligence .
The fines were originally set at $ 1,000 to $ 3,000 but that was raised in 2004 to keep up with inflation , according to Tracy Hester , head of the Environmental Law and Policy program at the University of Houston .

It is unclear , however , that the EPA would try to apply the fines , or seek maximum penalty levels .
EPA officials did not respond to several calls and e-mails requesting comment .
If the agency does act , the per - barrel fines could push oil companies ’ liability well beyond the cost of cleaning up the spill and paying legitimate claims for economic damages it causes , experts told Reuters .
“ There are civil fines that could be quite substantial .
I think BP ’s exposure to this is far greater than people initially thought , ” said Harvard Law School professor Jody Freeman , who recently served in the White House as Counselor for Energy and Climate Change .
BP has already said it will voluntarily exceed a $ 75 million cap on liability for economic damages , pledging to pay any “ legitimate claim ” it receives .
But the civil fines are another wild card .
BP spokesman Mark Salt said the company had nothing further to add to what it has said about the costs of the oil spill response .
Cash raised from such fines would be funneled to government pollution funds , which provide economic aid for hazardous material spills .
BP or other parties facing fines could appeal them , or try to settle with the government for a lesser amount .
Another option would be for BP or other responsible parties to seek a far - ranging settlement covering various areas of liability .
“ The amount of barrels being released from the well is going to be critical , ” said Hester of the University of Houston .
Under pressure over the government ’s response to the disaster , President Barack Obama last Friday created a bi-partisan commission on the spill , and the administration has pledged to independently verify the volume of oil leaking into the Gulf .
“ We ’re not depending on what BP is telling us , ” Interior Secretary Ken Salazar told CNN last week .
OVER A BARREL
After past oil spills , experts said , civil fines have comprised a modest proportion of total liability , but they said the magnitude of the Gulf spill may lead the government to seek unprecedented penalties .
It is common for the government to wait until an oil spill clean - up is well underway before pursuing civil penalties , experts said .
Authorities would also need an accurate accounting of the spill volume before seeking the fines .
Bernstein Research estimated in late April that BP ’s liability could reach $ 8 billion , but that figure did n’t include any potential penalties .
BP ’s stock price has plunged by around 30 percent since deadly explosions rocked the Transocean Deepwater Horizon rig on April 20 , setting off an oil leak that may become the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history .
An EPA legal document leaked online and viewed by Reuters shows the agency evaluated applying per barrel civil fines on BP for a 5,000 - barrel oil spill in Alaska ’s Prudhoe Bay in 2006 .
The EPA and U.S. attorneys declined to confirm or deny the contents of the document , which was found on a whistleblower website called peer.org .
When the penalty clause was introduced into the Clean Water Act by Senator Joseph Lieberman 16 years earlier , he argued that caps on spill liability might lead oil companies to take undue risk .
“ Large civil penalties ... are also especially important because , in certain cases , the liability of the spiller for clean - up costs under federal law is limited , ” Lieberman told Congress in 1990 , according to congressional records .
“ Aggressive penalties may need to compensate for this limited liability , ” he told Congress at the time .
If BP ’s estimated spill rate of 5,000 barrels per day is accurate , responsible parties could face civil fines between $ 5.5 million and $ 21.5 million per day , depending on levels of negligence .
BP ’s net profits in the first quarter of 2010 were around $ 6.7 million per day .
Other companies may share responsibility and face a portion of the civil fines , lawyers said .
“ I would expect the government to go after BP and other parties for the maximum civil fines , ” said William Bode , managing partner at the Bode & Grenier law firm in Washington .
“ The case could be brought in a Louisiana court where it would most likely succeed , although it might be settled for less than the maximum . ”
Any gross negligence ruling against BP or others could depend on whether the companies knew they were taking undue risks in the Gulf , lawyers said .
“ If a driller like BP knew or should have known about a condition that could lead to a disaster , it might face gross negligence , ” said a lawyer and insurance underwriter who does business with BP and asked not to be named .
If the government pursues civil fines based on the volume of oil spilled , it would take into consideration whether companies have made their best effort to mitigate the spill , their prior history of offenses , if any , and whether they can bear the cost of fines , among other factors , experts said .
BP received the third - largest criminal penalty , of $ 50 million , for an environmental offense in U.S. history for a Texas City refinery fire in 2005 .
BP subsidiaries remain under federal probation for prior offenses in Texas and Alaska .
“ There ’s only so much blood you can get from a stone , ” Uhlmann said .
“ I do n’t think bankrupting BP will be the goal . ”
Baldur , the son of Frigga and Odin , was the most handsome and noble of all the Gods .
Forever appearing in the form of a beautiful young man , he was the God of Light and Spring , of all things Right and Good , the best loved among all Aesir .
One morning , his mother wakened from a horrible nightmare .
She had seen Hel , the Goddess who rules the underworld , take Baldur into her realm .
Baldur too had been plagued by troubling dreams foretelling doom .
So Odin invoked the ancient prophetess , Wala , from her grave to find out what was behind the dreams .
He asked her who was next expected to enter the realm of Hel , and her answer was " It is Baldur , the noble one , who is next for Hel , and Hödur , his blind brother , will be the instrument of his demise . "
( Baldur was not a warrior , he would not be killed in battle .
This meant his body was for Hel , not for Valhalla . )
So the Aesir held a meeting to make plans to forestall Baldur 's death .
They decided that every creature in heaven and on earth must swear a holy oath to never do harm to Baldur .
Frigga herself undertook the administration of the oath , from fire and water , giants , dwarfs and elves , human beings , animals and plants .
From this time on , every weapon directed at Baldur missed its mark , it even became a favourite pastime among the Gods to throw weapons at Baldur .
None could touch him .
Even Loki , the meanspirited one , had taken part in the meeting of the Gods .
As the Aesir amused themselves throwing weapons at the God they could not hit , Loki took the form of an old beggar woman , knowing that he would be welcomed by Frigga .
He managed to get her to tell him a secret :
On an oak tree , outside the gates to Valhalla , grew a bush of mistletoe .
The little plant had seemed so meek and harmless to Frigga that it had not been included in the oath .
Back in his real shape , Loki hurried to the oak tree .
There he cut a twig from the mistletoe , then he returned to the circle of the Gods .
They were still at their game with Baldur .
The only one standing aside was the blind Hödur .
" How can I play when I can't see what I 'm doing ? " he complained to Loki .
" Take your bow and get ready to shoot , " replied Loki , " and here is your arrow . "
He handed Hödur the twig and told him he 'd guide his hand .
Not suspecting anything , Hödur went along with Loki .
Mortally wounded , Baldur sank to the ground .
The horrible prophecy of Wala had come true .
Only Odin 's word , that Baldur 's death had been prophesied , protected Hödur from the immediate revenge of the Gods .
He would be killed later , though , by Odin 's son Valli .
So the Gods set about to bury the body of their beloved Baldur .
Never before had Asgard or Midgard been in such deep mourning .
They erected a funeral pyre on Baldur 's own ship , Ringhorn .
At the sight of her beloved husband , dead upon the pyre , Nanna , his widow , died of a broken heart .
Her body was laid at the side of her husband's .
The Aesir sent off Baldur with words of hope and encouragement , but no - one knows the words that Odin whispered to his son .
As Thor put the torch to the pyre , he accidentally kicked a tiny dwarf into the flames .
The dwarf perished , leading to later friction betwen Gods and Dwarfs .
Then the Giants pushed to ship out into the open waters and wild flames accompanied the God on his last journey .
When the ship finally sank into the depth of the ocean , it seemed as if the whole world went into a twilight .
No -one was grieving more than Frigga , his mother .
Was Baldur , the God of Light and Springtime , lost forever ?
Was there a way she could persuade Hel , the Goddess who ruled in the land of the dead , to let Baldur return to the daylight ?
Touched deeply by Frigga 's grief , Hermodur , the divine messenger , decided to try and free his brother .
Odin lent him Sleipneir , his steed , who knew the way to Hel .
For nine nights , Hermodur rode the eight - legged horse which was swift as the wind .
Finally , they reached Bifröst , the bridge that separates the world of the dead from the world of the living .
Once he reached the realm of Hel , he saw Baldur , pale and dazed , Nanna at his side .
He wispered words to comfort to his brother .
But Hel , the cold , dark Goddess of the Dead , was not to be swayed : " The dead are for my realm alone , Baldur belongs to me . "
However , she finally agreed that Baldur may return if any and all creatures , alive or dead , would cry for Baldur .
If even one creature refused to cry , Baldur would be hers for all time to come .
Hermodur returned to Asgard as fast as he could , carrying presents from Baldur and Nanna for Odin and Freya .
The Asgards had been anxiously awaiting his return .
When they heard what Hel had decreed , Freya immediately send out the Elves , her special messengers .
They were to find every creature so that they would cry for Baldur .
And every creature went along , even the rocks and stones cried over the loss .
But then , in a cave , they encountered a Giantess , Thoegg , who coldly refused to shed even one tear for Baldur .
No amount of begging and pleading could soften her mean spirit .
Some even say that the Giantess was no other then Loki himself , in one of his many guises .
And thus Baldur remained in the realm of Hel .
The Aesir were naturally very upset about the behavior of the Giantess , but they recognised the doings of Loki .
Where was this underhanded God , this murderer ?
In the confusion over Baldur 's death , he had quietly stolen away .
He was finally tracked to a house that had four windows , one in every direction .
Thus Loki saw them coming .
He turned himself into a salmon , one of his favourite tricks , and disappeared into the ocean .
But he had left something behind :
In order to find out how he might be captured in his fish form , he had invented and fashioned a net , which he then threw into the fire before fleeing .
This was his downfall :
The shape of the net was still discernible in the ashes , and now the Aesir had a way of catching him .
And catch him they did .
Their revenge was as horrible as the crime he had committed :
He was taken to an island in the realm of Hel and bound to a sharp - edged rock in such a manner that he could barely move .
Above his head they hung an adder who continuouly dripped her acrid poison upon his face .
Sigyn , his faithful wife , stayed by his side , catching the dripping acid in a bowl .
Horrible were the screams of Loki when Sigyn had to rise to empty the bowl , and his desperate writhing was felt through all Midgard .
This shaking of the world the humans came to call earthquake .
During those gruesome nights , the Midgard Snake stirs in the depth of the ocean so that huge waves hit the lands , and mighty floods slam into the wall that separates Midgard against the sea , accompanied by the frightening howl of the Fenris Wolf .
And thus it will remain until Ragnarök , the Twilight of the Gods , the end of all things .
If you were faced with by far the biggest bill of your life , would you not want to be confident that there was a very good reason why you should pay it ?
That is why we need to know just how far we can trust the science behind the official view that the world is threatened with catastrophe by global warming – because the measures proposed by our politicians to avert this supposed disaster threaten to transform our way of life out of recognition and to land us with easily the biggest bill in history .
( The Climate Change Act alone , says the Government , will cost us all £ 18 billion every year until 2050 . )

The raids involved over 800 ICE officers and law enforcement officials from local to international levels .
Immigrant rights activists fear that the operation signifies a new wave of anti-immigrant repression and border militarization .
( Fight Back ! News / Jason Aragon )
Tucson , AZ - “ Tucson today is the moral equivalent of Birmingham , Alabama in 1961 , ” said Mike Wilson , border rights activist and Tohono ‘ O’odham tribal member , at a rally at the Federal Building here , April 15 .
The rally was held in response series of raids that took place the same day in Phoenix , Tucson , Rio Rico and Nogales , and in the Mexican city of Nogales , Sonora .
The raids targeted people traveling on shuttle services , but whole neighborhoods were affected , with traffic brought to a virtual standstill while agents occupied urban areas in the biggest such operation in the seven - year history of Immigration and Custom Enforcement ( ICE ) .
Although the rally was organized as an emergency response , with calls going out only a couple of hours before it took place , some 75 people showed up in a diverse crowd of all ages and nationalities .
Rally - goers vowed to end the system of racist laws in Arizona with a popular fight back , just like Jim Crow laws of racial discrimination were defeated in the civil rights struggle in the U.S. South in the 1960s .
The raids involved over 800 ICE officers and law enforcement officials from local to international levels .
Immigrant rights activists fear that the operation signifies a new wave of anti-immigrant repression and border militarization .
According to ICE officials , the raids targeted narco - traffickers and human smugglers .
In reality , the raids targeted shuttle service owners and operators and community members who evoked suspicion because they looked Latino or indigenous .
Scores were arrested and 50 vehicles and seven vans were confiscated .
Vidal Ramirez , owner of Sahuaro Shuttle ( whose service was not raided ) , responded to the news saying , “ I do n’t have the right to ask for papers .
I sell the ticket and that ’s it .
It ’s a big , big circus . ”
Andrew Provencio , however , lost the shuttle van that he runs to and from Nogales , Arizona .
The van was being driven by his son , Ricardo Gomez , who was questioned , but not arrested by ICE agents .
Provencio said he was just beginning to pay the $ 22,000 loan he had gotten on the van , remarking , “ You are not even involved in what ’s going on and they seize everything . ”
Gomez agreed that shuttle drivers are not allowed to ask passengers regarding their immigration status .
Border rights activists are concerned about the timing of the raids , coming just two days after the Arizona House passed Senate Bill 1070 , which would be the harshest anti-immigrant legislation in the country .
Among other things , the bill would require local and state police to enforce immigration law and investigate anyone they suspect of being undocumented .
The law also gives citizens the ability to sue police agencies for not enforcing immigration law aggressively enough .
Some present at the rally wondered if the timing of the raid signified an endorsement of this new approach .
The bill ’s sponsor , Republican Senator Russell Pierce , claims that there are already ten states ready to adopt similar measures .
Making a comparison with institutionalized racism in the Jim Crow South , Wilson noted that Arizona is an epicenter in the development of racist laws - laws that are often picked up by other states .
In a later statement , immigration lawyer and Coalición de Derechos Humanos co-founder Isabel García noted , “ We have permitted Arizona to be the engine for the creation of laws and politicians that will impact every person living in this country … with copy - cat legislation appearing across the states . ”
Because of the ‘ papers on demand ’ provisions for anyone suspected of being an undocumented immigrant , the bill implies that everyone , resident , citizen or not , must have identification on their person at all times to verify their immigration status .
Anyone who lives near the border knows what this means .
English speaking whites who travel between the border and further inland are virtually never asked to provide proof of citizenship when crossing ICE roadblocks or casually coming into contact with law enforcement .
But this requirement is routine for Latinos and indigenous persons , especially if Spanish is their first language - which means the law codifies racial profiling .
The Arizona Puente Human Rights Movement released a statement comparing the legislation to the passbook laws of Apartheid South Africa : “ If and when Governor Brewer signs [ SB 1070 ] , Arizona will have effectively become the first Apartheid State in the United States .
Despite heavy opposition by business interests , clergy , religious associations , police chiefs and League of [ Arizona ] Cities and Towns , the bill passed the Arizona House of Representatives , moving Arizona closer to becoming the first police state in the country . ”
The bill defines any undocumented worker as being in violation of state criminal trespassing laws simply by virtue of being in the state , with mandatory jail time for infractions .
It also forbids churches from providing sanctuary to undocumented workers and stops cities from adopting policies that prevent police from enforcing immigration laws .
It makes illegal the solicitation of work from , or the hiring of , day laborers .
It intensifies the requirement that state agencies demand proof of citizenship for all those seeking services , including those calling for police in the event of domestic violence or other crimes .
Martha Ojeda , Director of the Coalition for Maquiladora Justice in San Antonio , has little patience either for Arizona ’s pioneering policies of racism ( and the tendency of other states to follow them ) or for the hypocrisy she sees in the treatment of undocumented workers .
She notes that the North American Free Trade Agreement lead to a huge spike in immigration , granting free access for big corporations to cross borders , but not for workers to do the same .
She notes that undocumented workers have become an indispensible part of the U.S. economy and that they pay more in taxes and Social Security than they receive in social services .
Ojeda feels that the Obama administration was on the right track with initial calls to renegotiate NAFTA , but that his calls do n’t go far enough : “ A renegotiation is indispensible that not only includes labor and environmental accords … or …studies and statistics to measure the increases in poverty .
This does n’t help anyone .
The market must be regulated and NAFTA must be annulled … ”
Asked about Arizona ’s example , Ojeda does n’t mince words : “ Arizona has made itself stand out for being a racist state that pursues and criminalizes human beings that come contributing to the economic growth of the United States .
Without the day laborers , waiters , cleaners - the U.S. economy would be in more critical shape …
Many politicians are worried by immigration but it is obvious that it ’s only rhetoric to dress up the nationalist racism of the political conservatives that even now are controlling power . ”
The raids also coincide with revelations that ICE policy for agent evaluations has recently changed to emphasize caseload quotas and that it is trying to drive up statistics for successful operations by expanding the populations it targets for deportations .
In a statement blasting the Obama administration ’s immigration and border policies , the International Executive Vice President for the Service Employees International Union , Eliseo Medina , said that the Department of Homeland Security ( which oversees ICE ) needs to “ stop these crazy , irrational policies . ”
According to Medina , " They said they were going after criminals .
They need to do that .
They said they were going after bad actor employers to take away the profit motive .
They need to do that .
But instead , they are still going after meatpackers , janitors and cooks . ”
“ There has been a failure with this strategy , and so there 's a lot of anger within our union , because we look at and see the everyday impact of these policies , and it ’s the complete opposite of what they said they were going to do . ”
During the raids in Arizona , not only were individuals questioned and arrested , but whole neighborhoods were subjected to a military - style deployment .
Kat Rodriguez , also of Derechos Humanos , said , “ There was a massive show of force , with helicopters , dozens of agents , police vehicles and weapons , assaulting our community in a fashion never seen before …
This action clearly demonstrates what we have predicted , that we would all be living in a police state here in Arizona .
How can the Obama administration permit these actions while espousing a commitment to ‘ change ? ’ ”
She added , “ We demand an immediate response from the president and Secretary [ of Homeland Security ]
Janet Napolitano , as this community is already scrambling from the Jim Crow - type laws coming from the extremists in the Arizona legislature . ”
Napolitano was the previous governor of Arizona before taking her current position .
Derechos Humanos ’ Garcia added , “ Instead of bringing in the Department of Justice to investigate the immigration abuses and uphold our rights , the Obama administration sics the ICE police on our communities . ”
Meanwhile , Coalition for Maquiladora Justice ’s Ojeda believes border militarization and immigrant laws are an attempt to shift the blame for the many crises plaguing the United States and represent a reactionary assault doomed to failure :
I definitely believe that immigration has turned itself into a boomerang for political conservatives … their greed was limitless and did not take into account the consequences .
They opened the market and paid hunger wages , obligating people to immigrate .
They thought with their invited workers program - the bracero program - they could continue slavery with legitimacy , robbing people of their passports , not paying them [ Specific cases like this have been uncovered recently in the states of Florida and Mississippi ] , thinking that they would have no other alternative than to suffer the oppression .
But they were wrong , simply and sincerely because the necessity to survive was bigger and millions of undocumented people broke the frame and did n’t follow the paradigms of slavery .
Ojeda continued , “ They came and demanded the right to work , to live and the right to migration that is consecrated in the Universal Statement of Human Rights of the United Nations .
And now the results are in - whether they like it or not .
A crisis in banking , in housing , in nutrition in the environment , with a crisis in manufacturing and a crisis in the automotive industry and with unemployment at high levels not seen since the Great Depression in the ‘ 30s .
The result is that the U.S. , whether it likes it or not , depends on an undocumented labor force . ”

What we have here is a mercury arc valve rectifier , a device that became prominent in the 1920s and 1930s for converting alternating current into direct current .
The spectacular machines could be found in power stations for electric railways , streetcars , and locomotives of the day .
Wikipedia enlightens on their funky design :
One type of mercury vapor electric rectifier consists of an evacuated glass bulb , with a pool of liquid mercury sitting in the bottom as the cathode .
[ 2 ]
Over it curves the glass bulb , which condenses mercury evaporated in the course of operation of the device .
The glass envelope has one or more arms with graphite rods as anodes .
Their number depends on the application .
If direct current is to be produced from single - phase alternating current , then two anodes are used , each connected to the outer ends of a centre - tapped transformer secondary winding .
With three - phase alternating current three or six anodes are used , to provide a smoother direct current .
Six - phase operation can improve the efficiency of the transformer as well as providing smoother DC , by enabling two anodes to conduct simultaneously .
During operation , the arc transfers to the anodes at the highest positive potential ( with respect to the cathode ) .
Design of the arms and envelope is intended to prevent an arc from forming between the anodes ; such a condition is called " backfire " and is a critical factor in the design of mercury arc rectifiers .

As these mad scientist monstrosities depended on hazardous mercury for their operation , they were ultimately replaced by solid state devices in the 1970s .
The newer versions , it goes without saying , looked nowhere near as rad as their predecessors .

A former senior National Security Agency official is facing a slew of charges over the leaking of classified information about the super secret intelligence agency to a newspaper reporter .
Thomas Drake , 52 , of Glenwood , Maryland , was charged in a 10 - count indictment handed down by a federal grand jury in Maryland , the Justice Department said in a statement Thursday .

Drake , a high - ranking employee at the NSA between 2001 and 2008 , is accused of illegally retaining classified information , obstructing justice and making false statements .
Drake is alleged to have provided information to a newspaper reporter for a series of articles published between February 2006 and November 2007 .
The indictment did not identify the reporter , described only as “ Reporter A , ” or the “ national newspaper ” but various reports identified her as Siobhan Gorman of The Baltimore Sun .
Gorman now works for The Wall Street Journal .
The Baltimore Sun did not respond to a request for comment from AFP .
The indictment also did not identify the subject of the stories , but said they were “ articles about the NSA and its intelligence activities , including SIGINT programs . ”

NSA headquarters in Fort Meade , Maryland , where Drake worked , is the main facility for SIGINT , or Signals Intelligence programs , which involve capturing and processing foreign communications for intelligence purposes .
Drake “ served as a source for many of these newspaper articles , including articles that contained SIGINT information , ” the indictment said .
Gorman wrote a number of articles about the NSA during the time period cited in the indictment , including stories about problems with classified information collection and analysis programs known as “ Turbulence ” and “ Trailblazer . ”

According to the indictment , Drake left Fort Meade in 2006 to work at the National Defense University in Washington but remained an NSA employee .
His security clearance was suspended in November 2007 and he resigned from the NSA in April 2008 .

Using Hushmail , a secure email service , Drake allegedly exchanged hundreds of emails with “ Reporter A ” and they met on six occasions in the Washington area , according to the indictment .
“ This defendant used a secret , non-government email account to transmit classified and unclassified information that he was not authorized to possess or disclose , ” assistant attorney general Lanny Breuer said in a statement .
“ He also later allegedly shredded documents and lied about his conduct to federal agents in order to obstruct their investigation , ” Breuer said .

“ Our national security demands that the sort of conduct alleged here — violating the government ’s trust by illegally retaining and disclosing classified information — be prosecuted and prosecuted vigorously . ”
Drake faces five charges of illegally retaining classified documents , which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison .
He faces one charge of obstruction of justice , which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison , and four charges of making false statements , which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison .
Lucy Dalglish , executive director of The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , told AFP the prosecution of a government leaker , while rare , is “ not unheard of . ”

“ It ’s not a shock , ” Dalglish said .
“ They ’ve always had the ability to charge people with violating national security laws when they leak to a reporter .
They just do n’t typically do it very often . ”
She said the case is “ designed to have an impact on leakers . ”
“ It ’s going to impact people sharing information with reporters , ” she said .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Toyota Motor Corp has agreed to pay a record $ 16.4 million fine to U.S. safety regulators to settle a complaint that the company delayed a recall over defective accelerator pedals , but denied violating U.S. regulations .

The automaker on Monday also recalled the 2010 Lexus GX 460 , a luxury SUV that influential magazine Consumer Reports warned last week was a “ safety risk ” because of a potential handling problems in turns .
Toyota said its own testing confirmed the problem and said it would fix the electronic stability control system ’s software in about 9,400 Lexus GX 460 vehicles sold in the U.S. market .
The recall is the latest in a series of recalls and incidents that have tarnished Toyota ’s once market - leading reputation for quality .
Toyota had estimated in February that the previous recalls would cost it $ 2 billion for its fiscal year ending in March , but it has recalled more vehicles since that estimate and not provided any further updates .
Most analysts believe the costs will be significantly higher .
Delays alleged by U.S. regulators in a January recall of 2.3 million vehicles due to defective accelerator pedals led to the record fine .
Toyota said it had made a “ good faith ” effort to handle safety problems , but decided to pay the penalty -- the maximum allowed by U.S. law and the largest the regulator has ever sought -- “ to avoid a protracted dispute and possible litigation .
“ We did not try to hide a defect to avoid dealing with a safety problem , ” Toyota said in a statement .
U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Toyota had put consumers at risk by failing to report safety problems related to the defective accelerator pedals and the department ’s investigations continued .
The department ’s actions may also provide further ammunition to plaintiff lawyers looking to bolster legal claims against Toyota , which has recalled more than 8 million vehicles worldwide for accelerator pedal defects and ill - fitting floormats that could cause unintended acceleration .
On Friday , Toyota also recalled 870,000 Sienna minivans sold in North America since the 1998 model year because of a risk that the spare tire could drop into the road .
“ Toyota appears to be settling in for a long legal fight , ” Gimme Credit analyst Craig Hutson said .
“ We think the combination of legal costs , higher marketing costs , increased incentives and all that could easily be multiples of the $ 2 billion in costs for the 2010 year that Toyota has forecast , ” Hutson said .
Toyota faces numerous lawsuits alleging consumer fraud and personal injuries over unintended acceleration in its vehicles .
The company ’s handling of safety issues is also under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a grand jury in New York .
Some lawyers estimate Toyota faces potential civil liability of more than $ 10 billion in U.S. courts .
The recent addition of demands for full refunds to U.S. owners of recalled Toyota vehicles as part of consumer protection cases filed in 12 states could raise the legal stakes even higher for the car company .
The fine related specifically to the U.S. National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration ’s allegations that it failed to notify the agency for four months about a defect in accelerator pedals that were “ sticky ” and “ slow to return . ”
The U.S. regulator said in proposing the fine that Toyota ’s own records showed that it had issued repair notices for the pedal problem in Canada and Europe in September , but did not take action in the U.S. market until January .
Automakers are required to tell U.S. safety regulators within five days if they determine a safety defect exists .
U.S. safety regulators continue to review Toyota ’s statements and more than 120,000 pages of Toyota documents to determine whether the automaker has complied with all its legal obligations and have said that additional fines are possible .
Toyota ’s shares fell 31 cents to $ 79.06 on the New York Stock Exchange late Monday afternoon .

Indeed , a 1999 study by psychologist Robert Feldman at the University of Massachusetts showed that the most popular kids were also the most effective liars .
Just because our aptitude is hardwired does n't mean it can't improve with practice and skill .
Here are 10 techniques that top - notch liars use to maximize their effectiveness .
( By the way , this information is offered as a way to help detect deceit in others , not to practice it yourself .
Honestly ! )
# 1 Have a reason .
" Prisons are filled with bad liars , " says psychologist Charles Ford , author of the book Lies !
Lies !
Lies !.
" The good liars are out running HMOs . "
So what 's the big difference ?
Basically , says
Ford , the trick is to lie as little as possible — only when you actually have something to gain .
" Pathological liars can't stop themselves from lying , so they tell a lot of little lies and wind up getting caught , " he says .
Truly expert fabricators , on the other hand , save their ammunition — they do n't bother to lie unless it 's going to get them something they really want .
# 2 Lay your groundwork .
Do n't wait until you 're under the interrogation lamp to start putting your story together .
A 1990 study by psychologist Bill Flanagan showed that liars who had worked out the details of their stories beforehand had significantly more success than those who had n't .
As in everything , practice makes perfect .
" It 's easier to catch someone in a lie the first time they tell it , " says psychologist Dr. Cynthia Cohen .
# 3 Tell the truth , misleadingly .
The hardest lies to catch are those which are n't actually lies .
You 're telling the truth , but in a way that leaves a false impression .
Technically , it 's only a prevarication — about half a sin .
A 1990 study of pathological liars in New York City found that those who could avoid follow - up questions were significantly more successful at their deceptions .
# 4 Know your target .
Good liars have the same gift as good communicators : the ability to get inside the listener 's head .
not only clues you in to what your subject wants to hear , it will help you avoid stepping onto trip wires that will trigger their suspicions .
" To make a credible lie , you need to take into account the perspective of your target , " says Carolyn Saarni , co-editor of the book Lying and in Everyday Life .
" Know what they know .
Be aware of their interests and activities so you can cover your tracks . "
# 5 Keep your facts straight .
" One of the problems of successful lying is that it 's hard work , " says psychologist Michael Lewis .
" You have to be very consistent in doing it . "
That means nailing down the details .
Write down notes if you have to .
" One of the things that trips people up is that they give different information to different people , who then start talking about it and comparing notes , " says Dr. Gini Graham Scott , author of The Truth About Lying .
# 6 Stay focused .
" When I 'm trying to catch a liar , I watch to see how committed they are to what they 're telling me , " says Sgt. John Yarbrough , interrogation expert with the LA Sheriff Department 's homicide bureau .
" If I accuse someone of lying , and they 're not very committed to the statement they just made , a red flag goes up . "
One of the reasons most people make bad liars is that they find lying a deeply unpleasant activity .
and are evident in their facial expressions .
They want to get the process over as quickly as possible , so they show relief when their interrogator changes the topic .
That 's a dead giveaway .
Really good liars , on the other hand , actually enjoy the process of deceiving other people .
" The best liars do n't show any or remorse because they do n't feel it , " says Cohen .
" They get a thrill out of actively misleading others .
They 're good at it , and they enjoy the challenge . "
# 7 : Watch your signals .
It 's folk that people fidget , touch their noses , , and break eye contact when they lie — the proverbial " shifty - eyed " look .
But research has shown that just is n't so .
In his 1999 study of high school students , Feldman found that nonverbal signals were crucial in determining who got away with telling lies .
" The successful kinds were better at controlling their nonverbal signals , things like the the amount of eye contact and how much they gestured , " he says .
# 8 : Turn up the pressure .
If your target has clearly become suspicious , it 's time to raise the emotional stakes .
" The best liars are natural manipulators , " says Sgt. Yarbrough .
He cites as a perfect example the scene in Basic Instinct where Sharon Stone is brought to the cop station for questioning and winds up flashing everyone a glimpse of her Lesser Antilles .
" She was turning them on , " Yarbrough explains , " and that 's a form of manipulation — using sexual or emotional arousal to distract the interviewer . "
# 9 : Counterattack .
The fact is , just as most of us are uncomfortable telling lies , most are uncomfortable accusing others .
This discomfort can be used in the liar 's favor .
" You 'll often see politicians respond to accusations with , " says Stan Walters , author of The Truth About Lying : Everyday Techniques for Dealing with Deception .
" What they 'll do is drive critics away from the issue , so they 're forced to gather up their resources to fight another scrimmage . "
# 10 : Bargain .
Even when the jig is up , liars can often escape the worst by using a process psychologists call bargaining .
" You want to soften , alleviate , or totally eliminate feelings of responsibility for the lie , " explains researcher Mary DePalma .
" If you can decrease responsibility for blame and the anger that goes with it , you 're really looking at a much better outcome .
The “ Southside kid ” ca n’t come up with the name of a single Chicago White Sox player , though he takes great pains to mention that he lived by “ Cominskey ” ( sic…double sic ) Park …
He ’s phonier than one of the faux vegetables from Michelle Obama ’s garden .

Can you imagine if Sarah Palin or George W. Bush had flubbed the softball question like the Gaffe Machine - in - Chief ?

Obama ’s been getting the name of his supposed favorite ballpark wrong for years .
Flashback July 16 , 2009 :
President Obama ’s lordly attitude and effete bearing would be more than welcome there than on hard - edged 35th Street , but no doubt he wishes to keep his manufactured South Side “ cred ” and remains aligned with the White Sox .
He may wish to brush up on the former name of where his beloved Sox play , though – it used to be Comiskey Park , not “ Cominskey Field ” as he told Bob Costas .
Really , it does not matter in the long run if our president is neither an exceptional athlete nor even a casual fan of some team in his adopted hometown .
But be up front about it ; do n’t try cheap tricks using a compliant media and assume prominent residence in a group with which you are unfamiliar and attempt to relate .
It stinks of emptiness and desperation .
Actually , it just stinks .

The list of things the Canadian government 's IT group did n't like to see was a long list .
High up on that list was " thirty - five contract developers sitting idle around a box of Tim Hortons donuts and racking up billable hours because they could n't do any development with the DEV database out of commission " .
A fantastic way to spend free time , if you can get it .
It fell to Jody , junior DBA , to put an end to this .
Before he even had time to grab coffee , he was investigating , " Error 04002 , ' Unable to open file ' " A quick check against the vendor 's documentation gave him a few options : the datafile was n't there , the drive was full , or there were insufficient file handles .
Jody quickly eliminated the first two , but found he did n't have the rights to increase the number of file handles .
Feeling halfway successful , he went to his boss and explained his findings .
" We should call the vendor and see what they say , " he said .
" Can we try this while you sit on hold ? " he asked .
His boss was adamant , so to the phone they went .
They paced about the conference room while the support analyst read through his troubleshooting script over their speaker - phone .
" And what version are you running ? "
When they rattled off the numbers , the support analyst apologetically replied , " Oh , that 's a few point releases back .
Before we proceed , we should get you upgraded to the newest version . "
" We really do n't have time for that , " Jody said .
There was a caffeine deficient edge in his voice .
His boss noticed and gave him " a look " .
" Well , if this were a production issue , we 'd certainly try and work with your current version , " the support goon said with disturbing calm , " but since this is only your development database , our policy is that you need to be up to date .
Your issue may have already been solved in the next version . "
" Well , this is time sensitive , " Jody 's boss said .
" How can we upgrade ? "
" Well , we do have a patch that will update you to the latest point release without doing a full install .
We could overnight that to you … "
" We need it faster than that ! "
Jody said .
" Would you like us to fax it to you ?
Do you have a fax number ? "
There was a long moment where Jody and his boss stared at each other in stunned silence .
The question made so little sense that they had n't the foggiest idea how to reply .
" Um , What about our FTP site ? " his boss offered helpfully .
" Certainly , we can fax it to your FTP site .
What 's the number ? "
Defeated , his boss shrugged .
He could n't make eye contact with Jody .
He killed the call triumphantly .
His boss logged into the server , increased the available file handles , and rebooted .
Sure enough , their database came back online and the devs put their donuts down and went to work .
Satisfied , Jody returned to his desk and tackled the other work on his plate for the day .
It was a little later when his boss appeared behind him , his face apologetic , with a cup of Tim Hortons and a box of donuts .
" Got time to take a break ? "
" I 've always got time for Tim Hortons . "
With the regular season now over I decided to take one last look at penalty kill save percentage .
First off , I 'll take a look at the numbers of the leaders from December to show the kind of regression to league average we expect with this statistic .
Then , I 'll take a look at each of the goalies involved in the playoffs and their save percentage by game state ( PK and EV ) to see if there 's anyone who had a PK save percentage that made them look great in the regular season but is n't such a good bet to repeat throughout the playoffs .
In the original study earlier this season I looked at goalies who had faced at least 60 shots and created two tables , one for goalies who had a PK save percentage above .900 and another for those with a PK save percentage below .840 .
So we 're looking at the guys who did the very best and the guys who did the very worst .
Historically , an average save percentage on the PK is about .866 .
I like to calculate " goals saved above / below average " and the number I 'm using for " average " is that .866 figure .
The two tables below show how the best and worst up to December 8th fared in the rest of the season :
As we can see , in both instances there was a strong tendency to regress toward the average of .866 .
Of the fourteen goalies in the study , only Vesa Toskala , Ray Emery and Jonas Hiller ended up further away from .866 in the second sample of games than they did in the first .
In Emery 's case the second sample only had 33 shots so an extreme result can easily be discarded .
Toskala 's number is amazing considering just how bad his first number was .
What a frustrating season for fans of the Toronto Maple Leafs .
In Jonas Hiller 's case , he 's further away from .866 but in the opposite direction .
His season started off very poorly on the PK and ended very well .
At any rate , I hope that this shows a couple of things .
First , a playoff series is going to be a very small sample so anything can happen !
Second , goalies with an extreme result one way or another probably should n't be counted on to reproduce that number .
If we were taking bets on the PK save percentage for these 14 goalies for the last part of the season , league average ( .866 ) was a better predictor of their performance than was the first part of the season in 9 out of the 14 cases !
So now let 's look at the playoff goalies .
The goalies that have benefited from a high PK save percentage without the EV save percentage to back it up are highlighted in red .
The goalies with a reasonably strong EV save percentage but who have been hurt by a weak number on the PK are highlighted in green :
Some interesting things to note include Nashville and Washington who each have both goalies highlighted in green .
This may imply that those teams are n't very good at controlling shot quality on the PK .
It may also signal that those teams have had very poor luck with their goaltending on the PK .
If it 's the former , it 's a somewhat new development .
Although both Nashville goalies had a poor PK save percentage last season , in 2007 - 08 Dan Ellis was among the league leaders with a PK save percentage of .918 .
For Washington , Semyon Varlamov posted .886 last season if we combine his results in the regular season and playoffs .
If I were a fan of the Predators or Capitals , I would find some hope in the strong EV performance and realize that my goaltenders are probably better than their overall save percentages imply .
Another interesting case is the Philadelphia Flyers .
Michael Leighton benefited from some extremely good luck on the penalty kill while Brian Boucher was very poor .
At EV - a better predictor of future performance - Boucher is actually the better goalie .
Now Boucher still is n't very good but if Leighton were healthy the Flyers would likely be playing someone who is even worse .
The goalies who are probably worse than the overall save percentage might imply ?
In addition to Leighton we have Tim Thomas who is n't likely to play in the playoffs .
But even if he did , at least he has a nice track record of performance to suggest he 's a pretty good goalie .
Brian Elliott does not .
The Penguins were n't able to get enough pucks past him last night but Ottawa is much weaker in goal than Elliott 's .909 overall save percentage implies .
And finally , Mr. Vezina himself , Ryan Miller . .928 at EV is still awesome .
He 's definitely a good goalie but his numbers this season have been somewhat inflated .
After more than a year of sustained pressure , the countries negotiating the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) have decided that the time is right to release the draft text of their work .
The official announcement came today after the conclusion of negotiations in New Zealand .
" There was a general sense from this session that negotiations have now advanced to a point where making a draft text available to the public will help the process of reaching a final agreement , " says the official announcement .
" For that reason , and based on the specific momentum coming out of this meeting , participants have reached unanimous agreement that the time is right for making available to the public the consolidated text coming out of these discussions , which will reflect the substantial progress made at this round . "
The draft text will be released this upcoming Wednesday , April 21 .
The announcement also shows just how carefully the European Union , Japan , Korea , Mexico , New Zealand , the US , and others have been watching public opinion .
It goes out of its way to say that the treaty will not oblige " participants to require border authorities to search travelers ' baggage or their personal electronic devices for infringing materials . "
This is a clear attempt to rebut the " but customs will start searching my iPod ! " madness we 've seen in relation to ACTA .
The announcement also says that " no participant is proposing to require governments to mandate a ' graduated response ' or ' three strikes ' approach to copyright infringement on the Internet . "
As we 've reported before , the leaked draft text does demand that ISPs have some plan in place to deter infringers , and a footnote made it clear that booting them off the Internet would be a great way to handle this — but the language in the draft came straight from the existing DMCA in the US and does not mandate any specific approach .
The announcement is certainly good news for fans of transparency , but it 's not all sunshine and unicorns .
For one thing , the participants plan to strip out their " respective positions . "
In other words , we are going to get a consolidated draft text that provides no information about who has been arguing for what position .
Not that it really matters , since massive leaks have already revealed negotiating positions and a complete draft text from January .
It 's disappointing that the negotiating countries refused to release more information about the process along the way ; their decision to do so now has limited meaning , since the complete text is already leaked .
Still , it should allow negotiators to start answering public questions about the treaty and responding to public criticism .
That 's a good thing , but it comes quite late in the process .
After a couple years of negotiations , the existence of a " consolidated text " shows that most of the tough negotiating has already been done .
Changes could still be made at this point , but it's late in the process and today 's announcement reminds us that the aim is to wrap up this treaty " as soon as possible in 2010 . "
The next meeting takes place in Switzerland in June .
The most badass collection of badass rainbows on the face of the planet .
Polar bear fur is made up of a dense , insulating underfur that is topped by guard hairs that vary in length .
The fur prevents almost all heat loss — in fact , adult males can quickly overheat when they run .
And surprisingly , the fur is n’t actually white — it just looks that way .
Each hair shaft is pigment - free and transparent with a hollow core that scatters and reflects visible light , much like what happens with ice and snow .
Polar bears look whitest when they are clean and in high - angle sunlight , especially just after the molt period , which usually begins in spring and is complete by late summer .
Before molting , accumulated oils in their fur from the seals they eat can make them look yellow .
By many counts , 2009 was a great year for women in Hollywood .
Female directors knocked out such hits as “ The Proposal , ” “ Alvin and the Chipmunks : The Squeakquel , ” “ It ’s Complicated ” and “ Julie & Julia , ” as well as the Oscar contenders “ The Hurt Locker ” and “ An Education . ”
Sandra Bullock and Meryl Streep outperformed most of their male counterparts dollar for dollar at the box office , nabbing Oscar nominations to boot .
The elusive female movie - going audience has started to gel into a potent force , driving such hits as the “ Twilight ” franchise , “ The Blind Side ” and this weekend ’s “ Alice in Wonderland . ”
Now comes the capper , as Kathryn Bigelow stands poised to become the first woman to win an Oscar for directing , after spending seven years in proverbial director ’s jail because her last film , “ K - 19 : The Widowmaker , ” flopped at the box office .
After winning numerous critic awards and the prestigious Directors Guild of America directing award , Bigelow is favored to take tonight ’s prize for directing “ The Hurt Locker , ” her film about bomb - disposal technicians in Iraq that is also nominated for best picture .
Bigelow ’s likely ascension to the podium at the Academy Awards has provided a jolt of adrenaline .
The director lent her own idiosyncratic eye to the most male of genres , the war film .
But she is considered by many in the business to be more of an outlier , an exception to the rule as a woman who ’s made her name largely directing men in action films such as “ Point Break ” and “ Strange Days . ”
Most female directors have risen to power by directing ( and often writing ) films that appeal to women , whether or not that ’s their natural inclination .
That ’s one reason why one of the film ’s producers , Nicolas Chartier , found it easier to raise the funds for “ The Hurt Locker ” by selling the foreign rights than from Hollywood studios .
“ When you meet foreign audiences , you could see there ’s a deep appreciation for her work , maybe even more so than in the U.S. , ” said another of the movie ’s producers , Greg Shapiro .
In Hollywood , few women like to be singled out as female directors per se .
Bigelow declined to be interviewed for this article for that reason , her publicist said .
Although successful female directors appear to have gained higher profiles of late , the actual percentage of top films directed by women has remained static for 25 years at 7 % to 9 % , according to an annual study of women writers , directors , and producers of the 250 top - grossing films of the year by the Center for the Study of Women in Film and Television at San Diego State University .
“ We ’re running in place .
There ’s been no progress since 1987 , ” said Martha Lauzen , the center ’s executive director .
For instance , neither Warner Bros. , the world ’s largest studio , nor Paramount Pictures hired a single female director last year , while Walt Disney Studios and Universal Studios hired just one apiece .
No woman has ever been hired to direct an event picture with a budget of more than $ 100 million , the kind of film most valued by the Hollywood machine .
Whether the director of a film is a man or a woman has a correlation to how many women appear in the film .
The population might be more than 50 % female , but actresses nabbed only 29.9 % of the 4,379 speaking parts in the 100 top - grossing films of 2007 , according to a recently released study by Stacy L. Smith , a professor at the Annenberg School for Communications & Journalism at USC .
Only 2.7 % of the directors on those films were women , but when they did step behind the camera , the percentage of female characters jumped dramatically , to as high as 44.6 % , compared with 29.3 % when the director was a man .
Moreover , Smith said , the proportion of women on screen literally “ has n’t changed since the 1940s .
It ’s disheartening at best . ”
Smith also discovered that women tended to be portrayed as “ eye- candy . ”
Women were more likely to be shown in scanty clothing ( 27 % vs. 4.6 % for men ) or displaying mild nudity , such as cleavage or thighs ( 21.8 % vs 6.6 % for guys ) .
Smith noted that Hollywood ’s depiction of gender does affect attitudes in the culture , particularly among the young , re-enforcing the idea that “ stories about women are not as important as stories about men .
Some of the [ research ] about youth has shown that showing a limited range of occupations on screen is correlated with having restricted range of aspirations . ”
But gender is a touchy subject for many women in Hollywood .
Anne Fletcher , who directed the box office smash “ The Proposal ” as well as the hit “ 27 Dresses , ” says , “ I never think of gender , ever .
For me , I ’ve never in my entire career experienced sexism . ”
Jane Campion , who won an Oscar for writing “ The Piano , ” acknowledges the relative paucity of female directors .
“ It must be some kind of glass ceiling .
I look at women studying law or medicine .
They sit for the exams , and they get the result , ” and they get good jobs .
But she says she does n’t give it much thought .
“ I just see [ the films ] as my work , ” she said .
“ I think every filmmaker or artist comes from that point of view .
My guy friends do n’t say , ‘ This is my masculine work . ’
Of course , [ films ] are going to be an expression of everything about you , but it ’s limiting or ghettoizing to always say , because [ you ’re a woman ] , that first you ’re a woman filmmaker . ”
Campion is one of only three women besides Bigelow who have been nominated for the directing Oscar .
She was nominated in 1994 for “ The Piano . ” Italy ’s Lina Wertmuller was the first , for directing the 1975 film “ Seven Beauties . ”
Sofia Coppola landed the nod for “ Lost in Translation ” in 2004 .
Catherine Hardwicke is the only female director to launch a successful franchise .
Although “ Twilight ” grossed $ 385 million at the global box office , Hardwicke has found it hard to set up her next film , but acknowledges that , like many male directors , she also has run smack into Hollywood ’s recent belt - tightening , with studios dramatically cutting the number of films released .
But she acknowledges that there ’s a gender factor .
“ One producer was candid enough to say ‘ We want to go to a guy , ’ ” she said .
“ Other times you just feel it by the questions they ask you , or by not getting the meeting .
A lot of people think that women ca n’t do [ special ] effects .
That was my first job when I came to Hollywood , working in an effects house ! ”
After several projects failed to get greenlighted , Hardwicke is now waiting to begin “ The Girl With the Red Riding Hood , ” a gothic retake on the classic tale , based on an idea from Leonardo DiCaprio ( who ’s also producing ) and starring Amanda Seyfried .
One apparent growth arena for women is in working for other women .
Streep , for instance , told The Times that she attributes her box office renaissance to the fact that she opted to do three films , “ Mamma Mia , ” “ Julie & Julia , ” and “ It ’s Complicated , ” that were written and directed by women , as well as backed by studios with women as presidents of production or even higher in rank .
Certainly , the fact that Bigelow is in the running for the Oscar has caused excitement and joy among many of her fellow directors who happen to be women .
“ I ’m deeply , deeply moved , ” says director Julie Anne Robinson , whose Disney film , “ The Last Song , ” opens this month .
“ When I first started getting the [ Directors Guild ] magazine , I would turn the pages and there would not be one woman face in the entire magazine .
It was a standing joke .
Honestly , it went on for months and months .
To see a woman up there at the Oscars , it ’s a dream come true .
It ’s fantastically inspirational to see that . ”
“ I ’ve kept track of the previous three women who ’d been nominated for the [ directing ] Oscar , ” says writer - director Shana Feste , whose Sundance film “ The Greatest ” debuts in theaters in April .
“ I get tears in my eyes thinking about it .
I ’m rooting for her , man . ”

Brian Murphy , a history professor at Baruch College in New York , knows a whole lot about corporations in the early days of the American republic .
When the Supreme Court struck down restrictions on political spending by corporations in January , the ruling ( pdf ! ) struck him as dramatically at odds with how the Founding Fathers saw the role of the corporation .
As he put it in a comment to this blog :
The majority opinion is discovering corporate rights in a Constitution written by people with a dramatically different conception of corporate power and the limits thereof , and an understanding of citizenship as something based on accountability and membership in civil society .
That intrigued me , and an e-mail discussion with Murphy followed .
After writing that it would be nice to hear more from historians in today ’s economic debates , it seems only right to hand the podium over to a historian , so here ’s a slightly condensed version of our virtual chat .
Q : The corporations of the early days of the republic were very different beasts than those of today .
They seem to have been creatures of government — or at least of politicians — right ?
A : That ’s right .
Americans inherited the legal form of the corporation from Britain , where it was bestowed as a royal privilege on certain institutions or , more often , used to organize municipal governments .
Just after the Revolution , new state legislators had to decide what to do about these charters .
They could abolish them entirely , or find a way to democratize them and make them compatible with the spirit of independence and the structure of the federal republic .
They chose the latter .
So the first American corporations end up being cities and schools , along with some charitable organizations .
We do n’t really begin to see economic enterprises chartered as corporations until the 1790s .
Some are banks , others are companies that were going to build canals , turnpikes , and bridges — infrastructure projects that states did not have the money to build themselves .
Citizens petitioned legislators for a corporate charter , and if a critical mass of political pressure could build in a capital , they got an act of incorporation .
It specified their capitalization limitations , limited their lifespan , and dictated the boundaries of their operations and functions .
I should add , too , that as part of this effort to democratize corporations , state charters specifically spelled out how shareholder elections were to be conducted to choose directors .
Corporations were supposed to resemble small republics , with directors balancing interests among shareholders .
When they printed material or conducted correspondence , it was usually in the name of the “ President , Directors , and Shareholders of the X Company . ”
A couple months ago the Supreme Court ruled that restricting corporate political spending amounted to restricting free speech .
In this view , corporations are pretty much equivalent to people .
Would that have seemed reasonable to the Founding Fathers ?
In a word , no .
I read this opinion carefully — I ’m trained as a historian , not a lawyer .
Chief Justice Roberts lays out an ideologically pure view of corporations as associations of citizens — leveling differences between companies , schools and other groups .
So in his view Boeing is no different from Harvard , which is no different from the NAACP , or Citizens United , or my local neighborhood civic association .
It ’s lovely prose , but as a matter of history the majority is simply wrong .
Let me put it this way : the Founders did not confuse Boston ’s Sons of Liberty with the British East India Company .
They could distinguish among different varieties of association — and they understood that corporate personhood was a legal fiction that was limited to a courtroom .
It was n’t literal .
Corporations could not vote or hold office .
They held property , and to enable a shifting group of shareholders to hold that property over time and to sue and be sued in court , they were granted this fictive personhood in a limited legal context .
Early Americans had a far more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of corporations than the Court gives them credit for .
They were much more comfortable with retaining pre-Revolutionary city or school charters than with creating new corporations that would concentrate economic and political power in potentially unaccountable institutions .
When you read Madison in particular , you see that he was n’t blindly hostile to banks during his fight with Alexander Hamilton over the Bank of the United States .
Instead , he ’s worried about the unchecked power of accumulations of capital that come with creating a class of bankers .
So even as this generation of Americans became comfortable with the idea of using the corporate form as a way to set priorities and mobilize capital , they did their best to make sure that those institutions were subordinate to elected officials and representative government .
They saw corporations as corrupting influences on both the economy at large and on government — that ’s why they described the East India Company as imperium in imperio , a sort of “ state within a state . ”
This was n’t an outcome they were looking to replicate .
What changed in the interim ?
Well , we have a Civil War , and to prevent former Confederate states from infringing on the rights of freed slaves , the 14th Amendment extends “ equal protection ” to all American citizens .
Section 1 specifies that this applies to all “ persons ” and in an 1886 Supreme Court case involving a railroad , the court ’s reporter — a former railroad president — writes a note saying that the justices agreed that a corporation qualified as a person .
This is n’t in the opinion itself , and some legal historians think it ’s a moot issue , but Justices William Douglas and Hugo Black later cite it as a momentous event .
Either way , what ’s clear is that in the late 19th century , far more equal protection cases were heard by the Supreme Court where corporations were plaintiffs than freedmen .
The Court — not the legislatures or the Congress — allowed the personhood distinction to slip away .
Some legal scholars defend the granting of personhood to corporations as a useful innovation — it allows corporations to enter into contracts , for instance .
Do they have a point ?
Yes .
One of the original purposes of corporate charters in the United States was to allow groups of people to file lawsuits , and be sued , in courts .
But it was n’t absolutely necessary — if you and your partners formed a joint - stock company , you created an entity that had bylaws and directors and could enter into contracts and enforce them in courts .
What the corporate charter did was grant additional privileges to this basic joint - stock company framework .
In the case of state - sanctioned infrastructure projects — turnpikes and bridges — corporations usually held monopolies or exclusive rights of some kind .
In the case of early American banks , their biggest privilege was limited liability and favored status as deposit institutions for state revenues , which usually gave them de facto monopolies .
So the corporation does n’t merely arise because it ’s a convenient legal form .
Instead , it was a useful tool for capital formation because it carried economic privileges that protected investors and enabled them to externalize all kinds of risks and costs .
That ’s why charters are difficult to obtain in early America .
You have to spend political capital to get one passed through two legislative houses and signed by a governor ’s pen .
When general incorporation acts are eventually adopted by states in the early nineteenth century , the states ’ intent is to level the playing field and disentangle themselves from the political power — and burden — of choosing among rival groups of charter - seekers .
The intent of these laws is therefore the opposite of what the Court asserted in Citizens United .
Free incorporation was meant to limit the power of corporations by democratizing the corporate form through dilution .
It was supposed to be a giant leap in distinguishing between public and private spheres of activity .

Good evening everybody and welcome to our minute - by - minute coverage of the second leg of Barcelona v Inter in the Champions League semi-final , with the tie nicely poised at half - time .
Internazionale take a two - goal lead into tonight 's match , having won the first leg 3 - 1 at the San Siro in a fascinating match that culminated in a comically petulant display from Mario Balotelli , which you can study in all its glory here .
In the pre-match build - up , Inter manager Jose Mourinho has been busily peddling his unique brand of nonsensical waffle masquerading as profundity and as usual the press pack have been hungrily lapping it up .
The Special One thinks
Inter are in the box - seat tonight because they only " dream " of winning the Champions League , while winning it at Real Madrid 's home ground , the Bernabeu , at the end of this season has become " an obsession " for Barcelona .
Obviously anyone with even a passing acqaintance with Massimo Moratti will know that Mourinho is talking complete cobblers - if anyone involved in tonight 's match is obsessed with winning the Champions League it 's Inter 's president .
" The final is more than just a dream for us , " he said yesterday , temporarily forcing his manager back into his box with a long overdue slapdown .
Team news : Jose Mourinho puts out the same 11 who started the first leg , while Pep Guardiola makes two changes : Yaya Toure and Gabriel Milito come in for Carles Puyol ( suspended ) and Maxwell ( dropped ) .
Toure will operate as midfield anchor , which means that Seydou Keito has to move to left - back .
Gabriel Milito starts at centre - back , where he will be hoping to put a stop to the gallop of his older brother Diego , who plays up front for Inter .
Barcelona : Valdes , Dani Alves , Pique , Milito , Keita , Xavi ,
Toure Yaya , Busquets , Pedro , Ibrahimovic , Messi .
Subs : Pinto , Marquez , Bojan , Henry , Maxwell , Thiago , Jeffren .
Inter : Julio Cesar , Maicon , Lucio , Samuel , Zanetti ,
Cambiasso , Motta , Eto'o , Sneijder , Pandev , Milito .
Subs : Toldo , Cordoba , Muntari , Mariga , Materazzi , Chivu , Balotelli .
Referee : Frank De Bleeckere ( Belgium )
Pre-match emails : " Barry , I 'll think you 'll find Mourinho 's a genius , " writes Harvey Kelly .
" And you 're not .
He 's only marginally more successful and knows only slightly less about football than your good self . "
Ooh , this one 's good .
" I 've been looking forward to this match all week but now my wife has been selfish enough to go into labour tonight , thus presenting a problem regards watching the match as the birth of my child rapidly approaches , " writes Paul Jaines , who alone among minute - by - minute writers , appears to have had sex in the past nine months and is rightfully boasting about it .
" Thankfully we are having a home birth which means I have access to tv , computer etc - but do you think it would be bad form to have the match on TV while she is in the birthing pool ? "
Why not just put the birthing pool in front of the TV and then fill it ?
It 'll be too heavy to move and if the baby does n't arrive in the next few hours you wo n't have to vacate it before full - time to let your wife in .
Tactical shenanigans : According to ITV 's team line - up graphic , Barcelona are going to be playing a 3 - 4 - 3 tonight , with Pique , Milito and Toure across the back .
That 's the kind of news that would excite my colleague Jonathan Wilson , but I have to say it leaves me cold .
I suppose time will tell if they 're right or not .
" Pep Guardiola 's made quite a start to his management career , but this other fellow [ Mourinho ] is a trophy machine , " says ITV anchor Matt Smith as he goes to an advert break .
Trophies won by Pep Guardiola in one season : 7 . Trophies won by Trophy Machine in 10 seasons : 13 . Hmmm ...
This is interesting : Jose Mourinho has apparently announced that Goran Pandev is " injured " and replaced him with Christian Chivu in the starting line - up .
That 's a defender for a winger , with the obvious suggestion being that Mourinho has seen the Barcelona line - up and changed his own to suit it without having to waste a substitution .
Oh dear sweet God , if this has any obvious bearing on the result the UK press will shove their collective tongue so far up his jacksy the groans of pleasure - from both ends - will be deafening .
Not long now :
The teams are out , the 96,000 home fans are rocking Camp Nou and ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley 's banal nonsense is already getting on my nerves .
He 's talking about T - shirts Barcelona 's players wore after their La Liga win last weekend , which he thinks bore slogans promising their fans they'd " quite literally play out of their skins tonight " .
That should make for interesting , if not a little gory viewing .
Speaking of skins , Inter wear all white tonight , while Barcelona wear their usual home strip .
1 min : They 're off .
Barcelona win a free - kick in the Inter left - back position within a minute .
Xavi lifts it in towards Seydou Keita at the far post , but it 's put out for a corner from which nothing comes .
2 min : For Barcelona , Pedro cuts inside Maicon from the left flank and tries a shot from the edge of the area .
Wide , but not by much .
4 min : Barca have lined up in a 4 - 3 - 3 with Toure and Pique in the centre - back berths and Dani Alves and Gabriel Milito playing at right and left - back respectively .
For Inter , Christian Chivu has gone in on the left wing as a direct replacement for the injured Pandev .
That 'll upset the conspiracy theorists .
7 min : Barca play it long from the back , Ibrahimovic leaps and skims the ball wide off the top of his head .
Goal - kick for Inter .
8 min : Lionel Messi tries his first darting run from the centre - circle , only to get knocked off the ball by his international team - mate Esteban Cambiasso .
9 min : Barca are enjoying most of the possession at the moment , unsurprisingly , but are n't doing a great deal with it beyond probing the area between midfield and the edge of the Inter box looking for openings .
10 min : Thiago Motta gets booked for a trip on Dani Alves .
Free - kick for Barca about five yards outside the Inter area , near the angle .
10 min : Messi crosses the ball to the far post and the referee blows for an infringement in the penalty area .
He awards Lucio a free - kick for a foul by Ibrahimovic but remains unmoved when Ibrahimovic shows him that the front of his shirt has been ripped open by the defender .
12 min : Contesting a ball with Messi , Maicon injures his shoulder after sliding into an advertising hoarding .
Play is held up as he receives treatment .
14 min : " Thanks for doing this , but can you have your IT people add the auto - refresh button on the page ? " asks Dave Hill .
" I 'm clicking my computer 's refresh button way too much .
Thanks . "
I 'm very sorry for your trouble , Dave .
Sit tight there and I 'll just summon my personal coterie of IT " people " .
After all , it 's not like I 'm busy doing anything else at the moment and I 'd hate to see you put out by the inconvenience of having to click a mouse every now and again .
16 min :
In the Barcelona half of the middle third , Pique is penalised for brushing against Diego Milito , who falls over as if shot by a sniper .
Nothing comes from the free - kick .
18 min : Ibrahimovic is penalised for handball on the right - hand side of the Inter penalty area after controlling a pass with his upper-arm .
Craven plea to certain readers who know who they are : please stop mailing me lengthy missives enquiring about the whereabouts of the auto - refresh button .
It 's there now and the incessant whingeing of lazy spoilt people is drowning out the big match atmosphere .
20 min : While I feel slightly embarrassed by even suggesting to Xavi Hernandez how he should play football , it 's worth noting that he just tried to pick out Ibra with a dinky pass from the edge of the penalty area , when I think he should have shot .
It 's a view I offer reluctantly , for obvious reasons , but one that 's been confirmed by the sight of his attempted pass being intercepted by a defender .
23 min :
The ball refuses to sit nicely for Xavi as he careers through the Inter penalty area and tries to offload to Ibra .
Inter clear .
23 min : Dani Alves sends in a cross which the unmarked Pedro Rodriguez tries to half - volley home from 14 yards .
With Inter goalkeeper Julio Cesar anchored to his line , the ball fizzes wide , but not by much .
25 min : Inter finally get forward and the ball is pinged out to the right flank , where Samuel Eto'o is standing alone in acres of space .
Between them , Gabriel Milito and Gerard Pique manage to force him to run the ball out of play .
26 min :
The red card is out !
Inter 's Thiago Motta gets sent off for shoving his flat hand into the face of Sergio Busquets .
He got his opponent in the face , but Busquets went down very easily , holding his face ... then had a little peek at the referee to see if he'd be giving Motta his second booking .
Have these ladies got no shame ?
Seriously ?
29 min : Motta goes off ... eventually ... trying to start a couple of scraps on his way .
He 's not one bit happy and cuffs Busquets for being a drama queen and making sure he got the red card .
It was a soft one alright , but he really only had himself to blame .
Inter will have to make do with 10 men for the next hour .
30 min : Barca attack down the left wing and Pedro tries to send in a cross .
It hits Lucio , prompting the fans behind the goal to appeal for a penalty for handball .
None is forthcoming , which is just as well because the ball struck his midrift .
33 min : A fantastic save from Julio Cesar , who dives low to his right to tip a rasper from Lionel Messi around the upright .
That was real Roy of the Rovers stuff .
Messi had dashed from right to left across the face of the penalty area before unleashing his shot and bringing a sensational save out of the Inter goalkeeper .
34 min : With Barcelona on a promising attack , Ibrahimovic gives the ball away to Wesley Sneijder and then concedes a free - kick while trying to win it back .
AThe best thing you could say about his performance so far is that at least he was trying to win it back , I suppose .
36 min : Julio Cesar gets booked for time - wasting ... in the 36th minute .
For all their domination of possession , Barcelona are creating very little .
They do n't seem to be eviscerating the Inter defence with their usual verve and are losing possession more often than you 'd expect as a result of misplaced passes and poor touches .
Even with Inter down to 10 men , this might not be their night .
38 min : Alves gets in around the back of Inter 's defence and tries to tee up Ibrahimovic , whose shot from eight yards is blocked by Walter Samuel .
39 min : Barca win another free - kick in the Inter left - back position , for an Eto'o foul on Messi .
The Argentinian lofts a cross towardss the far post , but there 's too much welly on it and it sails out for a goal - kick .
Actually make that a free - kick , the ref's spotted another infringement in the area .
41 min : Predictably enough for a 10 - man team managed by Jose Mourinho , Inter 's players are going to ground and pretending they 're injured at every opportunity .
Chivu is the latest to drop - and - roll after jumping near Lionel Messi .
43 min : With Sneijder down " injured " , Barcelona refuse to put the ball out of play and Messi gallops towards the edge of their penalty area , where he 's chopped down by Chivu .
The defender gets booked for his trouble .
Ibrahimovic shoots from 35 yards and his effort swerves wildly in the air before fizzing wide of the left post .
44 min : Barcelona continue to pass the ball around the edge of the Internazionale area , trying to create an opening .
Eventually they win a free - kick a good distance from goal near the right touchline .
Messi lofts it towards Busquets , but Lucio clears .
44+1 min : Yaya
Toure tries two wild shots from distance in quick succession , one of them from a ridiculously narrow angle .
ITV 's match analyst Jim Beglin makes the astute point that when Barcelona players start doing that it 's usually a sign they 're running out of ideas .
Of course when I start quoting ITV match analysts , it 's usually a sign that I 'm running out of ideas .
Half - time
Grace Pickering writes : " Re : your comment at 26 Mins regarding ' ladies ' .
Aside from the tired and lazy sexism , surely it 's inaccurate - I thought all you fellas grumbled that we do n't go down easily enough ? "
That 's a fair point , well made Grace .
I apologise .
Oooh ... look .
A Gallery of this match that 's being added to by my " people " in the photo library as the game progresses .
You 'll have to click on it to see it , mind .
I realise that many of you consider such effort to be far too great of an imposition on your very valuable time and would like to apologise for any incovenience caused by our speedy , free service .
Half - time analysis : " Seriously , what do you have against Mourinho , " asks Halilu Remawa , one of many members of the Jose Mourinho fanclub who appear unable to distinguish between criticism of Mourinho and criticism of reporters who treat his every utterance , however banal , as the word of God .
I have nothing against Mourinho , I just think he 's a very good manager who 's nowhere near as clever , amusing or intelligent as his cheerleaders in the UK press would have us all believe .
Second half : Barcelona 's players have been ready to start the second half for several minutes , while Inter 's are emerging from the tunnel in dribs and drabs .
Barca make one change for the second half , with Maxwell , who I incorrectly thought was suspended , replacing ... somebody .
I 'll find out who in a moment .
48 min : Maxwell is on for Gabriel Milito .
My expectations for this half are not high - if Barcelona continue playing the way have been , they have n't a hope of dragging themselves back into contention .
They 're sluggish , things are n't going their way and Inter are down to 10 men , which in a strange backs - against - the - wall kind of way , probably suits them better in this situation than having their full complement of players .
49 min : " Do you think you could describe the picture gallery MBM style to save my poor clicking finger ? " asks Alex Carey , who is quickly trumped by somebody else who wants to know if I 'll post them up as gifs instead of jpegs .
51 min : Xavi plays a long ball from the halfway line towards the edge of the Inter penalty area , which Seydou Keita tries to head down for Ibrahimovic .
Inter hack clear .
54 min : Xavi plays the ball into the Inter penalty area , Ibrahimovic gets goalside of Lucio and goes down .
Julio Cesar rushes off his line to claim the ball and Lucio orders Ibra to his feet , telling him to " stop acting the bollix " ( I'm paraphrasing there ) .
55 min : Made - up stats .
Chances of Inter scoring a goal in the next 35 minutes : 0 . Chances of Barcelona scoring any time soon if they do n't up their game : 0 . This is truly awful - Inter are squeezing the life out of this game .
They 've every right to do so , but it sure ain't purdy .
57 min :
The final word on whether or not Jose Mourinho is a genius goes to Gary Naylor , whose results are inconclusive : " I 'm certain that ( i ) Mourinho knows better than anyone how to play Barcelona with ten men ; ( ii ) he will have communicated that to his players precisely .
If genius is doing the simplest things in the simplest way , Mourinho is a genius . "
60 min :
The ball goes out for a corner off Maicon , but the referee awards a goal - kick to Inter .
Despite being on a yellow card , Julio Cesar dawdles over it in a bid to waste time .
I would laugh like a drain if he got sent off on the back of two bookings for time - wasting .
61 min : Barcelona continue to press and press , but 10 - man Inter soak up the pressure with consumate ease .
Messi goes on a ferrety run through the centre , but is crowded off the ball by Lucio and Chivu , who is wearing his scrum - cap with the flap hanging down so that he bears a passing resemblance to Biggles .
Tally ho , chaps !
63 min : Barcelona double substitution : YouTube Sensation And Big Game Bottler Zlatan Ibrahimovic +
Busquets off , Bojan + Jeffren on .
Now the referee is over giving Jose Mourinho a ticking - off for the heinous crime of leaving his technical area to give instruction to Chivu .
Up with this he will not put .
65 min : Barcelona win a corner , which Xavi sends in to the mixer .
Lucio heads clear .
Internazionale substitution : Wesley Sneijder off , Sulley Muntari on .
67 min :
This is painful viewing , so be grateful you 're not watching it unless you 're one of the disturbing number of weirdos who reads minute - by - minute reports on the internet while simultaneously watching on TV , just so you can send in angry emails detailing any little mistake you happen to spot .
69 min : Dani Alves floats in a cross from the right channel , aiming for Seydou Keita .
Lucio leaps , heads clear , lands on the ground and takes another 30 seconds out of the clock by feigning injury .
71 min : Sensational !
This is absolutely sensational !
Inter have won ... a corner .
72 min : Meh .
Diego Milito arrows it into the penalty area , where Lucio is penalised for some manner of infringement or other .
73 min : Just over 15 minutes to go and Barcelona need to score two goals .
The way they 're going at the moment , they could continue playing until midnight and not score .
Their Plan A is n't working and their Plan B is sitting on the bench ruing another wasted opportunity to show everybody that he 's not a complete over - rated choker .
75 min : Lucio , Maicon , Cambiasso and Zanetti take turns in heading the ball out of the Inter penalty area , which is n't very difficult for them considering Barca 's two strikers have a combined height of less than one Zlatan Ibrahimovic .
Barcelona are pressing them continuously , but Inter are repelling their attacks with ease .
It 's almost as if Barca are resigned to losing and are just sending in cross after cross in a bid to be seen to be doing something .
77 min : A Barcelona player stands within a yard of Maicon , who immediately goes to ground holding his shin .
The referee signals to him to get up .
78 min : Jeffran gets in behind the Inter defence and squares the ball across the edge of the six - yard box , where there should be a queue of Barca players waiting to poke it home .
There is n't .
Bojan eventually shoots wide from a narrow angle - they should have pulled a goal back there .
80 min : Pep Guardiola sends central - defender Gerard Pique up to play centre - forward .
On ITV , Jim Beglin says he could have left Ibrahimovic there if he needed somebody tall up front .
Surely , I can't be the only one who'd rather have a centre - half playing up front on my team than Zlatan Ibrahimovic ?
This is a big game after all , not the sort of environment in which Zlatan thrives .
83 min : Oh , that 's a woeful miss .
Unmarked and on the end of a Messi cross from the left , Bojan heads wide from six yards with half the goal gaping .
That 's terrible .
He should have pulled one back for Barca there .
GOAL !
BARCELONA 1-0 INTER ( AGG : 2 -3 ) ( PIQUE 84 ) Game on , at last !
Makeshift centre - forward Gerard Pique shows the Big Game Bottler Other Big Game Bottlers doff their hats to how it 's done by picking up a defence - splitting through - ball from Xavi , drawing Julio Cesar towards him , turning on a sixpence and slotting the ball into an empty goal from 12 yards .
That 's a great finish .
86 min : Having halved their deficit , Barcelona are attacking with renewed vigour .
That finish from Pique was marvellous and has really buoyed his team and its fans .
They need another goal to make it through to the final and have four minutes and whatever extra time the ref adds on to get it .
87 min : Xavi and Messi take shots on goal in quick succession .
Xavi's effort is parried by Julio Cesar , while Messi fires the ball straight at him .
88 min : Barcelona stroke the ball around the edge of the Inter penalty , before Dani Alves goes down under a challenge from Sully Muntari while trying to run on to a through - ball from Messi .
Alves appeals for a penalty , but does n't get one .
His arm was being held by Muntari who let go of it as he entered the penalty area .
Alves decided to take a dive anyway .
90 + 1 min : Barcelona score the important goal courtesy of Bojan , but it 's disallowed because of a Yaya Toure handball in the build - up .
That 's a harsh decision - it was very much ball - to - hand as an attempted clearance struck him after being fired from point - blank range ; there was nothing he could do about it .
92 min : Two minutes to go and Barcelona are still trying to pass and play their way out of trouble .
90+3 min : Alves sends in two crosses from the right in quick succession , both of which are cleared by Maicon .
Barcelona win a corner .
90+4 min : It 's all over .
Xavi plays it short to Messi , who squares the ball for Alves outside the penalty area .
He pings it into the box , it 's hacked clear and the referee blows for full - time .
Barcelona are out and Internazionale have qualified for the final , where they 'll meet Bayern Munich .
Post - match niceties :
With weeping Barcelona players strewn around the battlefield like corpses on the set of Braveheart and Inter 's players celebrating wildly , Jose Mourinho sprints on to the pitch with one arm raised before giving it the full Messiah in the centre - circle .
Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes tries to drag him away before he antagonises too many Barcelona fans , but Mourinho ignores him .
He 's loving this .
Post - match analysis : " That was a triumph for Mourinho 's style of management , " writes Henry Shawdon .
" I cant wait to get that quality of shirt - pulling , injury - feigning , time - wasting and transcendental negativity back in the Premiership . "
Gary McFarlane claimed he was discriminated against as a Christian A relationship counsellor 's bid to challenge his sacking for refusing to give sex therapy to gay couples has been turned down by the High Court .
Gary McFarlane , 48 , from Bristol , was sacked by Relate Avon in 2008 .
He claimed the service had refused to accommodate his Christian beliefs .
Lord Justice
Laws said legislation for the protection of views held purely on religious grounds cannot be justified .
He said it was irrational and " also divisive , capricious and arbitrary " .
' Strongly - held '
Mr McFarlane said after the hearing that the decision not to let him appeal against the ruling left him " disappointed and upset " .
" I have the ability to provide counselling services to same - sex couples , " he said .
" However , because of my Christian beliefs and principles , there should be allowances taken into account whereby individuals like me can actually avoid having to contradict their very strongly - held Christian principles . "

More from BBC Radio 5 live Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey had earlier called for judges with a " proven sensitivity and understanding of religious issues " to hear the case .
Lord Carey said recent decisions involving Christians by the courts had used " dangerous " reasoning and this could lead to civil unrest .
Lord Justice Laws said Lord Carey 's views were " misplaced " and judges had never likened Christians to bigots , or sought to equate condemnation by some Christians of homosexuality with homophobia .
He said it was possible that Lord Carey 's " mistaken suggestions " arose from a misunderstanding of the law on discrimination .
As to his concerns over a lack of sensitivity on the part of the judiciary , Lord Justice Laws said this appeared to be an argument that the courts ought to be more sympathetic to the substance of Christian beliefs and be ready to uphold and defend them .
' Respecting all clients '
Mr McFarlane started training with Relate in May 2003 and said he enjoyed good relationships with clients and colleagues .
He was suspended in October 2007 after meetings with his manager , in which he claimed he was asked to state his views regarding same - sex couples .
He was later sacked .
Last November Mr McFarlane lost his appeal against unfair dismissal .
Relate chief executive Claire Tyler said : " This judgement validates , once again , Relate 's commitment to providing all members of the public full access to our services .
" [ We help ] 150,000 clients each year and nothing can damage or undermine the principles of trust and respect that underpins our work . "
Terry Sanderson , president of the National Secular Society , said the law must be clear that anti-discrimination laws exist to protect people , not beliefs .
Personal prejudice " The right to follow a religious belief is a qualified right and it must not be used to legitimise discrimination against gay people . "
Derek Munn , a director at gay pressure group Stonewall , said : " People delivering public services must n't be able to pick and choose who they will serve on the basis of personal prejudice .
But Andrea Williams , director of the Christian Legal Centre , said : " Mr McFarlane simply wanted his religious beliefs to be accommodated by his employer , which , in the specific facts of the case , was not unreasonable .
" It seems that a religious bar to office has been created , whereby a Christian who wishes to act on their Christian beliefs on marriage will no longer be able to work in a great number of environments . "

Last week the University of California CIO , Peter Siegel , and several IT council members sent a letter to staff that they have decided to end their GMail pilot .
The goal was to make GMail the primary mail system for the 30,000 faculty and staff at the University .
But the faculty expressed doubt that Google could keep their correspondences private .
Jeff Keltner , a business development manager in the Google Apps for Education group told InformationWeek " Obviously there 's lots of opinions and voices on campuses .
By and large , it 's not typical of what we 're seeing in the market .
We 're seeing lots of schools move their students and faculty onto Gmail , " said Keltner , who also noted that UC Davis students are continuing to use the service and that Gmail users ' privacy is protected by contractual assurances that govern data handling . "
Part of the concern expressed by the university was the privacy problems that came up with Google Buzz when it was released .
When Google Buzz was released users who chose to enable it gave anyone they followed a peek into who they emailed and chatted with the most .
This was fixed pretty quickly by Google but was still a factor in the Universities decision .
The University IT leaders also said that after review policies they found it may violate the UC Electronic Communications Policy which forbids the university from disclosing or examining the contents of e-mails without the account holder 's consent , and from distributing the e-mails to third parties .
This announcement is a blow to Google who is trying to expand it 's presence in the enterprise market .

BIGGEST INCREASES BIGGEST INCREASES
Ten metro areas with the biggest percentage gains in median prices for existing single - family homes .
Change from first quarter 2010 vs. the same quarter a year ago : Metropolitan area Saginaw - Saginaw Twp. , Mich .
100.7 % Akron , Ohio 90.2 % Cleveland - Elyria - Mentor , Ohio 53.8 % San Francisco - Oakland - Fremont 28.9 % Grand Rapids , Mich .
26.0 % San Jose - Sunnyvale - Santa Clara , Calif . 24.4 % Dayton , Ohio 22.8 % Memphis 18.5 % Gary - Hammond , Ind. 18.3 % Elmira , N.Y. 17.8 % Source : National Association of Realtors
Home prices are widely expected to fall now that a tax credit for home buyers has expired .
That 's raising concern about a possible double dip in home prices .
National housing prices stopped falling early last year and rose 0.3 % over the 12 months ending in February , according to a study by real estate analytics firm CoreLogic .
The firm predicts prices will fall this year before starting to rise again in late 2010 .
Even so , next February 's prices are likely to be 4.2 % lower , it forecasts .
HOME PRICES : Median price up in 60 % of cities in 1Q CHARTS : Housing industry 's boom , bust and forecast " Home prices will struggle for maybe another year , " says Mark Fleming , CoreLogic 's chief economist .
A shrunken pool of buyers due to the tax credit 's expiration is one reason .
" The tax credit is the big reason home prices have been so buoyant , and sales will drop " with its expiration , says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics .
" You will see a double dip in housing prices . "
Another reason is the number of distressed houses — including foreclosures and short sales — that are on the market or that will be in coming months .
Distressed homes , typically sold at discounted prices , accounted for 36 % of first - quarter sales , the National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday .
The first quarter 's median single - family home price ( $ 166,100 ) was roughly flat with a year earlier , despite gains in nearly two - thirds of 152 metro areas that the NAR surveys .
The NAR 's survey is n't the first to show evidence of softening prices .
The 20 - city Standard & Poor 's / Case - Shiller Home Price Index has fallen for five - consecutive months through February .
" It is too early to say the housing market is recovering , " David Blitzer , chairman of S&P 's index committee , said when the Case - Shiller report for February was released last month .
There may be some good news for sellers in areas not hit so hard by foreclosures .
When distressed sales are excluded , CoreLogic 's Home Price Index shows a 4.9 % rise in U.S. prices from this February through next February .
While some economists expect home prices to weaken , they do n't expect a major drop .
" I would n't expect anything like the meltdown we 've had over the past couple years , " says Jay Feldman , senior economist at Credit Suisse .

Computer history part Ten - Laptops and Portables - Teleram Corporation
As a result of my job in the News Industry , I have been involved with many laptops and portable computers over the years .
While this will not be a definitive history , or even close , I want to share a few of the originals , plus a couple that , well , I just happen to have .
You can click on most of these pictures for a full size view .
Use your Back button to return .
The Teleram P-1800 Portable Terminal This is the original Teleram P-1800 .
It was introduced sometime in the middle to late 1970s .
While technically a portable terminal , it had many of the features that make a laptop .
Built in Word - processing ( Via hard - wired logic ) , ram storage for text .
Mass storage ( a Data Cassette drive ) , and modem capabilities ( via an acoustic coupler ) .
OK , a stretch , but this is one of a handful of machines that marked the transition from paper , pencil , and telephone dictation ( or messenger ) , to electronic word processing in the field .
This is the front of the P - 1800 .
On the left is a black & white 7 " monitor which displays 43 columns by 14 rows of text .
On the right is the Data Cassette .
This uses standard sized cassette tapes , but they were specially formatted for the Teleram with indexing information which divided them into blocks .
There were no provisions on the unit to format the tapes , nor did we in the tech department have the ability .
We had to purchase them from Teleram .
In the center is the power switch , Brightness & Contrast controls , and 12 status indicator lights .
Below the Tape drive is a 2 digit block counter , and status for read , write , eot , and cassette in place .
This is a close - up view of the side connector panel .
Note that besides the AC power cord , it has a provision for a 12 volt power cord .
There was a full EIA RS - 232 output via the DB - 25 connector for connection to a modem , or use as a terminal .
The small D - style connector was for the acoustic coupler and 300 baud modem .
The coupler allowed you to place a telephone handset in it for transmission at 300 baud .
The transmissions were one way only . ,
The unit had no provisions for receiving data via modem or RS - 232 .
The small blue connector was for connection to a printer .
The knob selected the Baud rate 110 to 1200 baud , and there is a small switch next to it to select parity .
The ribbon cable at the bottom goes to the keyboard .
Here is a view looking in from the top .
You can see the unit was incredibly packed with electronics .
There were four main circuit boards , which you can see on the bottom of this shot .
There were a few other smaller boards .
One unusual part was the fan , which is plainly visible .
Run from a small DC motor , anything heavy set on top of the unit would case the case to hit the fan , stopping it , or making a large racket .
This unit has been sitting in the shop for a long time .
Note the rust on the screws !
The horizontal board above the monitor is for a Teletypsetter code option that was used for newspaper operations .
In the center was the power supply .
That round thing is the main filter capacitor .
Most of the bottom of the unit was solid .
This hole was below the monitor .
Peeking in you can see the CRT tube , and the video board over to the left .
At the bottom you can see just a little bit of the ' main stack ' of four logic boards .
Needless to say , this thing was not the easiest to work on !
The Teleram P -1800 was implemented entirely with TTL gates , and discrete logic .
There was no software , no operating system , no drivers , no processors , EPROM's , or any of that good stuff .
Teleram had a patent on the way they used logic to edit ASCII characters stored in RAM .
http://www.patentmonkey.com/PM/patentid/4040024.aspx.
As mentioned earlier , the main logic was contained on four 6 " by 16 " boards .
It used mostly 74xx series logic .
The unit had a full compliment of editing features including changing , deleting , and inserting text , a search function , and a full screen cursor .
It contained 2 k of RAM .
You could fill that RAM with text , and then save it to a 2 k data block on the Cassette tape .
Likewise , you could retrieve a block of data from cassette into the ram for further editing .
I think the tape actually held 75 - 80 blocks of data , so , in essence , you could have that many stories in your local ' data archive ' .
In the vernacular , this would be seventy five 500 word stories .
I have three of these units .
One has been partially taken apart and stripped of it's monitor and power supply .
I do n't want to dis- assemble either of the two that are intact , but , one is already past usability , so I will continue to disassemble it to show how it was made .
This machine , and it's immediate Teleram successors ( Teleram 3000 series ) were important in the world of journalism , and should be documented .
Do remember though ,
It has been 30 years , and I have no documentation .
This description is based on my best recollections , and may not be 100 % accurate !
So , here is 32 pounds of 1970s tech , the discrete way .
Please ignore the dirt , mildew and rust .
They have not always been stored in the best of environments the last 25 years !
Here is a very basic Block Diagram of the unit .
Use your back button to return .
Here is the ' stack ' of main logic boards as it came out of the unit .
The power leads went to 6/32 studs in the center top of each board .
Many ribbon cable jumpers using 16 pin DIP plugs connected the different parts .
Included here you can also see the TTS option board to the right , and the front status indicator panel on the left .
The boards were held together with Nylon spacers , which were then attached to the frame of the unit with screws .
Most of the ICs are dated from 1974 .
The four boards were loosely divided up into Cassette , Memory , Character Generator , and transmission board .
A count shows approximately 300+ 74 series TTL chips .
This is a picture of the Transmit ( TX ) board .
It handled all the serial transmissions .
Once the send button was pressed , this board would ' take over ' ram , and transmit the contents as ASCII characters .
The video display was left active during this time , and it did some weird things while the unit was transmitting .
The only LSI IC in the entire unit is on this board , in the upper left is a TMS 6011 Uart .
This is the cassette board .
It handled all the Cassette drive functions .
When a save was called for , it would ' take over ' the RAM , and write the contents , cell by cell onto the cassette tape .
The operator was responsible for keeping track of what block was what , and manually moving the tape to the correct block .
The 2 colored ribbon cables hanging off of this were the cables that went to the tape drive itself .
This is the Character generator board .
It is responsible for scanning the RAM regularly , converting the ASCII text to video characters , creating the composite video signal , and sending it to the CRT Monitor board .
The only EPROM is located on this board .
The White / gold IC at the bottom center , it is a 60720 used as the character EPROM .
This is the Memory board .
Sort of the heart of the machine .
It has the actual RAM memory , and the supporting address and data buffers and decoders .
This is also where the cursor counters are , and where the actual editing of the ram occurs .
The main memory is our old friend the 2102 1kx8 static ram .
There are 14 of them in the lower right corner ( 2 rows of Light gray ) .
One of them has been replaced with a ceramic / gold replacement chip ( bottom left ) .
This makes the memory 2 k of 7 - bit locations .
Here is the cassette drive .
Each spindle is directly driven by a servo motor .
Note there is no capstan .
The tape has two tracks .
One is for data , the other is a timing / servo track .
The electronics used the timing signals from that track to regulate the speed of the drive motors .
Note the Main tape head ( silver , directly in the top center ) .
It had two sections , one for each track .
The tape could not be flipped over !
Just to the right of the Main head is a standard erase head .
This only erased the data track , not the timing track , which was recorded at the factory .
In the lower right are two micro switches to sense cassette in , and write protect .
This is a view of the side of the Cassette drive .
You can see one of the reel servo motors .
That is all the information I have at present on the Teleram P - 1800 .
Two of my units ar intact and work somewhat .
At some point I may decide to clean up and restore one , and I may make that a project on this page .
Time will tell !
Until then , it 's time to move on about 4 - 5 years and delve into real computers ......
The Teleram 3100 ' Bubble ram '
Arguably , the first ' true ' laptop , or portable computer , was the Teleram 3000 series .
It was introduced at virtually the same time in 1982 as the Grid Compass 1100 / 1101 , Epson HX - 20 , MicroOffice RoadRunner , and Grundy NewBrain .
Which one was the very first is open for much debate .
The Grid Compass was very expensive , and required AC power for 1982 .
The HX - 20 is certainly a contender .
The HX - 20 was introduced in late 1981 , but not widely available until 1982 .
The T - 3000 grew out of the T - 1800 portable terminal ( which was a first ) .
But , I 'll leave the debate to others .
My version , shown here is the 3100 .
It is , unfortunately , missing 3 keytops .
These were introduced in July 1982 ( Just months before the Radio Shack M - 100 ) , and became a mainstay of many journalists and writers .
It used a version of the CP / M operating system .
Commonly referred to as the Bubble RAM , this machine had 128k of storage comprised of Magnetic Bubble Memory .
This acted as a disk drive for cp / m .
A major asset of Bubble memory is that it is non-volatile .
It will retain it 's contents indefinitely without any power .
The 3100 had 64 k of ram and a Z - 80 processor .
The built in cp / m operating system was a customized version .
The machine had a built in serial EIA RS - 232 port for communications , and a large expansion connector on the back called the TeleConnect , for connection to expansion peripherals ( Floppies , printers , etc . )
The screen was an LCD that displayed 4 lines of a full 80 characters .
An interesting feature of the screen is that it could be tilted up out of the case for easier viewing .
The only operator control , besides the keyboard , was a flat knob on the right that adjusted the contrast and was combined with the power switch ( just like on your transistor radio ) .
It ran off of a 12vdc AC power adapter , or 6 internal 2.5AH sealed 2 volt rechargeable batteries .
The operating system was stored in the bubble memory , so boot up was virtually instant on power up .
The 3100 contained a very good telecommunications program , Mbasic was built in , and it contained many cp /m utilities .
Interestingly though , there is no word processing program other than the limited cp / m command line utility , ED .
The keyboard was highly praised , and it is very nice to type on .
Unlike many , it had LED lights for the Shift and Caps lock keys .
The row of keys along the top were programmable function keys .
They could be programmed with a form of Macro or batch file .
This allowed customization for either local commands , or for special purpose commands used with the systems they connected to , such as store file , or directory .
The tops popped off , and a paper label could be placed in them to denote what they did .
A very annoying feature of the keyboard was the location of the return key .
It is above where most keyboards had them ( Where the backslash is on an AT style ) .
To it 's credit , it had a separate cursor keypad to the right of the main keys .
( White in the picture above ) .
This is the motherboard of the 3100 .
There is a daughterboard that goes over this and contains the Bubble Memory subsystem .
The empty blue header socket in the middle is for the display .
The large ribbon cable goes to the expansion connector .
The empty blue header connector on the right is for the keyboard .
In the upper right is the power supply , with the regulator electronics contained on the board that is attached to the back on the left .
The power devices were bolted to the rear panel just to the right of the expansion connector .
The batteries , which are 2 volt 2.5 ah rechargeable ' D ' cells lay in the curved ' slots ' seen just above the motherboard .
The CPU in this unit is a Zilog Z80L date coded 8238 .
It is the vertical 40 pin IC just to the left of center .
Other noteworthy chips are the eight Intel D2164A - 20 64 k x 1 Ram chips at the left edge .
On the right edge , just below the keyboard connector , is an Intel D8749H 8 - bit UV erasable microcontroller .
A label on it is handwritten ' kybd c' so I assume this is the keyboard controller .
The crystal on the bottom edge left of center ( just left of the screw ) is marked 4.9 mhz .
At the very top there is a 40 pin IC marked RCA CDP 6402CE .
I do not know what that is , nor can I find out .
I am assuming it is a UART .
This is a picture of the Bubble memory board in it 's place atop the motherboard .
It had a pin type connector in the center for the motherboard , a separate power supply cable , and was held in place by only 2 screws , one on either side .
It was very floppy in the middle , so the factory stuck numerous foam pads strategically around the motherboard to help support it .
OOPs !
Here is a close up of the Bubble Memory circuitry .
The memory itself is the large silver box with the white label on left .
It is an Intel 7110 - 1 , and the label says Copyright Intel Magnetics 1982 .
Also printed on the label is what I assume is akin to the ' bad sector ' listing .
It is held in a custom socket .
To the right is the bubble memory controller chip an Intel D7220 - 1 .
Just above and left of that is a 4.0 mhz crystal oscillator .
Other intel chips include a D7242 Sense Amplifier , a D7230 Current Pulse Generator and a D7250 Coil Pre-Driver .
Here is a page that describes this Bubble Memory System :
http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/tubepage.php?item=30&user=0
Here is another picture of the unit complete with only the top removed .
You can see the 6 batteries in the rear , partially obscured by the ribbon cable .
The Keyboard is labeled as being made by Hi-Tek p/n 373-70252B .
The empty blue ribbon cable is the one that attaches to the display which is mounted to the top case .
This is a picture of the TeleConnect connector on the back panel .
I do not have anything to connect to this , nor do I know the pinout .
TeleConnect is a high - speed parallel interface which connects peripherals such as CRTs , disk drives , and Teleram 's 3500 Office Station .
This is an " intelligent ' interface , requiring little set - up or operator intervention .
When power comes on , each connected device is identified and logged - into the system .
They can be called into service via the CP / M Assign utility .
Here is a close - up ( a bad close - up ) of the Keyboard .
You can see the unusual position of the return key , the separate cursor control pad , and the function keys along the top .
You can also see the three key - tops that are missing from this one .
Here is a picture of the message received on boot - up with my 3100 .
You can first of all see the nice characters ( with no descenders ) on the 80 column LCD .
Note the ' Bad load rec ' message .
It looks like Bubble memory CAN lose it 's contents in 20 or so years !
A note from MCC .
My 3100 will not boot up .
It passes it 's diagnostics , and comes up with a ' Bad load rec ' message , and a +? ( plus ) sign prompt .
I do not have any information on this unit , and I am unsure of where to go from here .
If anyone reading this has any information , tips , or a source of documentation for the 3100 , or any Teleram equipment for that matter , please feel free to contact MCC at MCC@mccworkshop.com .
If it is possible , I would consider adding any information you would wish to contribute to this page , or link to yours .

Epilogue
The early 80s were a major turning point for technology .
Personal computers were moving out of the Home and hobbyist realm , and into the business and commercial world .
Portable terminals , and early portable computers like these made a huge difference in the world of journalism .
They were embraced fully , and used to the maximum extent possible .
Teleram Communications was a pioneer in this early technology .
They were not alone , and they are all but forgotten now , but , at least for a few months , they were the leader of the pack .
PESHAWAR , Pakistan —
A stepped - up campaign of American drone strikes over the past three months has battered Al Qaeda and its Pakistani and Afghan brethren in the tribal area of North Waziristan , according to a mid-ranking militant and supporters of the government there .
The strikes have cast a pall of fear over an area that was once a free zone for Al Qaeda and the Taliban , forcing militants to abandon satellite phones and large gatherings in favor of communicating by courier and moving stealthily in small groups , they said .
The drones , operated by the C.I.A. , fly overhead sometimes four at a time , emitting a beelike hum virtually 24 hours a day , observing and tracking targets , then unleashing missiles on their quarry , they said .
The strikes have sharpened tensions between the local tribesmen and the militants , who have dumped bodies with signs accusing the victims of being American spies in Miram Shah , the main town in North Waziristan , they said .

An interesting new study was just published in Psychological Science , about a lab experiment at SUNY Buffalo that suggests junk - food taxes increase the overall nutritional quality of a shopping trip , while subsidies on healthy foods actually decrease the nutritional quality ( via Science Daily ) .
[ Study author and clinical psychologist Dr. Leonard ]
Epstein and colleagues simulated a grocery store , “ stocked ” with images of everything from bananas and whole wheat bread to Dr. Pepper and nachos .
A group of volunteers — all mothers — were given laboratory “ money ” to shop for a week ’s groceries for the family .
Each food item was priced the same as groceries at a real grocery nearby , and each food came with basic nutritional information .
The mother - volunteers went shopping several times in the simulated grocery .
First they shopped with the regular prices , but afterward the researchers imposed either taxes or subsidies on the foods .
That is , they either raised the prices of unhealthy foods by 12.5 percent , and then by 25 percent ; or they discounted the price of healthy foods comparably .
Then they watched what the mothers purchased .
The study authors separated food into two categories , “ high calorie for nutrient ” food and “ low calorie for nutrient ” food — i.e. junk food and healthy food .
They did this so that they could specifically measure the effect pricing changes had on the nutritional content of a participant ’s shopping basket .
As you might expect , taxing junk food reduced junk food purchases , and subsidizing healthy food increased healthy food purchases .
But the story does not end there .
The researchers discovered that taxing the bad stuff was far more effective from a nutritional standpoint than subsidizing the good stuff — and not just because prices affected sales .
The junk food taxes caused a real shift in nutritional quality because the money saved on junk food was spent on healthy food , which has more nutrients per calories .
However , when the researchers subsidized healthy food in their test , many participants spent the savings on — wait for it — junk food .
A subsidy for health foods actually increased the amount of fat , protein , and carbohydrates from that simulated shopping trip by about 10 percent each .
There were some other important elements to the study .
A subject of some debate in academic circles involves whether obese people will react the same way as normal - weight people when presented with increased prices for junk food or reduced prices for healthy food .
In this case , 40 percent of the study participants were obese , defined as a Body Mass Index over 30 .
They reacted to the changed prices in more or less the same way as normal - weight participants .
This SUNY Buffalo study does present some challenges for advocates of taxes and subsidies .
On the one hand , I ’ve argued , and continue to believe , that both taxes and subsidies are necessary components of addressing obesity .
But there is clearly some risk that pairing the two policies might not give quite the bang for the buck some might hope , since consumers might use the subsidy savings to pay for more junk .
And while the ideal solution involves a general junk - food tax , the study does suggest that a soda tax on its own might still have a significant positive effect on the nutritional content of a shopping basket .
A chart accompanying the study lists the “ calorie for nutrient ” ratings of all the foods used .
Healthy foods had CFNs below 30 ( bananas are 20 , chicken is 11 , tomatoes are 4 ) , while junk food ratings were 30 and up .
But if you look at individual foods , you realize that soda is off the charts in terms of caloric impact of a grocery trip .
Cheetos , for example , have a CFN rating of 48 .
Pop - Tarts are 50 .
Starburst and M&Ms are 70 and 83 , respectively .
Pepsi , however , has a CFN of 443 .
Even mayonnaise , not exactly a stand - alone food , has a CFN of only 197 .
The point here is that anything that deflects purchases from soda will improve the nutritional quality of a shopping trip .
And a soda tax on its own will do just that .
The challenge now is to figure out a way to bring down the cost of fruits and veggies in such as way as not to increase purchases of junk food .
Here ’s one idea : subsidize farmers markets and green grocers , i.e. places that tend not to sell lots of cheap , calorically dense foods .
Any other suggestions ?
Google has hit out at state attempts to clamp down on the internet by revealing governments ' requests to remove data from the web and get information about users .
Tonight it released a web page with a map showing country by country where it has had government requests or court orders to remove content from the YouTube video service or its search results , or to provide details about users of its services .
The release of the tool , announced on its official blog , comes as it has had to counter complaints from data protection authorities in 10 countries , including the UK , that its Street View product , which provides pictures of public streets , and its ad - hoc social networking service Buzz " were launched without due consideration of privacy and data protection laws " and that Buzz in particular " betrayed a disappointing disregard for fundamental privacy norms " .
Details provided by Google cover requests between 1 July and 31 December 2009 , and show that in the UK there were 1,166 requests for data about users and 59 requests to remove web pages in Google 's services such as YouTube , or from its search results for the web .
It complied with 45 , or 76 % , of the 59 requests , of which 43 were about YouTube videos .
It does not specify which government agency – such as the police or others – made the request .
Launching the new tool , Google says that " We believe that greater transparency will lead to less censorship " and links to a list which already shows that Brazil , where Google 's social network Orkut is hugely popular , leads the world with 291 removal requests – with Germany , India , the US , South Korea and the UK behind it .
The " censorship " numbers also include non-governmental court - ordered removal of sites or results for defamation or criminal proceedings – though the company will try to clarify that in future updates to the data , probably every six months .
However China has no listed requests – because , as the online tool explains , " Chinese officials consider censorship demands as state secrets , so we cannot disclose that information at this time . "
If China were included it would almost certainly be in the top spot , because its government only allowed Google to operate inside the country if it hid thousands of web pages from search results .
Google portrayed the data release as part of its continuing championing of openness of information , which fits into its mission " to organise the world 's information and make it universally accessible " .
It also fits into its ongoing struggle with the Chinese government , whose censorship of search results – and suspected encouragement of hackers to break into Google 's most important systems – finally proved unbearable for top Google executives including co-founder Sergey Brin in January after four years .
Google has now withdrawn to Hong Kong and ceased censoring its results – but people inside China cannot see them because of the " firewall " operated by the government .
David Drummond , the company 's chief legal officer , said in a blogpost about the new tool that while it regularly receives demands to remove content such as child pornography ( which it has a policy of removing at once ) , it also receives demands to take down other content to aid police or other enquiries .
" The vast majority of these requests are valid and the information needed is for legitimate criminal investigations , " noted Drummond .
" However , data about these activities historically has not been broadly available .
We believe that greater transparency will lead to less censorship . "
A Google spokesman insisted that the timing of the release was coincidental with the privacy complaint in a joint letter from data protection authorities from the UK , Canada , Israel , France , Spain , Ireland , Italy , New Zealand , Germany and the Netherlands .
" We 've been working on this for months and months , " he said .
But the criticism over Google 's data practices , and Street View and Buzz in particular , led data protection authorities to call on Google to collect " only the minimum amount of personal information needed " for a service and to make it clear how that information will be used , as well as offering " privacy - protective default settings " , ensure personal data is adequately protected , and make it easy for people to delete accounts .
Google is coming under increasing pressure from governments to reduce the amount of data that it keeps about its users , and to reduce the length of time that it stores it .
The data provided do not include requests from normal non-governmental users such as individuals or companies for the removal of content such as pictures , blogposts or YouTube videos .
Those would probably be many orders of magnitude greater : there are thousands of " user flags " of inappropriate or misused content on YouTube videos alone every month .

Not just well funded by a little bit of money but by the tune of 48 and a half million dollars .
That 's right , between the years of 1997 and 2008 Koch Industries has pumped almost fifty million dollars into various organizations to put forth climate change denial echo chambers of so called experts , scientists and , " think tanks " .
Mercatus Center
$ 9,247,500 received from Koch foundations 2005 - 2008 [ Total Koch foundation grants 1997 - 2008 : $ 9,874,500 ]
Americans for Prosperity Foundation ( AFP )
$ 5,176,500 received from Koch foundations 2005 - 2008 [ No Koch foundation grants received prior to 2005 ]
The Heritage Foundation
$ 1,620,000 received from Koch foundations 2005 - 2008 [ Total Koch foundation grants 1997 - 2008 : $ 3,358,000 ]
Cato Institute
$ 1,028,400 received from Koch foundations 2005 - 2008 [ Total Koch foundation grants 1997 - 2008 : $ 5,278,400 ]
The obscene amounts of money thrown around is to prop up bogus experts in order to discredit legitimate scientific research and make it seem as if these skeptics have some kind of ground to stand on .
And Koch has a reason to see science stumble , a lot of reasons , it 's called profit , lots of little dollar signs .
Not just Exxon , Massey and other large oil , coal and fossil fuel giants that are as plain as the nose on our faces , Koch is one of those giants that flies under the radar .
Not anymore , if we can do something to reveal how they push their money to mold the opinion of the masses we can hopefully take away their cover .
So who is Koch Industries ?
Billionaire oilman David Koch likes to joke that Koch Industries is “ the biggest company you 've never heard of . ”
But the nearly $ 50 million that David Koch and his brother Charles have quietly funneled to climate - denial front groups that are working to delay policies and regulations aimed at stopping global warming is no joking matter .
Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch have a vested interest in delaying climate action : they ’ve made billions from their ownership and control of Koch Industries , an oil corporation that is the second largest privately - held company in America ( which also happens to have an especially poor environmental record ) .
It ’s time more people were aware of Charles and David Koch and just what they ’re up to .
Here is just one example of how the Koch machine works ...
Case Study : The Koch - funded “ ClimateGate ” Echo Chamber In November 2009 , anonymous hackers illegally obtained and disseminated thousands of personal emails from climate scientists housed on the server of the University of East Anglia .
The emails spanned 13 years of correspondence and a handful of selected emails were taken out of context by a number of climate - denier organizations .
These organizations , many part of the Koch Web , claim the emails prove a “ conspiracy ” of scientists and cast doubt on the scientific consensus on human - caused climate change .
This incident , dubbed “ ClimateGate ” by climate - denier groups , has been distorted and repeated many times by conservative media and blogs since late November 2009 .
Twenty organizations , roughly half of the Koch - funded groups profiled in this report , have contributed to the “ ClimateGate ” echo chamber .
Among the most vocal groups are organizations that received over $ 1,000,000 from Koch foundations since 2005 , including Americans for Prosperity , the Heritage Foundation , and the Cato Institute .
Americans For Prosperity ( received over $ 5 million from Koch since 2005 ) hosted a live webcast from Copenhagen on Dec 9th as part of their “ Hot Air Tour , ” using the “ ClimateGate ” emails as a reason to prevent passage of any progressive global warming policy .
During the webcast , Steve Lonegan , AFP ’s New Jersey Director , said “ ClimateGate ” could have uncovered “ the biggest hoax our world has ever seen ” and vows not to allow any climate bill to pass the US Senate .
Several members of the Copenhagen youth delegation crashed the AFP event and were angrily called “ Hitler Youth ” by AFP guest speaker and well known climate denier Lord Christopher Monckton .
In addition to the Copenhagen webcast , AFP mentions “ ClimateGate ” in many blog posts , including in their protest of the EPA CO2 endangerment finding .
The Heritage Foundation ( received over $ 1 million from Koch since 2005 ) has posted several articles on its website regarding “ ClimateGate . ”
The blogs run the gamut of possible climate - denier angles on the incident , ranging from conspiracy accusations , to a history of imagined climate scandals , to effects on world politics , to supposed economic consequences from climate legislation .
** The Cato Institute ( received over $ 1 million in grants from Koch since 2005 ) is the front - group for climate - denier Patrick Michaels , who has been a vocal spokesperson regarding “ ClimateGate ” .
Within two weeks following the email breach at East Anglia University , Patrick Michaels had appeared in over twenty media interviews on shows including CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 , NBC's Nightly News , FOX's Fox & Friends , C - SPAN 's Washington Journal , and BBC's Have Your Say .
Michaels , taking one line of an illegally - obtained email out of context , has claimed the scientists have committed a “ capital crime ” and their actions are “ akin to filtering what goes in the bible . ”
Emphasis Mine !
Kind of makes your stomach turn , does n't it ?
And this kind of " echo chamber " attack works , not because they prove anything is wrong , they do n't have to produce any research of their own , they just have to play a kind of media " house of cards " by removing just one piece of the house and say that because of this , the whole thing just collapses .
And science just does n't work that way , science is not a house of cards but , as so eloquently argued by an article in The Economist , it is more like a jigsaw puzzle as scientists attempt to put it together collectively , arranging pieces and putting together those parts to get a bigger picture .
There is no reasoning between climate scientists and supporters and those that are determined to deny and undermine the science if they refuse to use the same logic .
Of course we know , as you can see by the huge amount of money behind the denial , it 's not about science at all , but the bottom line of large corporate entities that rely on the continued use of fossil fuels and the lack of regulation regarding green house gases .
In any complex scientific picture of the world there will be gaps , misperceptions and mistakes .
Whether your impression is dominated by the whole or the holes will depend on your attitude to the project at hand .
You might say that some see a jigsaw where others see a house of cards .
Jigsaw types have in mind an overall picture and are open to bits being taken out , moved around or abandoned should they not fit .
Those who see houses of cards think that if any piece is removed , the whole lot falls down .
When it comes to climate , academic scientists are jigsaw types , dissenters from their view house - of - cards - ists .
The defenders of the consensus tend to stress the general consilience of their efforts — the way that data , theory and modelling back each other up .
Doubters see this as a thoroughgoing version of “ confirmation bias ” , the tendency people have to select the evidence that agrees with their original outlook .
But although there is undoubtedly some degree of that ( the errors in the IPCC , such as they are , all make the problem look worse , not better ) there is still genuine power to the way different arguments and datasets in climate science tend to reinforce each other .
Emphasis mine
But does this come down to the fact that in general , people have a real lack of understanding of science , they can point to a snowstorm and say , look global warming can't be real ?
And then fall for it ?
This is what distresses me most , that the big money can use the house of cards so well that we can move a huge number of people to think so ill of the scientific process .
Remove a card and the whole thing falls down ?
And here are some examples of these organizations brilliant work !
Gotta love this video !
Here 's another winner that they call " Grassroots " that 's funded by corporate dollars !
Here is Patrick Michaels of the Cato Institute giving his thoughts on " Climate Change " on CNN with Anderson Cooper .
This is part of the Echo Chamber that Greenpeace documented as their example of Koch Industries funding the denial
**
Just thought I would give you a little taste of the echo chamber .
Especially when Anderson Cooper says , Patrick has a point !
Really ?
What needs to happen is that we need to reveal that the denial is well funded by huge corporate entities that do n't really care about your personal wellbeing .
Pass it on .
Rachel Maddow covered Koch Industries , of course she did .
I leave you with her segment on this issue .
This is much easier to share .
Regardless of experience , having a new baby brought in the world ( whether yours or someone else ’s ) is enough to give everyone parenting jitters .
You never really know what you need until you needed it five minutes ago .
However , with advancements in all kinds of technology being made every day , there is no shortage of gadgets to make caring for baby easier and while no one can say that they really need them , they rank pretty high on the wish list .
When it comes to cool tech for your baby , there is nothing g quite as extravagant or as indispensable as a formula maker or preparation machine .
If you are n’t quite sure what a formula maker is , think of an espresso machine or your favourite Keurig but specifically for your baby .
These nifty little devices take a lot of the guesswork out of prepping your baby ’s formula – they boil the water in advance to remove any impurities before cooling it to a drinkable temperature , mixing it with the correct amount of your preferred brand of powdered formula .
Most machines , like the Baby Brezza® Formula Pro and the Born Free® Bottle Genius , have reservoirs for the unprepared powder as well as the water so that at the push of a button , your bottle will be concocted and ready for baby ’s dinnertime .
If your little one is moving away from bottle - feeding towards a more solid diet , meal prep becomes a bit different but do n’t worry , there are plenty of gadgets for this stage of your child ’s development as well .
The notorious Baby Bullet® and the Baby Brezza® One Step Baby Food Maker are just a couple of the options for making your own baby food at home .
Not only do they help with the actual food prep , but they provide systems for storage and keeping track of food expiration dates to make mealtimes just a little bit easier .
Feeding , however , is just one aspect of childcare .
Making sure your little one is meeting all your sleep needs is a huge challenge for most parents .
Devices such as the Sleep Sheep , which produces soothing sounds to help lull your baby off to dreamland , are excellent as a first step in regulating sleep patterns .
It has a soft , fuzzy exterior for cuddling and plays four different sounds –white noise , ocean , mother ’s heartbeat , and whale song –which can be set to automatically shut off after 23 or 45 minutes .
Getting to sleep is only half the challenge ; the other half is staying asleep .
Although no one can force a child to sleep more than their body will allow , the Gro Clock can help you teach your child to stay in bed until it ’s time to get up .
Its face changes from blue to yellow and will light up to let your little one know that they can get out of bed , preventing them from waking you up early .
If you ’re looking for something that can do a little bit of everything , the adan + anais ® serenity star is a system that ’s meant to aid in both sleeping and feeding .
It acts as a sound machine , a nightlight , a room thermometer , and it can record when you last fed your baby ( and from what side , if you ’re nursing ) .
Time spent recollecting the little Bohemia we foregathered in several tryout places before settling on a villainous Turkish - Cypriot kebab house on the fringes of Bloomsbury called the Bursa — sharing cheap kebabs and hummus and retsina and dividing up a bill that never quite seemed to reflect the low value of the nosh — confirms three related but contrasting things for me .
The first was the pervasive cultural influence of Philip Larkin .
The second was the importance of word games and the long , exhaustive process that makes them both live and become worthwhile .
The third was the gradual but ineluctable rise of Margaret Thatcher and her transatlantic counterpart Ronald Reagan .
These , then , will be my excuses and pretexts while I “ let in daylight upon magic , ” as the essayist Walter Bagehot phrased it .
In a New Statesman piece , I said in passing that I thought Mrs. Thatcher was surprisingly sexy .
Unspoken in our circle was quite a deep divide between left and , if not exactly right , yet increasingly anti-left .
Fenton and I were still quite Marxist in our own way , even if our cohort was of the heterodox type that I tried to describe earlier .
Kingsley had become increasingly vocally right - wing , it often seeming to outsiders that he was confusing the state of the country with the condition of his own liver ( but please see his letters of the time to notice how cogent he often still was ) .
Clive and Martin had been hugely impressed — as who indeed had not ?— by the emergence of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn as a moral and historical titan witnessing for truth against the state - sponsored lie .
In between , men like Terry and Mark found it difficult to repudiate their dislike for a Tory Party that had been the main enemy in their youth .
Robert Conquest was and still is the most distinguished and authoritative anti-Communist ( and ex-Communist ) writing in English , but if this subject was excluded , his politics tended toward something fairly equably social democratic in temper .
After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , he and I agreed that the Moscow Olympics should be boycotted , and of course it was he who noticed that an aquatic event was being held in one of the Baltic States , the Russian annexation of which had never been recognized by the post - Yalta agreements that defined the Cold War .
At the last Friday lunch I ever attended , before emigrating to the United States , in 1981 , a toast was raised to Bob 's impending fourth — or was it fifth ? — marriage .
“ Well , ” he replied modestly , “ I thought perhaps ‘ one for the road . ’ ” Philip Larkin wrote gloomily to Kingsley that the new Texan spouse would probably make their old friend move permanently to America , “ as all Yank bags do . ”
And so indeed it proved .
Elizabeth — or “ Liddie ” — is a bit more than “ the other half ” : she is a great scholar in her own person and the anchor of one of the most successful late marriages on record .
Once Martin and I had also married Americans , she printed a T - shirt for all concerned that read , YANK BAGS CLUB .
I learned appreciably from registering the cross-currents that underlay this apparently light but really quite serious lunch .
Our common admiration for Larkin , as a poet if not as a man , arose from the bleak honesty with which he confronted the fucked - up — the expression must be allowed — condition of the country in those years .
It was his use of that phrase — “ They fuck you up , your mum and dad , ” as the opening line of his masterly “ This Be the Verse ” — that put him outside the pale of the “ family values ” community .
Clive James was in some ways the chief whip of the lunch and would often ring round to make sure that there was a quorum ( though I noticed that whenever Martin was away his enthusiasm waned a bit , as did everyone else 's ) .
He needed an audience and damn well deserved one .
His authority with the hyperbolic metaphor is , I think , unchallenged .
Arnold Schwarzenegger resembled “ a brown condom full of walnuts . ”
Of an encounter with some bore with famous halitosis Clive once announced , “ By this time his breath was undoing my tie . ”
I well remember the day in 1978 when he delivered his review of a biography of Leonid Brezhnev to the New Statesman and Martin read its opening paragraphs out loud : “ Here is a book so dull that a whirling dervish could read himself to sleep with it .
If you were to recite even a single page in the open air , birds would fall out of the sky and dogs drop dead . ”
One could hear his twanging marsupial tones in his scorn for this world - class drone and bully ( the work was being “ published ” by the ever servile and mercenary tycoon Robert Maxwell , one of the Labour Party 's many sources of shame ) .
Clive had given up alcohol after a long period of enjoying a master - servant relationship with it , in which unfortunately the role of the booze had been played by Dirk Bogarde .
He thus threw in money only for the food part of the bill , until one day he noticed how much the restaurant charged for awful muck such as bitter lemon and tonic water .
At this he moaned with theatrical remorse , “ I owe you all several hundred pounds ! ”
But not all was geniality and verve : the only rift in the Friday fraternity came when Clive took huge exception to Fenton 's Sunday Times review of his ( actually quite bad ) 1981 verse play about the rise of Prince Charles .
The expression complained of , I seem to recall , was “ This is the worst poem of the twentieth century . ”
The ensuing chill went on for a bit .

MacRuby 0.6 іs now available ( MacRuby 0.6 Download Link ) .
As MacRuby 0.6 Release Notes say , MacRuby 0.6 is now considered stable for Cocoa development , complete with XCode and Ahead of Time ( AOT ) support , which means it 's possible to compile the Ruby source and only ship the resulting binaries .
As announced previously , the 0.6 release now comes with experimental debugging support .
MacRuby 's debugging support inserts special instructions in the compiled code to trigger breakpoints , as compared to many other Ruby debuggers which use the tracing support or use Ruby VM hooks .
A note from the release blog post :
An interesting feature of the debugger is that it has been abstracted into a simple Objective - C API , of which macrubyd is just one client .
In the future we might see other clients .
Comparable Java and Ruby libraries are available in the Debug - Commons project .
With MacRuby 0.5 , MacRuby removed the GIL , allowing threads to run in parallel ( unlike Ruby 1.9 where only one Ruby thread can run at a time ) .
Some new improvements in 0.6 make multiple threads more useful , eg. ( from the release blog post ) :
Finally , the Regexp class has been totally rewritten in this release .
It is now using the ICU framework instead of Oniguruma for regular expression compilation and pattern matching .
Since ICU is thread - safe , MacRuby 0.6 allows multiple threads to utilize regular expressions in a very efficient way , which was not possible previously .
MacRuby 0.5 already contained the beginnings of support for Grand Central Dispatch ( GCD ) , Apple 's system wide threadpool and task system available on Mac OS X Snow Leopard and on Phone OS 4.0 .
MacRuby 0.6 adds new features and abstractions in the ' dispatch ' library .
Job offers a similar interface as Thread , and can be used to asynchronously execute code .
It can be used synchronously or asynchronously .
For instance , here the code to have a Job do some work and wait for the Job to finish ( from the docs ) :
@result = job.value puts @result.to_int.to_s.size # => 51
The asynchronous way requires to pass in a callback that is called once the Job is finished ; in Ruby this is , of course , done with a block :
job.value {|v| p v.to_int.to_s.size } # => 51 ( eventually )
Another tool introduced in MacRuby 's Dispatch library is Proxy , which allows to serialize method calls on an object .
Other features are parallel iteration , ie .
parallel implementations of iterators , Enumerable # p_each , Enumerable #p_map , Enumerable # p_find , and similar methods which make use of multiple threads to execute all the block invocations .
GCD also features Event Sources , which allow to register interest in certain events and have them handled by blocks scheduled on GCD queues .
Event sources can be timers , process signals , input descriptors for I/O , etc. Event Sources are a powerful tool to make use of the OS - wide thread pool by running event handlers on a queue which grabs a thread when an event comes in and releases it back to the system after the event handler was run .
The source code of the dispatch library in MacRuby has a README for a more detailed introduction to all of these GCD features in MacRuby 0.6 .
One issue that was found after the release of MacRuby 0.6 seems to cause problems with scheduling a block to run on the main thread from a background thread .
Something to watch out for in case of weird threading problems ; the bug report contains a workaround and a solution should come to MacRuby 's trunk soon .
The big question for every Ruby implementation is of course compatibility ; the state in MacRuby 0.6 ( from the release blog post ) :
MacRuby 0.6 provides support for C extensions written for the original implementation of ruby .
We were able to successfully use the Nokogiri , SQLite3 and PostgreSQL extensions from MacRuby .
This release also passes about 85 % of RubySpecs , is able to run a modified version of Rails 3 , and implements better support for Ruby 1.9 encodings .
Finally , Matt Aimonetti is working on a book for O'Reilly ; the first few chapters of " MacRuby : The Definite Guide " are already available and can be read online .
Just me , or does anyone else worry that Beck ’s prediction of violence , followed by a statement that he “ hopes not , ” actually fans the flames of such violence ?
The guy is a nut .
But he ’s who conservatives listen to .
And just like Limbaugh , if this guy is one of the intellectual fathers of the modern Republican party , and he is , then what he says matters .

Defense Minister Kim
Tae - young 's comments on Sunday that a bubble jet caused by a heavy torpedo was the most likely cause of the blast that sank the Navy corvette Cheonan have put North Korean heavy torpedoes on the top of the list of suspects .
It is difficult to imagine a country other than North Korea launching a torpedo attack against a South Korean warship , and the extent of damage the Cheonan suffered has made a heavy torpedo the probable cause .
Military experts believe North Korea has four types of heavy torpedoes : Yu - 3G , ET - 80A , TYPE 53 - 59 , and the TYPE 53 - 56 .
One source said if a North Korean torpedo was the culprit , it would most likely have been a Yu - 3G .
Developed in China during the mid 1980s , the Yu - 3G is a " passive acoustic homing " torpedo that tracks the sounds of a vessel 's propellers and its wake and attacks accordingly .
Experts believe the North would have equipped the Yu - 3G with a fuse that can be detonated by the magnetic field generated by a vessel .
The lower part of the Cheonan , beneath the gas turbine room where the external explosion is believed to have happened , is the part of a ship that produces the strongest magnetic field .
When equipped with a 200 kg high explosive , the Yu - 3G , with a range of 12 km , is said to be strong enough to split a war ship the size of the Cheonan in half .
The ET - 80A is also a passive acoustic homing torpedo with a range of 7.3 km .
The Type 53 - 59 and Type 53 - 56 torpedoes , which were developed in the former Soviet Union and were exported to China and North Korea , are straight - track projectiles that travel in a straight line toward their targets after being fired .
Image caption Google had faced similar disputes in Germany , Poland and Russia .
British e-mail users with Google accounts are now able to change the end of their addresses from @googlemail.com to @gmail.com .
A five year trademark dispute meant that Google was not allowed to use the name Gmail in the UK .
In 2005 a company called Independent International Investment Research claimed it had used " Gmail " first .
Google claimed at the time that the settlement IIR asked for was " exorbitant " and dropped the name .
Within a year of launching the free e-mail service in the UK , Gmail became Google Mail .
While early adopters received a gmail.com address , all subsequent new accounts were given the suffix googlemail.com .
" Since ' gmail ' is 50 % fewer characters than ' googlemail ' we estimate this name change will save approximately 60 million keystrokes a day , " wrote software engineer Greg Bullock on Google 's Gmail blog .
British users with Googlemail addresses will be asked whether they wish to change their address .
It will not affect the settings or functionality of the accounts , Google said .
The firm is not releasing the details of the new settlement but states that the matter is " happily resolved " .
Yesterday I flagged the new information released about Gregory Giusti , the fine gentleman arrested for threatening Speaker Nancy Pelosi in more than 48 threatening and / or harassing phone calls over almost a two month period leading up to the Health Care Reform vote .
But there was some pretty hilarious comedy wrapped into this otherwise ugly event .
It seems Giusti had rather overstated his clandestine skills as a wannabe domestic terrorist .
Giusti allegedly used the Internet phone service Magic Jack to make his threatening calls .
And in one call to Pelosi ’s office taunted “ and the number I ’m calling from is untraceable so if you ’re trying to trace it have fun . ”
Needless to say , though , it seems that the security mountain in front of Magic Jack was no match for the tech folks at the FBI .
As the first commenter on the post snarked : “ Another idiot is rudely introduced to the difference between what your casual user can get from caller ID and what the FBI can do when it wants . ”
Gefechte bei Kunduz Bundeswehr tötet versehentlich afghanische Soldaten
Es war ein fataler Irrtum : Bei den schweren Gefechten in Kunduz hat die Bundeswehr versehentlich fünf afghanische Soldaten getötet - sie sollen sich nicht korrekt identifiziert haben .
Für die drei gefallenen deutschen Soldaten gibt es an diesem Samstag eine Trauerfeier in Kunduz .

We live in a social reality .
In addition to physical reality , we have to make sure our friends , neighbors , co-workers and service providers like us .
To that end , we tend to repeat memes of “ truth ” about our world that they like .
Even if we do n’t mean to , we pass these memes on as conversation .
This becomes a problem when the memes diverge from reality by a substantial margin .
I ’m not talking about a little bit of fudging here — but outright wrong .
One meme we have is that our technology makes us bulletproof , our “ enlightened ” progressive politics make us post - historical , and that we ’re too big too fail .
But if you think about it , there is no guarantee that the social memes are correct .
We pass them along without thinking about whether they ’re correct .
And if you think a little more , you ’ll see that most civilizations fail at some point .
If they knew they were failing , they ’d counteract that , right ?
Then you look around and see all the people in denial .
In denial that their drug habits have consequences , that their teenage daughters are having sex , that those sounds at night are indeed squirrels that have moved into the attic .
Human behavior is very practical .
Part of that is that if we cannot fix a situation , we go into denial .
Ca n’t make myself immortal ?
Pretend death does not exist .
At least that way we are functional .
However , at some point that function becomes inverted .
If you change the background of a picture we see every day , we will probably not notice .
In the same way , once we accept our civilization as it is , warts and all , we stop noticing subtle changes that add up to a whole lot of decline .
This inversion explains why societies fail at all : they do n’t notice that the background changed .
They ’re used to going to work every day , reading bad news in the newspaper , and seeing mediocre films on TV .
Over time , these things get worse and people just adapt to them .
To make themselves feel better , they keep passing along the same social memes that by seeming to have solutions or reasons why things as they are , explain away the problem .
But it grows .
And now the reason we call it an inversion becomes clear : when a civilization decays past a certain point , all “ truths ” are lies and many “ lies ” are truths .
The society has turned away from reality because it cannot face its own demise .
What ’s it like to live in such a time ?
All of your “ heroes ” are bunk .
A civilization in denial rewards those who strengthen the denial , not those who have something profound to offer .
The politicians and leaders you see are the most corrupt , not the least .
They got where they are by pandering to an audience that wants to hear their opinions on an internal dialogue like right - versus - left , not their diagnosis of where society is heading .

All of your art becomes escapist .
The concept of art itself is dead in such a time .
People want political art , they want art about characters whose sole problem is within themselves … they do n’t want art about people adapting to the world and changing it and themselves for the better .
Art becomes entertainment .

Art becomes entertainment .
All “ issues ” are internal .
If you are in a dying civilization , you cannot talk about future direction , only changes as they exist within the civilization as it is .
Any competing ideology must be snuffed and called ignorant .
Whether a society legalizes abortion must be more important than whether it can support the number of people it has , or stop polluting .

The lowest common denominator reigns .
Since we all need to keep our dialogue internal to stay in denial , we start becoming fascinated with the lowest common denominator .
Do n’t tell me about the geniuses ; what do the peasants do with their time ?
And to pander to this group , and those who think this is a good idea , the media , art , culture and government workers target the lowest common denominator in their population , which is always crass .

Reformers are rebels , not reformers .
A reformer fixes things , starting with the biggest issues like social direction .
A rebel acts out against the world in which he finds himself , but does not hope to change it .
Most rebels are anti-heroes who self - destruct instead of finding methods of fixing the things they claim to be upset by .
In reality , the outrage is a justification for the “ rebel lifestyle ” : anti-hero behavior that eschews responsibility for hedonism .

Degree of offense is more important than degree of truthfulness .
In a time where we cannot face reality , our outlook on life becomes arbitrary .
As a result , people pick what is personally convenient , and label everything else offensive .
And since lowest common denominator politics is essentially a mob shouting demands at its leaders , any idea that is offensive gets quickly silenced through non-governmental means .
If no one wants to buy your truthful idea , you ’d better come up with an inoffensive one quickly .
What does it mean to live in a civilization in decline ?
The first sign is that everyone around you is in denial , starting with denial that their civilization is slowly imploding .
It also means that all your public figures are corrupt or worse .
Bono , Bill Clinton , Oprah Winfrey , Richard Dawkins , Jon Stewart , Stephen Colbert — are these people heroes , or just clever marketers who have found an audience ?
Even more , why are we getting our political opinions from entertainers ?
It means that all of those who you hear lauded as “ geniuses ” are not , and those you never hear about may be , because society confers “ genius ” as a marketing title for denial experts , not reality experts .
It means you live in parallel worlds , one called social - reality and one called physical - reality .
In social reality , the language of commercials predominate ; in physical reality , when you bring the product home , you find the instructions are wrong and you need some hideous hack to make it even work .
Take a critical look around you as you go through life .
The people you see celebrated ; are they worth celebrating , or just clever denial experts ?
Are our leaders honorable , or just good at hiding their intentions ?
While I love my country , and my world , the best manifestation of that love is a clear - eyed view of reality itself .
And if a civilization you love is in decline the only course of action can be to not go with the flow ” but get our move on to fix that decline .

( Mashable ) --
By now , landing a job via social media is nothing new ; we 've perused the how - to guides and heard dozens of great success stories .
There are , however , still plenty of creative opportunities for securing a job with a bit of clever online marketing .
Meet Alec Brownstein , senior copywriter at creative advertising shop Young & Rubicam ( Y&R ) New York .
Last summer , Alec was just another tired , 28 - year - old copywriter at a large international ad agency who wanted nothing more than to work at " a really creative shop for really creative [ creative directors ] . "
While Googling his favorite creative directors last summer , Brownstein noticed that there were no sponsored links attached to their names .
Since Brownstein Googles himself " embarassingly frequently , " he assumed that the creative directors did so as well , and thus he decided to purchase their names on Google AdWords .
" Everybody Googles themselves , " Brownstein explained .
" Even if they do n't admit it .
I wanted to invade that secret , egotistical moment when [ the creative directors I admired ] were most vulnerable . "
Since Brownstein was the only person bidding on the names of the five creative directors he most admired , he was able to get the top search spots for a mere 15 cents per click .
Whenever someone ran a search for one of the creative directors ' names , the following message appeared at the top of the page : " Hey , [ creative director 's name ] : Goooogling [ sic ] yourself is a lot of fun .
Hiring me is fun , too " with a link to Brownstein 's website , alecbrownstein.com .
Over the next couple of months , Brownstein received calls from all but one of the creative directors whose names he had purchased .
And finally , at the end of the year , he received a job offer from two : Scott Virtrone and Ian Reichenthal of Y&R New York .
The whole campaign cost him $ 6 .
But the rewards for Brownstein 's creativity have n't ended there .
He has also received awards in the self - promotion category at two major advertising awards shows , The One Show and The Clios .
We asked Brownstein if he has any advice for others trying to land their dream jobs via Internet marketing .
" Do n't be afraid to put yourself out there in an interesting way , " he said .
" The people who you want to work for can't hire you any less than they already are .
So shoot for the moon . "
We could n't agree more with his advice .
What do you think of Brownstein 's story ?
Have you or anyone you know used online marketing to land yourself a job ?

There are fears of an environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , as efforts to clear up an oil spill have been suspended because of bad weather .
A drilling rig leased by the oil company BP exploded and sank off the Louisiana coast last week .
Some 1,000 barrels of oil a day are leaking into the sea from the damaged well , officials say .
They say the oil leak has the potential to damage beaches , barrier islands and wetlands across the coastline .
Eleven workers are still missing and presumed to have been killed in the accident .
The search for them has been called off .
More than 100 other workers were rescued .
The Deepwater Horizon had been burning for 36 hours when it sank on Thursday in 5,000 ft ( 1,500 m ) of water , despite efforts to control the flames .
It was carrying out exploratory drilling 84 km ( 52 miles ) south - east of Venice , Louisiana when the blast occurred .
' Highly complex task '
Bad weather caused cleanup efforts to be suspended over the weekend , allowing the slick to grow to about 580 sq miles ( 1,500 sq km ) , officials say .
Oil leaks from a sunken drill pipe 5,000 ft beneath the ocean surface BP has been using a robot submarine to try to activate a blowout preventer - a series of pipes and valves that could stop the leak .
However , this was a " highly complex task " and " it may not be successful " , chief operating officer of BP 's exploration and production unit Doug Suttles was quoted as saying by Reuters .
The company has also brought in more than 30 cleanup vessels and several aircraft to spray dispersant on the floating oil .
At the moment , the weather conditions are keeping the oil away from the coastline and it is hoped the waves will break up the heavy crude oil , allowing it to harden and sink back to the ocean floor .

The coastguard earlier said it had thought it was dealing only with a surface residual oil spill from the rig .
" In addition to that , is oil emanating from the well .
It is a big change from yesterday ...
This is a very serious spill , absolutely , " said Rear Adm Mary Landry .
In 2009 , BP PLC was fined a record $ 87 m for failing to improve safety conditions following a massive explosion that killed 15 people at its Texas City refinery .
But the US Mineral Management Services found no violations on the Deepwater Horizon rig when it carried out routine inspections in February , March and April this year .
President Barack Obama said on Thursday that the government was providing " all assistance needed " for both the rescue and clean up efforts in the troubled area .
He described the crisis on the BP - leased rig as his administration 's " number one priority " .
No cause for the blast has yet been identified .

( CNN ) --
Next time you find yourself at a boisterous bistro shouting at your dinner companions over the plat du jour , it might be the result of a restaurant up - sell .
It turns out these not - so - good vibrations might be on purpose .
Studies show people drink more , eat faster and leave sooner when the bass is thumping , so restaurants are bringing the noise .
Customers have been sounding off in recent years about the deafening volume level in restaurants .
Washington
Post food critic , Tom Sietsema , has gone so far as to include the average decibel count into his restaurant reviews and former New York Times restaurant critic Frank Bruni famously docked chef Mario Batali 's flagship restaurant Babbo one star for its ear - splitting rock soundtrack .
There is , he wrote , " Lou Reed and Moby , at a volume that rises around 10:30 p.m. , as if patrons are being cued to chew faster . "
" In the mid-1980s , researchers at Fairfield University demonstrated that people increased their rate of chewing by almost a third when listening to faster , louder music , accelerating from 3.83 bites a minute to 4.4 bites a minute , " George Prochnik at The Daily Beast points out .
A 2008 study in France further found that when music decibels are amped up , men not only consumed more drinks but consumed them in less time .
But music is n't the only tactic restaurants sneakily employ to make customers eat and get out -- or even better , spend more cold hard cash .
Diners seated at tables in the middle of the floor , exposed to the hustle and bustle , will be less comfortable and will eat faster .
The same goes for uncomfortable chairs ; restaurant designers know if your derrière is n't snug , the less time it will spend parked .
Seeing is believing -- and spending .
Catching a glimpse of food lets your senses take over your wallet ; elaborate dessert trays , cheese carts and sizzling fajita platters tempt people to pay up for items they originally had n't intended to buy .
Restaurants can color your appetite , too .
Next time The Golden Arches call to you , blame it on the color scheme .
Warm colors such as red , orange and yellow stimulate the need to eat .
" Bold , primary colors and bright lighting encourage turnover and are appropriate for quick - service and casual restaurants that depend on fast turnover , " Regina S. Baraban and Joseph F. Durocher write in Successful Restaurant Design .
However , these tactics certainly are n't for every restaurant .
Many dining rooms , especially those outside the casual eatery sector , encourage those to linger a little longer .
New York - based architect Andre Kikoski is a finalist for the James Beard Foundation 2010 Award for Outstanding Restaurant Design for The Wright , a fine dining restaurant at the Guggenheim Museum .
" They [ the diners ] need to be rewarded with an environment that does more than get them in and out quickly , " Kikoski told CNN .
" We have this particular goal that we are to an extent , a museum experience . "
The contemporary restaurant design relies on a primarily white foundation , banquette with bold blue leather seating , soft lighting and calibrated colors for a " sense of calm , a sense of retreat , that lets you be in that moment . "
Of course , there are others that are more up front with their turnover techniques .
On hectic nights , the reservationist at Salumeria Rosi Parmacotto in New York City will inform diners that they need the table back in 90 minutes for the next party .
If you lurk over your digestif too long , chef Cesare Casella will place your name on Salumeria 's " no salami " list .
Take note dilly - dalliers : no salami for you .

SALT LAKE CITY —
No denim skirts .
No faded corduroy pants .
No sequined tops , no baggy tops , no hoop earrings larger than 1.5 inches in diameter .
No frosted eye shadow .
When the University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics adopted a new dress code for its 7,000 employees this year , it opted for conservative and very specific .
The policy will be fully in effect by July .
The idea , says CEO David Entwistle , is to provide an environment in which patients feel confident that they 're in capable hands .
" It 's a reflection that we take our job seriously , " says hospital spokesman Chris Nelson .
" It 's hard to keep that faith in your care provider if the nurse is wearing SpongeBob SquarePants scrubs . "
Also considered " not professional " : hoodies , fleece vests , flannel , sandals , more than two rings per hand , pleats that do n't lay flat .
On the list of acceptable dress : conservative , classic , modest , tailored — cardigan sweater sets .
The specifics of the new policy , which took two years to hammer out , came from a team of employees , not from hospital administrators , says Nelson .
But the need for specificity was requested by managers who felt the old policy was vague and inconsistently enforced .
" I would sometimes see folks with ripped , holey clothing that might be stylish in a different setting , or they'd be at a counter , showing cleavage , " says Julie Schmidt , a registered nurse who is manager of the emergency department and who served on the dress code committee .
" Or people who like to wear their slippers or flip - flops . ' "
So now all nurses will wear white , with red , navy or black bottoms .
Pharmacists in the emergency department will wear olive .
EMTs and certified nurse assistants will wear red , black or navy , and there will be a color - coded chart in each patient 's room to keep score .
The new policy does not apply to the U.'s physicians or medical students .
" Sloppy appearance equals sloppy work — that 's what we internalize , " says Roberta Hughes , president of Avidere , an image consulting company hired by the U. hospitals and clinics .
In the health care industry in general , " we 've been seeing an overall decline in presentation , " Hughes says .
" Sometimes patients can't tell the difference between a person on the street and an employee . "
Patients also had complained that they sometimes could n't tell who was who among the parade of people in scrubs .
" Patients would be lying in a hospital bed and would see someone in scrubs and they 'd say ' Can you tell me about my test results , ' and the employee would say ' I 'm just here to sweep the floor , ' " says Schmidt .
Hospital spokesman Nelson guesses , based on anecdotal accounts , that about 70 percent of hospital employees agree with the new policy and 30 percent think it 's taking away their freedom .
Matt Fenwick , a spokesman for the American Hospital Association , said he knows of no overarching trend toward more conservative or consistent dress in the nation 's hospitals .

The guinea worm grows to a metre long in its victim 's body before punching its way out – but hopefully not for much longer
Education is an important part of eradication
IT STARTS with a painful blister – a very painful blister .
It feels , people say , like being stabbed with a red - hot needle .
When the blister bursts , the head of a worm pops out , thin , white and very much alive .
The rest of the worm , about a metre long , remains inside your body .
It can take up to two months to pull it out , inch by agonising inch , during which time it may be impossible to walk .
In extreme cases , you may host up to sixty of them , anywhere on your body .
The worms can cause paralysis or lethal bacterial infections , and even if you survive mostly unscathed , next year it can happen all over again .
The guinea worm ( Dracunculus , or little dragon ) is probably the closest living equivalent to the monsters in the Alien movies – except we ’re beating this enemy .
Guinea worm was once widespread in Africa , the Middle East and many parts of Asia .
In 1986 , there were nearly 4 million cases a year in 20 countries across south Asia and Africa .
Last year , there were just 3142 in four countries in Africa .
The worm could be extinct by 2012 , making dracunculiasis the second human disease ever to be eradicated – the first being smallpox .

Guinea worms start out as minuscule larvae living inside water fleas of the genus Cyclops .
These millimetre - long crustaceans live in stagnant water , and people can swallow them when they drink from ponds , ditches or shallow wells .
Stomach acids dissolve the water fleas but can leave the larvae untouched .
The free larvae then burrow out of the intestine and cross to the chest or abdominal wall , where the male and female worms mature and mate .
The males eventually die , but the growing females tunnel imperceptibly to , and then under , the skin .
Even as the females grow up to a metre long , their hosts remain unaware of their presence .
The worms prevent pain by secreting opiates and dodge the immune system by coating themselves with human proteins .
It may be just as well people do n’t know they are infected as nothing can help at this stage .
A year after being swallowed , the guinea worms change tack .
They secrete a searing acid , create a blister and emerge from the skin – most often on the leg or foot , but it can be anywhere .
The acid alerts the immune system , but this only makes matters worse .
As the tissue around the worm swells , it adds to the pain and wedges the worm in place .
“ The worms secrete a searing acid .
People seek out water to relieve the burning pain , and the female worms then expel hundreds of thousands of larvae ”
The horrendous pain is no accident .
It causes people to seek out cool water to relieve the burning sensation , and when the females sense the water , they contract violently , expelling hundreds of thousands of larvae .
If there are any water fleas in the water , they will be infected and the cycle begins again .
The fact that the worms emerge after a year is no accident either .
Water flea populations peak when there is lots of stagnant water , which happens in the dry season in wet areas , such as Ghana , and in the wet season in dry areas , such as Sudan .
Either way , a yearly cycle maximises the larvae ’s chances of finding water fleas .
Death and paralysis
Guinea worms can cause all sorts of problems for their victims .
Some worms lose their way and attack the heart or spinal cord , leading to death or paralysis .
The emergence site can become infected by bacteria , leading to abscesses and tetanus .
If a worm passes near a joint , it can cause stiffness .
Joints can even seize up altogether , causing limbs to wither from disuse .
Worst of all , though , the guinea worm season tends to occur at times when people need to plant or harvest their crops .
“ A family that cannot cultivate because of guinea worm has no harvest , ” says Makoy Samuel Yibi , head of guinea worm eradication for the south Sudan government .
“ Every village has stories of people who died after bad guinea worm outbreaks . ”
There is no drug that kills guinea worm , no vaccine and no protective immunity after infection .
There are , however , two simple ways to prevent infection : stopping people with emerging worms from contaminating water sources , and not swallowing water fleas , either by drinking water from clean wells or by filtering infested water .
Because water fleas are relatively large , even simple cloth filters can eliminate them .
Clean drinking water alone helped eradicate guinea worm from many countries over the past century .
Then , in 1986 , the World Health Organization declared guinea worm eradication an official goal and The Carter Center , set up by former US president Jimmy Carter , took up the challenge .
Clean water is essential in the fight against guinea worms
Guinea worm disease is an obvious target for eradication and the only one besides polio now backed by the WHO .
Only humans are infected by guinea worm , and the larvae die within months if no one swallows the water fleas carrying them .
So stop human infections and the worm disappears .
The eradication programme had succeeded in India and Pakistan by 2000 , but donations were flagging .
Then the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation stepped in , and progress resumed .
The results are spectacular ( see map ) .
For instance , no cases were reported last year in Nigeria , which in 1986 was the worst - infected country with 700,000 cases .
It helps when governments or charities install tube wells that provide clean water , but this is expensive .
Instead ,
The Carter Center ’s main strategy is to provide cheap ways to cope with infested water .
These include filters for household water stores , drinking straws with filters that people can carry with them , the pesticide Abate to kill water fleas in ponds , and “ containment huts ” for people to go to when a worm appears , to keep them away from water supplies .
A young girl has a adult worm removed .
This painful process often takes weeks
There are now tens of thousands of containment centres across Africa , staffed by local volunteers trained to remove worms using the time - honoured method of winding them gently around a stick ( see “ The staff of Asclepius ” ) .
If a worm breaks and releases its larvae into the flesh , the pain is intense .
The centres feed residents and provide bandages , antiseptics , painkillers and cold compresses .
“ The heroes of guinea worm eradication are the 10,000 village health volunteers , ” says Sandy Cairncross of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine .
“ The key is to organise institutions in rural communities , and give them continuing modest support . ”
Cairncross pioneered the use of computer mapping systems to track progress – and to show governments and donors that their efforts are paying off .
“ Thorough surveillance is key , because it mobilises national leadership , ” says D. A. Henderson at the University of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , who led the fight against smallpox .
“ The guinea worm campaign has also been brilliant in getting local people to understand and cooperate in the effort . ”
Part of the problem is persuading people that guinea worms come from water , says Makoy .
“ They believe it comes from God or eating certain animals or witchcraft .
They do not see the point of filtering water , ” he says .
But once some families try it , the effects are so dramatic that the rest soon follow .
“ People were sceptical that we could eradicate the worm without drugs or vaccines , ” says Don Hopkins , a parasitologist at The Carter Center who heads the eradication drive .
“ Changing people ’s behaviour is notoriously hard . ”
The World Bank has estimated that the cost of guinea worm eradication in Africa , which Hopkins puts at $ 250 million in total , will be recouped within four years in increased food production alone .
That ’s not counting other benefits like children staying at school .
As cases become rarer , each one becomes harder and more expensive to find and contain , but it is crucial to keep going .
“ As long as there is one worm left , it will spread and be everywhere again , ” says Makoy .
Hopkins cites cases where the worms were eliminated from a country , only for someone from outside to infect a pond .
Such outbreaks often feature infections with multiple worms , as people have let their guard down and stopped filtering water .
A simple pipe filter can make a huge difference
With just 452 cases in total in Ghana , Mali and Ethiopia last year , eradication now depends on southern Sudan , which had 2690 , or 86 per cent of all cases .
“ We can stop transmission this year , ” says Makoy , but it will take another year or two after that to be sure the campaign has succeeded .
The main reason Sudan still has so many cases is the civil war that has raged almost continually since independence in 1956 .
It could yet derail things .
“ It ’s a race between war and the worms , ” says Hopkins , “ but I ’m an optimist . ”
He does have reason : in 1995 , the warring sides agreed a truce to allow guinea worm teams to work .
There has been a peace agreement between north and south Sudan since 2005 , but that could be threatened in the lead - up to elections in April and to a referendum next year , in which the oil - rich south is expected to reject continued union with the north .
Meanwhile , conflict is escalating between southern peoples such as the Nuer and the Dinka .
Last year , guinea worm staff had to stay indoors or be evacuated due to a lack of security on 35 occasions , and two local offices were destroyed .
“ We have the right team and materials to succeed , ” says Makoy .
“ All we need is peace . ”
The staff of Asclepius Guinea worms have long afflicted humanity .
They are thought to have been the “ fiery serpents ” described as attacking the Israelites in the biblical story of the exodus , and worm tracks have been found in 3000 - year - old Egyptian mummies .
The only way to get them out , then as now , is to slowly wind them around a stick .
While there is no definitive proof , this is widely thought to be the origin of the symbol of the Greek and Roman god of healing , Asclepius – a serpent wrapped around a staff .
The staff of Asclepius is on the crest of the World Health Organization and other medical bodies , but it has sometimes been confused with the caduceus , a winged staff entwined by two snakes .
The caduceus was a symbol of Mercury , god of commerce and thieves , and later became associated with alchemy .
Leader : “ From disease eradication to accommodation ”
In Badakshan , the Northeast of Afghanistan , 6 women die in labour for every 100 babies born .
That is almost four times the national average , in a country with the world 's second highest maternal mortality rate ...
Let 's use Mother 's Day weekend to think of those mothers in less fortunate countries .
Maternal health continues to be a challenge for many in remote areas , where access to clinics or even primary care is non-existent .
Or only exists only through WHO ( the UN's World Health Organisation ) mobile clinics as shown in this video .

Palin says she went after BP as Governor of Alaska and President Obama should , too , but White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs set Palin straight .
Here ’s as far as I got with the Palinese real time transcript :
“ There is perhaps a hesitancy I do n’t know how to say this the oil companies who have so supported Obama why the media has n’t asked if there is any connection there to President Obama to take so doggone long to dive in there and grasp the complexity and potential tragedy that we are seeing there in the Gulf … if this were President Bush or Republican who had n’t received the support form the oil companies as Obama , the msm would be all over his case , askin ’ why he did n’t get in there to make sure the regulatory agencies were getting in there to make sure the oil companies were n’t getting away with this .. ”

I can ’t .
I just can’t .
Luckily ,
Fox lovingly translated for us :
“ I do n’t know why the question is n’t asked by the mainstream media and by others if there ’s any connection with the contributions made to President Obama and his administration and the support by the oil companies to the administration . ”
Press Secretary Robert Gibbs knocked down Palin ’s claims on Face The Nation :
Gibbs said , “ I ’m almost sure that the oil companies do n’t consider the Obama administration a huge ally .
We proposed a windfall profits tax when they jacked their oil prices up to charge more for gasoline .
My suggestion to Sarah Palin would be to get slightly more informed as to what ’s going on in and around oil drilling in this country . ”
So , Sarah Palin , the Drill Baby Drill poster girl and someone whose PACS read like a who ’s who in the oil business has the gall to accuse Obama of not doing his job because he is in bed with big oil ?
Sarah did NOTHING to regulate oil in Alaska , other than charge them fees she gave back to the people in a redistribution of the wealth campaign .
No , Sarah got appointed to the citizens chair ( not an oil expert despite how the campaign lied about her service ) of the Oil and Gas Board by Frank Murkowski as a favor for her stumping for his campaign , when he refused to give her what she really wanted : his senate seat .
Sarah ’s Lt Governor Sean Parnell ( now the Governor ) was a former oil lobbyist and legislator .
Her backers in her campaign for governor were oil people , many of whom she promptly stabbed in the back by giving the gas pipeline project to TransCanada , the way real Americans do ( sending jobs to other countries , also , too ) .
As for her claim that she went after the oil companies , she had nothing to do with ( other than possibly being involved on the wrong end of the taking ) the VECO FBI investigation , which led to the downfall of Ted Stevens .
Frank Pruitt tipped off this FBI investigation , not Sarah Palin .
This investigation started before she was even governor .
VECO Corp has been a political player in Alaska for years and has ties with the state ’s political leaders , hosted campaign fundraisers and given hundreds of thousands in campaign contributions .
Including Sister Sarah .
As for Sarah ’s claim that Obama has more ties with big oil than Bush and Cheney … .
I bow down to the hubris .
It ’s not ignorance , because Sarah spends a lot of time in Texas with oil people who then contribute to her various PACs and campaigns .
No , she knows .
She ’s just lying because she CAN .
No one will call her out on it at Fox and she does n’t DO media anywhere else .
Here ’s some of those pesky liberal facts :
John S. McCain ( R ) ( um , the top of the ticket Palin ran on …ringing any bells ? ) has received $ 1,261,691 in oil contributions during the 2008 election campaign .
$ 46,900 of those dollars were from industry PACS .
Barack Obama ( D ) has received $ 435,123 in oil contributions during the 2008 election campaign .
$ 0 of those dollars were from industry PACS .
Um , so , yeah .
What is the bridge to nowhere saying again ?
Apparently Sarah once again does n’t understand the law .
She is now advocating for Obama to violate the law that was ( ironically ) put into place after the Exxon Valdez disaster , which states that oil companies are responsible for the clean up and payments and the government cannot take charge .
It ’s interesting to hear Sarah , a Republican who claims to be against socialism ( though we all know she was the biggest socialist in the US as governor of Alaska , and that is a literal fact ) calling for Obama to make sure the regulatory companies are “ getting in there ” .
Um , Sarah , the regulatory agencies come BEFORE disaster .
These would be those same regulations Sarah thought she and McCain were FOR , even though McCain has been known for his anti-regulation stance .
She thinks the President just waltzes in and tells the agencies what to do , takes over BP ’s legal duties ( nationalizing the company ) , we pay for the downside ( Republicans are still arguing that holding BP accountable for economic damages much over the current cap harms business ) , and then he tells the oversight people what to do and the magical Jesus rides in on his oil cascade of End Times glory .
Yes , Sarah , that ’s nationalization .
Look it up .
My god , Republicans .
REALLY ?
The GOP does not stand for regulations or oversight .
End of story .
They are still fighting against both NOW .

Anchorage Daily News , February 19 , 2009 :
“ An unknown amount of oil , natural gas and water spilled from a Prudhoe Bay pipeline this week in an incident under investigation by state regulators .
Prudhoe Bay , the state ’s biggest oil field , has had a series of spills in recent years that have led to heightened oversight by state and federal regulators of operations there .
BP runs the field on behalf of itself , Exxon Mobil , Conoco Phillips and Chevron . ”
And what did she leave in her wake ?
Where are all of those gosh darned regulations she supposedly fought for ?
Anchorage Daily News , December 4 , 2009 :
In the midst of cleaning up a major North Slope oil spill with an unusual twist , BP has reported another spill involving a different pipeline .
The spill is the second since Sunday involving pipelines managed by BP .
The Sunday oil spill still is being cleaned up as well .
Officials say they have not pinpointed a cause or estimated the size of that spill .
Anchorage Daily News , December 9 , 2009 :
Officials have found a 24 - inch jagged rupture in a pipeline that began pouring oil and water Nov. 29 , creating one of the biggest North Slope crude oil spills ever .
Officials say massive ice plugs had formed inside the pipe , which caused BP Exploration ( Alaska ) Inc. to stop operating it a few weeks ago .
Pressure then built up until the pipeline ruptured , according to BP .
The biggest oil spill ever on the North Slope occurred in 2006 when more than 200,000 gallons of crude leaked from a corroded transit line at the Prudhoe Bay field .
That led to a criminal misdemeanor conviction for BP , $ 20 million in fines and restitution , and three years of probation , which the company is still on . ”
So , what is that Sarah was prattling on about ?
Why did n’t she fix the mess in her own backyard ?
She had more pull with BP , since her husband worked for them –“ The governor has called a special session of the Legislature to possibly rewrite the Petroleum Profits Tax .
Her proposals could have a multi-million dollar impact on her husband ’s employer , ” lobbied for the oil industry ( without ever registering ) and she had tons of their money in her pocket .
What ’s this about oversight and regulation , Sarah ?
Does she mean when she tried to get the Polar Bear taken off the endangered spices list so the oil companies could drill more , drill now ?
Did Fox think it relevant to tell the viewers that the Palins ’ hold BP stock ?
Hmmm .
Talkin ’ outta both sides of you mouth , there , sweetie .
Now , if you were n’t scared enough , Fox tells us :
“ Finally , when asked about a potential Presidential run , the former Vice Presidential Candidate answered , “ if the voters of America are in the mood for a kind of unconventional , candid , honest public servant , and it does n’t necessarily have to be me , but if that ’s what they ’re in the mood for , they ’re going to let that be known and they ’re going to help really propel and push that candidate forward . ” ”
In other words , she ’s running as the reluctant candidate , Mrs. Smith Goes to Washington and saves the People , whilst never picking up a book or learning doggone it about Government .
Sure , she quit once but this would be different !
Her country needs her , unlike those Alaskans she left in debt and despair as she followed the treasonous money trail to her own fame and wealth .
Sarah Palin , the GOP ’s pride and joy , who believes just because she says something , it ’s real .
Never mind the facts , jack .
Facts are for the poor liberal elite .

MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) -- Unemployment in Spain has reached 20 percent , meaning 4.6 million people are out of work , the Spanish government announced Friday .
The figure , from the first quarter , is up from 19 percent and 4.3 million people in the previous quarter .
It represents the second - highest unemployment rate in the European Union , after Latvia , according to figures Friday from Eurostat , the EU 's statistics service .
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero told Parliament on Wednesday he believes the jobless rate has peaked and will now start to decline .
The first quarter of the year is traditionally poor for Spain because of a drop in labor - intensive activity like construction , agriculture and tourism .
This week , Standard & Poor 's downgraded Spain 's long - term credit rating and said the outlook is negative .
" We now believe that the Spanish economy 's shift away from credit - fuelled economic growth is likely to result in a more protracted period of sluggish activity than we previously assumed , " Standard & Poor 's credit analyst Marko Mrsnik said .
Gross domestic product growth in Spain is expected to average 0.7 percent annually through 2016 , compared with previous expectations of 1 percent annually , he said .
Spain 's economic problems are closely tied to the housing bust there , according to The Economist magazine .
Many of the newly unemployed worked in construction , it said .
The recession revealed how dependent public finances were on housing - related tax revenues , it said .
Another problem in Spain is that wages are set centrally and most jobs are protected , making it hard to shift skilled workers from one industry to another , the magazine said .
Average unemployment for the 27 - member European Union stayed stable in March at 9.6 percent , Eurostat said Friday .
That percentage represents 23 million people , it said .
The lowest national unemployment rates were in the Netherlands and Austria , which had 4.1 and 4.9 percent respectively , Eurostat said .

Article # 25 , by Can Sönmez

Insomnia as usual , so I 'll take the opportunity to chat about how the shift to online teaching only has been going for me here in Bristol .
I 've been doing it for a month now , as I have a housemate willing to be my uke .
I 've been using Zoom to teach group and private lessons since the lockdown got serious in the UK a month ago .
Internet connection while streaming has stayed steady , which surprised me considering my wifi is pretty rubbish .
The recording function on Zoom is terrible : it 's supposed to upload to Zoom 's cloud storage , but so far has just resulted in unwatchable vids ( though the quality while I 'm initially streaming seems to be fine ) .
I therefore record it on my phone instead , then upload that to unlisted YouTube links I can send to my students ( as lots of them do n't watch live , they prefer to check it out later , judging by the view numbers on the YouTube vids ) .
The full vids are between 20 to 30 minutes long , though as my uke does n't like to be on public footage , those are just for members .
😉 The main problem is naturally the lack of physical feedback .
I have got a few sufficiently motivated students that have been doing Zoom private lessons and give good verbal feedback , plus I can see what they 're doing and correct ( thanks to the gallery view in Zoom ) , but most of them do n't have a drilling partner , which unsurprisingly makes that a lot less useful .
Interestingly , one of the most committed private lesson students is somebody who I had n't often seen in my classes pre-lockdown : she usually goes to the nogi and women 's class .
I 'll be curious to see if she will pop up in my classes when normal training resumes ( I hope so , she 's a good student , a promising blue belt ) .
I have modified how I teach a little as a result of the move to online - only .
I demonstrate the technique for longer , also taking time to show it solo .
In a normal class , I 'd just teach one technique with one variation , then do a lot of drilling .
With Zoom , I 'll show multiple variations and some related techniques , plus anything else people ask about .
After that , I do solo drills ( like shrimping , bridging , grilled chicken , turn to knees , back step etc ) , bunch of repetitions so people can follow along .
The handy thing with that is I get a little work - out too : I have considered doing that section for longer ( at the mo , is n't usually more than a few mins ) .
So yeah , I need to ask if people want that solo drill section to be longer or not .
I then finish up with stretching , which again is useful for me .
That 's something else I could potentially do for longer , as there is n't the same time constraint as in a ' normal ' class .
I think that is one positive outcome of the lockdown .
All sensible BJJ schools have now engaged with some kind of online training as a result , which is making everybody more familiar with the options available .
That also means we are all getting a lot of hands - on experience with what works best online : the long - term repercussions for our sport could be significant , with a whole generation of BJJ teachers becoming very familiar with both the technology and pedagogy of teaching online .
Before lockdown , online training was something a few big names were able to use as an income stream , putting up technique videos relatively similar to what you get on a DVD .
Now , I think that is going to open up , as so many of us are running full classes on Zoom , or recording full classes and uploading them .
That experience and knowledge is still going to be there when the lockdown is lifted .
In an ideal world , it will provide us all with a whole new potential income stream , or at least a way to increase the value of what we can offer to our students .
I was surprised when an ex-student of mine ( who now lives in Australia ) suggested she'd be interested in paying to just have private lessons , as I 'd mentioned I was doing them for my current students .
I 'm not at a level yet where doing that separately would make sense , BUT it would n't be difficult to simply live stream my in - person classes ( once those start up again ) .
I could set up some low payment option for people like her , who have an interest in doing distance learning .
Though yeah , I 'd need a wifi connection at the gym for that , probably .
I could try the data on my phone , but I 'm not sure my data package is beefy enough to handle repeated live streaming .
It 's something I 've considered in the past , but the experience of Zoom classes has done a lot of clarify the idea for me .
Watch this space ! 😁
If you ever get caught up in a chemical or biological weapons attack , your cellphone may save your life .
Or at least that ’s the ambition of the Department of Homeland Security .
The Department ’s science and technology team has begun talks with four cell - phone manufacturers on designing ‘ nextgen ’ phones that would be able to sense a wide variety of noxious chemical compounds in the air – and alert the user .
The director of the “ Cell - All ” program at the DHS , Stephen Dennis , tells CNN that within a year , “ We expect up to 80 prototype cell phones to be developed that can be then tested against various agents . ”
The vision is to alert cell - phone users to all sorts of risks – from accidental gas leaks to a terror attack using poison gas .
For example , if ammonia escaped from a train wreck , the gas would trigger an alert .
The chip – at current prices – would cost as little as $ 1 .
One of the technologies being examined is a porous silicon “ nose ” that is based on – amazingly - the beetle shell .
Professor Michael Sailor at the University of California San Diego uses silicon to mimic the way a beetle ’s complex shell produces iridescence .
Sailor uses chemistry to give silicon particles a sponge - like structure .
The particles ’ pores are designed to recognize and sop up molecules of certain toxins .
So these “ artificial ” noses can potentially detect scores of chemical compounds .
NASA is also involved – helping with the chemical sensing , and using technology designed for measuring air quality in the space program .
“ They rethought the platform , ” says Dennis , scaling it down to ‘ nanosize . ’
The application would go beyond warning the consumer .
Dennis ’ team is already consulting emergency service providers to see how phone alerts might be automatically fed to authorities .
Dozens of alerts from multiple phones in one location would help responders quickly to assess the nature and extent of the threat .
In technical jargon , this “ crowd - sourcing ” helps provide a more accurate read - out of the threat .
( So for example if someone spilt some bleach at a laundromat , it would not translate into a major public emergency . )
The alert process would take less than a minute – and that seems a lot more efficient than hundreds of panicked citizens dialing 911 .
Imagine how useful such an application would have been had you been a Tokyo commuter on March 21 1995 , when members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult released sarin gas in five coordinated attacks on the city ’s subway .
Eight people died ; more than 5,000 were taken to hospitals .
Do n’t expect the application to be ready tomorrow – the “ Cell - All ” folks acknowledge it could be several years before it is commercially available .
The manufacturers involved have to grapple with design issues , power drain and other challenges .
And the sensors have to be designed in such a way that the number of “ false positives ” is kept to a minimum .
A lot of false alerts would not do anyone ’s nerves much good .
The DHS stresses that the technology would be optional in phones and that data transmissions would be anonymous .
Offering its services on connected consoles has " meaningfully " boosted video rental service Netflix 's subscriber base , says Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter .
" We believe that the Xbox 360 helped Netflix add 800,000 customers in 2009 , a figure that we had expected the PS3 and Wii to each replicate in 2010 , " Pachter says .
But growth is beating expectations .
The analyst estimates that each console -- currently Wii , Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 all support Netflix digital rentals , although Wii and PS3 require a special disc to be in the drive -- could create 300,000 - 400,000 new subscribers a year for the service , assuming a 5 - 10 percent conversion rate of new owners .
That will ultimately mean around 3 million new subscribers from all three consoles in 2010 , the analyst concludes , and then 900,000 - 1.2 million new subscribers thereafter .
Pachter says Netflix CDs for Wii owners , the last to receive access to the service via console , began shipping last Monday .
" In our opinion , Netflix on the Wii will not be as popular as it is on the Xbox 360 and the PS3 for two main reasons : the lack of HD on the Wii , and the limited number of Wii users connected to the Internet , " he says .
" Further , the Wii audience has demonstrated little commitment to buying videogames ( attach rates are at historical console lows ) , leading us to suspect that many Wiis are relegated to the playroom or ( heaven forbid ) the closet . "
But Netflix 's new iPad app is one of the most - downloaded third party applications , says Pachter , although while it will continue to be popular , " this popularity may not translate into a meaningful number of new subscribers , as we expect that a large portion of the the iPad 's tech - savvy clientele already have a Netflix subscription . "
Earlier this week , Netflix reported first quarter earnings up 44 percent year over year , with profits of $ 32.3 million and sales up 25 percent to $ 493.7 million .
In total , the company added 1.7 million new subscribers in the quarter alone , bringing it to a total of around 14 million users .
I 've stayed pretty quiet vis a vis the Flames for the past month , mainly because the Flames blogosphere is mostly consumed with teeth gnashing and unhappy post - mortems .
All justified , mind you , but at heart I 'm an optimist so I thought I 'd just sit and listen for a while rather than dive in .
Besides , Robert and Hayley and Richard and Kent over at that other place are all much better than me at doing the post - mortems - I appreciate the advanced stats and think there is value in them but I can't make them dance like they can .
So , I have n't had much to add , other than it feels like a bad time to be a Flames fan .
But while watching the little kid with the Boston Bruin jersey crying his eyes out in the stands after game 7 of the Bruin - Philly series , I realized it could be worse .
I 'm never one to say I 'd rather miss the playoffs than lose in the first round , because more Flame 's hockey is always preferable to less .
However , I was in the stands when they lost game 7 in double OT to San Jose back in '95 and I 'm pretty sure I felt worse than I do right now .
So , for fun , I thought I 'd give my opinion of fan - bases that are happier than us and those that have it worse , as of right now .
I 'm basing it on how the last year went , how it ended , and how the future looks .
If nothing else , it will remind us all that we 're lucky not to be Leaf fans .
In order from happiest to saddest groups of fans :
Montreal - Playing with house money , only team in Canada left
Philly - making history , also playing with house money and has great shot at surprise Cup final
Chicago - Good , still young team , and can enjoy it after years of crap
San Jose -
Always good , finally advanced past 2nd round , must feel like this is the year .
Still a little leery though , like they 're waiting for the other shoe to fall .
Pittsburgh - Coming off a Cup , still have Crosby and Malkin
Los Angeles -
Finally made playoffs , look like next stud team ( unless they sign Kovalchuk )
Colorado -
They 're happy because they think they 're back from the one year black hole , ready to be perennial powers .
They 're wrong , but they do n't know that so they 're happy !
Vancouver -
Sure they 're treading water , but should be able to reign over NW at least another year .
And they have some damn good regular season players .
Detroit -
The fans are spoiled and probably are n't happy , but screw them - they should be .
Other than having to watch Bertuzzi ( who admittedly did n't suck completely in the playoffs ) .
Phoenix - Knocked down a bit from the season - long high , because all six fans have to put up with another summer of wondering whether they 'll have a team , plus they 're going to miss the playoffs next year .
Ottawa -
Had a nice year , not sure it 's repeatable but at least they made the playoffs , plus they wo n't have to deal with the Heatley stuff this summer .
New Jersey - Playoff disappointment sucks , but they 're always near the top of the East so they always have a shot at being that crappy conference 's Stanley Cup rep .
Buffalo - Similar situation to Jersey .
Nashville - Not sure how it feels to be a fan of this team .
Wait a second , yes I do .
They make the playoffs nearly every year and always lose in the first round .
Seems familiar ...
St. Louis -
Of all teams that missed the playoffs , they should feel best about their chances for next year .
They can look back at this year with the injuries and really bad start and reasonably think they should have been in Colorado 's spot .
Washington -
They should be happier than a non-playoff team , but they 're too busy worrying about if they have what it takes to get over the hump and if their system and goaltending are both good enough .
Tampa Bay -
New owner , seemingly finally some sanity in the front office , Stamkos , Hedman , St. Louis ...
Islanders -
Some young talent and they 're not capped out .
Potentially a year or two behind the Kings model .
Canes -
One year removed from semi-final run , the fans are used to the schizophrenic nature of this team and think they 'll be back .
Calgary -
Sucks missing the playoffs but there is still enough talent around that with some better luck year two of Butter can be better than year one .
I 'm guessing this would go up some if Daz was relieved of his duties .
Anaheim / Minnesota / Rangers / Dallas -
All similar to Flames , think next year will be better than this year , have some recent history to celebrate , reasonably good organizations ( well , maybe not the Rangers ) .
I 'm sure their fans feel about the same as the Flames fans .
Oilers -
This year sucked , but there 's some talent in that pipeline and eventually they 'll be out of salary cap hell .
Would be higher if there was n't the sneaking suspicion management will screw it all up .
Florida -
Always missing the playoffs but never bad enough to get the really high draft choice .
Like the Flames of ' 97 -'03 .
This really sucks .
Atlanta / Columbus - See Florida
Bruins -
Were lucky to make the playoffs , and then a goal away from the conference finals in Game 4 they pissed it all away .
There are no fans of any team who feel worse right now .
Leafs -
Except maybe the team with the high draft choice that they gave to those same Bruins .

Tehran , Iran ( CNN ) --
Coming through on a promise to crack down on protesters on the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution , Iran 's security forces clashed with demonstrators Thursday , as hundreds of thousands filled a " disruption - free " Tehran square to hear their president announce the expansion of Iran 's nuclear program .
Iran 's celebration of the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution culminated February 11 , a date that three decades ago marked the end of the country 's Western - backed monarchy and the start of an Islamic republic .
A coalition of Iranian reformist groups had urged opponents of Iran 's hardline regime to stage nonviolent protests at central Tehran 's Azadi Square on Thursday , on the official anniversary of the ouster of Iran 's shah .
However , the Iranian government deployed thousands of police and plainclothes Basij militiamen in Tehran and other cities to quash anti-government protests during anniversary celebrations .
Eyewitnesses said Iranian security forces quickly squelched out opposition protests , though CNN could not independently confirm the reports .
" The city was under siege .
It was controlled entirely , it was impossible to protest the way people protested before , " said Behzad Yaghmaian , author of " Social Change in Iran . "
Follow CNN 's special coverage on Iran
" So the dangers were much higher today . "
Witnesses said there was some confusion about organizing the protests ; for example , it was n't clear to some whether they were supposed to hold up their signs before or after they arrived at Azadi Square , where President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was to speak .
It appeared that the strength of the opposition response was less than other recent days of unrest in Iran , namely the protests on the holy day of Ashura in late December .
Because of reporting restrictions , there was no way to independently confirm the turnout of the opposition .
Yaghmaian said the so - called Green Movement , which is demanding democracy and fair elections , suffered a " numbers shock . "
" The Green Movement anticipated a much larger turnout -- the turnout was not that large , and the turnout of the pro-government people was a lot larger than what people expected , " said Yaghmaian , who teaches at New Jersey 's Ramapo College .

Plainclothed and uniformed security agents assaulted vehicles carrying reformist Mehdi Karrubi , who ran for in the disputed June presidential elections , and former President Mohammad Khatami as their supporters poured onto the streets , opposition sources said .
Militia members also beat the wife of opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi with batons , according to postings on the social networking Web site Facebook and opposition Web sites .
The forces were preventing the opposition leaders and their followers from reaching Azadi , or Freedom Square , where Ahmadinejad delivered an anniversary address extolling the country 's nuclear program to supporters .
They fired on crowds in some areas and pepper - sprayed demonstrators in others , opposition groups said .
CNN has not been able to independently confirm those reports .
Members of the Basij , the paramilitary force loyal to Iran 's hard - line leadership , attacked Karrubi while he was headed to a meeting with supporters , his son Mohammad - Taghi Karrubi told CNN .
The militia broke a window in the car in which Karrubi was riding , an opposition Web site said .
When he switched cars , that car also was attacked .
" The guards attacked , and the crowds came to him .
When the crowds started to come and surrounded him , again the guards attacked with tear gas , tear as well as the batons and different kinds of weapons against the people .
And unfortunately my father received very bad gas tears , and his face is burned , " Mohammad - Taghi Karrubi said .

The reformist Raheh Sabz Web site said plainclothes policemen arrested Karrubi's son Ali , as he tried to protect his father 's car .
Mohammad - Taghi Karrubi confirmed the arrest of his brother Ali , the third of the leader 's four sons .
" My younger brother is arrested by police .
And we were surprised because for two days we just came to demonstrate , to rally , to participate to show what we want and ask for our rights , " he said .
The government said that if protesters disrupt state - sanctioned marches , they will be jailed until at least April 9 , the end of the Persian holiday of Norooz .
The holiday marks the start of spring .
Plainclothes security forces wielding tear gas and batons also attacked Khatami's vehicle and supporters , as he headed to Azadi Square , forcing him to abort a plan to walk there alongside followers , the Raheh Sabz site said .
Two reformist figures -- Mohammad Reza Khatami , the brother of the former president with a similar name , and his wife , Zahra Eshraghi -- were arrested , opposition groups also said .

The Facebook page of Dr. Zahra Rahnavard , Moussavi 's wife , said she had planned to join demonstrators at Sadeghiye Square , when she " was surrounded and attacked . "
" Plainclothes militia physically assaulted her and beat her with batons at her head and back .
Zahra Rahnavard after this incident with the support of a large crowd of people who made a human shield to protect her , was able to leave the area , " the Facebook page said .
Iran 's official Press TV took note of opposition protests , saying " a few hundred supporters " of Moussavi and Karrubi gathered in a western Tehran district , and Karrubi was seen among the demonstrators .
" Police had stepped up security in the area to prevent possible disturbances , " it reported .

The chaotic scenes drew expressions of concern from the West , with the United States and the European Union calling on Iran to end reported abuses against its people .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the United States stands " by the universal rights of Iranians to express themselves freely and to do so without intimidation or violence . "
" Iranians have gone out into the streets to do just that in a peaceful way , and we will continue to monitor it and continue to express our condemnation and dismay for any violence that should result in the exercising of those universal rights . "
Catherine Ashton , the European Union 's foreign policy chief , said the EU is concerned about " reports that opposition leaders have been subjected to violence and intimidation " and that some may have been detained .
Observers say the pro-government Azadi Square demonstration was a well - choreographed event .
One observer in the throng told CNN a relaxed and supportive atmosphere prevailed at the demonstration .
There was no sign at a pro-government parade of Basij militia members , ever - present during opposition events , but they were seen stationed away from the main area of the demonstration .
Government officials distributed cartons of milk , juice boxes , lemonade and cupcakes in the crowds , which appeared to number in the hundreds of thousands , the witness said .
Women who usually stay home went out , and there were a number of people from outside Tehran attending , the observer said .
" They got what they wanted : a disruption - free rally , " the observer said .
" There were no potential ' greens ' in that crowd . "
Flag - waving and cheering supporters heard Ahmadinejad announce that Iran has produced its first batch of 20 percent - enriched uranium and will soon triple production -- a claim that the United States dismissed .
He also touched on familiar topics :
He lashed out at the West , particularly the United States , and criticized its relationship with Iran 's rival , Israel .
Ahmadinejad 's speech at Azadi Square ended without incident .
" There are those who stand against us because what they want is to control the Middle East and to control the world , " Ahmadinejad said .
" And an independent Iran , a free Iran , a developed Iran , a powerful Iran will naturally be a challenge for their goal .
And that is why they are hostile to the Iranian nation . "
Since a disputed presidential election in June , anti-government protesters have turned public gatherings into rallies against hard - liner Ahmadinejad , who was declared the overwhelming winner of the race , and street demonstrations were anticipated on the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution .
Over the volatile months since June , police have responded to such demonstrations with mass arrests , denouncing protesters as anti-Islamic and against the revolution .
In the latest big street confrontation , on the holy day of Ashura in December , witnesses said hundreds of people were detained and seven were killed , with responsibility for the fatalities denied by the Iranian regime .
As the anniversary day approached , opposition leaders urged their followers to demonstrate peacefully , and Iran has imposed tight restrictions on foreign reporters covering the anniversary , busing them to and from Ahmadinejad 's speech to prevent them from reporting on skirmishes on the streets .
The precautions were meant to prevent a repeat of overt anti-government displays on other key occasions that have embarrassed and inflamed Iranian authorities .
Pick - ups roamed the streets of Tehran , blaring pro-government slogans and songs from speakers , a witness said , and residents in the Iranian capital said Wednesday that text messages on many messaging services have been blocked and Internet speeds have slowed to a crawl .
At Aria - Shahr square in western Tehran and in various other parts of the city , security forces fired on and tear - gassed demonstrators who chanted " Death to the dictator , " and " Death to ( Supreme Leader Ayatollah ) Khamenei , " according to opposition reports .
Undeterred , the demonstrators chanted on , and many of them wore masks or handkerchiefs over their faces .
Opposition videos surfacing from Tehran showed the wrath of demonstrators .
One showed protesters tearing up a poster of Ayatollah Khomeini , the late founder of the Islamic Revolution , and Khamenei .
Another showed people stomping on an image of Khamenei .
One video showed a man apparently stripped from the waist up put in a choke hold and punched in the head by a helmeted security force member .
This is a tale of two hospitals .
One has the highest rate of Caesarean sections in the city , the other the fourth lowest .
They represent some of the city ’s obstetric extremes , yet they sit just five miles apart on Staten Island , serving similar populations .
So what accounts for the difference ?
In large part , determination , which Dr. Mitchell A. Maiman , the chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at one of the two , Staten Island University Hospital , has in ample supply .
As New York City ’s C-section rate has soared in recent years — by 36 percent , between 2000 and 2007 , according to the New York State Department of Health — Dr. Maiman has kept his hospital ’s rate around 23 percent of all births .
In 2008 , according to numbers released by Choices in Childbirth , an advocacy group for pregnant women , working with state statistics , Staten Island University Hospital ’s rate went down , while the rate at the other hospital , Richmond University Medical Center , went up again , to 48.3 percent .
That made it , for the fifth consecutive year , the hospital with the highest C- section rate in the city .
( The National Center for Health Statistics reported that the Caesarean rate reached 32 percent in 2007 . )
Caesarean births are generally considered more prone to complications than natural births , so most hospitals at least pay lip service to their devotion to reducing them .
But very few have pulled it off .
What seems to have made the difference for Dr. Maiman ’s department is building that goal into policy , even when it is unpopular with doctors — even , sometimes , when it may be unpopular with patients .
I had planned on reviewing the iPad in my next post , but instead I ’ll dedicate this entry to my photo below and an incident that happened today .
Review of the iPad coming soon .
( UPDATE : now posted )
As was correctly guessed , those iPads in the photo are not for me .
When Apple delayed the international iPad launch by a month , early adopters worldwide started to panic .
Since my nearby
Apple store initially had plenty of stock , I offered to purchase and ship iPads internationally for members of the NeoGAF gaming forum .
I was doing this as a favor , unlike hoarders who were unloading iPads on eBay to cash in on the $ 150 + markup .
Instead , my asking prices were very reasonable , just enough to cover all the tax , international express shipping , and Paypal fees with a little left over for unexpected costs .
So as the pick - up requests came in , I went on multiple visits to the Apple store , buying no more than 2 per day since I had heard there was a limit per person .
I found this whole situation pretty funny considering I had never bought an Apple product prior to this madness ( the iPod Touch I use at work was given to me by my medical school ) .
But the store recently went completely out of stock .
I had one last order to fulfill so an employee helped me place a reservation .
A few days passed and yesterday I was sent an email notifying that my reserved iPad had come in .
The story begins here …
I walk into the store today and ask somebody where I can pick up my iPad reservation .
He notes my name and says he ’ll be back , going behind closed doors to the stockroom .
I take advantage of this opportunity to place another iPad reservation using a store PowerBook .
There are a couple more NeoGAF people considering a purchase , but they have n’t paid me yet .
Oh well , by the time this reservation comes in , one of them should have made up his mind and sent payment .
But drats , reservations are limited to one per iTunes account .
Luckily I have a second account so I used that to place the reservation .
No sweat .
The employee emerges a few minutes later with the iPad and I hand over my credit card .
If you ’ve never been to an Apple store before , instead of checking customers out at a register , the employees use hand - held credit card terminals to ring up purchases .
Adds to the hip factor , I suppose .
But instead of using his handheld device , he walks to the back of the store where the “ Genius Bar ” is .
Naught a word spoken .
There are registers here but this area is used mainly for technical support .
I follow the guy there .
He still has n’t said anything to me .
He gives my credit card to one of the staff there and says , “ I want you to help me ring up this purchase . ”
Guy # 2 ( looking at the handheld terminal ) —
“ Why do n’t you just use that ? ”
Guy # 1 — “ I need to check the card for … uh , pre-authorization . ”
Guy # 2 — “ Ok . ”
He swipes my card and they click around for about half a minute while looking at their monitor and whispering .
Meanwhile , I ’m standing on the other side of the Genius Bar , only half paying attention to these two guys .
Instead I was curiously watching an employee ask a girl what she loves most about Apple .
Guy # 2 ( murmuring ) — “ … yeah , the 14th . ”
My attention snaps back when I catch this snippet .
April 14th was my last trip to the Apple store , and I had bought 2 iPads that day .
When I walked to the Genius Bar , I had n’t suspected anything out of the ordinary .
But now I suddenly realize I will not be walking out of here with an iPad today .
Guy # 1 says to Guy # 2 —
“ Hold on , I ’ll be right back ” and disappears to the stockroom again .
Guy # 2 is still clicking around , not looking at me .
Me ( nonchalantly ) —
“ Is there an issue ? ”
He ’s still staring at his monitor and a few seconds pass before Guy # 2 carefully says , “ There is a limit to the number of iPads that customers can buy . ”
Me ( playing dumb ) — “ Oh , is that right ?
What ’s the limit ? ”
Guy # 2 — “ Only 2 per customer . ”
Ok , so the gig is up .
I stand around waiting for a bit and was preparing to leave when Guy # 1 returns .
Guy # 1 —
“ I ’m sorry sir , but you have reached your lifetime limit of iPad purchases and will not be allowed to buy any more . ”
Me ( anticipating that statement ) —
“ Is the iPad limit per person ?
Per credit card ?
Per household ? ”
Guy # 1 —
“ All I can say is that you have reached your lifetime limit . ”
Me — “ What does that mean ?
Can I use a different credit card to buy it ?
I ’m buying this for a friend . ”
Guy # 1 —
“ You are not allowed to buy this iPad . ”
Me — “ Uhh … is it ok if I have a family member or friend come to buy it for me ?
My reservation does n’t expire until 6:00 PM . ”
Guy # 1 —
“ All I can say is that you have reached your lifetime limit . ”
Me ( suddenly realizing what he ’s saying ) —
“ Wait , what ?
Lifetime ?
What does that mean ? ”
Guy # 1 —
“ All I can say is that you have reached your lifetime limit of iPads and will not be allowed to buy any more . ”
Me — “ I ’m banned from buying iPads ?
I know there ’s a shortage right now , but I ca n’t buy any more once there ’s plenty of stock ? ”
Guy # 1 —
“ All I can say is that you have reached your lifetime limit . ”
I pause and look at him with incredulity undoubtedly written all over my face .
Everybody tells me I have the worst poker face .
Hey asshole , nice job with the passive aggressiveness , but who do you think you ’re talking to ?
I ’m from Los Angeles ; nobody does passive - aggressive like we do !
Me — “ Ok buddy , I ’m not going to make a scene so I ’m leaving .
How many iPads is the limit by the way ? ”
Guy # 1 —
“ That information is not available . ”
Me ( looking at Guy # 2 , who has been silent this whole time ) —
“ He tells me that the limit is two . ”
Guy # 1 —
“ I wish I could say but I do not have that information . ”
Me — “ I ’ve already purchased more than 2 iPads .
Why did n’t anybody else stop me in the past ? ”
Guy # 1 —
“ I wish I could say but I do not have that information . ”
Me — “ Alright , I ’ve had enough .
Have a good day . ”
The icing on the cake ?
When I came home , I found an email from Apple waiting for me .
It was an update about my reservation , the one I had placed today in the store using my 2nd account !
Ban complete .
APPENDIX : Many people have been emailing me to ask how much I charged people .
While I had previously decided not to give any concrete numbers , I also did n’t anticipate the wide interest in my story .
For full disclosure , here are the specific figures :
A 16 GB iPad model retails for U.S. $ 499 .
My initial asking price was U.S. $ 650 .
This price includes all my additional charges : sales tax , 2 day USPS international express shipping , insurance , and Paypal credit card fees .
All customs duty was properly declared .
This initial price was based on a shipping cost which I had estimated myself .
Once I actually shipped the first package out and knew the actual USPS shipping cost , I refunded $ 20 to my buyers and lowered my price to U.S. $ 630 .
The other models were priced the same way .
In summary , 16 GB for $ 630 , 32 GB for $ 740 , 64 GB for $ 850 .
How is this different from eBay markup ?
eBay auctions add additional shipping costs and fees on top of the final auction value ( $ 150 - $ 200 above retail last I checked ) .
I bought 5 iPads total .
You can do whatever calculation you want to figure out my “ big - time profits ” .
I ’ll save you the time : it was negligible .
Was it worth all that effort driving around after long days working at the hospital ?
Financially , no .
But 5 diehard Apple fans in countries around the world are now very happy and spreading the iPad love to friends and co-workers , who would not have seen the iPad in person for a month at the very minimum .
A couple of them have requested that I buy a few more iPads for their friends .
I had to decline because … well , Apple banned me .
Photo from Flickr .
I do n’t know his story , please do n’t go flaming him .
Let ’s play a game : how many sites will use this photo in connection with my story when they post about it , thinking these iPads are all mine ?
Just a little test to see if people actually read what I write instead of being sensationalists and grabbing only what they want to hear .
The moment you , MyTouch 3G and G1 users , have been waiting for is here !
Only minutes ago Cyanogen announced the availability of CyanogenMod 5.0.7 ROM ( v. Test1 ) which brings Android 2.1 to MT3G and G1 :

Thank you to EVERYONE involved in helping with testing , coding , debugging and documenting !
Enjoy !
No-one , ultimately , had a clue about the election .
The pollsters , the politicians , the pundits got it wrong .
Even the bookies , who are always meant to be right , having a financial interest in being so , were wrong .
No - one predicted the result we got or understands it now we ’ve got it .
Why did people vote this way here , that way there ?
Why did the Lib Dems lose seats ?
Who benefits most from a Tory deal ?
No idea .
Amid all this confusion , spare a thought for the poor political columnists , the people who have to pretend that they can still explain it all in 600 words .
What on earth can they write ?
When a political journalist is n’t sure of their ground , the first rule is to keep things portentous , but vague .
Tell the party leaders what they should be doing to make a success of this election .
Just do n’t say it ’s what they will do .
The second : when you do come down strongly on someone ’s side , refer to a higher authority to give yourself the requisite gravitas .
Someone whose authority will not be questioned – someone who radiates an indefinable but unimpeachable cachet .
In America , if it ’s not God , it ’s the Founding Fathers .
Over here , it ’s Orwell .
Many journalists , moonlighting as clairvoyants , are able to reveal exactly what Orwell would think about any contemporary political question .
In the last month alone we ’ve learned how Orwell “ foresaw our treatment of Sharon Shoesmith ” ( The Independent ) , that this election represented “ a campaign that Orwell would recognise ” ( The Indie again ) , or how Orwell , an old Etonian just like Cameron , would n’t mind a bit of fagging ( The Daily Telegraph ) .
If not giving us updates on Orwell ’s spectral Twitter feed , then writers are letting us in on the secrets of the “ real Orwell ” ( ©
The Times , The Scotsman and The Herald , all 2010 ) , as if we ’ve been making do with the beta version for the last 70 years .
Another Times article is happy to set us straight about how “ people invoke George Orwell … wrongly as universal patron saint and defender of the poor . ”
The fools !
Thankfully , the columnist is able to explain to us that Orwell disliked the “ benefit cheats ” he met in Wigan , despite the non-existence of any real welfare state for them to cheat in the 1930s .
Crudely put , George Orwell is anyone ’s bitch .
Whatever the topic , whatever the political position , he can be wheeled out …

Sean Penn has defended Hugo Chávez as a model democrat and said those who call him a dictator should be jailed .
The Oscar - winning actor and political activist accused the US media of smearing Venezuela 's socialist president and called for journalists to be punished .
" Every day , this elected leader is called a dictator here , and we just accept it , and accept it .
And this is mainstream media .
There should be a bar by which one goes to prison for these kinds of lies . "
Penn , who has visited Chávez in Caracas , said Venezuela 's poor majority had willingly embraced his leftist revolution , but that this view was concealed from Americans .
" We are hypnotised by the media .
Who do you know here who 's gone through 14 of the most transparent elections on the globe , and has been elected democratically , as Hugo Chávez ? "
Penn , speaking on Bill Maher 's HBO chatshow , is part of a small but vocal pro-Chávez Hollywood group which includes Oliver Stone and Danny Glover .
They have remained steadfast even as Venezuela 's leader has lost fans at home and abroad .
Inflation , crime and water and electricity shortages have hit his popularity and led to defections from his socialist party .
The Organisation of American States recently accused Chávez of intolerance and authoritarianism , and a Spanish judge accused Venezuela of cosseting Farc and Eta terrorists , sparking a diplomatic spat with Madrid .
Chávez thanked Penn for his support in what he said was a daily battle for public opinion .
" I was reading the declarations from our friend Sean Penn , the famous American actor , " he told a televised rally in Caracas .
" Penn defended what he considers to be the truth . "
The Hollywood star was an ally in the effort to counter a campaign to " confuse " Venezuelans , said the president , who has been in power for 11 years .
" From here I thank you very much . "
Other celebrity endorsements have come from the linguist and writer Noam Chomsky and model Naomi Campbell .
Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay says that Sen. Jim Bunning was “ brave ” for blocking an extension in unemployment benefits .
DeLay subscribes to the notion that people only try to find jobs when their benefits run out .
“ There is an argument to be made that these extensions , the unemployment benefits , keep people from going and finding jobs , ” he told CNN ’s Candy Crowley Sunday .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ In fact there are some studies that have been done that show people stay on unemployment compensation and they do n’t look for a job until two or three weeks before they know the benefits are going to run out , ” he argued .
“ People are unemployed because they want to be ? ” asked Crowley .
“ Well , it is the truth .
And people in the real world know it , ” said DeLay .
The Senate passed a ten billion dollar stopgap unemployment measure late Tuesday , after including an amendment offered by Sen .
Bunning that prevented further deficits .
Ryan Grim noted in The Huffington Post that “ unemployment benefits are generally so small that much of it is often used to pay for COBRA health insurance , even when subsidized .
The size of the benefits does not generally cover the cost of living and it would be hard to find a single person who would prefer unemployment to having a job so that they could get subsidized COBRA . ”

Fast , Useful Business Knowledge for Musicians and Artists .
DETROIT — The leader of a Christian militia planned an elaborate , two - part training session for this month and told members it was OK to kill " anyone who might stumble upon the operation , " federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing Friday .
Details about the Hutaree 's planned training session -- to be held during the second and fourth Saturdays in April -- were revealed in a 17 - page document prosecutors filed in response to a defense motion to free Hutaree leader David Stone while he awaits trial .
It , along with several other government filings over the past week , help paint a fuller picture of the southern Michigan - based group 's make - up and activities .
Stone and eight other suspected Hutaree members were arrested after a series of raids across the Midwest late last month and charged with seditious conspiracy , or plotting to levy war against the U.S.
The self - proclaimed " Christian warriors " trained in paramilitary techniques in preparation for a battle against the Antichrist .
Friday 's filing included a transcript of remarks Stone allegedly made during a January briefing on the planned operation .
According to the filing , Stone told other Hutaree members that " we are going locked and loaded . "
" If you 're made , somebody comes tripping along , they just happen to see you , we 're gonna handle it as a hostile situation , " Stone said .
" That means you put them on the ground . "
Andrew Arena , the head of the FBI in Detroit , has said his office felt compelled to arrest the nine suspects before the April training session because of the potential for violence .
Stone 's lawyer , William Swor , said he had n't seen the latest filing but does n't see any reason why his client should be jailed .
" The government has n't proved that he should n't be free , " Swor said .
Prosecutors claim Stone and the others plotted mass killings of police as a prelude to a larger war against the government .
In Friday 's filing and others that trickled out over the past week , they described several ways in which Hutaree members considered killing law enforcement personnel .
According to one scenario , they would place a phony 911 call , kill responding police officers , then set off a bomb at the ensuing funeral to kill many more .
In another , Friday 's filing said , Hutaree members talked about " torching the homes of police officers and then shooting them and their families as they fled their burning homes . "
Swor and other defense attorneys in the case have argued their clients are protected by a right to free speech .
A federal magistrate judge in Detroit has ordered eight of the suspects to remain locked up until trial .
A ninth suspect , Thomas Piatek , of Whiting , Ind. , was ordered held by a judge in Indiana but recently transported to Michigan .
Piatek appeared in court Thursday and a not - guilty plea was entered .
U.S. District Judge Victoria Roberts has set an April 27 hearing to consider appeals of the detention orders , but the date could change because of a scheduling conflict with one of the prosecutors .

The current $ 350 million ad campaign for the 2010 Census , including the much - maligned $ 2.5 million Super Bowl spots , urges individuals to  Tell your story . 
The Census Bureau is particularly eager for minorities and illegal immigrants to do so , as they are traditionally believed to be the most undercounted .
Yet widespread non-compliance , especially among those most likely to be discriminated against by a majority , may not be rooted strictly in the ignorance  the ads are designed to overcome .
History including very recent history shows that the information provided to the Census can be used against you .
The most recent examples occurred in 2002 and 2003 , when the Census Bureau turned over information it had collected about Arab - Americans to Homeland Security .
Data from the 1940 Census was used to intern Japanese , Italian , and German Americans following the U.S.s entry into the war , and to monitor and persecute others who escaped internment .
In addition to providing geographic information to the War Department , the Census Bureau released the name , address , age , sex , citizenship status and occupation of Japanese Americans in the Washington , D.C. , area to the Treasury Department in response to an unspecified threat against President Franklin Roosevelt in 1943 .
There may well be other instances of such data sharing of which we remain unaware , as the full scope of the personal information released during World War II has only recently been brought to light .
Thus , while the Census Bureau assures us that your confidentiality is protected .
Title 13 requires the Census Bureau to keep all information about you and all other respondents strictly confidential ,  these exceptions negate such assurances .
Of course , the release of the strictly confidential data was also perfectly legal : during World War II , under the terms of the Second War Powers Act , and more recently , under the terms of the USA PATRIOT Act , now extended by the Obama administration .
In preparation for this years census , 140,000 workers were hired to collect GPS readings for every front door in the nation .
Such pinpoint precision will certainly simplify the process of locating any individual or group that may be identified as a threat to national security  in the future .
Remember , for example , the 1976 Senate Report in which 26,000 Americans were slated for roundup by the FBI in the event of a national emergency at the height of the Cold War .
Now that the U.S. Governments Terrorist Watchlist has exceeded one million , the GPS data acquired could be instrumental in accomplishing such a roundup .
Meanwhile , the data is also shared a little more broadly than advertised .
Stanford University recently joined UC Berkeley , Duke , the University of Michigan , UCLA , and others in having its very own census data center .
As the director of the new center explained ,  The Census Bureau is very interested in making the centers more accessible to scholars who can use the data they provide . 
As Henry Brady , dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley and principal investigator for the California Census Research Data Centers helpfully added :  We re trying to make centers where lots of federal agencies will let us use their data . 
While reassurances are repeated that the data is held under the strictest security , and will only be used for innocuous projects like government programs and solutions to our problems ,  do we really want academics to social engineer policy solutions based on sensitive personal data ?
After all , they may turn out to be no more desirable than the solutions  provided by government programs like internment and renditioning .
Without the protections afforded by a right to privacy , theres little chance of escaping a political will to enforce discriminatory policies .
This mission creep for the Census thus pushes up against a level of discomfort no amount of advertising dollars can likely assuage .
Many will no doubt choose to follow former Senate majority leader Trent Lotts advice to skip any Census questions they feel violates their privacy which may well include any exceeding the Constitutions mandate for an actual Enumeration . 
Unfortunately , choosing privacy now costs more : legislation recently passed raises the fine for anyone over 18 years old who refuses or willfully neglects to complete the questionnaire or answer questions posed by census takers  from a limit of $ 100 to $ 5,000  a fact not advertised even in the small print .
Kareena Kapoor is pregnant .
No no no .
Not in real life but reel life .
Yes we are talking about reel life of Kareena Kapoor .
Because we know ...
A recent Medina GOP mailer that urges voters to " take Betty Sutton out of the House and put her back in the kitchen , " has angered the Emily 's List political action committee , which raises money for female Democratic candidates .
" They 're set on defeating Cong. Betty Sutton ( OH - 13 ) , whom we helped elect in 2006 , and filling her spot with a conservative loyalist .
And how will they go about doing that ?
By sending her right where they think she ( and all women ) belong : the kitchen , " says a posting on the group 's website , which links to a fundraising page for Sutton .
" I wish I could say I were shocked , but I can't .
I can , however , say I 'm appalled , annoyed , and ready to do something about it . "
Medina County GOP Chairman Bill
Heck confirmed the Sutton item came from a recent edition of a party publication called the " Republican Review , " which goes to roughly 15,000 households .
He said he had n't received any complaints about it , and suggested that anyone who was offended could pursue the matter with the Ohio Elections Commission instead of trying " to air it through the paper and get some noise going . "
" I know Democrats said that kind of thing about Sarah Palin , but maybe the reference to the kitchen was n't the exact word , " said Heck .
" It was another sexist female task or location . "
It is hard to summarize Tim Weiner ’s Legacy of Ashes because there really is n’t anything that can be cut from it .
Every page is packed with stories of incredible sacrifice at low levels and incredible malfeasance at the highest level ( low - level people thinking of sacrificing yourselves , take note ) .
There ’s the story of how the CIA stole 5 % of the Marshall Plan relief money , stories of how it funded " moderate " socialist political parties and media all over the " free " world , stories of vast expenditure on covert programs with little result .
And of course the story of Dusty Foggo , executive director of the CIA under Bush .
His story is unusual in that he was actually convicted for corruption , unlike most of the questionable characters that have hidden behind CIA secrecy .
All these stories should be common knowledge , but are n’t ; most of us know more about James Bond than Dusty Foggo .
They add up to a series of valuable historical lessons which could save us from future possibly civilization - wrecking disasters .
I suppose we could summarize the lessons as " giving a quarter trillion dollars with no oversight to implausibly inept bureaucrats with names like Dusty Foggo and calling it an intelligence agency is n’t a very good idea , " but let ’s break it down :
1. The CIA Ca n’t Spy
The first lesson is that the CIA has never been able to spy on America ’s potential enemies .
The CIA was caught completely by surprise by every major development : the Soviet A - bomb , the Soviet H-bomb , the Korean War , the arrival of missiles in Cuba … right up to Saddam ’s invasion of Kuwait , which the CIA absolutely denied would happen even as it was underway .
A few years later the CIA turned around and stated that absolutely for sure , Saddam had WMDs .
Dick Cheney was presumably lying about the WMDs …
Weiner is pretty sure the CIA just did n’t know .
Every security threat has escaped the CIA ’s notice until they read about it in the newspaper or the military ’s satellites photographed it .
The CIA was unable to spy on Mao , Kim Il Sung , Stalin , Brezhnev , even Saddam Hussein .
If any of those guys ( I mean , among the ones that actually had WMDs ) had really been plotting a nuclear Pearl Harbor , the US would be a radioactive ruin .
The Agency ’s record on economic intelligence is similar .
The CIA was still reporting that the USSR ’s economy was growing at a whopping 6 % per year , even as that sickly economy collapsed in real life and the Berlin Wall fell .
According to the CIA figures ( which Weiner says they obtained by just taking the Soviet Five - Year Plan propaganda releases and tweaking them ) , apparently the USSR had solved the problem of calculation in a Socialist economy .
Why the CIA did n’t simply reveal that magic formula to the world and end the necessity for the difficulties of accounting and entrepreneurship was never asked .
The CIA ’s nearly total blindness has two causes : one , they have never had much in the way of spies .
During most of the Cold War the CIA had no important human intelligence behind the Iron Curtain at all .
Second , the CIA has often been penetrated by foreign intelligence services ( the Aldrich Ames case being the norm more than an outlier ; the NSA was formed when CIA signals intelligence was compromised right before the Korean War by a single Soviet spy named Weisband ) .

Even when the CIA thought it had valuable agents or signals intelligence , the KGB knew what the CIA knew and fed it what they wanted it to know .
A typical story was a cable - tapping operation in Berlin ; the CIA at vast expense dug a tunnel to a cable line and tapped it , sucking in vast amounts of data .
The Russians ’ spies knew about the operation from the beginning , and simply allowed the CIA to think that it had the upper hand .
But the agency was just as blind as ever … worse than blind , because for a while it thought it had 20 - 20 vision .
The CIA has often attempted to use friendly foreign intelligence agencies ( some of which actually have some spies ) as seeing - eye dogs … of course this leads to US policy being guided by foreign intelligence agencies .
2. The CIA Can’t Overthrow Dictatorships
The second lesson is that the CIA does no better when it comes to covert operations .
The CIA has served as a great shield to the dictatorships of the world , by recruiting people who wanted to oppose tyranny and turning them over to the respective secret police agencies .
Thousands of anti-communist Chinese , Koreans , Russians , Tibetans , Germans , Hungarians , Cubans etc. etc. were parachuted to certain death by the CIA , year after year and decade after decade .
And decade after decade the CIA covered up its failures from the American people , and kept the money flowing .
The few covert operation " successes " the CIA boasts were not about overthrowing totalitarian regimes .
The CIA did " succeed " in installing dictators in Greece , Guatemala , Iran , and other places where CIA money was sufficient to buy enough thugs .
Of course when these regimes finally fall , as in Iran , they leave the people who lived under them permanently embittered against the US .
The CIA also used to boast about their " success " in arming and funding Islamic fundamentalist terrorist groups to fight a little war in Afghanistan .
This has seemed less successful an idea since certain recent events .
3 . The CIA Is Secret Only From The US Taxpayer
The third lesson is that secrecy is counterproductive to real security .
Of course the world is a dangerous place , and we need defenses .
But the CIA has never been an effective part of America ’s defenses .
The military detests the CIA for its refusal to turn over what little intelligence it has during wartime .
CIA ineptitude and coverups have left US Presidents unknowingly blind during crises , thinking that they knew what was going on when they did n’t .
The CIA creates enemies in places where we had none , while it gives our real enemies more ability to spy on us ( and on their own dissidents ) than they would have without it .
It has always been a black hole for money … secret budgets breed Dusty Foggos like spilling cornflakes behind the kitchen counter breeds roaches .
And worst of all , the CIA is the most directly evil part of Aid To Dependent Dictators ; directly helping torture and kill people who oppose their own tyrannical governments .
The bottom line is that government secrecy is the enemy of freedom , not its protector .
The opposite of foreign totalitarianism is not domestic totalitarianism , it is transparency .
The US is still by far the most powerful nation on Earth ; we need fear no open enemy .
And all we have to do to get rid of most of the secret enemies is to quit paying for them ourselves .
The Best of Bill Walker
A week after filing suit , Blizzard has suddenly dropped all charges against alleged hacker group " Starcrack . "
On April 12 , Blizzard moved to sue a man by the name of John Marshall and five other unnamed defendants , alleging Marshall , under the name " usmc23 , " was posting detailed reports on the progress of the group 's attempt to crack Starcraft II 's game client and create an unauthorized copy .
Blizzard 's complaint was Marshall and his fellow hackers were producing this crack " ... with the goal of enabling members of this community to benefit from Blizzard 's development of SC2 without paying for it . "
A week later , the charges , which included direct and indirect copyright violation as well as the circumvention of copyright protection systems and a breach of contract , have all been dropped , with no stated reason why .
What we do know is Blizzard is cracking down on hacks and misuse of its system , so dropping the lawsuit seems a bit out of character .
Mistaken identity , perhaps ?

What Determines How Much Ultraviolet Radiation Reaches the Earths Surface ?
The amount of UV radiation reaching the Earths surface varies widely around the globe and through time .
Several factors account for this variation at any given location .
They are discussed below in order of importance , and descriptions of their effects appear in succeeding paragraphs .
Cloud Cover
Cloud cover plays a highly influential role in the amount of both UV - A and UV - B radiation reaching the ground .
Each water droplet in a cloud scatters some incoming UV radiation back into space , so a thick cover of clouds protects organisms and materials from almost all UV .
The larger the percentage of the sky that is covered by clouds , the less UV reaches the ground .
The more opaque the cloud , the less UV - B .
However , thin or broken cloud cover can be deceiving to people who are sunbathing , and the result can be an unexpected and severe sunburn .
Ozone in the Stratosphere
Ozone is the combination of three oxygen atoms into a single molecule ( O 3 ) .
It is a gas produced naturally in the stratosphere where it strongly absorbs incoming UV radiation .
But as stratospheric ozone decreases , UV radiation is allowed to pass through , and exposure at the Earths surface increases .
Exposure to shorter wavelengths increases by a larger percentage than exposure to longer wavelengths .
Scientists can accurately estimate the amount of UV - B radiation at the surface using global data from satellites such as NASAs TOMS ( Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer ) , GOME ( Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment ) and Aura ( will open in a new window ) , to be launched in 2003 , satellites .
These satellite measurements are compared to ground - based measurements to ensure that the satellite data are valid .
To calculate the reduction of UV - B by ozone , scientists consider the total ozone in a column of air from the stratosphere to the Earths surface .
At mid-latitudes , a decrease of one percent in ozone may result in an increase of between one ( 310 nm ) and three ( 305 nm ) percent of potentially harmful UV - B at the surface during mid-summer when UV - B is highest .
Ozone depletion is greater at higher latitudes , ( toward the North and South Poles ) and negligible at lower latitudes ( between 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S ) .
This means that decreases in ozone over Toronto are likely to be greater than those over Boston , and those over Boston greater than those over Los Angeles , while Miami will typically see the least ozone depletion of the four cities .
However , cities at lower latitudes generally receive more sunlight because they are nearer the equator , so UV levels are higher even in the absence of ozone depletion .
If ozone were to decrease at lower latitudes , southern cities would experience a greater absolute increase in UV - B than cities in the north for the same amount of ozone depletion .
Oblique angle of sunlight reaching the surface
At any given time , sunlight strikes most of the Earth at an oblique angle .
In this way , the number of UV photons is spread over a wider surface area , lowering the amount of incoming radiation at any given spot , compared to its intensity when the sun is directly overhead .
In addition , the amount of atmosphere crossed by sunlight is greater at oblique angles than when the sun is directly overhead .
Thus , the light travels through more ozone before reaching the Earths surface , thereby increasing the amount of UV - B that is absorbed by molecules of ozone and reducing UV - B exposure at the surface .
Aerosols
Unlike clouds , aerosols in the troposphere , such as dust and smoke , not only scatter but also absorb UV - B radiation .
Usually the UV reduction by aerosols is only a few percent , but in regions of heavy smoke or dust , aerosol particles can absorb more than 50 percent of the radiation .
While the presence of aerosols anywhere in the atmosphere will always scatter some UV radiation back to space , in some circumstances , aerosols can contribute to an increase in UV exposure at the surface .
For example , over Antarctica , cold temperatures cause ice particles ( Polar Stratospheric Clouds ) to form in the stratosphere .
The nuclei for these particles are thought to be sulfuric acid aerosol , possibly of volcanic origin .
The ice particles provide the surfaces that allow complex chemical reactions to take place in a manner than can deplete stratospheric ozone .
Water Depth
UV - B exposure decreases rapidly at increasing depths in the water column .
In other words , water and the impurities in it strongly absorb and scatter incoming UV - B radiation .
Some substances that are dissolved in water , such as organic carbon from nearby land , will also absorb UV - B radiation and enhance protection of microorganisms , plants , and animals from UV - B .
Different masses of water at different locations contain different amounts of such dissolved substances and other particles , making evaluation of UV damage very difficult .
Elevation
Living organisms at high elevations are generally exposed to more solar radiation and with it , more UV - B than organisms at low elevations .
This is because at high elevations UV - B radiation travels through less atmosphere before it reaches the ground , and so it has fewer chances of encountering radiation - absorbing aerosols or chemical substances ( such as ozone and sulfur dioxide ) than it does at lower elevations .
Reflectivity of the Earths Surface
As a highly reflective substance , snow dramatically increases UV - B exposure near the Earths surface as it reflects most of the radiation back into the atmosphere , where it is then scattered back toward the surface by aerosols and air molecules .
Fresh snow can reflect much as 94 percent of the incoming UV radiation .
In contrast , snow - free lands typically reflect only 2 - 4 percent of UV and ocean surfaces reflect about 5 - 8 percent ( Herman and Celarier 1997 ) .

Optimizing a FIR filter routine
Recently I had to implement a low - pass audio filter in software .
A low - pass filter is so named because it passes low frequencies while muting high ones , similar to what you 'd get by turning treble all the way down on a stereo .
Low - pass filters have a number of uses , the particular use in this case being to prevent aliasing in a subsequent resampling pass .
There are many ways to implement a low - pass filter , but the method that I used was a finite impulse response ( FIR ) filter .
FIR filters have a few advantages , such as simplicity of implementation in software and ease of making linear - phase filters .
The cutoff frequency was fairly high , so the FIR filter kernel did n't need that many taps -- a 15 tap symmetric filter was enough .
To retell the tale , let 's start with this routine :
void filter ( float * dst , const float * src , size_t n , const float * kernel ) {
const float k0 = kernel [ 0 ] ;
const float k1 = kernel [ 1 ] ;
const float k2 = kernel [ 2 ] ;
const float k3 = kernel [ 3 ] ;
const float k4 = kernel [ 4 ] ;
const float k5 = kernel [ 5 ] ;
const float k6 = kernel [ 6 ] ;
const float k7 = kernel [ 7 ] ; do {
float v = src [ 7 ]
* k0
+ ( src [ 6 ] + src [ 8 ] ) * k1
+ ( src [ 5 ] + src [ 9 ] ) * k2
+ ( src[ 4 ] + src [ 10 ] ) * k3
+ ( src [ 3 ] + src [ 11 ] ) * k4
+ ( src [ 2 ] + src [ 12 ] ) * k5
+ ( src [ 1 ] + src [ 13 ] ) * k6
+ ( src [ 0 ] + src [ 14 ] ) * k7 ; ++src ; * dst++ = v ;
} while ( --n ) ;
}
So ... how fast does it run ?
Well , compiled using Visual C++ 2010 and run on a Core 2 , the timing is about 125,000 cycles for 4,096 samples , or 30.5 cycles / sample .
Not too surprising , considering that there are 22 elementary operations per sample ( 14 additions , 8 multiplications ) .
This is with cache effects mostly discounted , as I test routines like this by running them 10 times in a loop and taking the minimum time -- cache effects are important , but they 're too often noise when profiling a routine like this and can make it hard to compare routines .
Therefore , all of these timings are ideal timings with regard to memory delays .
Another thing you might notice is the lack of __restrict ; I 'm omitting them for brevity here , although they were used on the timings .
I know why the restrict keyword exists and how it helps optimization , but truth be told , I 've never seen a single case where the Visual C++ compiler took advantage of it , no matter how many times I 've tried it .
Alright , that 's the easy case ....
It 's not terribly useful to benchmark a routine on a fast system , so we 're going to try something harder : my trusty little Atom - based netbook .
Survey says : 442,000 cycles , or 108 cycles / sample .
Ugh .
Well , we know that an Atom is n't as fast as a Core 2 , so this is n't surprising .
However , we can do better than this .
First stop is to look at the disassembly :
fld dword ptr [ eax +
8 ]
add eax ,

fadd dword ptr [ eax - 4 ]
add ecx ,
4
dec edx
fmul st , st ( 4 )

faddp st ( 1 ) ,

fadd dword ptr [ eax - 8 ]
fmul st , st ( 4 )
faddp st ( 1 ) ,
st

fadd dword ptr [ eax - 0Ch ]
fmul st, st ( 3 )

fld dword ptr [ esp +2Ch ]
fstp dword ptr [ ecx - 4 ]
jne 0000005F
Not too bad , but there are some obvious issues here .
In my experience , Visual C++ tends not to interleave calculations and instead prioritizes clustering related operations together .
This is not a bad idea for a CPU like the Core 2 , which has both out - of - order execution and an anemic lack of general purpose registers .
However , it 's not great for the in - order Atom because it means that the whole routine is full of stalls , since nothing can run in parallel .
We need to do something about this .
The most obvious thing to do would be to try to reorder the instructions to gain some parallelism .
I wo n't spend time here doing so , but suffice it to say that I tried this and it executed even more poorly than the straightforward code above .
A bit of checking with Agner Fog 's optimization tome reveals that the Atom has two big problems in this area , one being pathological scheduling with back - to - back x87 instructions and another being a non -free cost for the FXCH instruction .
The Core 2 , of course , does n't mind and actually likes the rescheduled instruction stream better .
We know that it 's possible to do better on both CPUs , though , so it 's not worth wasting any more time with x87 .
Time for SSE
You might wonder why I did n't try throwing / arch : SSE on the compiler .
Well , I did , but the x86 version of Visual C++ is generally reluctant to use SSE scalar math instructions even when you tell it to , and refused to recompile the inner loop as such .
Part of the reason is that it 's constrained by the ABI , which requires returning parameters in st ( 0 ) , and I suspect it 's also partly due to some older CPUs that executed x87 better than scalar SSE .
Therefore , we 'll have to go to assembly for this one .
The good news is that in SSE we do n't have to deal with a stupid register stack :
movss xmm0 , [ ecx + 7 * 4 ] movss xmm1 , [ecx + 6*4 ]
mulss xmm0 , [ edx+0 * 4 ] movss xmm2 , [ecx + 5*4 ]
addss xmm1 , [ ecx + 8 * 4 ] movss xmm3 , [ecx + 4*4 ]
addss xmm2 , [ecx +9*4 ]
mulss xmm1 , [ edx + 1 * 4 ] movss xmm4 , [ecx + 3*4 ]
addss xmm3 , [ ecx +10*4 ]
mulss xmm2 , [ edx +2*4 ]
addss xmm0 , xmm1 movss xmm5 , [ ecx + 2*4 ]
addss xmm4 , [ ecx +11*4 ]
mulss xmm3 , [ edx +3* 4 ]
addss xmm0 , xmm2 movss xmm6 , [ ecx + 1*4 ]
addss xmm5 , [ ecx + 12*4 ]
mulss xmm4 , [ edx +4*4 ]
addss xmm0 , xmm3 movss xmm7 , [ ecx+0 * 4 ]
addss xmm6 , [ ecx +13*4 ]
mulss xmm5 , [ edx +5*4 ]
addss xmm0 , xmm4 mulss xmm6 , [ edx +6*4 ]
addss xmm0 , xmm5 addss xmm7 , [ ecx + 14*4 ]
addss xmm0 , xmm6 mulss xmm7 , [ edx+7*4 ]
add ecx , 4 addss xmm0 , xmm7 movss [ ebx ] , xmm0
add ebx , 4 dec eax
jne xloop
Core 2 likes this about the same as the interleaved x87 asm routine at about 88,000 cycles ( 21.5 cycles / sample ) .
Atom appreciates it a lot more , however , and grinds through it twice as fast at 200,000 cycles ( 49 cycles / sample ) .
Not bad .
So we 've established that scalar SSE floating - point runs much , much better on Atom than x87 .
I guess the hardware designers are sick of the register stack , too .
We 're still doing everything in scalar math , however , so next stop is vectorization .
Vectorizing a FIR routine
If you take a look at the original routine again you 'll notice that I took advantage of the symmetric filter kernel and added symmetric taps together before scaling by the common weighting factors .
Well , this does n't work as well for a vectorized routine , because the symmetry is around a single tap , and when dealing with vectors that means some annoying shuffling to get everything in place .
In this case , it seems more trouble than it 's worth , so we 'll ditch it and just evaluate the filter kernel without the symmetry optimization .
This means double the multiplications , but those are about the same cost as the shuffles would be anyway as long as we keep the pipelines fed .
That leaves the question of how to evaluate the filter .
Ordinarily I construct FIR loops to read from a sliding window , weighting input samples to produce a single output sample .
However , for vectorized routines I 've warmed up to the alternate strategy of inverting the filter and accumulating output samples into a sliding window instead .
There are two reasons to do this : ( 1 ) read / modify / write is no more costly if you can keep the destination in a register , and more importantly ( 2 ) it avoids the need for expensive horizontal adds .
First stab , using intrinsics :
__m128 zero = _mm_setzero_ps ( ) ;

} while ( --n ) ;
This is a bit more obscure than the original routine , so a bit of explanation : x0 - x3 form a 16 output sample pipeline where we shift in zeros at the high end ( x3.w ) and shift out samples at the low end ( x0.x ) .
At the same time , we bring in input samples one at a time and accumulate its contribution to each of the 16 output samples according to the input sample 's relative location to the output sample .
This is done simply by splatting out the input sample 16 times and scaling that vector by the reversed kernel ( which is the same , since it 's symmetric ) .
Each turn of the crank merges one input sample , shifts the window over one , and writes out one output sample .
There is one other minor gotcha , which is that we have to prime the pipe with 14 input samples first -- but that 's just the normal loop with the output sample discarded .
Core 2 clocks in at 66,000 cycles ( 16.1 cycles / sample ) , Atom at 141,000 cycles ( 34.4 cycles / sample ) .
That looks a bit better .
We 're now at about 2 - 2.5 x over the original scalar code .
Problem in the machine code
If we dump the disassembly generated by VC10 , there 's a problem :
movss xmm6,xmm1
movss xmm3,xmm6
movss xmm6,xmm2
movss xmm1,xmm6
movss xmm6 , xmm0
movss xmm2,xmm6

What the heck is going on with the movss instructions at the top of the loop ?
Not too bash the VC ++ team too much , but unnecessary register - to - register moves have been an issue with intrinsics in VC ++ all the way back to the VC6 Processor Pack , and it's astonishing that even with the renewed focus on intrinsics code generation in VC10 the problem still has n't been solved ( bug 556347 ) .
Sigh .
Back to assembly it is :

Pipeline is in XMM0 - XMM3 , source pointer is ECX , dest pointer is EDX .
I 've omitted setup code here , but do n't worry , I 'll provide it later .
Results : Core 2 takes 40,000 cycles ( 9.8 cycles / sample ) , Atom takes 89,000 cycles ( 21.8 cycles / sample ) .
That 's about a third faster than the compiler .
Scheduling for Atom
Can we get this lower ?
Definitely , at least for the Atom .
Specifically , there are some stalls in the above code that are causing problems :
MULPS can only be issued in pipe 0 every two cycles , and has a five cycle latency .
ADDPS can only be issued in pipe 1 , and has a five cycle latency .
Therefore , we 've got to reorder the instructions to clear the stalls .
Brace yourself , this is going to be messy :
movss xmm7 , [ ecx ]
movss xmm0 , xmm1 shufps xmm7 , xmm7 , 0 mulps xmm4 , xmm7
movss xmm1 , xmm2 shufps xmm0 , xmm0 , 00111001 b

jne xloop
I 've added a single SSE2 instruction , PSRLDQ , to avoid an issue with register pressure ( could n't spare a register for zero ) .
It 's worth noting that while the Atom is capable of running two instructions per cycle at peak , there are unused instruction slots in the loop above .
The reason is that the loop is bottlenecked on instructions that can only execute in the first pipe , so there 's no possible way to drop a clock by reordering instructions alone .
This is because pipe 0 handles too many types of instructions we need here : load / store , shift , and vector multiply .
It would be easier if load / store instructions executed in pipe 1 , but the problem is that would likely make MULPS xmm , m128 instructions unpairable , which would have made it a wash here .
Incidentally , Agner 's tome says there is a 4 - 5 clock latency to read memory for vector instructions on the Atom , but I was n't seeing that at all on loads .
Good thing , too , because it would have made the code run much slower .
This runs at about the same speed on Core 2 , but on Atom , it runs another third faster : 62,000 cycles , or 15 cycles / sample .
By my estimates the code should actually run at 14 cycles / sample , but I have been unable to eliminate the last cycle for some reason -- it could be that branches on Atom are two cycles , in which case 15 cycles would be optimal for this instruction mix .
This is about the fastest I 've been able to get the routine so far , for an improvement of 3 x over the scalar code on Core 2 and 7 x on Atom .
Left as exercises for the reader
If you want to play with the code : http://www.virtualdub.org/downloads/fir.zip.
It 's not polished , it does n't check CPU flags , and it does n't even have a project file .
I trust you can deal with this , of course .
It works on VS2005 and VS2010 .
The routine would likely run faster if written in x64 , as with the extra registers some of the load / stores could be eliminated and the loop unrolled .
To bad I 'm still stuck in x86 land . :P
I tried an SSSE3 version to take advantage of PALIGNR instead of MOVSS + SHUFPS , but it was n't as advantageous as I had hoped -- 10 % faster on Core 2 , but 7 % slower on Atom .
One reason is that PALIGNR is a shift instruction , so on Atom it still requires pipe 0 , while MOVSS is a cheap instruction that can fit in a pipe 1 hole .
Another reason is that PALIGNR , like SHUFPS , has the source and destination registers swapped from the way you would expect .
In this case , it forces the pipeline to be run in the opposite direction with left shifts , which then requires extra instructions to pull the output sample from the top of a register .
I tried EXTRACTPS to do this , until I found out the hard way -- via a crash -- that it's an SSE4.1 instruction .
Oops .
Best I can tell , the only way to get a major speedup from this code on x86 would be to ditch floating - point and go back to good old fashioned 16 - bit fixed point .
Fixed - point code is still viable in many cases because integer instructions can often execute in more pipes and with lower latencies .
Going to fixed point would mean switching the algorithm back to the original style of a sliding source window , as the multiplies widen values from 16 - bit to 32 - bit , and we 'd need to take advantage of PMADDWD in order to get a speedup over the FP code .
The downside is that we'd be back to doing a horizontal add at the end , and that would be tricky to optimize and interleave .
Final note :
The level of optimization achieved here is a bit of overkill in that the original application runs this on a real - time , stereo 64 KHz audio stream .
If you crunch the numbers , that 's 0.8 % of a 1.6GHz
Atom even with the original scalar code , and at a 10 % CPU target for battery life and heat reasons , that 's still only 8 % of total CPU usage .
Truth be told , I got a little carried away again optimizing this thing , but I figure that I might as well take the 3 - 7 x improvement now that I have it .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Turkey said on Sunday Iran had agreed on a nuclear fuel swap deal which could help end Tehran ’s stand - off with the West over its atomic programme .
Full details of the agreement were not immediately released by Turkish and Brazilian officials mediating in Iran ’s dispute with leading world powers , who suspect Tehran of covertly developing a nuclear bomb .
Turkey ’s foreign ministry said a formal announcement might be made on Monday after any final revisions by the Brazilian and Iranian presidents and the Turkish prime minister .
“ Yes , it has been reached after almost 18 hours of negotiations , ” Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters in Tehran when asked if there would be an agreement .
Earlier , Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan flew to Tehran to join Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who has been negotiating with Iranian officials in what Western and Russian authorities have said is probably the last chance to avoid new U.N. sanctions against Iran .
A U.N. - backed deal offered Iran last October to ship 1,200 kg ( 2,646 lb ) of its low enriched uranium -- enough for a single bomb if purified to a high enough level -- to Russia and France to make into fuel for a Tehran research reactor .
Iran later said it would only swap its LEU for higher grade material and only on its own soil , conditions other parties in the deal said were unacceptable .
It denies seeking to build an atomic bomb .

“ I am going to Iran because a clause will be added to the proposal which says the swap will take place in Turkey , ” Erdogan had said earlier .
“ We will have the opportunity to start the process regarding the swap , ” he said .
“ I guarantee that we will find the opportunity to overcome these problems , god willing . ”
Lula also told reporters after holding talks with Iranians that “ the level of hope ( to reach an agreement ) has increased . ”
SANCTIONS LOOM
Lula has met President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Iran ’s most powerful authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who has the last say on all state matters like Iran ’s nuclear activities .
“ America is angry over the proximity of independent countries like Iran and Brazil ... That is why they made a fuss ahead of your ( Lula ) trip to Iran , ” state television quoted Khamenei as saying .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Friday that Lula ’s mediation effort would fail .
Iran has denied Western accusations it is developing nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian nuclear programme .
Turkey and Brazil , both non-permanent members of the U.N. Security Council , have offered to mediate to find a resolution to the impasse at a time when world powers are in talks to impose a fourth round of U.N. sanctions on Iran .
Iran had said it viewed the mediation positively .
The Islamic state started higher enrichment in February to create fuel for the research reactor itself , after the failure of talks with major powers over the nuclear swap .
The step brings Iran ’s enrichment closer to levels needed for making weapons - grade material -- uranium refined to 90 percent purity .
Non-traditional communications devices such as smartphones and game consoles pose a particular problem to law enforcement agencies trying to milk them for forensic data that reveals criminal activity , attendees were told at the 2010 Computer Forensics Show in New York City .
FBI details most difficult Internet scams
" Forensic tools for cell phones are in their infancy , " says Stephen Riley , a forensic examiner with the FBI 's Computer Analysis and Response Team .
" There 's lots of different carriers , different phones , different cables - just try to keep up .
" Smartphones can communicate via SMS , MMS , mobile e-mail , mobile internet access , VoIP and traditional cellular voice networks , Riley says , making each machine a potential treasure trove of information but also a nightmare maze of possible proprietary technologies to unlock it .
Retrieving SMS messages can depend on the model of phone , the carrier , the time of day , even the country in which the phone is used .
SIM cards removed from phones carry potentially useful forensic information , but unless it is associated with a particular phone 's PIN , it 's inaccessible .
Perhaps the personal unlock feature controlled by phone manufacturers could release the data , but that requires knowing the make and model of the phone , he says .
The ready availability of cell phones is also a problem .
Searches of suspects ' residences can turn up drawers - full of cell phones that are no longer used but never thrown out .
Yet they can demand valuable forensic time .
Game consoles pose a separate problem .
They can be used to send e-mail and connect to the Internet but have very little internal memory so whatever is on the drive can be quickly over written and therefore gone forever , he says .
" You can take a Wii onto the Internet and it does n't save sites or browser history , " he says .
" If you type in a Web address and surf , 10 minutes later there 's no record of it . "
That means users can send Web - based e-mail and leave no trace .
" This is a problem , " Riley says .
Meanwhile , the FBI continues to seek help from the private sector to protect critical infrastructure , hoping that IT professionals can act as eyes and ears to detect the activities of terrorists before they can carry out their plans .
Infragard , the FBI - business / academia alliance to protect U.S. infrastructure from terrorists , sought this help at the 2010 Computer Forensics
Show where professionals and students who are likely to have an interest in law enforcement came for seminars gathering evidence for legal cases .
" It 's all about critical infrastructure , " says Joe Concannon , president and CEO of New York Metro Infragard , one of 56 chapters around the U.S. that have a total membership of about 36,000 .
The value to the FBI is that it gets information from individuals that may point to criminal activity that might otherwise go undetected or go undetected until it 's too late , he says .
The FBI does n't report back about what comes of the information the individuals share , says FBI Special Agent Jim Capozzi , who is assigned full - time to promote the program to business groups , building owners ' associations , cultural centers and universities , among others .
But those who participate in Infragard get the satisfaction of knowing they help .
He says the New York City FBI bureau has 1,100 staffers enforcing 400 different violations , plus seeking terrorists .
" How can we protect it unless we have people going along with us ? " he says .
" If you see something we should know we can be proactive . "
Concannon says the New York area Infragard chapter offers educational seminars online during weekly podcasts .

I am Gavin Greene , and I am here to ask you a question :
Is a game sequel not entitled to the innovation of its concept ?
“ No ! ” says the designer at Activision , It belongs to Harmonix .
“ No ! ” says the publisher at EA , It belongs to the Marketing department .
“ No ! ” says the developer at Sonic Team , It belongs to No One .
2K Marin rejected those answers .
Instead , they chose …. wait … they did the same thing as the last game ?
… never mind .
Yes , it is time once again to dive into the bleak depths and return to the Libertarian ’s wet dream that is Rapture .
Bioshock 2 comes two years after the original became a surprise critical and financial hit , taking place ten years after the fall of Andrew Ryan ’s objectivist version of the underwater city .
With a new domineering philosopher exercising their control over the genetically enhanced citizens , and a new suite of plasmid - powered multiplayer modes , Bioshock 2 tries hard to enhance the art deco pedigree that made its prequel one of the most memorable games of this generation .
Does it succeed , or has this franchise taken on too much water ?
Forgoing a grandiose opening for a more immediate one , Bioshock 2 shoves you into the diving boots of Delta , the original prototype Big Daddy who has returned to the submarine dystopia after over a decade of absence .
The reins of Rapture have been taken up by Sofia Lamb , and although her altruistic philosophy could n’t be more different from Ryan ’s , the leaky city still suffers from an insane populace and an anarchic rule of law .
Delta ’s main mission is the retrieval of what was once his little sister who , like many of the original demented child - creatures , have grown into the new arch - villains known as the Big Sisters , who sport the power of the Big Daddies in a sleeker , plasmid - capable package .
The twisted tale pans out much the same way as in the first game : the majority of the political ins and outs revealed through optional audio diaries scattered across the world .
Exposition also comes in the form of conversations with Rapture ’s less insane inhabitants like Tenenbaum , as well as some scripted flashback sequences triggered by in - game scripted encounters .
While the script remains polished to maintain interest in addition to staying true to the world ’s retro-tech future , the voice acting has taken a noticeable dip in quality since 2007 , with some over - enthused accents and bland deliveries popping up consistently through gameplay .
Depending on your knowledge of altruism and philosophy in general , Sofia Lamb will noticeably lack the consistency of vision that Ryan so venomously oozed , some of her actions almost contradicting her proposed vision for the city .
The story as a whole is bookended with steady pacing , the middle 3 hours suffering from some tedious execution , and it all builds to a tumultuous , if slightly nonsensical endgame .
But you do n’t become a Big Daddy to sit around story circle , and Bioshock 2 manages to fully surpass its predecessor in nearly every aspect of gameplay .
Delta is equipped with the expected drill and rivet gun common to the iconic monster class , but can also obtain a variety of guns capable of both firing and whacking splicers into delicious gooey bits .
The ability to utilize both plasmids and weaponry simultaneously is an obvious but nonetheless well - implemented advancement in the combat , and the additional gene tonics allow for even more ways to elementally disturb the flow of your enemy ’s day .
But this new ease of combat is balanced with sharper enemy AI and a few new classes of splicers to challenge your survival skills , leaving the game with just as much frustrating - then - gratifying grit as before .
The ability to remotely hack switches and turrets is probably the most satisfying change most gamers will gravitate towards .
The mini - game required to confiscate mechanical allegiance is streamlined ( plus ) and in - game ( negative ) , keeping the flow of battle constant , if not slightly annoying .
The biggest aggravation , the ear - blistering tunes screeched by ammunition and item machines , have been mercifully destroyed .
A few key gameplay complaints arise after only an hour of play , however , and unfortunately , they inhabit the core of the new game mechanics .
The threat of sporadic Big Sister encounters was an outright falsity , their appearances in tune with the flow of the action to the point of blind predictability .
It ’s not a major issue , as a trading - blows session with a Big Sis is still one of the game ’s highlights , but those expecting a constant mega - threat will be able to breathe a disappointing sigh of relief .
But the major blemish on Bioshock 2 is the Little - Sister - Corpse - Defense game .
At many , many , many times during gameplay , you will be required to defend your little sister dujour as she ever so slowly syringes the genetic currency known as Adam from various corpses , causing a flood of splicers to flock to your location and attempt to disrupt the process .
While some smart usage of trap rivets and hacked turrets can expedite the task , the game forces you far too often into this routine , and it gets old after only the first few times .
But when one says Bioshock , one means art design .
The 50s - throwback décor and creepy graffiti allusions gave the series a pedigree for utmost atmosphere and tension .
It ’s a shame then , that Bioshock 2 ’s art design feels much less fluid – even while containing much more fluid – and dynamic .
Structures and layouts will strike as far too similar to ones you encountered hours before , and all of the subtle nuances to lighting and art direction have been shoved to the front window in efforts to appear as cool in trailers as possible .
There is a decided lack of mystique this time around , the experience feeling more of an underwhelming emulation of Rapture than the actual city .
Even taking into account the lack of antagonist gravitas , there is something sorely missing on this voyage .
Except for the startlingly tranquil romps in the Adam - enhanced foliage outside the city , which provide well structured , if inactive , breaks in conflict .
It ’s odd then , that the art design of the multiplayer feels much more inclined with the Bioshock motif .
Sporting the more varied locales of previously explored locales like Fort Frolic , the multiplayer suite sets you in a prequel to both Delta and Jack ’s adventures , as a not - quite - yet insane splicer under contract with Sinclair Solutions in a battle royale testing camp for its various new tonics and plasmids .
Sporting a surprisingly realized storyline , progression through the game ’s 5 modes ( all Rapture - fied takes on classic tropes like ‘ Capture the Flag ’ and ‘ Free for All ’ ) will bequeath the full story of the city ’s civil war , and is a decent motivator for keeping with the suite long after the gameplay has gone routine .
Plasmid use and a single Big Daddy suit upgrade allow for a few modes to go beyond the average expectations , but nothing will keep the disc spinning after the first dozen matches have been scored .
Each day , I like to see what is going on in the automotive world , so I like to check out a few different auto blogs .

For those of you unfamiliar , it is a combination of different writing styles and automotive related topics that are truly entertaining , for my strange sense of humor at least .
The way that they write is just the way I like it , a perfect symphony of facts , pictures , and sarcasm .
Now , I realize that this glorious Nutt ’s and Bolt ’s Automotive Blog is n’t at Jalop traffic levels yet , but I do often wonder if any of the writers over there check us out .
I am one of their biggest fans , so I would be honored if they stopped by here every once in a while .

BYU star running back Harvey Unga has voluntarily withdrawn from school because of an undisclosed honor code violation .
Women ’s basketball player Keilani Moeaki , reportedly Unga ’s girlfriend of three years , also has withdrawn from school .
Unga is the school ’s all - time leading rusher with 3,455 yards .
He led the Mountain West Conference in rushing last year in his third consecutive 1,000 - yard rushing season .
Unga actually flirted with leaving school for the NFL , but decided to return to help his team and his draft stock .
“ I fully support Harvey and his decision regarding his personal situation , ” BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall said in a statement .
“ The possibility of not having Harvey on the field in the fall would certainly have an impact on our team , but my main concern right now is in supporting Harvey . ”
Now , I ’m not going to speculate on what happened here , but BYU ’s honor code is very specific and very strict .
According to the school ’s Honor Code Office , each student must obey these policies :
Be honest Live a chaste and virtuous life Obey the law and all campus policies Use clean language Respect others Abstain from alcoholic beverages , tobacco , tea , coffee , and substance abuse Participate regularly in church services Observe the Dress and Grooming Standards ( including no beards without a waiver )
Encourage others in their commitment to comply with the Honor Code
The fact that Unga and Moeaki decided to withdraw together will create more than a few whispers , but the important thing to remember is that Unga voluntarily withdrew and that he could come back .
Mendenhall seemed very supportive , and while there will likely be punishment levied by the school , maybe Unga ’s decision to withdraw will gain some leniency should he decide to return .
As for the BYU backfield , there are several competent players to take Unga ’s place , but it ’s probably going to take a committee .
Few ( if any ) runners in the Mountain West possess the speed , hard - hitting ability and versatility that Unga does .
He was not only a threat as a runner , but also a passer .
And he did have a legitimate shot at going to the NFL .
It ’s a shame that something like this might derail that opportunity .
ERICE , Italy —
If you think of Earth 's poles as fraternal twins , the Arctic has been the wild one in recent years , while the Antarctic has been a steady plodder .
Withered by summer heat , Arctic sea ice has shrunk to record low coverage several times since 2005 , only to rebound to within 95 percent of its long - term average extent this winter .
By comparison , Antarctica , with some 90 percent of the world 's glacial reserves , has generally shed ice in more stately fashion .
However , emerging evidence from an Antarctic geological research drilling program known as ANDRILL suggests that the southernmost continent has had a much more dynamic history than previously suspected — one that could signal an abrupt shrinkage of its ice sheets at some unknown greenhouse gas threshold , possibly starting in this century .
Especially troubling , scientists see evidence in the geological data that could mean the vast East Antarctic Ice Sheet , which holds at least four - fifths of the continent 's ice , is less resistant to melting than previously thought .
ANDRILL , a collaboration among scientists from Germany , Italy , New Zealand and the U.S. , obtained the evidence from a 3,734 - foot - long core extracted in 2007 from the seafloor on the southern McMurdo Sound , near Antarctica 's Ross Island .
A prior core , extracted from the McMurdo Ice Shelf between October 2006 and January 2007 , indicated that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has frequently advanced and retreated .
As ANDRILL scientists met here April 6 - 11 to integrate core results , the geologists and climate modelers pondered the hints of dynamism observed in the much larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet .
Contrary to what climate simulations suggest , David Harwood , the program 's co-chief scientist , says , " nature seems to give us a record that the ice sheets are coming and going . "
The southern McMurdo Sound core yielded clear evidence of some 74 cycles of ice sheet buildup and retreat during a 6 - million - year stretch starting in the Miocene Epoch some 20 million years ago .
The unexpected ice - sheet dynamism has ANDRILL climate modelers considering what input or software adjustments would make the simulation produce the kind of dynamism seen in the geological record .
Their model currently indicates that even if the imperiled West Antarctic Ice Sheet succumbs to current warming trends , the much larger East sheet should stubbornly resist melting .
According to the simulation , the East ice sheet melts only when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are at least eight times higher than preindustrial levels .
The ice sheet ’s so - called hysteresis , or resistance to change , is now in doubt .
Modeler and geologist Robert DeConto of the University of Massachusetts , Amherst , says the policy implications are grim .
" Our models may be dramatically underestimating how much worse it 's going to get , " he says , noting that many population centers worldwide are within a few meters of sea level .
Looking at signs of meltwater in the early Miocene , DeConto says , " we 're seeing ice retreat faster and more dramatically than any model predicts . "
Antarctica's ice sheets contain roughly two - thirds of the world 's fresh water .
A meltdown of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet alone would boost sea levels by an estimated 20 feet , but if the East sheet were to also succumb , along with the Greenland ice sheet , sea levels could rise by more than 200 feet .
This would be catastrophic for major population centers near sea level , such as New York City , much of Florida and nearly all of Bangladesh .
No one expects the ice sheets to disappear overnight — even the worst timelines span centuries — and uncertainty about their fate remains , but radar altimetry from NASA satellites indicates that melting is under way in some parts of the East sheet , as well as in much of the West sheet .
Researchers say the effects of melting ice sheets could be apparent within a lifetime as undersea currents are disrupted and weather patterns shift .
DeConto's collaborator , climate modeler David Pollard of Pennsylvania State University , says the answer to the puzzling disparity between model predictions and the core data could lie in an erroneous assumption about Antarctica itself .
For example , Pollard says , some parts of the land underlying the East ice sheet might be much lower than currently believed .
In that case , if warming oceans strip away the surrounding ice shelves , significant chunks of the ice sheet could slide into the ocean .
Subglacial lakes , which form as glaciers slide over depressions , may have an underappreciated role , he added .
DeConto says polar stratospheric clouds also need further study .
There are indications , he says , that they act as infrared reflectors , which might contribute to ice sheet melting in ways not yet accounted for in models .
Whatever the cause , the key evidence for ice sheet dynamism in the Antarctic comes from the core 's lithographic record .
Sedimentologists have studied its facies , the visible characteristics that distinguish each stratum , for indications of how warm or cold the surrounding environment was .
The McMurdo Sound facies repeatedly vary from " ice proximal , " where fractures , scraping and larger grain size indicate a glacier rumbling by , to " ice distal , " where laminated sediments and marine fossils speak of lapping waves in an ice - free marine environment .
Numerous other lines of evidence from the core support the idea of wide climate swings in Antarctica 's past .
There are spikes in the amount of pollen found within the core , for example , indicating flowering plants nearby .
Levels of various organic molecules repeatedly rise and fall in the column , showing that microorganisms and shellfish flourished in the warmer periods and receded during cold times .
The presence or absence of clasts — chunks of sedimentary rock carried along and deposited by glaciers — also indicates a fluctuating Antarctic climate .
Co-chief scientist Fabio Florindo of Italy 's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology notes that surges of magnetic mineral in the core may also mark warming trends .
Reviewing the record , sedimentologist Christopher Fielding of the University of Nebraska - Lincoln says that in its warmest periods Antarctica must have resembled Patagonia today , where winters average a few degrees below freezing and summertime highs occasionally reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit .
However , Fielding , DeConto and others agree the core data is not conclusive .
The McMurdo Sound core offers a pinhole view of East and West Antarctic Ice Sheet behavior , but at the price of extreme difficulty of interpretation .
Scientists expect that firmer answers will emerge from other Antarctic research , including a hoped - for third ANDRILL project planned for Coulman High , also in the vicinity of Ross Island .
Harwood , a University of Nebraska geoscientist , says there is already evidence enough for policymakers to take action against global warming in hopes of preventing a dramatic Antarctic meltdown .
" This core is going to be studied for the next 20 to 30 years , " he notes , but already , he adds , the Miocene - age evidence it contains strongly suggests that it would be a mistake to count on ice - sheet stability in the Antarctic .
" We see two or three periods of ice - sheet collapse , including one that looks abrupt , with very rapid deglaciation . "
Happy Friday !

No one smells more like an ashtray than Ian Kettle .
So few people working Michigan ’s music scene welcome the state ’s upcoming smoking ban more than the 36 - year - old sound technician for Grand Rapids ’ Intersection nightclub .
Oh , plenty of others out there - rock cover bands , singer - songwriters playing open - mic nights , all those bartenders and servers - nightly endure the all - permeating haze of cigarette smoke .
But as the principal sound guy at downtown ’s principal live - music hot spot , I ’m betting Kettle absorbs more of these acrid - smelling , chemical - laced fumes than anyone else listening to rock , hip - hop , country and electronica at full - throttle volumes .
That makes the smoking ban in bars and restaurants - which takes effect Saturday - worth celebrating , he says .
“ I ca n’t wait .
It ’s going to be so great ... from just a body point of view and my eyes and my sinuses , ” says Kettle , who ’s handled sound duties at the nightclub for eight years .
“ Smelling like that , you ’ve got to change your clothes before you can touch your kid .
It ’s just horrible . ”
Kettle , who used to smoke , jokes that he “ quit four or five years ago and it was real easy : I was getting so much nicotine on a regular basis anyway four or five nights a week .
It was even cheaper than buying cigarettes . ”
Veteran Grand Rapids drummer Randy Marsh , who plays in several bands , including Organissimo and Claudia Schmidt ’s Funtet , also is “ jumping for joy ” about the ban .
“ I have absolutely no tolerance anymore for cigarette smoke , ” he fumes .
“ After May 1 , I ’ll be able to go to places like Billy ’s ( Lounge ) again .
I think it is going to be a boon to the live music - with - alcohol venues .
I know a lot of people who quit going to bars to hear music because they just could n’t take the smoke . ”
As a nightclub - going live music follower myself , I ’m with Marsh on this one : I long to kick the habit of stripping down in the laundry room after gigs and taking a quick shower to escape the smokehouse stench .
Granted , this ban is n’t embraced by all bar owners , musicians and smoke - ’em - if - you ’ve - got - ’em types , which seems obvious considering it took years for the bill to finally make its way through Michigan ’s politically charged Legislature .
Some bands and bars count large numbers of smokers among their regular clientele .
Others just believe it ’s another infringement on personal liberties .
“ I ’m torn because I believe people should be able to do whatever they want whenever they want unless it affects the well - being of others , ” reasons Grand Rapids singer - songwriter Nathan Kalish .
“ Smoking is very unhealthy and should n’t be forced on people .
However , the government should n’t have the right to tell some establishments they can or ca n’t allow this or any activity . ”
One of those establishments , Jukes Bar , 506 Leonard St. NW , attracts a young , cigarette - smoking crowd for weekend rock shows .
While he opposes the ban , owner Dave Eder speculates he can now book more groups into the club as “ some bands wo n’t play Jukes now because it is so smoky . ”
And while the new law may upset smokers for a few weeks , he ’s guessing they ’ll return to the club scene after getting bored at home .
Billy ’s manager Lyndi Charles concedes the ban may annoy some regulars and force the bar to stamp the hands of those who go outside to puff so they can re-enter without paying another cover charge .
But she believes it could boost attendance for blues shows , because many older fans do n’t smoke .
“ Honestly , I think it will help us , ” she says .
“ I think there ’s a lot of the blues crowd that does n’t come here because of the smoking . ”
Kettle also argues most out - of - state musicians who roll in for shows at The Intersection already have adjusted to no-smoking rules .
They usually express surprise they can light up inside the Grand Rapids club , because most music venues - from New York to California - banned cigarette smoking years ago .
The ban ’s benefits extend beyond health :
The tar in cigarette smoke is murder on laptop computers , amplifiers and other gear used to crank out music and control lights .
“ Everything is coated in tar and trying to keep it clean and keep it from overheating is a nightmare , ” says Kettle , noting he ’s burned up several laptops because the computers ’ fans suck in the cigarette smoke and its gumming tar .
“ On May 1 , everything ’s getting torn apart and cleaned - all the amps and consoles . ”
Even cleaning up tables should get easier , he surmises .
“ The tar is just like any other oil .
It does n’t react well with water , ” he says .
While no one ’s really sure whether the live music trade will suffer due to the smoking ban , or how the rules might get enforced , Kettle insists it may give The Intersection more entertainment options .
“ I think we could do more upscale shows , high - end blues and that sort of thing , ” Kettle says .
“ Those audiences certainly do n’t want to be around that smoke . ”
Nor do I .
And there could be an even more significant benefit to all this :
It might persuade some folks to stop smoking altogether .
“ I ’m ready to quit along with everybody else , ” says Charles , over at Billy ’s .
“ I hope this makes everybody quit . ”
THEY SAID IT
Michigan ’s smoking ban in restaurants , bars and nightclubs takes effect at midnight Friday
What some musicians are saying :
• “ ( We ’ve ) played a lot of bar gigs .
When you wake up the next morning , your clothes smell like smoke , your car smells like smoke from the equipment that was in the bar all night , and you just feel gross .
...
Smoke hurts my ability to sing at the top of my game and I am happy for the ban .
I do n’t think it will hurt attendance but rather help it . ” - Zachary Guy , bassist for Simien the Whale
• “ I am sure most bars will start seeing a smoking area in the back of their parking lots , just like when we were in high school .
I also feel certain clubs are going to let it ride until they rack up a few fines .
Personally , I think the law is stupid and should not apply to any deck / patio or private or adult - based establishment . ” - Dennie Middleton , piano player for Bimini Brothers and other bands
• “ Overall , it ’s a good thing for health and bad for the people of America who once again are being told they do n’t have the wisdom to make their own choices .
( But ) music will go on being played wherever it was before . ” - Nathan Kalish , singer - songwriter
How some music clubs plan to accommodate smokers :
• The Intersection , 133 Grandville Ave. SW , will rope off an outdoor smoking area in its parking lot to the north which smokers can access through a side door .
• Billy ’s Lounge , 1437 Wealthy St. SE , has set up receptacles for cigarette butts outside its front door for smokers who will “ just have to be on the sidewalk ” because there ’s no room “ to do anything else . ”
• Jukes Bar , 506 Leonard St. NW , also will urge smokers to puff outside the bar ’s front door , likely providing “ buckets with sand in it ” for butts .

From Research To Games : Interacting With 3D Space
By Joseph LaViola Jr .
[ While 3D interfaces are just taking off for consumers , years of research have been poured into the field .
Dr. Joe LaViola of the University of Central Florida shares detailed academic findings about building useful and fun ways to interact with games . ]
Over the last few years , we have seen motion controller technology take the video game industry by force .
The Sony EyeToy and the Nintendo Wii have shown that game interfaces can go beyond the traditional keyboard and mouse or game controller to create more realistic , immersive , and natural gameplay mechanics .
In fact , in the next few months , with the Sony Move , Microsoft 's Natal , and Sixense 's TrueMotion , every major console and the PC will have input peripherals that support 3D spatial interaction .
This paradigm shift in interaction technology holds great potential for game developers to create game interfaces and strategies never thought possible before .
These interfaces bring players closer to the action and afford more immersive user experiences .
Although these devices and this style of interaction seem new , they have actually existed in the academic community for some time .
In fact , the fields of virtual reality and 3D user interfaces have been exploring these interaction styles for the last 20 years .
As an academic working in this field since the late '90s , I have seen a significant amount of research done in developing new and innovative 3D spatial interface techniques that are now starting to be applicable to an application domain that can reach millions of people each year .
As a field , we have been searching for the killer app for years , and I believe we have finally found one with video games .
I believe that the game industry needs to take a good look at what the academic community has been doing in this area .
There is a plethora of knowledge that the virtual reality and 3D user interface communities have developed over the years that are directly applicable to game developers today .
Although it is important for game developers to continue to develop innovative interaction techniques to take advantage of the latest motion sensing input devices , it is also important for developers to not have to reinvent the wheel .
Thus , the purpose of this article is to provide a high - level overview of some of the 3D spatial interaction techniques that have been developed in academia over the last 10 to 15 years .
It is my hope that game developers will use this article as a starting point to the rich body of work the virtual reality and 3D user interface communities have built .
As part of this article , I am also providing a short reading list that has more detailed information about research in 3D spatial interfaces and as well as their use in video games .
3D Spatial Interaction
What is a 3D spatial interaction anyway ?
As starting point , we can say that a 3D user interface ( 3D spatial interaction ) is a UI that involves human computer interaction where the user 's tasks are carried out in a 3D spatial context with 3D input devices or 2D input devices with direct mappings to 3D .
In other words , 3D UIs involve input devices and interaction techniques for effectively controlling highly dynamic 3D computer - generated content , and there 's no exception when it comes to video games .
There are essentially four basic 3D interaction tasks that are found in most complex 3D applications .
Actually , there is a fifth task called symbolic input -- the ability to enter alphanumeric characters in a 3D environment -- but we will not discuss it here .
Obviously , there are other tasks which are specific to an application domain , but these basic building blocks can often be combined to let users perform more complex tasks .
These tasks include navigation , selection , manipulation , and system control .
Navigation is the most common VE task , and is consists of two components .
Travel is the motor component of navigation , and just refers to physical movement from place to place .
Wayfinding is the cognitive or decision - making component of navigation , and it asks the questions , " where am I ? " , " where do I want to go ? " , " how do I get there ? " , and so on .
Selection is simply the specification of an object or a set of objects for some purpose .
Manipulation refers to the specification of object properties ( most often position and orientation , but also other attributes ) .
Selection and manipulation are often used together , but selection may be a stand - alone task .
For example , the user may select an object in order to apply a command such as " delete " to that object .
System control is the task of changing the system state or the mode of interaction .
This is usually done with some type of command to the system ( either explicit or implicit ) .
Examples in 2D systems include menus and command - line interfaces .
It is often the case that a system control technique is composed of the other three tasks ( e.g. a menu command involves selection ) , but it 's also useful to consider it separately since special techniques have been developed for it and it is quite common .
There are two contrasting themes that are common when thinking about 3D spatial interfaces : the real and the magical .
The real theme or style tries to bring real world interaction into the 3D environment .
Thus , the goal is to try to mimic physical world interactions in the virtual world .
Examples include direct manipulation interfaces , such as swinging a golf club or baseball bat or using the hand to pick up virtual objects .
The magical theme or style goes beyond the real world into the realm of fantasy and science fiction .
Magical techniques are only limited by the imagination and examples include spell casting , flying , and moving virtual objects with levitation .
Two technical approaches used in the creation of both real and magical 3D spatial interaction techniques are referred to as isomorphism and non-isomorphism .
Isomorphism refers to a one to one mapping between the motion controller and the corresponding object in the virtual word .
For example , if the motion controller moves 1.5 feet along the x axis , a virtual object moves the same distance in the virtual world .
On the other hand , non-isomorphism refers to ability to scale the input so that the control - to - display ratio is not equal to one .
For example , if the motion controller is rotated 30 degrees about the y axis , the virtual object may rotate 60 degrees about the y axis .
Non-isomorphism is a very powerful approach to 3D spatial interaction because it lends itself to magical interfaces and can potentially give the user more control in the virtual world .
Common 3D Spatial Interaction Techniques
The key to using many of the 3D user interfaces techniques found in the VR and 3D UI literature is having an input device that supports 6 DOF .
In this case , 6 DOF means the device provides both position ( x , y , and z ) and orientation ( roll , pitch , and yaw ) of the controller or user in the physical world .
In some cases , it is also important to be able to track the user 's head position and orientation .
This will be somewhat problematic with current motion controller hardware , but these techniques can certainly be modified when no head tracking is available .
6 DOF is essentially the Holy Grail when it comes to 3D spatial interfaces and , fortunately , this is the way the video game industry is going ( e.g. , Sony Move , Sixense TruMotion , and Microsoft Natal ) .
One can still support 3D spatial interfaces with a device like the Nintendo Wii Remote , but it is slightly more challenging since the device provides some of these DOF under certain conditions .
As part of the reading list at the end of the article , I provide some papers that discuss how to deal with the issues surrounding the Nintendo Wii remote and 3D spatial interaction .
Navigation : Travel
The motor component of navigation is known as travel ( e.g. , viewpoint movement ) .
There are several issues to consider when dealing with travel in 3D UIs .
One such issue is the control of velocity and / or acceleration .
There are many methods for doing this , including gesture , speech controls , sliders , etc .
Next , one must consider whether motion should be constrained in any way , for example by maintaining a constant height or by following the terrain .
Finally , at the lowest - level , the conditions of input must be considered -- that is , when and how does motion begin and end ( click to start / stop , press to start , release to stop , stop automatically at target location , etc. ) ?
Four of the more common 3D travel techniques are gaze - directed steering , pointing , map - based travel , and " grabbing the air " .
Gaze - Directed Steering
Gaze - directed steering is probably the most common 3D travel technique and was first discussed in 1995 , although the term " gaze " is really misleading .
Usually no eye tracking is being performed , so the direction of gaze is inferred from tracking the user 's head orientation .
This is a simple technique , both to implement and to use , but it is somewhat limited in that you cannot look around while moving .
Potential examples of gaze - directed steering in video games would be controlling vehicles or traveling around the world in a real - time strategy game .
To implement gaze - directed steering , typically a callback function is set up that executes before each frame is rendered .
Within this callback , first obtain the head tracker information ( usually in the form of a 4x4 matrix ) .
This matrix gives you a transformation between the base tracker coordinate system and the head tracker coordinate system .
By also considering the transformation between the world coordinate system and the base tracker coordinates ( if any ) , you can get the total composite transformation .
Now , consider the vector ( 0,0 , - 1 ) in head tracker space ( the negative z - axis , which usually points out the front of the tracker ) .
This vector , expressed in world coordinates , is the direction you want to move .
Normalize this vector , multiply it by the speed , and then translate the viewpoint by this amount in world coordinates .
Note : current " velocity " is in units / frame .
If you want true velocity ( units / second ) , you must keep track of the time between frames and then translate the viewpoint by an amount proportional to that time .
Pointing
Pointing is also a steering technique that was developed in the mid 1990s ( where the user continuously specifies the direction of motion ) .
In this case , the hand 's orientation is used to determine direction .
This technique is somewhat harder to learn for some users , but is more flexible than gaze - directed steering .
Pointing is implemented in exactly the same way as gaze - directed steering , except a hand tracker is used instead of the head tracker .
Pointing could be used to decouple line of sight and direction of motion in first and third person shooter games .
Map - Based Travel
The map - based travel technique is a target - based technique .
The user is represented as an icon on a 2D map of the environment .
To travel , the user drags this icon to a new position on the map ( see Figure 1 ) .
When the icon is dropped , the system smoothly animates the user from the current location to the new location indicated by the icon .
Map - based travel could be used to augment many of the 2D game maps currently found in many game genres .
Figure 1 .
Dragging a user icon to move to a new location in the world .
This image was taken in 1998 .
To implement this technique , two things must be known about the way the map relates to the world .
First , we need to know the scale factor , the ratio between the map and the virtual world .
Second , we need to know which point on the map represents the origin of the world coordinate system .
We assume here that the map model is originally aligned with the world ( i.e. the x direction on the map , in its local coordinate system , represents the x direction in the world coordinate system ) .
When the user presses the button and is intersecting the user icon on the map , then the icon needs to be moved with the stylus each frame .
One cannot simply attach the icon to the stylus , because we want the icon to remain on the map even if the stylus does not .
To do this , we first find the position of the stylus in the map coordinate system .
This may require a transformation between coordinate systems , since the stylus is not a child of the map .
The x and z coordinates of the stylus position are the point to which the icon should be moved .
We do not cover here what happens if the stylus is dragged off the map , but the user icon should " stick " to the side of the map until the stylus is moved back inside the map boundaries , since we do n't want the user to move outside the world .
When the button is released , we need to calculate the desired position of the viewpoint in the world .
This position is calculated using a transformation from the map coordinate system to the world coordinate system , which is detailed here .
First , find the offset in the map coordinate system from the point corresponding to the world origin .
Then , divide by the map scale ( if the map is 1/100 the size of the world , this corresponds to multiplying by 100 ) .
This gives us the x and z coordinates of the desired viewpoint position .
Since the map is 2D , we can't get a y coordinate from it .
Therefore , the technique should have some way of calculating the desired height at the new viewpoint .
In the simplest case , this might be constant .
In other cases , it might be based on the terrain height at that location or some other factors .
Once we know the desired viewpoint , we have to set up the animation of the viewpoint .
The move vector represents the amount of translation to do each frame ( we are assuming a linear path ) .
To find , we subtract the desired position from the current position ( the total movement required ) , divide this by the distance between the two points ( calculated using the distance formula ) , and multiplied by the desired velocity , so that gives us the amount to move in each dimension each frame .
The only remaining calculation is the number of frames this movement will take : distance / velocity frames .
Note that again velocity is measured here in units / frame , not units / second , for simplicity .
Grabbing the Air
The " grabbing the air " technique , also first discussed in 1995 , uses the metaphor of literally grabbing the world around you ( usually empty space ) , and pulling yourself through it using hand gestures .
This is similar to pulling yourself along a rope , except that the " rope " exists everywhere , and can take you in any direction .
The grabbing the air technique has many potential uses in video games including climbing buildings or mountains , swimming , and flying .
To implement the one - handed version of this technique ( the two - handed version can get complex if rotation and world scaling is also supported ) , when the initial button press is detected , we simply obtain the position of the hand in the world coordinate system .
Then , every frame until the button is released , get a new hand position , subtract it from the old one , and move the objects in the world by this amount .
Alternately , you can leave the world fixed , and translate the viewpoint by the opposite vector .
Before exiting the callback , be sure to update the " old " hand position for use on the next frame .
Note it is tempting to implement this technique simply by attaching the world to the hand , but this will have the undesirable effect of also rotating the world when the hand rotates , which can be quite disorienting .
You can also do simple constrained motion simply by ignoring one or more of the components of the hand position ( e.g. only consider x and z to move at a constant height ) .
Selection
3D selection is the process of accessing one or more objects in a 3D virtual world .
Note that selection and manipulation are intimately related , and that several of the techniques described here can also be used for manipulation .
There are several common issues for the implementation of selection techniques .
One of the most basic is how to indicate that the selection event should take place ( e.g. you are touching the desired object , now you want to pick it up ) .
This is usually done via a button press , gesture , or voice command , but it might also be done automatically if the system can infer the user 's intent .
One also has to have efficient algorithms for object intersections for many of these techniques .
We 'll discuss a couple of possibilities .
The feedback given to the user regarding which object is about to be selected is also very important .
Many of the techniques require an avatar ( virtual representation ) for the user 's hand .
Finally , consider keeping a list of objects that are " selectable " , so that a selection technique does not have to test every object in the world , increasing efficiency .
Four common selection techniques include the virtual hand , ray - casting , occlusion , and arm extension .
The Virtual Hand
The most common selection technique is the simple virtual hand , which does " real - world " selection via direct " touching " of virtual objects .
This technique is also one of the oldest and dates back to the late 1980s .
In the absence of haptic feedback , this direction manipulation is done by intersecting the virtual hand ( which is at the same location as the physical hand ) with a virtual object .
The virtual hand has great potential in many different video game genres .
Examples include selection of sports equipment , direct selection of guns , ammo , and health packs in first person shooter games , as a hand of " God " in real - time strategy games , and interfacing with puzzles in action / adventure games .
Implementing this technique is simple , provided you have a good intersection / collision algorithm .
Often , intersections are only performed with axis - aligned bounding boxes or bounding spheres rather than with the actual geometry of the objects .
Ray - Casting
Another common selection technique is ray - casting .
This technique was first discussed in 1995 and uses the metaphor of a laser pointer -- an infinite ray extending from the virtual hand .
The first object intersected along the ray is eligible for selection .
This technique is efficient , based on experimental results , and only requires the user to vary 2 degrees of freedom ( pitch and yaw of the wrist ) rather than the 3 DOFs required by the simple virtual hand and other location - based techniques .
Ideally , ray - casting could be used when ever special powers are required in the game or when the player has the ability to select objects at a distance .
There are many ways to implement ray - casting .
A brute - force approach would calculate the parametric equation of the ray , based on the hand 's position and orientation .
First , as in the pointing technique for travel , find the world coordinate system equivalent of the vector ( 0,0 , - 1 ) .
This is the direction of the ray .
If the hand 's position is represented by ( ) , and the direction vector is ( ) , then the parametric equations are given by
Only intersections with should be considered , since we do not want to count intersections " behind " the hand .
It is important to determine whether the actual geometry has been intersected , so first testing the intersection with the bounding box will result in many cases being trivially rejected .
Another method might be more efficient .
In this method , instead of looking at the hand orientation in the world coordinate system , we consider the selectable objects to be in the hand 's coordinate system , by transforming their vertices or their bounding boxes .
This might seem quite inefficient , because there is only one hand , while there are many polygons in the world .
However , we assume we have limited the objects by using a selectable objects list .
Thus , the intersection test we will describe is much more efficient .
Once we have transformed the vertices or bounding boxes , we drop the z coordinate of each vertex .
This maps the 3D polygon onto a 2D plane ( the xy plane in the hand coordinate system ) .
Since the ray is ( 0,0 , - 1 ) in this coordinate system , we can see that in this 2D plane , the ray will intersect the polygon if and only if the point ( 0,0 ) is in the polygon .
We can easily determine this with an algorithm that counts the number of times the edges of the 2D polygon cross the positive x-axis .
If there are an odd number of crossings , the origin is inside , if even , the origin is outside .
Occlusion Techniques
Occlusion techniques ( also called image plane techniques ) , first proposed in 1997 , work in the plane of the image ; object are selected by " covering " it with the virtual hand so that it is occluded from your point of view .
Geometrically , this means that a ray is emanating from your eye , going through your finger , and then intersecting an object .
Occlusion techniques could be used for object selection at a distance but instead of using a laser pointer metaphor that ray casting affords , players could simply " touch " distant objects to select them .
These techniques can be implemented in the same ways as the ray - casting technique , since it is also using a ray .
If you are doing the brute - force ray intersection algorithm , you can simply define the ray 's direction by subtracting the finger position from the eye position .
However , if you are using the second algorithm , you require an object to define the ray 's coordinate system .
This can be done in two steps .
First , create an empty object , and place it at the hand position , aligned with the world coordinate system .
Next , determine how to rotate this object / coordinate system so that it is aligned with the ray direction .
The angle can be determined using the positions of the eye and hand , and some simple trigonometry .
In 3D , two rotations must be done in general to align the new object 's coordinate system with the ray .
Arm-Extension
The arm- extension ( e.g. Go - Go ) technique , first described in 1996 and inspired by ' 80s cartoon Inspector Gadget , is based on the simple virtual hand , but it introduces a nonlinear mapping between the physical hand and the virtual hand , so that the user 's reach is greatly extended .
Not only useful for object selection at a distance , Go- Go could also be useful traveling through an environment with Batman 's grappling hook or Spiderman 's web .
The graph in Figure 2 shows the mapping between the physical hand distance from the body on the x-axis and the virtual hand distance from the body on the y - axis .
There are two regions .
When the physical hand is at a depth less than a threshold ' D ' , the one - to - one mapping applies .
Outside D , a non-linear mapping is applied , so that the farther the user stretches , the faster the virtual hand moves away .
Figure 2 .
The nonlinear mapping function used in the Go - Go selection technique .
To implement Go - Go , we first need the concept of the position of the user 's body .
This is needed because we stretch our hands out from the center of our body , not from our head ( which is usually the position that is tracked ) .
We can implement this using an inferred torso position , which is defined as a constant offset in the negative y direction from the head .
A tracker could also be placed on the user 's torso .
Before rendering each frame , we get the physical hand position in the world coordinate system , and then calculate its distance from the torso object using the distance formula .
The virtual hand distance can then be obtained by applying the function shown in the graph in Figure 2 .
( starting at D ) is a useful function in many environments , but the exponent used depends on the size of the environment and the desired accuracy of selection at a distance .
Once the distance , at which to place the virtual hand is known , we need to determine its position .
The most common implementation is to keep the virtual hand on the ray extending from the torso and going through the physical hand .
Therefore , if we get a vector between these two points , normalize it , multiply it by the distance , then add this vector to the torso point , we obtain the position of the virtual hand .
Finally , we can use the virtual hand technique for object selection .
Manipulation
As we noted earlier , manipulation is connected with selection , because an object must be selected before it can be manipulated .
Thus , one important issue for any manipulation technique is how well it integrates with the chosen selection technique .
Many techniques , as we have said , do both : e.g. simple virtual hand , ray - casting , and Go - Go .
Another issue is that when an object is being manipulated , you should take care to disable the selection technique and the feedback you give the user for selection .
If this is not done , then serious problems can occur if , for example , the user tries to release the currently selected object but the system also interprets this as trying to select a new object .
Finally , thinking about what happens when the object is released is important .
Does it remain at its last position , possibly floating in space ?
Does it snap to a grid ?
Does it fall via gravity until it contacts something solid ?
The application requirements will determine this choice .
Three common manipulation techniques include HOMER , Scaled - World Grab , and World - in - Miniature .
For each of these techniques , the manipulation of objects in the game world could be used in many different genres including setting traps in first and third person shooter games , completing puzzles in action / adventure games , and supporting new types of rhythm games .
HOMER
The Hand - Centered Object Manipulation Extending Ray - Casting ( HOMER ) technique , first discussed in 1997 , uses ray - casting for selection and then moves the virtual hand to the object for hand - centered manipulation .
The depth of the object is based on a linear mapping .
The initial torso - physical hand distance is mapped onto the initial torso - object distance , so that moving the physical hand twice as far away also moves the object twice as far away .
Also , moving the physical hand all the way back to the torso moves the object all the way to the user 's torso as well .
Like Go- Go , HOMER requires a torso position , because you want to keep the virtual hand on the ray between the user 's body ( torso ) and the physical hand .
The problem here is that HOMER moves the virtual hand from the physical hand position to the object upon selection , and it is not guaranteed that the torso , physical hand , and object will all line up at this time .
Therefore , we calculate where the virtual hand would be if it were on this ray initially , then calculate the offset to the position of the virtual object , and maintain this offset throughout manipulation .
When an object is selected via ray - casting , first detach the virtual hand from the hand tracker .
This is due to the fact that if it remained attached but the virtual hand model is moved away from the physical hand location , a rotation of the physical hand will cause a rotation and translation of the virtual hand .
Next , move the virtual hand in the world coordinate system to the position of the selected object , and attach the object to the virtual hand in the scene graph ( again , without moving the object in the world coordinate system ) .
To implement the linear depth mapping , we need to know the initial distance between the torso and the physical hand , and between the torso and the selected object .
The ratio will be the scaling factor .
For each frame , we need to set the position and orientation of the virtual hand .
The selected object is attached to the virtual hand , so it will follow along .
Setting the orientation is relatively easy .
Simply copy the transformation matrix for the hand tracker to the virtual hand , so that their orientation matches .
To set the position , we need to know the correct depth and the correct direction .
The depth is found by applying the linear mapping to the current physical hand depth .
The physical hand distance is simply the distance between it and the torso , and we multiply this by the scale factor to get the virtual hand distance .
We then obtain a normalized vector between the physical hand and the torso , multiply this vector by the virtual hand distance , and add the result to the torso position to obtain the virtual hand position .
Scaled - World Grab
The scaled - world grab technique ( see Figure 3 ) is often used with occlusion selection and was first discussed in 1997 .
The idea is that since you are selecting the object in the image plane , you can use the ambiguity of that single image to do some magic .
When the selection is made , the user is scaled up ( or the world is scaled down ) so that the virtual hand is actually touching the object that it is occluding .
If the user does not move ( and the graphics are not stereo ) , there is no perceptual difference between the images before and after the scaling .
However , when the user starts to move the object and / or his head , he realizes that he is now a giant ( or that the world is tiny ) and he can manipulate the object directly , just like the simple virtual hand .
To implement scaled - world grab , correct actions must be performed at the time of selection and release .
Nothing special needs to be done in between , because the object is simply attached to the virtual hand , as in the simple virtual hand technique .
At the time of selection , scale the user by the ratio ( distance from eye to object / distance from eye to hand ) .
This scaling needs to take place with the eye as the fixed point , so that the eye does not move , and should be uniform in all three dimensions .
Finally , attach the virtual object to the virtual hand .
At the time of release , the opposite actions are done in reverse .
Re-attach the object to the world , and scale the user uniformly by the reciprocal of the scaling factor , again using the eye as a fixed point .

An illustration of the scaled - world grab technique .
World - in - Miniature
The world - in - miniature ( WIM ) technique uses a small " dollhouse " version of the world to allow the user to do indirect manipulation of the objects in the environment ( see Figure 4 ) .
Each of the objects in the WIM are selectable using the simple virtual hand technique , and moving these objects causes the full - scale objects in the world to move in a corresponding way .
The WIM can also be used for navigation by including a representation of the user , in a way similar to the map - based travel technique , but including the third dimension .
Figure 4 .
An example of a WIM .
This image was taken in 1996 .
To implement the WIM technique , first create the WIM .
Consider this a room with a table object in it .
The WIM is represented as a scaled down version of the room , and is attached to the virtual hand .
The table object does not need to be scaled , because it will inherit the scaling from its parent ( the WIM room ) .
Thus , the table object can simply be copied within the scene graph .
When an object in the WIM is selected using the simple virtual hand technique , first match this object to the corresponding full - scale object .
Keeping a list of pointers to these objects is an efficient way to do this step .
The miniature object is attached to the virtual hand , just as in the simple virtual hand technique .
While the miniature object is being manipulated , simply copy its position matrix ( in its local coordinate system , relative to its parent , the WIM ) to the position matrix of the full - scale object .
Since we want the full - scale object to have the same position in the full - scale world coordinate system as the miniature object does in the scaled - down WIM coordinate system , this is all that is necessary to move the full - scale object correctly .
System Control
System control provides a mechanism for users to issue a command to either change the mode of interaction or the system state .
In order to issue the command , the user has to select an item from a set .
System control is a wide - ranging topic , and there are many different techniques to choose from such as the use of graphical menus , gestures , and tool selectors .
For the most part , these techniques are not difficult to implement , since they mostly involve selection .
For example , virtual menu items might be selected using ray - casting .
For all of the techniques , good visual feedback is required , since the user needs to know not only what he is selecting , but what will happen when he selects it .
In this section , we briefly highlight some of the more common system control techniques .
Graphical Menus
Graphical menus can be seen as the 3D equivalent of 2D menus .
Placement influences the access of the menu ( correct placement can give a strong spatial reference for retrieval ) , and the effects of possible occlusion of the field of attention .
Placement can be categorized into surround - fixed , world - fixed and display - fixed windows .
The subdivision of placement can , however , be made more subtle .
World - fixed and surround - fixed windows can be subdivided into menus which are either freely placed into the world , or connected to an object .
Display - fixed windows can be renamed , and made more precise , by referring to their actual reference frame : the body .
Body - centered menus , either head referenced or body - referenced , can supply a strong spatial reference frame .
One particularly interesting possible effect of body - centered menus is " eyes - off " usage , in which users can perform system control without having to look at the menu itself .
The last reference frame is the group of device - centered menus .
Device - centered placement provides the user with a physical reference frame ( see Figure 5 ) .
Figure 5 . The Virtual Tricorder : an example of a graphical menu with device - centered placement .
This image was taken in 1995 .
We can subdivide graphical menus into hand - oriented menus , converted 2D menus , and 3D widgets .
One can identify two major groups of hand - oriented menus .
1DOF menus are menus which use a circular object on which several items are placed .
After initialization , the user can rotate his / her hand along one axis until the desired item on the circular object falls within a selection basket .
User performance is highly dependent on hand and wrist physical movement and the primary rotation axis should be carefully chosen .
1DOF menus have been made in several forms , including the ring menu , sundials , spiral menus ( a spiral formed ring menu ) , and a rotary tool chooser .
The second group of hand - oriented menus is hand - held - widgets , in which menus are stored at a body - relative position .
The second group is the most often applied group of system control interfaces : converted 2D widgets .
These widgets basically function the same as in desktop environments , although one often has to deal with more DOFs when selecting an item in a 2D widget .
Popular examples are pull - down menus , pop -up menus , flying widgets , toolbars and slider .
The final group of graphical menus is the group known as 3D widgets .
In a 3D world , widgets often mean moving system control functionality into the world or onto objects .
This can also be thought of as " moving the functionality of a menu onto an object . "
A very important issue when using widgets is placement .
3D widgets differ from the previously discussed menu techniques ( 1DOF and converted 2D menus ) in the way the available functions are mapped : most often , the functions are co-located near an object , thereby forming a highly context - sensitive " menu " .
Gestures and Postures
When using gestural interaction , we apply a " hand - as - tool " metaphor : the hand literally becomes a tool .
When applying gestural interaction , the gesture is both the initialization and the issuing of a command .
When talking about gestural interaction , we refer , in this case , to gestures and postures , not to gestural input used with a Tablet PC or Interactive Whiteboard .
There is a significant difference between gestures and postures : postures are static movements ( like pinching ) , whereas gestures include a change of position and / or orientation of the hand .
A good example of gestures is the usage of sign language .
Gestural interaction can be a very powerful system control technique as well as useful for navigation and selection and manipulation .
In fact , gestures are relatively limitless when it comes to their potential uses in video games .
Gestures can be use to communicate with other players , to cast spells in a role playing game , call pitches or give signs in a baseball game , and issues combination attacks in action games .
However , one problem with gestural interaction is that the user needs to learn all the gestures .
Since the user can normally not remember more than about seven gestures ( due to the limited capacity of our working memory ) , inexperienced users can have significant problems with gestural interaction , especially when the application is more complex and requires a larger amount of gestures .
Users often do not have the luxury of referring to a graphical menu when using gestural interaction -- the structure underneath the available gestures is completely invisible .
In order to make gestural interaction easier to use for a less advanced user , strong feedback , like visual cues after initiation of a command , might be needed .
Tools
We can identify two different kinds of tools , namely physical tools and virtual tools .
Physical tools are context - sensitive input devices , which are often referred to as props .
A prop is a real - world object which is duplicated in the virtual world .
A physical tool might be space multiplexed ( the tool only performs one function ) or time multiplexed , when the tool performs multiple functions over time ( like a normal desktop mouse ) .
One accesses a physical tool by simply reaching for it , or by changing the mode on the input device itself .
Virtual tools are tools which can be best exemplified with a toolbelt .
Users wear a virtual toolbelt around the waist , from which the user can access specific functions by grabbing at particular places on belt , as in the real world .
Virtual toolbelts could potentially restructure how items and weapons are stored and accessed in game genres including first and third person shooters , role playing games , and action / adventure games .
Sometimes , functions on a toolbelt are accessed via the same principles as used with graphical menus , where one should look at the menu itself .
The structure of tools is often not complex : as stated before , physical tools are either dedicated devices for one function , or one can access several ( but not many ) functions with one tool .
Sometimes , a physical tool is the display medium for a graphical menu .
In this case , it has to be developed in the same way as graphical menus .
Virtual tools often use proprioceptive cues for structuring .
Conclusions
The techniques I have discussed in this article only scratch the surface for what has been done in the virtual reality and 3D user interface research communities over the years .
As the video game industry incorporates more and more motion - based interfaces in the games they make , work done by researchers in this space will become increasingly important .
I would hope that the video game industry will take what we , as academics , have to offer in terms of a plethora of techniques and the lessons learned using them .
Given the popularity of video games , academics from the virtual reality and 3D user interface research areas will continue to explore and develop new interface techniques specifically devoted to games .
It is my hope that the game industry and academics can work together to symbiotically push the envelope in game interfaces and gameplay mechanics .

It 's really amazing to watch one of these unfold and expand ; very fun .
Once that 's over though , the important thing is how it works .
We had our first one out for about a week before it started to break down .
I think they 'll be great to have in the car , for emergencies and such , but what I * really * liked was how absorbent it was .
We had it next to the sink , and it was excellent for getting the extr ..
