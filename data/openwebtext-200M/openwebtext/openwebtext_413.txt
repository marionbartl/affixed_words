A video , showing a live alien will be revealed to the news media on Friday in Denver .
Previously , an expert who thoroughly examined the video , showing the UFO sighting said that the tape is not fake .
Jerry Hofmann , Colorado Film School instructor in Denver analyzed the shot made by Stan Romanek from Colorado who has reported about the alien .
The editor said that he had the equipment to check if the shot was recorded originally and no tricks were involved in production of it .
The video recorded with the help of infrared camera shows an alien head looking in the window at night .
It is around 4 feet tall and is spotted blinking , Hofmann reported .
He said that Hollywood experts have seen the video and concluded that this would be a very elaborate puppet and Romanek obviously did not have enough resources to make such a thing .
Jeff Peckman proposed the ballot initiative to start an Extraterrestrial Affairs Commission in Denver to prepare for the close contact with aliens and said that he will show the video .
However , it might take some time before the video can be shown to the general public , because the shot was included in a documentary by the autho .
Peckman plans to show other " credible evidence " on Friday 's news conference .

Time for Obama to fight back or prepare to be ' swift - boated ' Nick Langewis

Print This Email This GoLeft TV's Mike Papantonio sees a pending " swift - boating " for Senator Obama as the " Karl Rove filth machine " brings back seasoned Republican operative and Bush ally John Timothy Griffin to work for Senator McCain 's presidential run .
Papantonio worries that the Democrats could take the same advice from the same brand of " intellectual advisors " that had Senator Kerry 's doomed 2004 presidential campaign staying largely silent on accusations of " flip - flopping " and " elitism " in addition to the infamous " Swift Boat Veterans for Truth " attacks on his service in Vietnam .
" Griffin , " he goes on , " was dealing with such brain - dead , spineless opposition in the Kerry camp , that Kerry never thought it was a good idea to do the same thing to ' the Shrub . '
Instead , Kerry just sat back above the fray . "
Griffin , the McCain campaign 's Director of Research , brings his experience from his time as Deputy Research Director for President Bush 's 2000 run .
He would also serve as a legal advisor for the " Bush - Cheney 2000 Florida Recount Team " during the battle that would culminate in Bush being awarded the presidency by the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore .
Griffin would later work as aide to White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove from September 2005 to September 2006 .
Journalist Greg Palast also uncovered e-mails that implicated Griffin as part of a vote caging scheme in the run-up to the 2004 election , thought to target 70,000 voters , including soldiers , students and people of color with mailing addresses in heavily Democratic districts , for disenfranchisement .
Unless the Democrats and the Obama campaign hire a " bottom - feeding , Griffin - like reptile " of their own , warns Papantonio , Democratic voters are in for a repeat of the 2004 campaign .
The entire installment of " The Pap Attack , " entitled " Warm & Fuzzy Democrats , " is available to view below .

For the last ten years , obsessive record collectors in Usenet have been working on the Whitburn Project — a huge undertaking to preserve and share high - quality recordings of every popular song since the 1890s .
To assist their efforts , they ’ve created a spreadsheet of 37,000 songs and 112 columns of raw data , including each song ’s duration , beats - per- minute , songwriters , label , and week - by - week chart position .
It ’s 25 megs of OCD , and it ’s awesome .
As far as I know , this is the first time the project and its data have ever been discussed outside of Usenet .
Despite its illegality , they ’ve created a wonderful resource and you can do some fun things with the data .
For the next three days , I ’m going to publish some analysis and insights gleaned from their work .
Update : I published an entry about one - hit wonders and pop longevity .
History of the Whitburn Project
Named after Joel Whitburn and his authoritative Billboard books , the Whitburn Project began in 1998 , when a group of 15 collectors pooled their resources to create an MP3 collection of every single in the top 40 .
They experimented with trading the files on P2P networks , but eventually landed in Usenet instead .
The Excel spreadsheets were created to help them verify their collections were complete , with new versions updated and re-uploaded to the newsgroups weekly .
Later , other collectors found the spreadsheet and built tools on top of it , including a utility to rename files properly and locate missing songs .
Originally , most of the Whitburn Project was simple data entry and fact - checking , but as the project grew , it forked away from the Whitburn books .
“ This spreadsheet does not reflect the Whitburn information found in his books , ” wrote Bullfrog , one of the spreadsheet ’s maintainers .
“ Whitburn has changed the way he numbers the annual songs at least twice since this [ spreadsheet ] was created .
We feel that he went off the deep end a little , so will not be following his new numbering scheme . ”
They ’ve also added new fields culled from their own research .
“ Obviously with the addition of BPM , genre , and the like , ” wrote Bullfrog , “ it has become its own entity and will continue to be from now on . ”
Over the last few months , I ’ve tried multiple times to contact the maintainers of the spreadsheet and the excellent Whitburn newsgroup FAQ , but they have n’t responded .
The Data
There are several Whitburn spreadsheets uploaded to multiple Usenet newsgroups sporadically , but the most useful is the “ Billboard Pop ME ( 1890 -2008 ) , ” which is posted in alt.binaries.sounds.whitburn.pop .
Note :
This data is almost certainly a violation of Billboard ’s copyright , and probably infringes on Record Research ’s books too .
The analysis I ’m publishing here should fall under fair use , but redistributing the spreadsheet would not .
If you ’re brave ( or dumb ) enough to locate and mirror a copy of the file , leave a comment .
Update :
An anonymous commenter posted the spreadsheet to Rapidshare / Megaupload .
Above is a sample of the top 10 songs from 2007 , so you can see the format and fields of the collected data , along with the key explaining each column .
( Scroll to the right to see all the fields . )
Song Lengths Over Time
I ’ll be focusing more on analysis tomorrow , but here ’s one of the first questions I asked when stumbling on this spreadsheet .
Are pop songs are longer or shorter now than in previous decades ?
A quick query reveals this chart of average playtimes per year .
Pop songs became shorter in the early 1960s , around the 2:30 mark , before rising yearly until peaking in 1992 at 4:16 .
Since then , pop songs have hovered around 4 minutes long .
The longest charting song of all time is Harry Chapin ’s live version of “ A Better Place to Be , ” at an epic 9 minutes and 30 seconds .
Runners - up include Guns n’ Roses ’ “ November Rain ” ( 8:56 ) , Don McLean ’s “ American Pie ” ( 8:36 ) , and a new entrant , Death Cab for Cutie ’s “ I Will Possess Your Heart ” ( 8:35 ) .
And the shortest ?
The Womenfolk ’s cover of Malvina Reynolds ’ “ Little Boxes ” from 1964 is only 1 minute and 3 seconds long .
The shortest modern song to chart is Zac Efron ’s “ What I ’ve Been Looking For , ” the third - shortest charting song of all - time at a brief 1:19 .
How about the length of the perfect pop song ?
For this , we can look at the mode to find the most common song lengths by decade .
For example , in the 1940s , there were 42 songs that were exactly 3:01 , making it the perfect song length for that decade .
1950s , 2:30 ( 95 songs )
1960s , 2:30 ( 250 songs )
1970s , 3:30 ( 153 songs )
1980s , 3:59 ( 142 songs )
1990s , 4:00 ( 132 songs )
2000s , 3:50 ( 58 songs )
I was surprised at how exact these numbers are .
The capacity for 45 RPM records was about three minutes , setting the standard for pop singles well into the 1960s .
By the late 1960s , those constraints were removed , and we start to see longer singles .
But without artificial constraints , why did exactly four minutes become the de facto standard in the 1980s and 1990s ?
( Maybe Madonna knows . )
I ’m tired .
More analysis tomorrow , including a look at one - hit wonders and how quickly singles fall off the charts over time .
Update :
Here it is .
Suburban sprawl is a sad state of affairs indeed .
I was driving around town with a few friends the other day , when out of nowhere we saw a pedestrian .
This was a sufficiently rare occurance that we all stared and gawked until the stoplight turned green .
It 's sad , really , but there are no pedestrians in this city .
It is a city of bubbles ; people are outside only long enough to move from one bubble to another .
They go from the home - bubble to the car - bubble , and then a few minutes later leave the car just long enough to enter whatever building was their destination .
And there 's no human interaction at all !
It is a sad state of affairs indeed .
This city personifies everything that is wrong with sprawling western cities and a society that values personal space so much that it forgets about the importance of human interaction .
When simply seeing another human during the day is so unusual , how can we be expected to meet and empathize with one another ?
As the Atlantic hurricane season begins , Honoré , who was commanding general First Army and leader of Joint Task Force Katrina before retiring , offers his views on why the United States needs to develop a culture of preparedness for natural disasters .
Russel L. Honoré says Americans must embrace a culture of preparedness for a host of disasters .
( CNN ) --
The recent series of disasters in the United States and around the world have resulted in the forced evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from their homes and have again demonstrated with startling clarity that we are living in a new normal .
In this new normal , international interdependencies and instantaneous communications combine to constantly remind us of disaster and terrorism , and disasters that once were considered exceptional now occur more frequently .
The recent earthquakes in China and the Myanmar cyclone are but two reminders of such disasters .
The reminders are beamed into our homes and workplaces as if to demonstrate that tragedy that can result if we fail to prepare .
What people once viewed as the exception they now see on a routine basis , yet we still do n't take the steps to be prepared for this new normal .
Watch Honore talk with CNN »
We have to be better prepared , and the first steps start at home and at work .
In today 's densely populated and technologically dependent communities , disasters have a far greater impact than ever before .
It 's time for America to wake up to this reality .
In a world where natural and man-made disasters can and will happen with little or no warning , we need to be prepared .
We face a host of potential disasters : from earthquakes , hurricanes and pandemics to industrial accidents , electrical blackouts , terrorism and the effects of possible attacks with weapons of mass destruction .
Our task as Americans is to be ready .
At home , events after 9/11 , Katrina , wildfires in California and Florida , numerous destructive tornadoes and other storms , and the threat of earthquakes accentuate the need to create a culture of preparedness in America .
A preparedness that is ingrained and intertwined in every part of our daily life , but is mostly common sense , is based in the American spirit .
While it is the duty of local , state and federal governments to prepare for and respond to disaster , true preparedness begins in our homes and our neighborhoods .
To create this culture of preparedness , we need to focus " left of the disaster , " which means we focus on preparations and responses before the disaster .
How , or if , each of us survives a disaster is directly related to where we were before it hit .
To create this culture of preparedness , we must change the way that academia , private industry , community groups and individual households think about preparedness in their daily lives .
Disaster readiness is the responsibility of every part of our society and every individual .
In our free - market society , the private sector has far more response capability than our government .
Governments need to work with private industries and make them part of the plan so we can quickly tap into all of our nation 's best resources when we need them most .
Our schools , from kindergarten to post - graduate institutions , need to develop a curriculum that will teach us how to prepare for and better respond to crises as communities and as individuals .
Neighborhoods and community groups need to know about and keep track of those among us who are unable to self - evacuate or unable to care for themselves , particularly when the power fails or when they run out of medicine .
And each of us has a personal responsibility to be ready .
We need to prepare our families and our homes .
In many cases , family and personal preparations can be fairly simple .
All it takes is a shift in our thinking .
For example , when Granny 's birthday comes around , we have a tendency to get her one of those little silver picture frames with a photo of the kids .
We need to stop giving Granny those picture frames and give her a weather radio .
And on Father 's Day , instead of giving Grandpa those funky colored ties , give him a weather radio , too .
In times of disaster , information is power .
Those radios will let them know if it 's time to act because we can never predict when we 'll be told to evacuate .
An inexpensive plastic tote -- a " ready box " filled with food , water , clothes , a battery - operated radio , copies of important papers , cash and other family necessities , kept in the closet by the front door -- is a big step toward personal preparedness .
In this new normal , we have only two options :
We can exist in a culture of fear and dependency , or we can do the responsible thing :
Live comfortably in a culture of preparedness and readiness ; a culture where individuals can save themselves and empower their local , regional and national governments to better respond to any disaster .
It 's time for America to adopt this culture of preparedness .

Is this Monkeypatch Good or Evil ?
Okay , firstoff , if you think all monkeypatches are inherently evil , you 're invited to withdraw from this discussion , and even more so if you think they are all inherently good .
A coworker wanted to find the index of an element in an array .
Not a problem , we have Array #index sitting right there .
Ah , but he wanted to find the element using block syntax , and index does n't support that .
Now , before we get outta control , this really is just two statements , innit : users.index(users.find { |u| u.name= ' Bob'} )
It does access users twice , though , which is a tiny bit poogy -- I 've been on a no-locality kick lately .
My coworker wrote a method called find_index , and it works pretty much as you 'd expect .
It encapsulates that line of code .
But then I thought , the real problem here is that index does n't take block syntax , and it probably oughta .
It took me about 30 seconds to whip out this monkeypatch : class Array alias_method : orig_index , : index def index( val=nil , & block ) if block_given ? orig_index ( find ( &block ) ) else orig_index ( val ) end end end
And it works exactly as expected : users.index { |u| u.name= =' Bob '}
Now , I do n't want to get bogged down in whether or not we should be monkeypatching here .
Let 's take for a given right now that our small team has looked at the code and is willing to add this method to the bits of code they have to know exist , and that we all ( on my team ) agree that the cleaner syntax is a reward in itself .
The question is , however , should it be a monkeypatch ... or should it be a separate method .
The very specific reason for this question is that my monkeypatch now takes an argument or a block ... but it COULD take an argument AND a block .
In that case , it ignores the argument , but there 's nothing in there to indicate that you can only use one or the other .
Ruby does n't support different method signatures like C or Java would let us do , so if we want to make these arguments exclusive , we have to make a separate function .
Discuss .
P.S. Oh , duh : raise ArgumentError if !val.nil ?
&& block_given ?
Is this the answer ?

I would frown nine out of ten times
Okay , just for the record : you 're in the " all monkeypatches are evil " camp . :-)
Actually , I find the attitude behind this statement interesting .
My team has a very strong ethic of " do whatever it takes to improve readability and maintainability " , and that means " you should ONLY , but you should also ALWAYS , make a monkeypatch if a monkeypatch is the appropriate solution . "
Most of the Array methods have arg - or - block syntax .
Patching Array
Most of your arguments circulate around a fear of potential maintenance issues that you have never faced .
I know you 've never faced them , because we have , and they are neither as common nor as disastrous as you fear .
Not by an order of magnitude ... on either count .
Take a look at all of your concerns , and ask yourself this question : does leaving this monkeypatch out fix any of those problems ?
Novice coders will still make mistakes , new versions of Ruby might still be incompatible with a small amount of your code , and every single line of code you ever write might have unintended ramifications that you will have to debug .
You could argue that writing a monkeypatch might worsen these conditions .
I 'm saying I have actual experience that shows it does not .
Not any more than any other line of code , and what we do know about these lines of code is that they improve readability and maintainability .
Sorry if I 'm disagreeing overmuch .
I largely wanted to avoid the " monkeypatches are inherently good / evil " argument because I am very passionate about the topic of readability .
The general populace comes down blindly and hard against monkeypatches -- you yourself think " nine out of ten times against " is a fair middle ground !-- and it 's hard to argue against that without sounding like I'm in the " monkeypatches are inherently good " camp .
I am definitely not in that camp .
A bad monkeypatch can ruin your whole day .
What I do feel is that monkeypatches are extremely powerful , and that means that when misused they are extremely dangerous .
But that power can and should be leveraged whenever appropriate .
I would agree with you on the " nine out of ten " rule if only one monkeypatch in ten were more useful than dangerous , but the reality is , once you 've seen a few good monkeypatches it becomes very easy to tell them apart , and your sample set becomes much closer to " five out of ten " .
This particular monkeypatch rides the very edge of power vs. danger .
It only extends functionality , which is good , but it does so inside an existing method which , as you point out , gives the reader pause .
And it should .
Ultimately , I think we 'll keep it as a patch on index , though , because that 's where this functionality belongs .
Anyway , I hope I 'm not coming across as dismissive .
I appreciate your comments , and we considered them at length in debating the utility of this monkeypatch .
Thank you !

I just realized I may have inadvertently baited you .
I have presented this here with all the safety guards removed for the sake of brevity .
The actual code :
- is implemented with alias_method_chain
- timidly checks to see that the alias has n't already been chained , and refuses to re-chain if so
- has rdoc ( !!!)
- has a sanity check that passes calls ary .
index {...} without the patch , expecting silent failure .
If that condition ever changes ( e.g. Ruby changes ) , the unit test will immediately fail .
Yeah , I just realized that if you assume the patch I presented was presented in its entirety ( i.e. NO safety guards ) , it 's a bit on the " swinging from the chandelier with a cutlass in my teeth " side .
Thanks again .

The risk : gain ratio is too high on this one .
You 're tweaking a widely - used method for , let 's face it , pretty minor syntactic convenience .
The inherent risk of this particular change is pretty low , but multiplied by all the places that you do and do n't know of that call index , it should give one pause .
If you were tweaking this to implement , say , an algorithm 2 orders of magnitude faster for your problem set that will have benefits throughout your application , and you 've already used the normal index method everywhere , that 's a different story .
The risk is still there ( probably greater ) but the benefits are proportional .

Nothing changes .
Those assumptions would still hold .

I suppose someone somewhere might be passing a block to index , expecting it to be ignored , and now it would n't be .

Oh , I see - you were talking about when someone is intentionally using the patch .
In that case , you 're right , and a case could be made for patching include ?
to ignore a passed block just to keep the symmetry .
I do n't know if anyone would find that useful , however .
I thought you were saying the patch was dangerous because it could trip up someone who did n't know about the patch .

Since index does not have a behavior defined when a block is given it seems ok to me to provide that behavior .
Especially when the behavior defined is logical and expected ( i.e. this could easily be something that might later get introduced in a future version of Ruby ) .
And your automated testing should let you know if there is any obscure reason to not do this .
So I say go for it .

About this example in particular : the problem of what happens when you pass both an argument and a block bugs me .
Probably for this particular case I 'd use a different method , as I can't recall anywhere in the ruby stdlib where you have a block - taking method that ignores the arguments if a block is passed ( of course , I woke up 20 min ago , and have n't had coffee yet :P )
So , for consistency , and POLS , I 'd say ' Array
But , I 'm often one to monkeypatch to add stuff without thinking it twice , specially if what I add is orthogonal with the original code and wo n't do any damage .
About monkeypatching to add functionality :
If you 're adding to the method , and not changing anything , then what 's to fear ?
The only problem would be for people who were already passing a block to Array #index .
But as someone commented above : they had it coming .

How easy is it to grep the code to find all incidences of using index with a block ?
I 'd use a different method name .

I suppose code would break if there were two libraries trying to replace Array but your carefully written unit tests are n't going to test third - party libraries ( ie rubygems ) that break mysteriously when run alongside this hack .
I suppose code would break if there were two libraries trying to replace Array #index in incompatible ways .
Unfortunate that there 's not really a way to detect that ( is there ? ) .

Case in point - both rails and the classifier gem monkey patch Array
So I would n't release this in a library , but if it ' works for you ' in your app code then go nuts .
Monkey patching methods that are likely to be patched by other libraries is dangerous because one of the patches will get cloberred .
Case in point - both rails and the classifier gem monkey patch Array # sum , so you get obscure errors trying to use them together .

Not a ruby programmer , but ... ( Link ) .. can you have an array of blocks in ruby ?
If so , are n't you clobbering the ability to find the index of a given block in that array ?
Maybe not something you might be doing yourself , but are you sure no library code you rely on is going to do that ?

Although you can have arrays of procs , equivalence for them is undefined , so { |i| i==3} wo n't be equivalent to anything except itself , since you 're implicitly creating a new proc there .
Finally , even if all that could work , the syntax would be arr. index ( { |i| i==3 } ) ; ... note the {} is inside the ( ) .

KDE 4 UI critique 02008-01-18T16:36:07+00:00
Human beings have different kinds of memory ; they remember things in different ways .
Three common classes of memory are spatial memory , visual memory and verbal memory .
( There ’s also chronological memory , but that ’s not relevant to my point here . )
I have excellent spatial memory .
It ’s what I rely on most .
For example , if I start to think about how to get to a given place in town , I literally find 3D visualizations of my route flashing into my consciousness .
I also have pretty good visual memory ; when I make the journey , I verify that I ’m going the right way by comparing the visual appearance of buildings and landscape that I pass with the scenes I remember .
My linguistic memory is terrible .
If you asked me to name the actual streets on the route , I ’d have a hard time remembering them .
My mental map of London , for example , only has 6 street names .
This makes me a really bad person to get directions from .
“ You take the narrow road that heads off at a thirty degree angle , right at the place with the green copper roof , over the light colored bridge … ”
There ’s an upside to my condition .
If you rely on verbal memory to navigate , as soon as you step outside your known area you are pretty much lost until you can find a familiar street name .
In contrast , I have a pretty good chance of navigating between two known points , even if the area in between is totally new to me .
This hierarchy of types of memory also applies in my interaction with computers .
When I want to find my password manager , I do n’t remember its name .
Instead , I remember that it ’s in the bottom hierarchical menu of my KDE menu , positioned near the top , and has a green icon .
I know this experimentally , incidentally : back in the System 6 days there was a joke Mac INIT that removed all the text from the menus .
I tried it , and was quite startled to discover that I could still use most of my favorite applications .
With that background out of the way , I would like to talk about why for me , the new KDE 4 application launcher is a user interface disaster of epic proportions .
The launcher is still a button in the bottom left , like Windows .
Here ’s pretty much what you see the first time you hit the button :
One minor criticism springs to mind instantly : I have never in my life used Konqueror as my web browser , and it is emphatically not my favorite anything .
Once I was done thinking that , though , I immediately realized I could find the applications I actually wanted via the applications tab .
So I clicked it , and saw this :
Here ’s the first problem .
The new KDE launcher is a gynecologist interface :
There you are , sitting in front of a 20 ″ screen , but the programmer has dictated that you have to do everything by poking around in a small box .
The first thing I tried to do was resize the box so I could see what was going on .
No dice , it ’s not immediately resizable .
Oh well , I thought , and scrolled up and down until I found the hierarchical menu entry I wanted .
I ’ll get some screenshots of this , I thought , so I hit graphics .
The entire contents of the box disappeared , replaced by what I recognized as having once been the contents of my familiar graphics menu :
I found my screenshot program and opened it .
Once I had taken a few screenshots , I wanted to go open up a text editor to take some notes .
Here ’s where the real problems began .
Clicking the KDE menu button gave me :
Yup , the exact same graphics sub - menu I was last looking at .
Presumably the idea here is that if the last program I opened was graphics - related , chances are the next program I ’ll want to open will be graphics - related too .
I think that ’s wrong in general , and that KDE4 ’s behavior here is extremely unhelpful , but I ’m prepared to entertain the possibility that I ’m incorrect .
The big problem was that I could n’t work out how to get back to the main application menu .
I tried clicking Applications , but that did nothing .
I tried switching to favorites mode , then back to applications–again , no effect .
Next I tried the Leave button reasoning that it would let me Leave the current sub-menu .
Instead , that gave me options to log out or reboot .
I ’m guessing that on reboot , I ’d have still been stuck in the same Applications sub-menu .
Next , I tried thinking like a Linux user .
If clicking got me to a sub - menu , maybe right - clicking would get me back .
Nope .
I tried clicking the heading of “ Graphics ” , in case that would give me a list of other sub-menus .
I tried scrolling up and down , looking for a “ .. ” or left - arrow entry .
No dice .
Finally , I spotted the secret .
Have you seen it yet ?
In the sub - menu , the space to the left of the icons is shaded gray instead of white , and there ’s a tiny gray triangle on the gray shading .
If you click that shaded area , the sub - menu disappears and you ’re back at the level above .
In other words , the new menu works like a gynecologist version of the NeXT / OS X column - based view , where you ’re only allowed to see one column at once and the back button is disguised as something else .
Given that I took several minutes to work this out , I have a really hard time believing that my mother would ever master it .
I say this because my mother could launch applications in KDE 3 just fine , but getting her to find something in the OS X Finder is a bit of an ordeal .
So , I am skeptical of the claim that this interface is an improvement for beginners .
I ’m also of the opinion that it ’s a disaster for anyone who relies on spatial memory , because every time you open the menu , everything is in a random position based on how you left it last time you went to find something .
It ’s the same problem Microsoft hit when they had the bright idea of dynamically adding and removing items from the Windows start menu ; it really , really bugs the hell out of anyone who finds things by position .
Does anybody really remember how they last left a menu ?
Seriously ?
If not , what sense does it make to preserve that state the next time they enter the menu ?
The KDE developers apparently believe that there is nothing wrong with this new launcher , pointing at the fact that they did proper HCI usability studies .
Well , yes they did , with 10 people .
I ’m willing to bet that at most 1 or 2 of those people was a spatial memory person .
If you ’re a verbal / linguistic memory person , the new interface is great .
You just type part of the name of the program you want in the text box , and a list of possible matches appears underneath .
So quick and easy .
Unfortunately , program name recall is a major problem for me .
It ’s not uncommon for me to sit staring at the keyboard for 30 seconds as I try to recall the name of the program that you use to edit runlevels on non-RedHat systems .
I remember that it ’s ntsysv on RedHat , but for whatever reason I can never remember the name of the corresponding program on Debian or Ubuntu .
In fact , I ’ve resorted to aliasing ntsysv to a prompt that reminds me what the program is called .
It ’s rcconf , in case you ’re interested ; I just looked it up for what is probably the hundredth time .
So my guess is that there ’s a sizeable proportion of people like me who are going to find the new KDE4 extremely painful to use .
I suspect that the small sample size in the UI testing by chance did n’t include any of us , so the KDE developers are blissfully unaware that they ’ve done anything wrong .
They think we ’re just whining because it ’s something new we ’re not used to .
This article is an attempt to set out why that ’s not the case .
The obvious question is , what can be done to fix the new launcher ?
My guess is that most of the issues would go away if the Applications tab always started off at the top level of menus , and if each menu or sub - menu always started off consistently , scrolled to the top .
That way I would n’t be thinking “ OK , where the hell am I ? ” every time I clicked on it .
The second obvious fix is to get the launcher out of gynecologist mode .
Right now , there ’s a single size preference , which determines how many items get listed in the menu ; however , I ’d like to see a way to compress the vertical space occupied by each item , so I could at least see all my top level menus at once .
Then there ’s the horizontal dimension .
At the moment there is literally no way to see more than one column at once , no matter how big the screen is .
Actually being able to see the column to the left of the sub - menu you ’re in would provide some context and help you quickly establish a sense of where you were .
It would also make navigation a lot quicker .
There ’s a reason why the OS X file selector shows more than one column by default .
So I think the KDE 4 launcher is salvageable .
The question is whether the developers are willing to take these criticisms on board and address them seriously , or whether they will take the approach of the GIMP developers and claim that the complainers are just whining because the UI is n’t like something else they are used to .
A little more than a year ago , Nathan T's company decided to outsource a large portion of certain project to a certain country many thousands of miles away .
" Even if the code quality is n't as good , " one manager would often say , " we 'll just pay them to rewrite it and rewrite it again .
It 'll still be less expensive . "
Extended that logic even further , management decided to not only outsource overseas , but outsource to the cheapest overseas firm they could find .
Eventually , they 'd end up with solid code , right ?
As it turned out , each iteration of their code got more and more ... interesting .
The developers across the pond did n't quite grasp the basics of object - oriented programming ( especially the whole " reference type " versus " value type " thing ) , and ended up writing a lot of " superstitious " code to make sure the compiler would do exactly what they wanted .
Of course , being that the outsourcing firm delivered well over hundreds of thousands of lines of superstitious code , there 's really only one way to represent it all :
int j = int. Parse ( i.ToString ( ) ) ; // provides deep copy of j
At least that line worked ... if only the other 99,999 lines would .
Pressure is building on Iran .
This week Europe agreed to new sanctions and President Bush again suggested something more serious – possible military strikes – if the Islamic Republic does n't bend to the will of the international community on its nuclear program .
But increasingly military analysts are warning of severe consequences if the US begins a shooting war with Iran .
While Iranian forces are no match for American technology on a conventional battlefield , Iran has shown that it can bite back in unconventional ways .
Iranian networks in Iraq and Afghanistan could imperil US interests there ; American forces throughout the Gulf region could be targeted by asymmetric methods and lethal rocket barrages ; and Iranian partners across the region – such as Hezbollah in Lebanon – could be mobilized to engage in an anti-US fight .
Iran 's response could also be global , analysts say , but the scale would depend on the scale of the US attack .
" One very important issue from a US intelligence perspective , [ the Iranian reaction ] is probably more unpredictable than the Al Qaeda threat , " says Magnus Ranstorp at the Center for Asymmetric Threat Studies at the Swedish National Defense College in Stockholm .
" I doubt very much our ability to manage some of the consequences , " says Mr. Ranstorp , noting that Iranian revenge attacks in the past have been marked by " plausible deniability " and have had global reach .
" If you attack Iran you are unleashing a firestorm of reaction internally that will only strengthen revolutionary forces , and externally in the region , " says Ranstorp .
" It 's a nightmare scenario for any contingency planner , and I think you really enter the twilight zone if you strike Iran . "
Though the US military has since early 2007 accused Iran 's Qods Force – an elite element of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) – of providing anti-US militias in Iraq with lethal roadside bombs , and of training and backing " special groups " in actions that the US government alleges have cost " thousands " of lives , US commanders have played down Iran 's military capabilities .
Even Admiral William Fallon , who publicly opposed a US strike on Iran before he resigned in April , dismissed Iran as a military threat .
" Get serious , " Adm. Fallon told Esquire in March .
" These guys are ants .
When the time comes , you crush them . "
But that has not kept Iran from rhetorical chest - beating , with an active military manpower of 540,000 – the largest in the Middle East – dependent on some of the lowest per capita defense spending in the region .
Iran " can deal fatal blows to aggressor America by unpredictable and creative tactical moves , " the senior commander Brig .
Gen. Gholam Ali Rashid said in late May .
" It is meaningless to back down before an enemy who has targeted the roots of our existence . "
Iran 's supreme religious leader Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei also warned of far - reaching revenge in 2006 .
" The Americans should know that if they assault Iran , their interests will be harmed anywhere in the world that is possible , " he said .
" The Iranian nation will respond to any blow with double the intensity . "
Analysts say Iran has a number of tools to make good on those threats and take pride in taking on a more powerful enemy .
" This is not something they are shying away from , " says Alex Vatanka , a Middle East security analyst at Jane 's Information Group in Washington .
" They say : ' Conventional warfare is not something we can win against the US , but we have other assets in the toolbox , ' " says Mr. Vatanka , noting that the IRGC commander appointed last fall has been " marketed as this genius behind asymmetric warfare doctrine . "
" What they are really worried about is the idea of massive aerial attacks on literally thousands of targets inside Iran , " says Vatanka , also an adjunct scholar at the Middle East Institute .
" Their reading of America 's intentions in that scenario would be twofold :
One is to obviously dismantle as much as possible the nuclear program ; and [ the other ] , indirectly try to weaken the [ Islamic ] regime . "
Any US - Iran conflict would push up oil prices , and though Iran could disrupt shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf , its weak economy depends on oil revenues .
But nearby US forces in Iraq , Afghanistan , and the Gulf provide a host of targets .
Iran claimed last October that it could rain down 11,000 rockets upon " the enemy " within one minute of an attack and that rate " would continue . "
Further afield , Israel is within range of Iran 's Shahab - 3 ballistic missiles , and Hezbollah claims its rockets – enhanced and resupplied by Iran since the 2006 war to an estimated 30,000 – can now hit anywhere in the Jewish state , including its nuclear plant at Dimona .
Closer to home , Iran has honed a swarming tactic , in which small and lightly armed speedboats come at far larger warships from different directions .
A classified Pentagon war game in 2002 simulated just such an attack and in it the Navy lost 16 major warships , according to a report in The New York Times last January .
" The sheer numbers involved overloaded their ability , both mentally and electronically , to handle the attack , " Lt. Gen. K. Van Riper , a retired Marine Corps officer who commanded the swarming force , told the Times .
" The whole thing was over in five , maybe 10 minutes . "
During the 1990s , Iranian agents were believed to be behind the assassinations of scores of regime opponents in Europe , and German prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Iran 's intelligence minister .
Iran and Hezbollah are alleged to have collaborated in the May 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in revenge for Israel 's killing of a Hezbollah leader months before .
Argentine prosecutors charge that they jointly struck again in 1994 , bombing a Jewish community center in the Argentine capital that killed 85 , one month after Israel attacked a Hezbollah base in Lebanon .
With some 30,000 on the payroll by one count , Iranian intelligence " is a superpower in intelligence terms in the region ; they have global reach because of their reconnaissance ability and quite sophisticated ways of inflicting pain , " says Ranstorp .
" They have been expanding their influence . …
Who would have predicted that Argentina would be the area that Hezbollah and the Iranians collectively would respond ? "
Past examples show that " Tehran recognizes that at times its interest are best served by restraint , " says a report on consequences of a strike on Iran published this week by Patrick Clawson and Michael Eisenstadt of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
But Iran could target the US , too , depending on the magnitude of any US strike .
" Iran 's capacity for terror and subversion remains one of its most potent levers in the event of a confrontation with the United States , " says the report , adding that " success " in delaying Iran 's nuclear programs could backfire .
If " US and world opinion were so angered by the strikes that they refused to support further pressure against Iran 's nuclear ambitions , then prevention could paradoxically [ eventually ensure ]
Iran 's open pursuit of nuclear weapons , " concludes the report .
And the long list of unconventional tactics should not be taken for granted in Tehran , says Vatanka , noting that the Islamic system 's top priority is survival .
" So the Iranians have to be careful , " says Vatanka .
" Just because the US does n't have the will right now , or the ability to produce the kind of stick that they would fear , does n't mean the way of confrontation is going to pay off for them in the long run . "

â€ œK. S. Oâ€ ™Krienâ€ asks :
Why is it that women spend so much time on looks and fashion ?
Jesus , â€œK.
S.â€ 
Youâ€ ™re lucky you didnâ€™t ask Naomi Wolf that question .
After spiking your testicles right down your throat for , well , having testicles to begin with , she would very likely shove a copy of The Beauty Myth right up your sexist rectum on the assumption that your head is up there somewhere , too .
You see , Naomi ( Ms. Wolf if she ever happens to read this ) wants you to know that the modern ( sheâ€™s not very good with history ) womanâ€™s obsession with looks is primarily due to a cynical conspiracy ( capitalism ) by men ( donâ€™t tell Helena , Estee or MK ) to punish feminists ( because no one else was doing it ) by setting purely superficial and impossible standards and then brainwashing all us silly gals into going along with the program .
The Beauty Myth burst loudly and messily onto the scene during my own formative years , and as a hip young feminist I read it before the ink was dry .
â€ œVictim mentalityâ€ was not yet in my fledgling vocabulary , and â€œsloppy researchâ€ would have required too much critical thinking to assess , so my reactions swung from a smartass â€œduhâ€ to an impatient â€œoh pleaseâ€  and back again .
For example : â€ œLike I donâ€™t know thereâ€™s a multi-billion dollar beauty industry aimed directly at my soft underbelly of insecurity ?
Like I donâ€™t know society tries to impose its patriarchal rules on my sexuality and appearance ?
â€ I demanded of my pal Alan as he gave me the latest Cosmo quiz .
â€ œThis is no Feminine Mystique , Iâ€™ll tell you that much … wait a minute , Iâ€™m a All - Natural Slut ?
I could have sworn I was a High - Maintenance Whore .
What were the choices for number eight again ?â€ 
Or : â€ œI canâ€™t believe a self - described advocate for women considers her own gender nothing more than a bunch of brainless herd beasts , â€  I groused to my girlfriend Angela as we waited in line one day .
â€ œWhat a twit .
Hey , you stay here and Iâ€™ll go get us a Snapple â€ “ if we lose our place thereâ€™s no way weâ€™ll get tote bags .
What is it about Clinique Bonus Days that brings out all the crazy bitches ?â€ 
I just didnâ€™t buy it , not completely , and while listening to countless advertising flacks whine and squirm as they tried to disavow any responsibility at all for promoting harmful stereotypes was certainly a quick route to nausea , they had a point about personal responsibility and choice .
And although I gave up cosmetics for three months just to prove I could , it was a disingenuous gesture at best .
I knew perfectly well that anyone whose gaze traveled far enough north of my 23 - year - old anti-gravity breasts to notice the lack of makeup probably didnâ€™t want to fuck me anyway , so who cared ?
My opinions were in flux , but my values were rock - solid .
Fortunately for you and your nads , â€œK .
S. , â€ the eminently reasonable Nancy Etcoff came along a few years later to deliver a resounding and well - deserved bitchslap to Ms. Naomiâ€™s shaky thesis .
In Survival of the Prettiest ( and that title alone was a gleeful red flag to the bulls of second - wave feminism ) , she drew on an impressive pool of global research and historical analysis to suggest that maybe , just maybe , an attraction to pretty is hard - wired into humans , indicating health , good breeding potential , and general do - ableness for men and women alike .
She made an excellent case , too , that variations in essential standards of beauty are really not particularly variable or easily - manipulated , changing significantly in response to biological and evolutionary imperatives rather than the fitful breezes of politics or fashion .
Suck on that , Naomi , said Our Ms. Nancy , and think about this :
Why do three - month - old infants from a variety of cultures and races consistently prefer conventionally attractive faces ?
( Langlois , 1995 )
Why do young men with symmetrical faces and bodies get more action and get it earlier than their lopsided compatriots ?
( Thornhill and Gangestad , 1993 ) What am I doing on the back of this Harley , half - naked and helmetless , behind a beautiful young man too perpetually drunk to maintain a useful erection ?
( Euphrosyne , 1994 )
And how the hell else do you explain the success of this vacuous good olâ€™ boy ?
( click for details )
Male or female , thereâ€™s just something about the pretty .
Unfortunately , since the days of Elizabeth Iâ€™s sexy bejeweled and perfumed suitors ( not all of those codpieces were padded , you know ) and the glittering peacocks who strutted the courts of the Sun King , men in Western culture have been drabbed down to the point of excruciating dullness .
For a couple of centuries now , you guys have still had to be pretty in the right ways ; you just couldnâ€™t get caught working at it , unless it was a homophobeâ € “ proof exercise like weight - lifting or … or … I canâ€™t think of anything else .
So , â€œK .
S. , â€ if your wife seems to you to spend an unconscionably long time daubing on the colored mud and strapping the various body parts into more aesthetically - pleasing positions , Iâ€™m willing to bet that you would , too , if you thought you could get away with it .
You can , you know .
I have some great links if you need them â€ “ man girdles , fake pecs , spray tans , painted abs , Botox providers , even scrotum tightening for that youthful , jaunty swing .
Just let me know .
Thereâ€™s not much I can do about the possible posterior position of your cranium , though .
If this week 's Senate debate on a proposed cap - and - trade system for greenhouse gases was supposed to be a dress rehearsal for climate legislation , things are not looking too good for opening night .
The week has been marked by parliamentary maneuvers and bitter accusations over divergent estimates of the bill 's future costs .
On Wednesday , a group of GOP senators asked that the clerk of the Senate read the entire 491 - page bill aloud , an extremely rare request .
That took more than 10 hours .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Although parliamentary maneuvers could still extend the debate into next week , Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid ( Nev. ) faced the prospect of failure in a bid to end debate on amendments to the climate bill this morning .
In that event , he was expected to seek withdrawal of the entire measure , to the relief of some Democrats from coal - producing or heavy industrial states .
" We are going to have Democrats voting to end debate on what they call the most important issue facing the planet and Republicans voting to continue debate on it , " said Don Stewart , communications director for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) .
Some Democrats were worried yesterday that the GOP might try to block withdrawal of the legislation to prolong a debate that many Democrats think no longer works to their political benefit .
Republicans have pounced on the high price of gasoline and have stressed that the climate legislation , by introducing a price on carbon dioxide emissions , would further raise the price of gas along with that of all other fossil fuels .
James M. Inhofe ( Okla . ) , the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , said in a statement , " Now Democrats are on record as supporting legislation that would significantly increase prices at the pump and in our homes . "
Dozens of amendments will die along with the bill .
Several sought to impose tariffs on developing countries , such as China , that do not price carbon dioxide emissions .
McConnell sought an amendment to allow the energy and transportation secretaries to suspend parts of the legislation if they believed it had raised gasoline prices .

The $ 33 million Wallypower 118 is the boat of my dreams .
Its 118 feet are powered by five engines -- 2 diesels for tooting around the marina , and 3 jet turbines , for pirating at over 70 MPH .
At top speed it guzzles a liter of fuel per second , which limits the range of its 22 ton fuel tanks to 400 nautical miles ( compared to 1,500 nm if you 're just putting around with the diesels at 9 knots ) .
I could go on and on about how I want to get one and pirate my life away , but instead I 'll just say this : I take back all the mean things I said about the guy that has sex with cars , because I would totally do this boat .
A TON more pictures that you WILL look at because I spent a lot of time editing them ( and there 's one of a chick in a bikini from 50 miles away ) .
Also , some videos .

Thanks Raul , lets go halvsies and cruise the open seas for chicks .
Or mermaids .
Or treasure .
Actually , I do n't give a shit what we 're doing , as long as we 've got the yacht and call each other by pirate names .
And do n't worry , I did n't really mean that thing about having sex with the boat .
I think .
Safety campaigners have labelled the man as a " fool "
A front seat car passenger was photographed baring his backside at a speed camera in Northumberland .
The " mooning " man was snapped by the mobile camera as the black BMW X5 drove past on the A1171 Dudley Lane in Cramlington last month .
His behaviour has been labelled as " dangerous and offensive " by road safety campaigners .
Police may take action against the man for public order offences and not wearing a seat belt .
Officers have the registration of the car , which was not breaking the speed limit , and intend to contact its owner .
It is understood the driver will not face prosecution as no driving offence was being committed .
Jeremy Forsberg , of the Northumbria Safer Roads Initiative , said : " This behaviour is simply ridiculous - it 's clear what he was thinking with what he had on show .
" Not only is it disrespectful , but distasteful and offensive , particularly to children who may have been exposed to this nonsense .
" This prank could have been a real distraction from the driver and that is not something to laugh about . "

The SeaWiFS instrument aboard the Seastar satellite has been collecting ocean data since 1997 .
By monitoring the color of reflected light via satellite , scientists can determine how successfully plant life is photosynthesizing .
A measurement of photosynthesis is essentially a measurement of successful growth , and growth means successful use of ambient carbon .
This animation shows an average of 10 years worth of SeaWiFS data .
Dark blue represents warmer areas where there tends to be a lack of nutrients , and greens and reds represent cooler nutrient - rich areas which support life .
The nutrient - rich areas include coastal regions where cold water rises from the sea floor bringing nutrients along and areas at the mouths of rivers where the rivers have brought nutrients into the ocean from the land .

In praise of CO2
With less heat and less carbon dioxide , the planet could become less hospitable and less green
Lawrence Solomon
Financial Post , Don Mills , Ontario
Saturday , June 07 , 2008
Planet Earth is on a roll !
GPP is way up .
NPP is way up .
To the surprise of those who have been bearish on the planet , the data shows global production has been steadily climbing to record levels , ones not seen since these measurements began .
GPP is Gross Primary Production , a measure of the daily output of the global biosphere – the amount of new plant matter on land .
NPP is Net Primary Production , an annual tally of the globe ’s production .
Biomass is booming .
The planet is the greenest it ’s been in decades , perhaps in centuries .
Until the 1980s , ecologists had no way to systematically track growth in plant matter in every corner of the Earth — the best they could do was analyze small plots of one - tenth of a hectare or less .
The notion of continuously tracking global production to discover the true state of the globe ’s biota was not even considered .
Then , in the 1980s , ecologists realized that satellites could track production , and enlisted NASA to collect the data .
For the first time , ecologists did not need to rely on rough estimates or anecdotal evidence of the health of the ecology :
They could objectively measure the land ’s output and soon did — on a daily basis and down to the last kilometer .
The results surprised Steven Running of the University of Montana and Ramakrishna Nemani of NASA , scientists involved in analyzing the NASA satellite data .
They found that over a period of almost two decades , the Earth as a whole became more bountiful by a whopping 6.2 % .
About 25 % of the Earth ’s vegetated landmass — almost 110 million square kilometres — enjoyed significant increases and only 7 % showed significant declines .
When the satellite data zooms in , it finds that each square metre of land , on average , now produces almost 500 grams of greenery per year .
Why the increase ?
Their 2004 study , and other more recent ones , point to the warming of the planet and the presence of CO2 , a gas indispensable to plant life .
CO2 is nature ’s fertilizer , bathing the biota with its life - giving nutrients .
Plants take the carbon from CO2 to bulk themselves up — carbon is the building block of life — and release the oxygen , which along with the plants , then sustain animal life .
As summarized in a report last month , released along with a petition signed by 32,000 U. S. scientists who vouched for the benefits of CO2 : “ Higher CO2 enables plants to grow faster and larger and to live in drier climates .
Plants provide food for animals , which are thereby also enhanced .
The extent and diversity of plant and animal life have both increased substantially during the past half - century . ”
From the 2004 abstract :
Our results indicate that global changes in climate have eased several critical climatic constraints to plant growth , such that net primary production increased 6 % ( 3.4 petagrams of carbon over 18 years ) globally .
The largest increase was in tropical ecosystems .
Amazon rain forests accounted for 42 % of the global increase in net primary production , owing mainly to decreased cloud cover and the resulting increase in solar radiation .
Lush as the planet may now be , it is as nothing compared to earlier times , when levels of CO2 and Earth temperatures were far higher .
In the age of the dinosaur , for example , CO2 levels may have been five to 10 times higher than today , spurring a luxuriantly fertile planet whose plant life sated the immense animals of that era .
Planet Earth is also much cooler today than during the hothouse era of the dinosaur , and cooler than it was 1,000 years ago during the Medieval Warming Period , when the Vikings colonized a verdant Greenland .
Greenland lost its colonies and its farmland during the Little Ice Age that followed , and only recently started to become green again .
This blossoming Earth could now be in jeopardy , for reasons both natural and man-made .
According to a growing number of scientists , the period of global warming that we have experienced over the past few centuries as Earth climbed out of the Little Ice Age is about to end .
The oceans , which have been releasing their vast store of carbon dioxide as the planet has warmed — CO2 is released from oceans as they warm and dissolves in them when they cool — will start to take the carbon dioxide back .
With less heat and less carbon dioxide , the planet could become less hospitable and less green , especially in areas such as Canada ’s Boreal forests , which have been major beneficiaries of the increase in GPP and NPP .
Doubling the jeopardy for Earth is man .
Unlike the many scientists who welcome CO2 for its benefits , many other scientists and most governments believe carbon dioxide to be a dangerous pollutant that must be removed from the atmosphere at all costs .
Governments around the world are now enacting massive programs in an effort to remove as much as 80 % of the carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere .
If these governments are right , they will have done us all a service .
If they are wrong , the service could be all ill , with food production dropping world wide , and the countless ecological niches on which living creatures depend stressed .
The second order effects could be dire , too .
To bolster food production , humans will likely turn to energy intensive manufactured fertilizers , depleting our store of non-renewable resources .
Techniques to remove carbon from the atmosphere also sound alarms .
Carbon sequestration , a darling of many who would mitigate climate change , could become a top inducer of earthquakes , according to Christian Klose , a geohazards researcher at Columbia University ’s Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory .
Because the carbon sequestration schemes tend to be located near cities , he notes , carbon - sequestration - caused earthquakes could exact an unusually high toll .
Amazingly , although the risks of action are arguably at least as real as the risks of inaction , Canada and other countries are rushing into Earth - altering carbon schemes with nary a doubt .
Environmentalists , who ordinarily would demand a full - fledged environmental assessment before a highway or a power plant can be built , are silent on the need to question proponents or examine alternatives .
Earth is on a roll .
Governments are too .
We will know soon enough if we ’re rolled off a cliff .

" Israel faces an intensified campaign of delegitimisation , demonisation and double standards , " he said .
" Britain has become a hotbed for radical anti-Israeli views and a haven for disingenuous calls for a ' One state solution ' , a euphemistic name for a movement advocating Israel 's destruction . "

The same publisher that distributed the 2004 best - seller that took aim at John Kerry ’s Vietnam service is planning a summer release of what ’s scheduled to be the first critical book on Barack Obama .
Conservative journalist David Freddoso ’s “ The Case Against Barack Obama ” will offer “ a comprehensive , factual look at Obama , ” according to Regnery Publishing president and publisher Marjory Ross .
But the book ’s subtitle makes clear its perspective : “ The Unlikely Rise and Unexamined Agenda of the Media ’s Favorite Candidate . ”
Ross contends that the mainstream media has offered insufficient scrutiny of Obama and likens the goal of Freddoso ’s book to that of “ Unfit for Command , ” the scathing assessment of Kerry ’s war record that rocketed to No. 1 on The New York Times best - seller list .
Call it empathetic astronomy .
Astronomers are suggesting a new approach for finding advanced alien civilizations : look in the areas of the sky where the aliens would have the easiest time detecting us .
Just as human astronomers can only find planets that are lined up just - so with our telescopes , prospective aliens from across the galaxy would have the same problem .
By searching the thin elliptical slice of the sky where hypothetical alien astronomers could have easily detected earth and its habitability , a Johns Hopkins astronomer argues that we 're more likely to find signals from alien civilizations .
Richard Conn
Henry , presented the idea at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society , saying in a release :
those civilizations ... that inhabit star systems that lie close to the plane of the
Earth 's orbit around the sun will be the most motivated to send communications signals toward Earth because those civilizations will surely have detected our annual transit across the face of the sun , telling them that Earth lies in a habitable zone , where liquid water is stable .
Through spectroscopic analysis of our atmosphere , they will know that Earth likely bears life .
Applying the empathetic approach to the search for alien life could focus human efforts on a mere 3 percent of the sky .
Working with this smaller set of targets , Henry , with colleagues at SETI , hope to use the new Allen Telescope Array to search more effectively for signals beamed across the universe by civilizations that stumbled upon the earth and realized our potential .

1983 .
The year of the IBM PC XT , the Apple Lisa , Pioneer 10 leaving the solar system , and Hooters opening up shop in Florida .
It ’s also the birthyear of a 25 year old BSD bug , squashed only a few days ago .
A few days ago , Marc Balmer , OpenBSD developer , received an email from an OpenBSD user .
The email claimed that SAMBA would crash when serving files off an MS - DOS filesystem .
Balmer got into contact with a few SAMBA developers who claimed that SAMBA uses a special workaround in order to function properly on BSD systems : the code for reading directories in all BSDs was flawed .
Understandably , Balmer ’s first reaction was disbelief .
“ Of course my first reaction was to blame Samba , ” he writes .
Despite his initial reaction , he decided to dig deeper into this case , and he uncovered a bug that had been sitting in the code of all BSDs ( including Mac OS X ) , including a lot of old releases .
He confirmed the bug was already in 4.2BSD , released in August of 1983 .
The bug itself ?
Well , I ’m no programmer so the actual code is kind of gibberish to me , but I think I get the gist of the problem .
This code will not work as expected when seeking to the second entry of a block where the first has been deleted : seekdir ( ) calls readdir ( ) which happily skips the first entry ( it has inode set to zero ) , and advance to the second entry .
When the user now calls readdir ( ) to read the directory entry to which he just seekdir ( ) ed , he does not get the second entry but the third .
Marshall Kirk McKusick , the original developer of the * dir ( ) library , commented on the issue in a personal conversation with Balmer :
As the original author of the * dir ( ) library , you probably fixed one of my bugs :-) .
Prior to the * dir ( ) commands , programs just opened , read , and interpreted directories directly .
I had to update a shocking 22 programs ( a large percentage of the programs available on UNIX at the time ) to replace their direct interpretation of directories with the * dir ( ) library calls .
This little bug ’s fix was actually fairly trivial ( as is common with these sorts of long - standing bugs ) :
“ The fix is surprisingly simple , not to say trivial : _readdir_unlocked ( ) must not skip directory entries with inode set to zero when it is called from __seekdir ( ) . ”
“ Sorry that it took us almost twenty - five years to fix it , ” Balmer adds , jokingly .
If the morning and the night had a fight , who 'd win ?
My money 's on mornings .
Nights may be sleeker and , on the face of it , more dangerous , but mornings are definitely harder .
It 's strange that staying up late at night is somehow regarded as " cooler " than getting up at the crack of dawn , when it 's the latter that truly separates the men from the boys .
Any wuss can stay up until 4 am swilling cocktails and jabbering , whereas queuing silently for a bus at 5.30 am in the middle of winter requires a level of genuine grit normally reserved for the likes of the ancient mariner .
At what point , incidentally , does the night officially turn into morning ?
I 'd say , regardless of whether the sun has bothered rising yet or not , the morning only truly starts at the point where you would n't have to apologise to your neighbours if you accidentally set off a bullhorn in your living room .
Somewhere around 8 am , in other words .
Anything earlier than that is just inhumane .
The night / morning divide has been on my mind of late because my current circumstances have required me to become an early riser .
I 'm not a natural morning person .
Left to my own devices , with no work commitments or sense of purpose , my sleeping pattern tends to drift into student mode , ambling further and further past the horizon until it gets to the point where I 'm waking up at 1 pm and hitting the sack around six in the morning .
I eventually become fully nocturnal - like a vampire , but more of a loser , and with markedly less capacity for transforming into a bat and flapping around a castle scaring virgins .
Traditionally , anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves working with me discovers very quickly that there 's little point scheduling meetings first thing in the morning , because I 'll either miss the start by 45 minutes ( then waste another half hour defensively explaining that my alarm did n't go off and so on ) , or turn up bleary - eyed and useless , having stayed awake all night because I was so spooked by the thought of oversleeping .
But all that 's had to change of late .
I 've somehow got into the habit of rising early and , boy , oh boy , it 's an exciting journey into a whole new world .
For one thing , I 've discovered an entire species of human being that I rarely come into contact with : London 's commuters .
Their existence never fails to surprise me .
I 'd always thought of the mornings as essentially uninhabitable , like the planet Mercury .
But no .
I head out the door at 7 am and there they are - actual live people !
- making me jerk with astonishment each time .
It 's like lifting a rock and seeing life unexpectedly teeming below .
Although it 's not actually teeming most of the time .
A lot of it is simply standing around , lined up silently at the bus stop like a sorrowful row of Antony Gormley figurines , suffering one indignity after another .
Cramped conditions , busted LED signs , bursts of syncopated marching interspersed with the occasional frenzied dash , freezing skies , freezing breath , freezing , pissing rain ... their lives are a hilarious cycle of misery .
Or rather , it would be hilarious if I did n't have to join them each morning .
Still , apparently that 's all on the way out .
According to the Economist , thanks to the ongoing technological revolution , the commuter of yesteryear is gradually being replaced by the " urban nomad " of tomorrow .
A combination of burgeoning Wi-Fi access and increasingly smart - arsed gadgetry is making location increasingly irrelevant for many workers : wherever they are , they can still communicate with colleagues , access documents , and type up blisteringly dull reports .
There 's no need to physically head into work , unless you work in a chip shop , and even then scientists are close to cracking a method for frying potatoes via broadband and emailing them direct to your customers ' stomachs .
The upshot of all this being that the early morning commute is set to slowly dissipate from a concentrated frenzy of furrow - browed scampering into a sort of fuzzy , laid - back cloud in which worker bees drift hither and thither , sometimes staying at home , sometimes buzzing round town , touching down in a Starbucks every five minutes to stare at a BlackBerry or something modern like that .
The very notion of geography has been shattered as surely as if someone had written the word " geography " on a plate and hurled it to the floor in a touristy Greek restaurant .
And it 'll be a bit less cramped at the bus stop as a result .
Having conquered space , technology should now set about conquering time .
It 's all very well being able to hold a video conference without leaving your own toilet , but there 's still that pesky need to communicate with people in real time , which means being awake at the same moment they are .
And in my experience other people have an irritating tendency to get up early and stand around tapping their watch .
What I want is a Sky + system for all human interactions , so I can store conversations up and then play them back at a time that suits me , preferably the middle of the night , which is my natural habitat .
But then there are all sorts of things I want that the world of science has yet to deliver .
The real - world Sky + system is just one of them .
There is still no sign of the hovercar , the robot butler , or the pill that tastes like an entire Sunday roast , and I distinctly remember ordering all three way back in 1978 when I was seven years old and capable of soaring optimism .
Now I 'm older , I 'll simply settle for a lie - in .
Such is life .

Demand at food banks in the United States is up 15 percent to 20 percent over last year and many food banks are having difficulty coping , according to America ’s Second Harvest , the largest U.S. food bank provider with 200 in its network .
Food bank networks procure nonperishable and fresh produce from suppliers , then stock it in warehouses before distributing it via a chain of community food banks across the country .
The total number of people who use them is not known but the upward trend is one sign of a U.S. economic downturn in which soaring fuel costs and the rising price of other basic goods have pushed many people on low incomes or without jobs into hardship .
The banks say more people with steady jobs are turning up at their centers to wait in line , fill out forms and collect rations of free or reduced - price food .
In a parallel development demand for government food stamps is also rising .
“ Having a ( low wage ) job is n’t enough anymore .
Having two or three jobs is n’t enough anymore , ” said Marcia Paulson , spokeswoman for Great Plains Food Bank in North Dakota , where nearly half the households receiving food stamp benefits have one or more working adults .
Olga Medina ’s story illustrates the dilemma for many on low wages who said they considered their need to resort to free food a humiliation in a country that prides itself on independence and stresses work as a sure route to success .
Medina works full time providing homecare for old people in Douglas , on Arizona ’s border with Mexico .
She said she earns $ 1,100 dollars a month with which she also supports her parents and a sick son , but is unable to make ends meet due to rising food and fuel costs .
Most weeks she forages for milk , fruit and vegetables in dumpsters outside the Safeway supermarket .
One day last month she waited in line with 147 others outside the Douglas Area Food Bank for a grocery handout because she had no bread .
“ We have to put up with a lot of humiliation just to survive , ” she said , putting on a pair of sunglasses to hide tears .
“ It ’s not dignified but we are hungry and hunger is ugly . ”

PROVIDING FOOD
At a giant warehouse in Monroe , Georgia , scores of volunteers and paid workers using fork lifts or pallet jacks load food onto big trucks -- everything from carrots to frozen spare ribs to canned goods .
The warehouse is part of Angel Food Ministries , a national organization headquartered in Monroe that offers food at half price to people who need it .
A typical food pack contains $ 60 of family groceries and is sold for $ 30 .
The organization , which is linked to a church , purchases food in bulk at a discount and passes the savings on to 500,000 families a month who use its service in 35 states , distributing through a network of churches .
Its founder , Joseph Wingo , argued that perceptions that the U.S. economy was doing better than is reported failed to take into account a different reality for millions of Americans , not least senior citizens .
“ Go into any community that has been devastated by job losses and you will find there ’s more people ( struggling to provide food ) than you think , ” said Wingo , who set up the organization in response to demand in Monroe .
BROKEN DREAMS
For Selena Lewis , 28 , who owns a boutique in Alpharetta , Georgia , going to the North Atlanta Community Food Bank brings an added irony -- just last year she donated some of her money to the bank as an act of charity .
But the downturn has stifled demand at her boutique and some days she makes just a single sale , not enough to pay off debts and feed herself and her son and leading to a dilemma about whether to close the boutique and seek other work .
“ I do n’t want to give up on my dream because the hardest thing to do is to start , ” said Lewis who said she gave up a high - paying corporate marketing job to start the boutique .
Her story illustrates how small business owners are caught up in the downturn , but problems exist at the other end of the spectrum of age and opportunity .
Standing in line at the Douglas food bank was Brenda Salazar , a neatly dressed woman of retirement age , who worked for 25 years as a nursing assistant in the city .
Now disabled , she receives $ 944 a month in benefits and food stamps , but after paying rent , utilities and gassing up her car , she had just $ 16 for food to tide her over .
“ I bought a gallon of milk , I bought a bag of green onions and a bag of grapes .
It was $ 17 .
It was three items ....
Now I have to pray that God will put gas in my car . ”
1 Electromechanical teenager repellant
Howard Stapleton ( Merthyr Tydfil , Wales ) invented an electromechanical teenager repellant — a device that makes annoying high - pitched noise designed to be audible to teenagers but not to adults .
The “ Mosquito ” ultrasonic teenage deterrent aims to solve the problem of unwanted gatherings of youths and teenagers in shopping malls , around shops and anywhere else they are causing problems , claiming to be “ the most effective tool in our fight against anti social behaviour ” .
He later used that same technology to make telephone ringtones that are audible to teenagers but probably not to their teachers .

2 Apparatus for facilitating the birth of a child by centrifugal force
The late George and Charlotte Blonsky ( New York City and San Jose , California ) invented a device ( US Patent # 3,216,423 ) to aid women in giving birth — the woman is strapped onto a circular table , and the table is then rotated at high speed .
In their patent application , Blonsky and Blonsky explained the need : “ In the case of a woman who has a fully developed muscular system and has had ample physical exertion all through the pregnancy , as is common with all more primitive peoples , nature provides all the necessary equipment and power to have a normal and quick delivery .
This is not the case , however , with more civilised women , who often do not have the opportunity to develop the muscles needed in confinement . ”
Therefore , wrote Blonsky and Blonsky , they would provide “ an apparatus which will assist the under - equipped woman by creating a gentle , evenly distributed , properly directed , precision - controlled force , that acts in unison with and supplements her own efforts ” .
The Blonskys explained : “ The foetus needs the application of considerable propelling force . ”
They knew how to supply that propelling force .
The rest of their patent – eight very detailed pages altogether – specifies exactly how to do it .
The design includes some 125 basic components , including bolts , brakes , wing nuts , a massive concrete floor slab , a vari- speed vertical gear motor , a speed reducer , more wing nuts , sheaves , stretchers , shafts , thigh members , a butt plate , aluminium ballast water boxes , more wing nuts , pillow clamps , a girdle member , and some additional wing nuts .

4 Dog - to - human language translation device
Keita Sato , President of Takara Co. , Dr. Matsumi Suzuki , President of Japan Acoustic Lab , and Dr. Norio Kogure , Executive Director , Kogure Veterinary Hospital , invented Bow - Lingual , a computer - based automatic dog - to - human language translation device .
The Bow - Lingual ’s a two - piece set — a wireless microphone that attaches to your dog ’s collar , and a walkie - talkie - looking handset with an LCD screen .
Barks and yelps are transmitted to the handset , where their voiceprint is analyzed and placed into one of six emotional categories : happy , sad , on guard , frustrated , needy , or assertive .
Once the appropriate emotional state is determined , the Bow - Lingual randomly selects a phrase belonging to that category and displays it on the screen .
So if your pooch is determined to be on guard , maybe you ’ll get “ Are you my friend or my enemy ? ”
If aggressive , perhaps the sentiment will be “ I ’m dominant . ”
You get the drift .

5 Alarm Clock that runs away from you
Gauri Nanda ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) invented “ Clocky ” , an alarm clock that runs away and hides if you do n’t get out of bed on time .
When the alarm sounds you can snooze one time .
If you still do n’t wake up , Clocky will jump off of the bedside table , and wheel away , mindlessly bumping into objects until he finds a spot to rest .
You ’ll have to get up and out of bed to silence his alarm .
Clocky will find new spots everyday , kind of like a hide - and - seek game .

6 Artificial replacement testicles for dogs
Gregg A. Miller ( Oak Grove , Missouri ) , invented “ Neuticles ” , testicular implants for pets .
Many caring pet owners hesitate or even to refuse to neuter their pets , soNeuticles eliminates ‘ neuter - hesitant ’ concerns – as a ‘ Neuticled ’ pet looks exactly the same after surgery .
Neuticles are available for canines , felines , equine , bulls or any pet which is neutered .
Neuticles should be implanted when the pet is neutered - but can be implanted years afterwards in most cases .

8 Washing machine for cats and dogs
The co-inventors of the Lavakan , Eduardo Segura and Andrés Diaz , decided in 1998 that their dogs deserved the same treatment that humans get from a shower massage .
The side - loading automatic pet washing machine , is safer and less stressful for the animals than washing them by hand .
It soaps , rinses and dries dogs and cats in less than half an hour .
It has a series of conical nozzles that wash and massage beasts from every direction , while dirty and soapy waste is filtered through a hose at the bottom .
Operators use the Lavakan ’s touch panel to choose the best wash cycle for the animal ’s size and dermatological needs .
Pesticide soaps , for example , require an extended wait period to kill fleas and ticks .

9 Software that detects cats walking across the keyboard
Chris Niswander ( Tucson , Arizona ) invented PawSense .
When cats walk or climb on your keyboard , they can enter random commands and data , damage your files , and even crash your computer .
This can happen whether you are near the computer or have suddenly been called away from it .
PawSense is a software utility that helps protect your computer from cats .
It quickly detects and blocks cat typing , and also helps train your cat to stay off the computer keyboard .

10 Automobile burglar alarm consisting of a detection circuit and a flamethrower
Charl Fourie and Michelle Wong ( Johannesburg , South Africa ) invented an automobile burglar alarm consisting of a detection circuit and a flamethrower , to provide a deterrent to carjackings .
With a rising crime rate , carjackings became a serious concern in South Africa .
The Blaster car modification functions as a liquified petroleum gas flamethrower ; when a carjacking occurrs , the driver steps on an additional pedal next to accelerator and flames erupt from outer sides of both front doors , “ neutralizing ” the assailant .
The inventor claims it is unlikely to kill but would “ definitely blind ” the assailant .
In South Africa , it is legal to use lethal force in self - defense if in fear of ones life , and ownership of flamethrowers is unrestricted .

When most people today hear the word “ lesson , ” they usually do n’t think of it as a good thing .
Teaching a lesson may be looked at as being bossy or perhaps a know - it - all .
While having learned a lesson may be viewed as a sign of weakness .
However , learning lessons is far from being weak .
In fact , George Washington once said , “ We ought not to look back unless it is derive useful lessons from past errors and for the purpose of profiting by dear bought experience . ”
Well said , sir .
Without further ado , here ’s the list :
In order to save you some time , starting next week and continuing each week , I ’m going to highlight one of the lessons that you can focus on throughout the week .
Until then , why not send me a note and tell me about the lessons you ’ve learned along the way .
I ’ll add the good ones to this list .

Serial entrepreneur Michael Robertson is embroiled in a legal fight against the recording business - and not for the first time .
His MP3 Tunes locker service has raised the ire of EMI in a case that continues this week .
But is n't it weird , he asks , how the Big Four divvy up the litigation against music start - ups between them so neatly ?
Robertson 's current fight is over a service that 's not too dissimilar to a feature of his MP3.com start - up , called MyMP3.com .
That allowed users to make a digital copy of a CD they had legally purchased online .
A court decided this was n't covered by fair use , and MP3.com lost the case against Universal , which later bought out the company .
This time , Robertson shot first : suing EMI in September .
EMI counter - sued two months later .
MP3tunes automatically syncs your iTunes or WMP collection online .
" They 're playing tough and mean and nasty , " he says .
" There are five safe harbour provisions in the DMCA .
The third one ( 512c ) says that if you 're storing the file at the direction of the user , you 're exempt .
That 's exactly what we do . "
On the other hand , 512c is what covers Google 's YouTube service - and Google has vowed to clean up the service from infringing material .
But Robertson says there 's no sharing , in contrast to other services .
" You can't play music out of a locker , and there 's no anonymous access or wink - wink nudge - nudge sharing where we look the other way .
Xdrive - pick anyone - everyone has anonymous access where you can share it with the world .
" Here 's how I like to think about this .
Our business is the delivery of the music .
You have it at home and play it at work .
The labels never thought about the delivery .
" The business we 're in , the distribution business , does n't have to be a threat .
It could be a best friend to the retail side .
We can be your best partner . "
All good points .
I thought what the labels feared was what Robertson might do , once everyone had a digital locker .
In that sense , it was like the book authors and publishers litigation against Google Books .
But Robertson has noticed something that we had n't noticed before .
Which is quite spooky .
Scottsdale speed cameras snapped pictures of two people inside a Goodyear murder victim 's car and police want to know who they are .
Goodyear police said the photos were taken about the time 29 - year - old Josue Montero , of Phoenix , went missing .
He was found fatally shot with his hands bound March 17 in a desert area south of Westar Drive and east of Rainbow Valley Road .
The pictures show two people , an unidentified male and female , inside Montero 's grey 2006 Chevy HHR , with license plate 785 - ZRD .
Goodyear police said they are asking for the public 's help in identifying both people .
Police want to question both people about how they got a hold of the victim 's vehicle .
Anyone with information is asked to contact Goodyear police at 623-932-1220 .
The makers of Airborne — a multivitamin and herbal supplement whose labels and ads falsely claimed that the product cures and prevents colds — will refund money to consumers who bought the product , as part of a $ 23.3 million class action settlement agreement .
The company will pay for ads in Better Homes & Gardens , Parade , People , Newsweek , and many other magazines and newspapers instructing consumers how to get refunds .
Concocted by second - grade teacher Victoria Knight McDowell and her screenwriter husband Thomas Rider McDowell , Airborne promised to “ boost your immune system to help your body combat germs ” and instructed users to “ take it at the first sign of a cold symptom or before entering crowded , potentially germ - infested environments . ”
The company ’s folksy “ created by a school teacher ! ” slogan and insistence that the product be stocked with real cold , cough , and flu medicines instead of with dietary supplements , helped turn the company into an overnight success , as did an appearance by Victoria Knight McDowell on the Oprah Winfrey Show .
But in February 2006 , ABC News revealed on Good Morning America that Airborne ’s much - touted lone clinical trial was actually conducted without any doctors or scientists , just a “ two - man operation started up just to do the Airborne study . ”
Soon after the plaintiff notified Airborne of his intent to file suit in March 2006 , the company stopped mentioning the study and began toning down the overt cold - curing claims in favor of vague “ immunity boosting ” language .
Next , in 2007 , the Federal Trade Commission and a group of state attorneys general began investigating the various “ cold busting ” claims that Airborne has made since its launch in 1999 .
Those investigations are continuing .
Airborne ’s basic formula contains Vitamins A , C , and E , as well as other nutrients common in multivitamins ; the amino acids glutamine and lysine , and an “ herbal extract proprietary blend . ”
CSPI cautions that Airborne may provide too much vitamin A , since just two pills provide 10,000 IU — the maximum safe level for a day — and the package directs customers to take three per day .
In addition to several flavors of the original formula , other Airborne products include “ Power Pixies , ” an artificially sweetened powder version for children ; Airborne Seasonal , which is described as a “ non- drowsy formula containing a nutritional blend which promotes normal histamine levels ” ; Airborne On - the - Go ; and Airborne Nighttime .
“ There ’s no credible evidence that what ’s in Airborne can prevent colds or protect you from a germy environment , ” said CSPI senior nutritionist David Schardt , who reviewed Airborne ’s claims .
“ Airborne is basically an overpriced , run - of - the - mill vitamin pill that ’s been cleverly , but deceptively , marketed . ”
Consumers seeking refunds for purchases of Airborne can obtain a claim form by writing to the Airborne Class Action Settlement Administrator , PO Box 1897 , Faribault , MN 55021-7152 , calling 1-888-952-9080 , or by visiting www.AirborneHealthSettlement.com.
The class plaintiff was represented by California law firms which asked the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest ’s litigation project to join as co-counsel in late 2006 for its expertise in nutrition and labeling lawsuits .
U.S. District Court Judge Virginia A. Phillips of the Central District of California gave preliminary approval to the settlement on November 29 .
“ This was a great opportunity for CSPI to participate in a major lawsuit against one of the biggest supplement frauds in the country , ” said CSPI ’s Litigation Director Stephen Gardner .
Created in 2005 , CSPI ’s litigation unit has successfully negotiated settlements that have resulted in improved food marketing and labeling practices .
In June , CSPI struck a settlement agreement with Kellogg that resulted in nutrition standards for the foods that company markets to young children .
CSPI has negotiated settlements that resulted in improved labeling or marketing of products made by Frito - Lay , Pinnacle Foods , Procter & Gamble , Quaker Oats and others .
CSPI is currently pursuing litigation against Coca - Cola over its so - called “ calorie burning ” drink Enviga ; Burger King , over its use of artificial trans fat ; and Anheuser - Busch and Miller over their illegal marketing of alcoholic “ energy ” drinks .
The IMB ’s records are a litany of brutality .
Last year pirates who attacked a Danish tanker off the coast of Nigeria tied up the bosun and threatened to cut off his ears unless he told them the code for the locks on the cargo control room .
In another attack off the Nigerian coast , a Panamanian tug boat was boarded by five men who approached in a small fast boat .
The pirates rounded up the crew on the bridge , smashed a bottle over the master ’s head and forced each crew member to hand over their belongings .
Security is Mathematics
In a recent editorial in Wired News , Bruce Schneier commented on the twisted mind of security professionals ; that is , the way that we look at the world , always questioning hidden assumptions -- like the assumption that someone who buys an ant farm will mail in the included card asking to have a tube of ants delivered to his own address , rather than someone else 's address .
Schneier suggests that this " particular way of looking at the world " is very difficult to train -- far more difficult than the domain expertise relevant to security .
I respectfully differ :
In my opinion , this mindset is not particular to security professionals ; and universities have been successfully training people to hold this mindset for centuries .
In the fall of 1995 , in my second year as an undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University , I took a course numbered ' Math 242 ' , with the title " Introduction to Analysis " .
This was ( and still is ) a required course for mathematics undergraduates , and for very good reason ; it is often described as " the course which decides if you 're going to get a degree in Mathematics " , and is the first undergraduate course which takes mathematical rigor seriously .
Remember in first - year calculus where the topics of sequences , series , convergence , continuity of functions , and limits were glossed over ?
This is the course where you learn to prove everything you thought you already knew .
In the semester I took this course , the average grade on the first mid-term examination was 29 % .
Three students ( myself included ) , out of a class of about 40 , scored higher than 50 % .
I do n't know exact numbers for other semesters , but my understanding is that grade distribution was n't particularly unusual .
Why was the average grade so low ?
Because the entire mid-term examination consisted of writing proofs ; and a proof is n't correct unless it considers all possible cases .
Forgot to prove that a limit exists before computing what it must be ?
Your proof is wrong .
Assumed that your continuous function was uniformly continuous ?
Your proof is wrong .
Jumped from having proven that a function is continuous to assuming that it is differentiable ?
Your proof is wrong .
Made even the slightest unwarranted assumption , even if what you ended up thinking that you had proved was true ?
Sorry , your proof is wrong .
This is what Schneier calls the " security mindset " -- and all mathematicians have it .
In the first chapter of my doctoral thesis , I devoted a page to proving a lemma concerning the distribution of primes ( namely , that between x and x * ( 1 + 2 / log(x ) ) there are at least x / log(x ) ^2 primes , i.e. , at least half of the " expected " number ) .
I did n't do this merely because I liked the notion of citing a paper concerning the distribution of zeroes of the Riemann zeta function in a thesis about string matching ( although I admit that I found the juxtaposition appealing ) ; rather , I did it because I could n't prove an error bound on my randomized algorithm without this lemma .
Most computer scientists would have waved their hands and made the common assumption that prime numbers " behave randomly " ; but with my mathematical training , I wanted a proof which did n't rely on extraneous assumptions .
Knuth is famous for the remark " Beware of bugs in the above code ; I have only proved it correct , not tried it " , and the implicit statement that a proof - of - correctness is not adequate to ensure that code will operate correctly is one I absolutely agree with ; however , it is important to consider the nature of bugs which evade the eye of a proof - writer .
These bugs -- and , I posit , the potential bugs which Knuth was warning against -- tend to be errors in transmitting ideas from brain to keyboard : Missing a semicolon or parenthesis , for example , and thereby rendering the code uncompilable ; or mixing up two variable names , and thereby causing the code to never function as specified .
These bugs are easily found by quite minimal testing ; so while neither testing nor proving is particularly effective alone , in combination they are highly effective .
More importantly than this , however , is that the sort of edge cases which mathematicians are trained to think about in writing a proof are exactly the sort which cause most security issues .
Very few security problems " in the wild " are the result of bugs which are tripped over all the time -- such bugs do n't survive long enough to cause problems for security .
Rather , security issues arise when an unanticipated rare occurrence -- say , an exceptionally large input , a file which is corrupted , or a network connection which is closed at exactly the wrong time -- takes place .
For this reason , when I write security - critical code I generally construct a proof as I go along ; I do n't go to the extent of writing down said proof , but by thinking about how I would prove that the code is correct , I force myself to think about all of the edge cases which might be potentially hazardous .
Schneier is right that security requires a strange mindset ; and he 's right that computer science departments are n't good places to teach this mindset .
But he 's wrong in thinking that it can't be taught :
If you want someone to understand security , just send him to a university mathematics department for four years .

Indeed , some venture capitalists are arguing that the pipeline for public offerings has dried up in part because of the considerable shift in the industry ’s interest in the last three years into “ green ” technologies , which was taking time to bear fruit .
But Paul Kedrosky , an investor and the author of Infectious Greed , a venture capital - centric blog , said that there were deeper , more systemic problems for venture capitalists in addition to the cyclical challenges .
He said part of the problem was that the industry was backing companies that lack widespread investor appeal , like YouTube clones and dating and social networking sites .
“ There is nothing that the industry is producing that investors want , ” Mr. Kedrosky said .
“ The stuff they ’re investing in is idiosyncratic  it ’s fun and appealing to them but Wall Street does n’t care . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday threw out the record $ 2.5 billion in punitive damages that Exxon Mobil Corp had been ordered to pay for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska , the nation ’s worst tanker spill .

The U.S. Supreme Court overturned on Wednesday the $ 2.5 billion in punitive damages that Exxon Mobil was to have paid for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska .

By a 5 - 3 vote , the high court ruled that the punitive damages award should be slashed to a maximum amount equal to the total relevant compensatory damages of $ 507.5 million .
The justices overturned a ruling by a U.S. Court of Appeals that had awarded the record punitive damages to about 32,000 commercial fishermen , Alaska natives , property owners and others harmed by the spill .
In the majority opinion , Justice David Souter concluded the $ 2.5 billion in punitive damages was excessive under federal maritime law , and should be cut to the amount of actual harm .
Soaring oil prices have propelled Exxon Mobil to previously unforeseen levels of profitability in recent years ; the company posted earnings of $ 40.6 billion in 2007 .
It took Exxon Mobil just under two days to bring in $ 2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2007 .
The Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground in Alaska ’s Prince William Sound in March 1989 , spilling about 11 million gallons of crude oil .
The spill spread oil to more than 1,200 miles of coastline , closed fisheries and killed thousands of marine mammals and hundreds of thousands of sea birds .
A federal jury in Alaska awarded $ 5 billion in punitive damages in 1994 .
A federal judge later reduced the punitive damages to $ 4.5 billion , and the appeals court further cut it to $ 2.5 billion .
Exxon Mobil , the largest U.S. company by market capitalization , then appealed to the Supreme Court .
Souter rejected Exxon Mobil ’s argument that the federal clean water law ’s water pollution penalties preempt punitive damage awards in maritime spill cases .
But he sided with the company in slashing the award .
“ We ... hold that the federal statutory law does not bar a punitive award on top of damages for economic loss , but that the award here should be limited to an amount equal to compensatory damages , ” he said .
In Irving , Texas , Rex Tillerson , Exxon Mobil ’s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement , “ The Valdez oil spill was a tragic accident and one which the corporation deeply regrets . ”
“ We know this has been a very difficult time for everyone involved .
We have worked hard over many years to address the impacts of the spill and to prevent such accidents from happening in our company again , ” he said .
‘ SLAP ON THE WRIST ’
In Alaska , Tim Joyce , mayor of the Prince William Sound town of Cordova , where most of the area ’s fishing fleet is concentrated , said , “ Instead of taking a large corporation to the woodshed , they just gave them a slap on the wrist . ”
Compared to Exxon ’s billions of dollars of quarterly profit , “ $ 500 million , that ’s lost in the rounding , ” he said .
“ A lot of people had their whole lives ruined because of this . ”
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin also denounced the ruling and said , “ The court gutted the jury ’s decision on punitive damages . ”
A joint statement from Alaska ’s congressional delegation said , “ Today ’s ruling adds insult to injury to the fishermen , communities and Alaska natives who have been waiting nearly 20 years for proper compensation following the worst environmental disaster in our nation ’s history . ”
Tom Donohue , president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , said : “ This is good news for companies concerned about reining in excessive punitive damages . ”
The business group said the ruling could have an impact far beyond federal maritime law .
Company lawyers had called the $ 2.5 billion the largest punitive damage award ever affirmed by a federal appellate court -- larger than the total of all punitive damage awards upheld by federal appellate courts in U.S. history .
The case was decided by eight Supreme Court members .
The ninth , Justice Samuel Alito , who owns Exxon Mobil stock , recused himself from the case .
Dissenting Justices John Paul Stevens , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer would have upheld the award .
Stevens and Ginsburg said Congress , not the court , should set limits on punitive damages under maritime law .
Breyer said this was no ordinary reckless behavior case .
RELAPSED ALCOHOLIC
“ The jury could reasonably have believed that Exxon knowingly allowed a relapsed alcoholic repeatedly to pilot a vessel filled with millions of gallons of oil through waters that provided the livelihood for the many plaintiffs in this case , ” he said .
“ Given that conduct , it was only a matter of time before a crash and spill like this occurred , ” Breyer said .
Exxon has not set aside any legal reserves for possible damages as the company has argued that it was not possible to predict the ultimate outcome .
The ruling will likely take a small bite out of upcoming earnings .
Immediately after the ruling was announced , Exxon Mobil shares dropped around 80 cents , or just less than 1 percent .
But the company ’s shares later recovered and closed up 68 cents at $ 87.60 on the New York Stock Exchange .
The ruling could create a new public relations challenge for Exxon , which is already facing heat from Congress and consumers because of high gasoline prices .
“ They are already being vilified in the news because of their profits , ” said Argus Research analyst Phil Weiss , who said the company ’s tenacious legal defense was good for its shareholders .
“ But if I ’m a consumer who does n’t own Exxon stock and does n’t care about Exxon stock , I ’m looking at the money I ’m paying to put gas in my tank and thinking ‘ Here they are , taking advantage of somebody else , ’ ” Weiss said .
Sadly , we 'll never know if Jimi Hendrix would have been any good at Guitar Hero , but thanks to Activision , the game 's developers , we now have a reasonable idea of what he'd have looked like wielding its dedicated controller .
To celebrate the fact that there will be two Guitar Hero performances on the main stage at this year 's Isle of Wight Festival , Activision has re-branded the bronze statue of Hendrix that sits in the grounds of the island 's Dimbola Lodge , turning Jimi 's guitar into the aforementioned video game peripheral .
Hendrix played the festival in 1970 .
His performance was plagued by technical problems - at one point , he told the crowd to go and buy hot dogs rather than listen to him - but has become legendary because it turned out to be one of his last .
Of course , Hendrix purists might argue that associating him with the Guitar Hero franchise borders on the sacrilegious , but given how popular the game has become , they 'd possibly be in the minority .

Link of the day - the most amazing flash cards you ’ll ever see
What links a tourist who lost 84 kilograms of Bombay mix on holiday with another who had his camera stolen by a monkey ?
Both are among the more unusual claims received by travel insurance companies .
Times
Money has trawled through the files of some of the UK ’s biggest insurers to bring you the 25 most bizarre travel insurance claims ever .
1 . One thing you do n’t expect when you go on holiday is to be harassed by a monkey .
One British traveller in Gibraltar , however , was so besieged by the attentions of an over - friendly primate that he asked his insurer to refund the cost of his trip .
The insurer refused but did pay out for his camera , which the monkey had run off with one evening .
2. Monkeys also blighted the romantic getaway of a couple in Malaysia , who foolishly left the window to their chalet open during the day .
They returned to find their underwear , clothing and belongings strewn across the resort and neighbouring rainforest .
Luckily for the clothes - less couple , their insurer paid the claim .
3 . One unlucky pensioner managed to lose his false teeth after throwing up over the side of a cruise ship on the choppy seas of the Bay of Biscay .
Thankfully for the squeamish septuagenarian , his misplaced dentures were covered in his travel insurance policy under lost baggage , so his claim was paid .
4 . Another unfortunate pensioner had to make an even more embarrassing travel claim after a stroll on the deck of a cruise ship went disastrously wrong .
The poor gentlemen was chatting with friends when a strong gust of wind lifted his toupee off his head and blew it into the sea .
He never got over the shame but at least his travel policy reimbursed the cost of his hairpiece .
5 . It is all too easy to lose your sunglasses , or even your passport , on holiday .
Less easy , you might think , to misplace 34 large bags of Bombay mix .
Yet one holidaymaker claimed he had lost £ 300 - worth of the spicy snack while in Europe .
At roughly 89 p for a 250g bag , the misplaced mix would have weighed a hefty 84 kilograms .
Needless to say , his insurance company turned him down .
6 . It is a good idea to keep your wallet secure at all times when you are away , as one careless Briton discovered to his cost in Israel .
The holidaymaker accidentally dropped his wallet down a drain in Natanya .
However , his claim was n’t for his lost credit cards or cash .
It was for hospital treatment after being stung by a poisonous scorpion while reaching down into the drain to get his possessions back .
Thankfully , his travel insurance covered the cost of treatment .
7 . A holidaymaker in Spain lost his camera after setting it down beside him on a park bench .
The strap , hanging tantalisingly down over the edge of the seat , caught the attention of a passing dog , which grabbed it and ran off with the camera .
His insurer paid for a new camera under accidental damage .
8 . One family camping in a remote field in Wales had their peace disturbed when a parachutist from a nearby airbase missed his target and scored a direct hit , landing on their tent and destroying their camping equipment .
Sadly , the family were n’t covered for accidental damage so their insurer did n’t reimburse them .
9 . It ’s every parent ’s nightmare .
Your children are playing on the beach and they think it would be fun to bury your camcorder worth £ 600 .
Thankfully , when this happened to a family in Cornwall , their insurer saw the funny side and refunded the cost .
10 .
Police in a holiday resort in France were on the lookout for a wrinkle - free burglar after a woman who had her cosmetics bag stolen from her hotel room admitted that she had transferred medical - strength haemorrhoid cream into an empty tub of moisturiser earlier in the holiday .
Her claim for make - up , lotions and perfume was paid .
11 . A holidaymaker who was refused entry to a plane at Manchester Airport had his travel - insurance claim for holiday cancellation declined after it emerged that he had actually booked a flight from Manchester , New Hampshire , USA .
12 . Mis-reading your flight details is easy to do , usually necessitating a frantic rush to the departure gate .
But one family that turned up late for their flight had no such panic .
Their plane had departed the previous month .
They were denied compensation from their travel insurer .
13 . A holidaymaker who arrived in a ski resort only to find that there was not enough snow , claimed for the cost of the brand new skis she had bought before leaving the UK .
Unsurprisingly , the insurer rejected her claim .
14 . A man walking along the street in Greece became so transfixed by two bikini - clad girls that he walked straight into a glass - panelled bus shelter and broke his nose .
He successfully claimed on his travel insurance for his hospital bills .
15 .
The fairytale wedding day for a British couple on a West Indian beach went up in smoke after the bride ’s dress caught fire from a brick of coal that fell from the BBQ .
The quick - thinking groom picked up his now blazing bride , ran along the beach and tossed her into the ocean .
They were able to claim on their travel insurance policy for the ruined wedding outfits as they had taken out wedding cover before jetting off .
16 . Another couple stayed in a Parisian hotel room infested with fleas .
After two days of itching and scratching , the pair cut their trip short and returned home , where they hastily burnt all their clothes on a bonfire .
However , their claims for replacement wardrobe were rejected .
17 . A traveller who lost his bag on holiday claimed only for its contents : a bottle of water , a newspaper and a packet of mints .
With an excess on his insurance policy of £ 50 , his claim was rejected .
18 . When you ’re holidaying in the Black Forest , it ’s not thieves that you need to watch out for .
One family left the door to their chalet open and came home to find that their wallets and passports had been eaten by a greedy goat , who had also chomped through some sandwiches that had been sitting on the kitchen table .
The family ’s claim for cost of new passports and wallets was rejected .
19 . Sometimes Dads do n’t always know best .
A resourceful father whisked his teenage daughter to a local hairdresser , after she frazzled her hair on the oven in their holiday apartment in Spain .
The result was hardly the work of Mr Toni and Mr Guy , leaving the girl running in tears from the salon .
The dad tried , but failed , to claim the cost of the disastrous haircut from his insurance policy .
20 .
A chilled - out traveller in Sri Lanka needed £ 400 worth of hospital treatment after a large , ripe coconut fell from a tree and landed squarely on her head while she was peacefully reading below .
She was knocked out cold , which is hardly surprising .
Fresh coconuts weigh roughly 2 kilograms , and the trees grow up to 30 metres tall .
The coconut would have been falling at 53 miles per hour when it hit the poor woman on the skull .
Her insurer covered her medical expenses .
21 . Meanwhile Direct Line received a claim for two lost coconuts from a couple who returned home from a holiday in Mauritius .
As a coconut costs just 69 p ( from your local Tesco ) , the claim was rejected .
The couple ’s excess on their policy meant they would have paid for the first £ 50 of the cost of any claim .
22 . A customer submitted a claim for a “ guitar made out of a pumpkin ” .
The slightly baffled staff at Direct Line were forced to reject the claim .
23 .
The clue was in neon lights above the door .
A young party animal in Greece got badly burnt when she tried to order a cocktail in local hangout called “ Fire Bar ” .
Ignoring the loud warning buzzer , and the disappearance of her fellow drinkers , she stood firmly at the bar waiting to be served when it suddenly became engulfed in flames .
She received third degree burns to her hands , and successfully claimed £ 300 worth of medical expenses .
24 . A British backpacker was chased down the street by an angry bull in Kerala , Southern India .
It was n’t clear from his claim whether he provoked the animal , but he did require £ 2,800 worth of hospital treatment after the attack , which was reimbursed by his travel insurer .
25 . Finally , according to one long - serving insurance underwriter , there have been more Rolex Oyster watches , worth upwards of £ 1,000 , recorded as lost in the Costa Del Sol in the Spain than have ever been manufactured .

THE Macintosh has a lot to answer for .
The first time your correspondent clapped eyes on its graphical user interface ( GUI ) , he realised the game was up .
The use of icons instead of written words seemed the final admission that we had given up trying to read and write , and had entered a post - literate age .
The Apple Macintosh was n't the first computer to have a GUI based on windows , icons , menus and pointing devices ( known collectively as “ wimp ” ) .
Back in the early 1970s , Xerox pioneered most of the wimp features with its legendary Alto personal computer for researchers , and later its Star computer for office use .
But Apple brought the dumbed - down pictorial interface to the rest of the world .
And once Microsoft followed suit , by grafting a friendly Windows face on its crusty old MS - DOS operating system , it became the norm .
Why Johnny can't read
No question , without a wimpy GUI , computers would never have become as popular as they are today .
The command - line interface — with its forbidding prompt and blinking cursor — required mastering a whole catechism of arcane instructions that only a priesthood of computerdom could cherish .
When “ root@computername : ~ # shutdown -h now ” could be replaced by a simple click of a mouse to switch off a computer , novices of all ages and backgrounds could climb aboard the digital bandwagon .
The flight from literacy to digiracy did n't stop there .
The printed word has fought a rear - guard action against not only computers and television , but also a whole horde of digital upstarts from DVDs and video games to mobile phones , iPods , YouTube and now the mobile internet .
Meanwhile , newspapers , magazines and books have faded to shadows of their former selves , as a post - literate generation finds its facts and fun elsewhere .
According to Mark Bauerlein , an English professor at Emory University and author of “ The Dumbest Generation ” , leisure reading among American 15 - to - 17 - year - olds fell from 18 minutes a day in 1981 to seven in 2003 .
Electronic media , of one sort or another , now occupy every spare moment .
Mr Bauerlein fears that , far from opening new vistas for learning and awareness , digital technology has fostered a level of public ignorance that now threatens not just our competitive wellbeing but our democracy as well .
To some extent , government statistics bear him out .
Proficiency scores in reading , writing , science and mathematics for American teenagers in their last year of high school all fell between 1992 and 2005 .
Only one in three children left high school able to read proficiently .
Only one in four could write a coherent paragraph .
Cultural observers bemoan the way electronic media — with their demand for spectacle and brevity — have shortened our attention spans .
But as a blogger on Eastgate.com noted recently , that equates brevity with debased taste , and sees patience for long stories as a mark of high culture .
But if brevity is to be deplored , what should we make of haiku , sonnets , and ink - brush calligraphy ?
On the other side of the coin , lengthy sagas are not the sole prerogative of the literary elite .
Pop culture has its share of huge tales — witness the Harry Potter canon .
Indeed , for every pared - down presentation pumped out by the electronic media , an engaging narrative can be found .
None more so than Michael Straczynski's television masterpiece , “ Babylon 5 ” — a single narrative , conceived , written and produced essentially by one person , spanning 80 hours of performance spread over five years .
That 's the equivalent of 40 full - length feature films , or a handful of books by Dickens .
Literacy may be under attack from electronic media , but that 's actually nothing new .
In fact , the assault on the written word began not with the Macintosh computer in 1984 , but with Samuel Morse 's demonstration of the telegraph in 1844 — an innovation a colleague on The Economist insists , quite correctly , on calling the “ Victorian internet ” .
In an essay on why Johnny and Janey can't read ( and why Mr and Ms Smith can't teach ) , Mark Federman of the McLuhan Programme in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto , argued that the telegraph was the first to “ undo ” the effects of the written word .
Where the phonetic alphabet separated the sound of a word from its meaning ; and encoded that sound in symbols we call letters ; and combined those symbols into hierarchical groupings called words , sentences , paragraphs and , ultimately , books ; the telegraph recombined those symbols with sound — enabling the instantaneous transmission of information from person to person across vast distances .
If the telegraph was the starting point , Mr Federman reckons we are probably half way through a 300 - year transition out of the world of mass literacy .
That world began when Johannes Gutenberg introduced the printing press in 1455 , and gave birth along the way to the Reformation , the Age of Reason , the Enlightenment , the Scientific Method , and finally the Industrial Revolution — not to mention the modern era of newspapers , universal education and , yes , mass literacy .
Why 300 years ?
Because that 's how long it takes to reform social institutions .
It 's the period needed for a generation to cease hearing about the way things used to be done from great - grandparents , who had heard about such things from their own great - grandparents .
So , where in this brave new world of post - literacy are we heading ?
Er , not sure ...
What little we know is that our sources of trusted wisdom are eroding fast .
When academics pay to have their findings published , invent results or ignore conflicting data to keep a sponsor 's money flowing , it 's hard to view our learned institutions as sources of reliable information .
Nowadays , we seem to put greater faith in the wisdom of crowds .
Hence our trust of Google , which ranks a web page by how many other pages are linked to it , and how many other searchers view the page in question .
In doing so , we prize the confidence of our peers above that of experts .
In Mr Federman 's view , the quest for truth has given way to the quest for making sense of the world as experienced .
For anyone under the age of 20 , the world being experienced is one where the internet has always existed , and where everyone who matters is only a click , speed dial or text message away .
“ Tomorrow 's adults , ” says Mr Federman , “ live in a world of ubiquitous connectivity and pervasive proximity . ”
Their direct experience of the world is wholly different from yours or mine .
So , no surprise that when we incarcerate teenagers of today in traditional classroom settings , they react with predictable disinterest and flunk their literacy tests .
They are skilled in making sense not of a body of known content , but of contexts that are continually changing .
Teachers must recognise that our pedagogical tools are inconsistent with the skills needed to survive in a world where people are always connected to everyone and everything .
In such a world , learning to think for oneself could well be more important than simply learning to read and write .

Example species are rats and cockroaches , which survive well in human habitats .
But Klein is most interested in crows : they do n't just survive , they thrive in human environments , even using human technology to feed themselves .
Klein discusses crows creating and using tools , using human fishing gear , using cars to open nuts , and much more .
Okay , so Klein demonstrates that crows are smart .
But what can we do with this information ?
Watch his ten -minute talk to learn how Klein used Skinnerian training to create a " Crow Vending Machine " in which crows exchange lost coins for peanuts .
Read more about Klein 's crow vending machine at his website .
No word yet on whether he 's rich from all that spare change .
# InklusionsSportpark für Berlin ! Ein Sportpark für ALLE !
Die bunte und vielfältige Sportmetropole Berlin braucht einen offenen Sportpark für ALLE , den Sportler * innen , Zuschauer * innen , Mitarbeiter * innen und Anwohner * innen umfassend barrierefrei nutzen können .

Der Berliner Senat , das Abgeordnetenhaus und die Bezirksämter Pankow und Mitte sollen Folgendes bei der Umsetzung des Bauvorhabens zum Inklusions Sportpark berücksichtigen : 1 . Mehr Sportflächen für den organisierten Sport und den Individualsport durch Umgestaltung der gesamten Sportanlage und den Neubau des Stadions schaffen : Verbesserung der Trainings - und Wettkampfflächen für die bereits vor Ort existierenden Sportarten Fußball , Hockey , Basketball , Tennis , Beachvolleyball , Volleyball , Schach , Leichtathletik , Gymnastik , Gewichtheben , Kraftsport .

2.000 barrierefreien Zuschauerplätzen , u.a. für den Rollstuhl- , Frauen- , Kinder - und Jugend - Basketball und andere Ballsportarten auf regionalem , nationalem und internationalem Niveau .
Der zweite Sporthallen - Neubau soll primär als „ Forschungshalle für Inklusionssport ” dienen .
2 . Schaffung des „ Kompetenzzentrum für InklusionsSport ( KIsS ) " für die inklusive Aus- und Weiterbildung von Übungsleiter * innen und Sportlehrer * innen , insb . auch von Menschen mit Behinderungen .
Das KIsS , betrieben durch den Behinderten - und Rehabilitations - Sportverband Berlin e.V. und ausgewählte Inklusionssportvereine , dient auch der Organisationsentwicklung von Berliner Sportvereinen und - verbänden , sowie der Entwicklung und Erprobung neuer inklusiver Sportarten .
3 . Im InklusionsSportpark müssen ausreichend Büro- , Multifunktions - und Lagerräume für die Sportvereine und - verbände , sowie Seminarräume für die Aus- und Fortbildung entstehen .

WP Cumulus Flash tag cloud by Roy Tanck requires Flash Player 7 or better .
Bordered by lemon trees on one side and an olive grove on the other , the country lane leading to Joher Al Dik , where Fadel Shana was killed doing his job , was all but deserted yesterday afternoon .
But two teenage boys from the Nusseirat refugee camp displayed half a dozen of the dull , black , inch - long darts which they said they had found among the cactus growing along the verge opposite where Mr Shana had parked his unarmoured SUV to film a tank on Wednesday afternoon .
According to doctors who examined the body of the 23 - year - old Palestinian Reuters cameraman at Gaza City 's Shifa Hospital , it was controversial darts like those , flechettes , fired from an Israeli tank shell that explodes in the air , that caused his death .
X - rays displayed to Reuters showed several of the flechettes embedded in the dead man 's chest and legs , and more were found in his flak jacket , clearly emblazoned , like his vehicle , with " TV " and " Press " signs .
Mr Shana , unmarried , and a talented and popular member of the award - winning , 15 - strong Reuters team in the Gaza Strip , had been driving west along the normally quiet road when he and his soundman , Wafa Abu Mizyed , 25 , decided to park their vehicle 200 metres or so short of Gaza 's main north - south Salahadin Road .
They had been touring Gaza to report on the worst day of violence since early March .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A charred black patch yesterday marked the spot where the vehicle , its rear ripped to pieces by the blast , had been towed away .
Mr Shana set up his tripod and faced back east in the direction of the Israeli border to film a tank perhaps a kilometre and a half away across the fields .
The last video from Mr Shana 's camera showed the tank opening fire .
Two seconds later , after the shot raises dust around the tank 's gun , the tape goes blank – presumably marking the precise moment at which he was hit .
Reuters reported yesterday that a frame - by - frame examination of the tape shows the shell exploding and dark shapes shooting out of it .
The Israeli military was silent last night on whether it planned to launch the " swift , honest , and impartial investigation " into Mr Shana 's death , urged by David Shlesinger , the editor - in - chief of Reuters News , who said the medical evidence underlined the case for such an inquiry .
While expressing " sorrow " for Mr Shana 's death , a military official said the area was one in which there was " ongoing fighting against armed , extreme and dangerous terrorist organisations on a daily basis " .
The presence of media , photographers and other uninvolved individuals in areas of warfare is extremely dangerous and poses a threat to their lives . "
But Mr Shlesinger said : " The markings on Fadel Shana 's vehicle showed clearly and unambiguously that he was a professional journalist doing his duty .
We and the military must work together urgently to understand why this tragedy took place and how similar incidents can be avoided in the future .
This tragic incident shows the risks journalists take every day to report the news . "
The military would only say that all its weapons " are legal under international law " .
Israel 's Supreme Court rejected a 2003 petition arguing that the use of flechettes as an anti-personnel weapon contravened a 1980 UN convention , but the Israeli human rights group Btselem said last night that flechettes violated international law and demanded a criminal investigation .
Mr Shana 's friend and colleague Wissam Nassar , also 23 , a photographer with the Maan news agency , said yesterday that , alerted to reports of civilian casualties in central Gaza , he and two colleagues had driven south in the armoured car of photographer Mohammed Abed , of Agence France Presse .
" We parked the car at the corner [ of the lane ] and saw people looking east .
We saw Wafa Abu Mizyed [ who was injured by shrapnel in the blast ] and he was saying ' Fadel died ' . "
Mr Nassar added that before they managed to get to Mr Shana 's car there was an explosion perhaps 30 metres away from what he presumed was another tank shell , which had landed ahead of them to the east of the car .
" We all lay down in the road , " he said .
" I thought at first I had been injured .
There was a lot of smoke . "
Eventually they reached Mr Shana 's car and found his body beside his mangled tripod .
The two teenage boys from Nusseirat , Tareq al - Bana , 16 , and Mohammed Abu Hajaj , 19 , said they had been there when Mr Shana had been killed by the explosion which also injured or killed several other Palestinians , including at least one teenager with a bicycle .
They said some tyres had been burned in the lane but that there had been no shooting from Palestinians .
Mr Nassar said Mr Shana was a fine colleague " who always wanted to make an extra effort .
He thought a lot about the future .
He really wanted to be something in Reuters . "
He had photographed Mr Shana last Friday when they met on duty outside a mosque where Hamas 's leader , Ismail Haniyeh , was speaking .
The picture shows a smiling man in sunglasses with stubble and hair down to his neck .
Mr Nassar added : " He joked with me , saying keep those pictures ; you may need them some day . "

actually , since there 's no way in hell consumers will see a dime , I would prefer that any telecom executives and lawyers that signed off on or agreed to do this for the government GO TO JAIL !
I do n't know if the article talks about criminal penalties , but sending several top executive and top lawyers to jail would certainly provide a good lesson in civic responsibility .

My wife had to rent a car awhile back , and apparently the company was involved in a class - action lawsuit that was effective during the time she had rented the car .
The company sent her a discount coupon for her next car rental , which expired a few months later .
And since neither of us had any reason to rent a car , the coupon went unused .
Since most people do n't rent cars on a regular basis , I doubt the company was out any significant amount of money .
That certainly would n't surprise me .

My implication was that , since TK is a strong supporter of civil damages ( i.e. RIAA ) , he should have no moral bias towards the imposition of these types of fines towards a business entity which clearly violated the law and as such should be held accountable ( as we have heard ad nauseum )

Howevere the BS / AT&T merger adds additional assets to the pot to be distributed to plantiffs .
I 'm fairly sure BS merger occured after the lawsuits were filed , and the FISA court oversight was re-established .

educated guess based on what the blogger at Legality believes a jury would award .
If At&t were ever forced to settle , rest assured , the amount would be significantly less .
Before you jump on someone else pretending you know everything , perhaps you should go to law school - $ 146 k is at best a very generous , above all , guess based on what the blogger at Legality believes a jury would award .

Now you know why there is a such a great push for retroactive immunity .
It is / always about the money .
No one gives a rats a$$ about your rights ..

It 's not even all about the money .
Sure , they 'll claim it is , and logically the numbers will be extremely huge because they 're freaking " ma bell " ( got the ill communication ) .
It 's more about being responsible .
They ought to just go ahead and admit it .
Everyone knows what 's really going on anyway , and the whole " oooh , but our secrets can't get out .. " excuse is beyond lame .
Nobody cares so much about HOW they 're doing what they 're doing , it 's the why .
Not many people disagree that yes , they should be able to tap some things for purposes of tracking down a person , as long as 1 ) they have a just cause 2 ) they 'll keep their end of the bargain and get a warrant - even if it is ' after the fact ' by their most generous time limits of , what is it , 90 days ???
If the agents can't even get a warrant within that time frame , then does n't it seem reasonable that maybe , just maybe , it was n't worth it in the first place and they should move on to " bigger fish " or something that might be worthwhile ?
The part (s ) most people have problems with , is all this is the idiotic notion that everything must be tapped and that big brother must watch everything .
Why ?
What good does it do to have extraneous information that 's completely irrelevant ?
It 's not only wasteful , it 's underhanded , pretentious , and apparently , it used to be illegal .
Not illegal anymore I guess .
That must be nice to be able to just change the laws to suit your self .
Why not give retroactive immunity to non-violent small time criminals who are overcrowding prisons across this country ?

This news item actually makes sense , sort of .
quote :
While highly unlikely given AT&T 's lobbying & legal prowess , these kind of numbers make it a little more clear why AT&T and Verizon have been spending millions in DC over the past few years in order to get legal immunity for their involvement in these programs .
Well , DUH .
This is exactly what I 've been saying in other news article comments as this story unfolds .
This is not about " illegal wiretapping " or " breaking the law " .
This is about a company trying to stay out of class action lawsuit hell .
My comment is : why should n't AT&T spend money on lobbying this issue ?
First , it 's perfectly legal .
Second , it 's manifestly clear from a business point of view that it's in their interest to avoid being liable for billions or trillions of dollars in damages .
If you owned stock in AT&T and they did not try to avoid these liabilities , you 'd probably sue them for malfeasance .
quote : Congress is currently on vacation , but when they return the House will be tasked with deciding whether or not to fight , or support , these companies ' request for immunity as they move to renew FISA .
Jon , you 've left out some important points .
( a) Congress left without renewing FISA at all !
Your story completely glosses over that little detail .
Instead the Democrats decided to ram through procedurally loaded deals against the Justice Department over their hiring and firing practices .
They 've prioritized election - year partisan manuvering above working on national security .
( b) The immunity deal is a small part of FISA .
You make it sound like that 's the biggest issue .
It 's not .

The bottom line is VERY SIMPLE .
AT&T and the others KNEW what they were doing was illegal .
End of case .
Do the crime , pay the fine .
No if 's , and , or but 's about it .
The LAWYERS at AT&T KNEW it was illegal , but the executives of said companies chose to ignore their advice .
Guess what , the SHAREHOLDERS are the ones who are going to pay , not the public .
I hope to hell AT&T is forced to pay out at least 40 billion in fines .
That 's the ONLY way the other megacorps are going to finally realize that breaking the law , WHEN THEY KNOW ABOUT IT AHEAD OF TIME , is going to cost them .
So guess what shareholders , all your investments are going to be worthless .
Oh well , you knew you were dealing with an evil company , but your greed overrode your common sense .
Now you suffer for that same greed .

No , see i even said that included replacing the copper ( meaning whats up on the poles / underground feeding the neighborhood ) with fiber , multiply that 146,000 by at least 20 - 50 homes in my neighborhood , they would have plenty to replace the copper with fiber .
As U.S. strikes on Shiite armed fighters in Baghdad have widened , Iran has suspended talks with the United States on Iraqi security , citing the continued offensive as the reason , the Iranian Foreign Ministry said Monday .
American forces were responding to fire from Shiite militias in the Amel neighborhood in western Baghdad , and in eastern Baghdad , they hammered both the nearby district of New Baghdad during the day and the Shiite ghetto of Sadr City on Monday night .
" The focus of discussions with the U.S. is Iraq 's security and stability , " said Mohammad Ali Hosseini , the spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry in Tehran , according to IRNA , the official Iranian news agency .
" We are witnessing indiscriminate bombardment of Iraqi residential areas by the U.S. occupying forces , " Hosseini told reporters at his weekly news conference .
The United States says Iran is supplying weapons and training to Shiite militias in Iraq , but Tehran has denied interfering .
It remains uncertain whether some of the weapons found in Iraq that appear to be Iranian came directly from Iran or through third parties .
The Iraqis are forming a committee with experts from the ministries of interior and defense to look into the allegations against Iran .
The State Department did not comment directly on the talks , but a spokesman , Tom Casey , said : " The fact remains , though , that the Iranian government continues , despite their public statements of support for the Iraqi government , to play this negative role , to provide this kind of assistance to militant groups and to militia groups .
" It 's something we want to see stopped , and it 's something the Iraqis want to see stopped , " Casey said .
The gesture by Iran is hard to read .
It comes on the heels of a disclosure by the U.S. military that among the evidence it has collected of intervention by Iran is documentation of training camps near Tehran run by Lebanese Hezbollah militants .
That information was given to an Iraqi delegation to present to Iranian officials last week .
But Iranian politics is a game of shadows , with so many crosscutting interests that it is hard to say what Iran 's goal may be in suspending the talks .
Two things are clear :
The talks have not borne much fruit , so suspending them is almost cost - free , at least in the short term .
The downside is that the talks have been a way for the two countries , which do not have diplomatic relations , to have face - to - face conversations .
Several Iraqi politicians said they believe that the Iranian suspension was as much in retaliation for U.S. criticism of Iran 's nuclear program as it was for Iraq policy .
" Some Iranian officials believe that Iraq is a better location to pressure the Americans over Iran 's diplomatic crisis with them , " Ali al - Dabbagh , Iraq 's government spokesman , told Al Hurra , a satellite channel , Monday evening .
Secondly , Iran loses nothing in Iraq by denouncing strikes on Shiite civilians , especially since it has also said it approves of the Iraqi government 's effort to halt the activities of illegal militias .
While those two positions might sound contradictory , in fact , they are plausible here .
The Iraqi government also says it wants to help civilians and is only targeting the militias .
The reality is that when forces go after insurgents in urban areas , it is impossible to avoid hitting some innocents as well .
Ovarian cancer is often deadly because it is typically diagnosed only in late stages .
A new study suggests dogs could help doctors sniff out the disease earlier .
Scientists have shown previously that dogs seem able to sniff out cancer .
A 2004 study in the British Medical Journal found dogs could detect bladder cancer by sniffing human urine .
And in a small study in 2006 reported in the journal Integrative Cancer Therapies , dogs were trained to identify lung or breast cancer .
In the new study , researchers trained dogs to distinguish different types and grades of ovarian cancer , including borderline tumors .
Turns out the odor of ovarian cancer does seem to differ from those of other gynecological malignancies , such as cervical or endometrial cancers .
Importantly , early - stage and low - grade ovarian cancers emit the same scent as advanced tumors .
" Our study strongly suggests that the most common ovarian carcinomas are characterized by a single specific odor detectable by trained dogs , " write the authors in the June issue of Integrative Cancer Therapies .
" And while we do not believe that dogs should be used in clinical practice , because they may be influenced during their work , leading to changes in the accuracy rates , still , under controlled circumstances , they may be used in experiments to further explore this very interesting new property of malignancies . "
Dogs have many times more smell - sensitive cells in their noses compared to humans .
They can of course sniff out bombs , drugs and even buried corpses .
In fact , animals have many amazing abilities to sense things that humans cannot .
The work was led by Dr. György Horvath from the University Hospital in Göteborg , Sweden , with help from the Working Dog Clubs in Sweden and Hungary .
" I believe there is great value in this study , which adds to the growing body of research suggesting the diagnostic skills of these specially trained dogs , " said Dr. Keith I . Block , editor - in - chief of the journal .
" Their ability to detect specific odors associated with chemicals related to malignancy should eventually lead to effective methods and tools for very early detection , and thus a greater proportion of cancer cures . "
Ovarian cancer is three times as deadly as breast cancer .
Separately , researchers at Yale School of Medicine announced in February a new blood test that detects ovarian cancer with 99 percent accuracy .
That ongoing research is in clinical trials now .
Many programmers have read Paul Graham 's essay Beating the Averages which develops a theory of programming language hierarchies .
A programmer used to a programming language that does n't provide certain functionality has trouble imaging how that functionality could be useful .
After all , they 've gotten along so far without the feature , so it can't be that important , right ?
In Graham 's words :
As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum , he knows he 's looking down .
Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful , because they 're missing some feature he 's used to .
But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction , up the power continuum , he does n't realize he 's looking up .
What he sees are merely weird languages .
He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub , but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well .
Blub is good enough for him , because he thinks in Blub .
One thing that I do n't think has received enough consideration is that this reasoning applies in an interesting way to human languages as well .
Different spoken language are specialized towards certain types of communication .
English is a language obsessed with time , with a medley of future , past , present , perfect , and progressive tenses .
But English is n't as precise at expressing formality as Spanish or French are , both of which have incorporated formality into verb conjugation .
Japanese on the other hand , has codified formal speech more precisely than most Western languages1 ,
Japanese , further differentiating itself from English , does n't have a future tense : saying " I will go to school " and " I go to school " are expressed in the exact same way .
However , Japanese is adept at expressing emotional nuance , and has a few tricks up its sleeves to help talking about temporal events ( words like ototoi , asatte , saraisyuu -- which respectively mean " the day before yesterday " , " the day after tomorrow " , and " the week after next " -- are really nice to have , and I wish English had equivalents ) .
Stepping back a bit , lets continue the comparison at work with Graham 's argument about blub languages .
Specifically , do we think we could make a case for a hierarchy of power among spoken languages ?
Its a difficult thought exercise to begin , in large part because each language has its own specialized domain ( formality , time , emotional nuance , etc ) , and thus our hierarchy of power would become entirely dependent upon our definition of power .
We can easily enough argue English is more powerful than Japanese -- if we 're talking about time -- but changing the definition of power we can quickly enough reverse that statement .
However , I think we can suggest that a fairly clear power hierarchy exists between modern Italian and Latin .
Italian greatly resembles Latin , except it has lost many of the tenses and complexities of Latin .
Just as Lisp 's tragic history of losing to its less powerful successors to its ideas , Latin 's structure and grammatical depth have given way to its less potent children ( the Romance languages ) .
Why do more powerful solutions get rejected in favor of the less powerful ?
The same reason why Latin has fallen into disuse : after reaching a certain point , the benefits ( and costs ) of having more power are trumped by convenience .
The reason why programmers flocked to Python rather than Common Lisp is that Python is powerful enough , and much more convenient .
Much of modern software development is dealing with technically easy things2 , and the benefit from additional power does n't justify dealing with difficult package management3 , awkward string handling4 , or the varied and sundry chaos provoked by divergent competing implementations5 .
Until CL 's inconveniences are dealt with , it wo n't matter where Lisp rests in the power hierarchy .
All languages in heavy usage today are sufficiently powerful for the common tasks they are confronting , and the ones gaining mind - share are those that are more convenient , rather than the more powerful6 .
New emerging languages that wish to become mainstream will have to compete first in convenience and second in power .
This is why we are seeing a bevy of JVM based languages emerge -- piggy - backing on existing Java libraries and the widespread JVM allows great convenience even with limited penetration -- and its also why languages that fail to cater to convenience will flounder , even if they are markedly more powerful than existing popular languages .
After anointing Obama as the nominee on Tuesday , the media narrative has shifted to the West Virginia and Kentucky " Appalachian " contests .
They are reduced to quaint curiosities in which poor , white , uneducated mountain people from a " bygone era " have been trained to make their way to a school gym and push a button just like real people for the delight and amusement of the media elite .
The " dueling banjos " video in this post entitled " On to Appalachia " is a good example .
Presumably it is a reference to the retarded West Virginia inbred voter demographic making up Clinton 's 20 % to 40 % margin of support there .
Because it's " silly season , " as Obama called it , let 's analyze that more closely .
The scene is from the movie Deliverance .
It was filmed on the Chattooga River , which is the border between Georgia and South Carolina .
Obama won both of those primaries .
Other scenes were filmed in North Carolina .
Obama won that primary , too .
The " banjo boy " was a teen actor selected during a casting call at Clayton Elementary School in Clayton , Georgia .
Obama won 82 % of the vote in Clayton County .
The teen actor did not actually play the banjo .
The recorded banjo playing was performed by Eric Weissberg , who studied music at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and the Juilliard School of Music .
( Coincidentally , Obama also won the Wisconsin primary . )
So in the final analysis , the political humor backfires given the strong Obama connection to " dueling banjos . "
Political humorists should find a better vehicle for poking fun at West Virginia voters .
Speaking of West Virginia , did you know that the FBI 's Criminal Justice Information Services data center is in Clarksburg , West Virginia ?
The nearly 1,000 acre complex houses the FBI 's largest division , which operates the National Crime Information Center , Uniform Crime Reporting System , Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System , and the National Incident - Based Reporting System .
Did you also know that the IRS 's main data center is in Martinsburg , West Virginia ?
Data from every federal tax return filed in the United States is processed and stored at the IRS Martinsburg Computing Center .
Your W4 , W2 , 940 , and 1099 filings are processed there , too .
Martinsburg also processes information for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network , which monitors large cash and other suspicious transactions and assists law enforcement with money laundering and terrorist funding investigations .
That sounds like a lot of complicated , high - tech work for a bunch of uneducated banjo players .
They are given simple letter - based names so that it ’s easy to remember in the event that you need to buy a replacement cord .
You just look at the bottom of your gadget where it says “ Requires Type G Cord ” and go to Radio Shack and buy a Type G cord ( at a fraction of the cost of buying a new brick ) .
The letter is also embossed on the plug itself , so you do n’t need to worry about mixing up your cords .
Simple .
Outlet 2.0 compliant plugs will have key - like notches in the prongs that let the outlet know what kind of electricity is needed .
For example , a “ Type A ” plug will have zero notches .
It looks like a standard plug , and it just uses normal AC .
“ Type B ” plugs will have one notch to indicate that they require 1.5v DC .
Here are a few sample plugs to illustrate what I mean :
I propose a new standard for electric outlets where every outlet in your home has a universal adapter built in , on the other side of the wall , where you will never see it .
When you need AC , it gives you AC .
And when you need DC , it automatically converts to the proper voltage DC for you .
No more ugly bricks .
Plugging in your phone charger , computer speakers , or router will be as elegant as plugging in a lamp .
Today , if you lose an AC adapter , you have to find a new one that converts the AC in your wall to the proper voltage DC for that particular gadget .
Or , you can buy a universal AC adapter for just a little more money that you can manually set to provide whatever voltage DC your gadget requires .
I say it ’s high time we do away with the whole mess by moving the AC / DC conversion to the other side of the wall .
Some people have gotten around the problem by coming up with creative designs for power strips .
But that ’s backwards thinking because it just accepts that we have to deal with these bricks and puts a bandage on the problem .
We can do better .
Let ’s get rid of these things once and for all .
Here we are in the 21st Century , and we ’re still using electric outlets designed way back in the early 20th Century .
Back then , Alternating Current beat out Direct Current as the standard in our homes partly because it travels further before losing power .
But our needs have changed since then .
Sure , we still plug in a bunch of things that require AC , but we also have a few dozen items in each home that require DC .
So each of those items has its own power - converting brick taking up precious space on our power strips , and creating eye - sores on our walls .
Wo n’t this increase the cost of electric outlets ?
Yes .
But you only need to install your outlets once .
However you may otherwise buy a hundred gadgets over your lifetime that include their own transformer brick , and the cost of that brick is built into the price of the gadget .
With no brick needed , the cost of the gadget goes down .
Also , the weight of the new gadget in its box with all its accessories goes down , which makes it less expensive to ship , which translates to further savings .
What about power strips ?
How will they work ?
Outlet 2.0 compliant power strips will be plugged in with a “ Type A ” plug so they receive AC as usual .
But they will have internal universal converters at each of their outlets so they provide the proper electricity to the devices that are plugged in .
Yes , this will make them slightly larger and more expensive .
But the savings will come in less expensive devices , and a much neater area under your desk where everything is plugged in .
Is Outlet 2.0 backwards compatible ?
Yes .
Anything you have that came with a normal plug — including power bricks you got with gadgets before the Outlet 2.0 standard — will still work .
They have a normal “ Type A ” plug , so they will receive the AC they ’ve always received .
Will new 2.0 compliant plugs work in old 1.0 outlets ?
Well , once the standard is adopted , it should be relatively inexpensive to replace at least some old outlets with new ones , so hopefully it wo n’t be an issue for long .
You ’ll start to see even older hotels begin to advertise that they have Outlet 2.0 compliant rooms .
But if you are going to visit a home or hotel that has n’t upgraded yet , you can bring a simple travel - size pass - through converter .
You just plug it into any 1.0 outlet , and then you can plug any Outlet 2.0 compliant gadgets into the converter .
( Note that any Outlet 2.0 compliant power strip will work properly in a 1.0 outlet , converting the power as needed ) .
What if a 2.0 plug is plugged into a 1.0 outlet without an adapter ?
This could damage your gadget , so there is a feature in the Outlet 2.0 standard that prevents this from happening .
It is not shown in the plug renderings above because I have n’t worked out the details yet .
It will probably take the form of an extra prong that does n’t carry electricity , placed off center so as not to be confused with the grounding prong already present on current “ three - prong ” plugs .
At right is a rendering of how it may appear .
This not only prevents you from sticking a 2.0 plug in a 1.0 outlet , but makes the different outlets easy to recognize by sight .
Will I have to upgrade my whole house to Outlet 2.0 ?
No .
If you ’ve had the lamp in the corner plugged into the same 1.0 outlet for the past 20 years , and you never plug anything else into it , there ’s no need to upgrade that outlet .
Just upgrade the outlets where you will benefit from having the Outlet 2.0 standard .
If you ever sell the house , you may consider a full upgrade then so you can advertise that every room is Outlet 2.0 compliant .
Conclusion
For far too long , we ’ve been dealing with heavy , unwieldy , ugly power conversion bricks all over the place , and they do n’t seem to be going anywhere soon .
But I refuse to believe that a world that sends robots to Mars ca n’t figure out a way to solve this problem .
So this is my proposal .
Of course , I ’m not an electric engineer , so I may be missing some of the finer issues .
Let me know what you think , and tell me how this idea can be improved .
Update :
There are few things more frustrating for me than discovering that one of my ideas has already been thought of .
But in this case I ’m pleased to find via the comments that a similar proposal is already being worked on called The Green Plug .
It does n’t appear that the Green Plug puts the converter on the wall side , but it does create something like the Outlet 2.0 Power Strip , so that all your devices can share the same DC converter .
I fully support this .
Windows XP SP3 , which was unofficially released almost a week ago and has been available to TechNet and MSDN subscribers for even longer than that , does not come with Windows Internet Explorer 7 .
Whether you have Internet Explorer 6 , 7 , or 8b1 installed , the installation of XP SP3 will not affect your version of Internet Explorer .
However , there are differences that are worth noting for each version , with the most important point for IE8b1 users being that they should uninstall it before applying XP SP3 .
Jane Maliouta , Deployment Program Manager for IE8 , explains :
Users who have IE6 when they install SP3 do not need to worry about the installation process .
They have the option of installing either IE7 or IE8 beta 1 after the installation of SP3 and uninstalling back to IE6 if they so choose .
Users who have IE7 when they install SP3 do not need to worry about the installation process .
They have the option of installing IE8 beta 1 after the installation of SP3 .
They cannot uninstall IE7 and go back to IE6 , however , since SP3 updates files that IE6 uses and an uninstallation of IE7 could cause problems .
If the user wants to revert to IE6 :
and IE7 was installed before XP SP3 , the only option is to uninstall SP3 , uninstall IE7 , and install XP SP3 .
and XP SP3 has not yet been installed , Microsoft recommends installing IE7 after the installation of XP SP3 , so that it can later be uninstalled .
Users who have IE8 beta 1 currently installed should uninstall it before moving to XP SP3 and reinstall it afterwards .
It is not recommended to install SP3 with a system that has IE8 beta 1 , or any beta version of IE for that matter , installed .
In summary , if you do n't plan to downgrade your version of Internet Explorer after the installation of XP SP3 and you are using a final version , you will be fine .

On tap in space : Urine will not go to waste Astronauts wo n't need to look any further than the toilet to quench thirst .
WASHINGTON -- Astronauts living on the International Space Station soon will take recycling to new extremes :
They 'll get some of their drinking water from the toilet .
NASA has spent decades perfecting a system to transform urine into water that can be used in space for drinking , food preparation and washing .
Agency officials say the water from the system will be cleaner than U.S. tap water .
The new $ 250 million machine was being unpacked Wednesday at the space shuttle 's Florida launch site .
Shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to take it to the station this fall .
If all goes well , the so - called toilet - to - tap system will be fully operational in six months .
Russia developed a similar system in the 1980s but it never flew in space because of concerns over crew squeamishness , says former station astronaut Leroy Chiao , now a space consultant .
He says station crews expect hardships and are n't likely to object .
" You 're going ( to the space station ) as part of exploration , " he says .
" This is just something you have to put up with , and that 's OK . "
Some of the crew 's drinking water already comes from an unconventional source : evaporated laundry water and sweat , which are captured by a Russian machine .
NASA developed the new system because water is so heavy to carry to orbit .
Once the number of station residents grows from three to six next year , it would be impossible to ship enough water to the station , says Marybeth Edeen of NASA 's Johnson Space Center .
A toilet to arrive on the station this fall will funnel liquid waste to the new system through pipes , but the wastewater from the station 's older toilet will have to be carried in tanks to the processing machine .
There , water will be distilled from the waste and undergo six steps to cleanse it , including the addition of iodine to kill microbes .
The machine will also suck in humidity from the astronauts ' sweat and breath and clean it .
The end product will fill the bowls of the new toilet and will also dribble from taps in a galley and a " hygiene center , " where astronauts will bathe and brush their teeth .
The new machine will provide roughly half of the crew 's water intake , says Bob Bagdigian of NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center , including 1 ¾ gallons per person per day for drinking and food .
Recycling wastewater also is gaining in popularity on Earth .
A dozen or so U.S. communities have plants that cleanse sewage so it can be added to aquifers that supply drinking water .
The biggest plant , which can serve 500,000 people , opened this year in Orange County , Calif .
Public disgust has squelched such systems in San Diego and Los Angeles .
Edeen admits the recycled water poses a " psychological issue to get past " but says that , after tasting it " many , many times , " she can't tell it apart from any other water .
" It 's not urine anymore , " she says .
" It 's water . "
" I very much understand ( public ) squeamishness , " Bagdigian says .
But , he adds , he does n't have to contend with it , because " you 're talking about people who 've already come to grips with putting themselves on a rocket . "
My 14 year old has decided he is now atheist : ( I know he is searching and confused ( welcome to the teen years ) .
Because I ONCE was an atheist , I am aware of all the “ logic ” he tries to use in support of this .
When I point out how ILL - logical being an atheist is , he just says that being a Christian is too hard and not believing in easier and more fun:eek :
like me , there will come a time when the emptiness of being an atheist will be overwhelming , and that is when he will return to the fold of God ’s love and mercy .
Being an atheist is indeed easy , no going to Church , no praying , etc … but there will come a time when all that “ Easy ” will feel empty .
Just believing that when we die that is IT seems so dark , empty of hope .
I know , I was once there .
I pray for my son and for all atheist who are lost , even though they may not feel lost at the moment .
The Joy and Peace of soul in believing and knowing our Lord far outweighs the nothingless of atheism .

McCain is purging active lobbyists from his campaign team in a quest to wrest the reformist title from Democrat Barack Obama .
Lobbyists :
This is our thanks ?
More than a few Republican lobbyists in Washington are scratching their heads these days , asking :
So this is the thanks we get ?
It was a small band of loyal lobbyists who stood by presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain last August when his campaign went broke and his White House aspirations seemed doomed .

They raised money for him under impossible odds and kept him company in budget hotels during his darkest days .
Now they are under siege as McCain purges active lobbyists from his campaign team in a quest to wrest the reformist title from Democrat Barack Obama , his likely opponent in this fall ’s general election .
The dramatic turnabout among these once - embattled allies may be long forgotten by Republicans — and the voters — come November .
But for now , it seems a modern - day case study of Harry S. Truman ’s famous truism : “ If you want a friend in Washington , get a dog . ”
Five lobbyists have been shown the door of McCain ’s Virginia campaign headquarters in the past week , including Tom Loeffler , who is largely credited with keeping the senator ’s primary campaign financially afloat long enough to capture the Republican presidential nomination .
“ If it was OK to have these people working for you in February , why is it not OK today ? ” asked one Republican lobbyist who counts a friend among the new McCain outcast class .
The timing , motivation and even the details of the policy itself all are the subject of debates and consternation this week at water coolers , in restaurants and on conference calls on K Street .
“ McCain ’s self - righteous [ expletive ] has caught up with him .
Now he ’s got himself in a jam , ” said another Republican lobbyist who asked to remain anonymous because he is a campaign volunteer .
“ He ’s got to change the subject back to economic growth and taxation and the war on terror . ”
And there ’s this thought from another McCain supporter : “ I find it a little offensive .
It was good enough to get my $ 2,300 donation .
If we ’re not good enough , then send my check back .
It pisses me off . ”
Republican lobbyists are n’t the only ones feeling the heat .
In his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination , Obama is refusing donations from federally registered lobbyists and excluding them from his official campaign staff .
( They can still be advisers and volunteers , and their spouses ’ checks are certainly welcome . )
The Illinois senator ’s lobbyist backers adapted to those rules months ago .
But they ’re creating some angst today for advocates who banked on Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign .
With it now sputtering , those lobbyists are scrambling to figure out how to ingratiate themselves with the Obama team other than with the classic political pivot : issuing a big donation check .
“ The whole anti-lobbyist shtick is disingenuous and annoying on both sides , ” said one lobbyist .
The emergence of Obama as the presumptive Democratic nominee is a major reason many believe McCain imposed restrictions on the role of lobbyists inside his campaign .
It ’s no secret on Capitol Hill that McCain , a 22 - year Senate veteran and co-author of the McCain - Feingold campaign finance reform law , has been irked by the Democratic newcomer ’s attempt to grab the reformer title by often citing his work in the Illinois Legislature .
Both campaigns are using the issue to compete for independent voters in November by claiming to be distant from the special interests in Washington .
A continuing taint from the Jack Abramoff lobbyist scandal is also cited as motivation .
Abramoff raised big money for President Bush and was later convicted of bribing administration officials to win favorable action for his clients .
As Senate Commerce Committee chairman then , McCain uncovered much of that scandal .
“ It ’s a different time , and we have a different set of rules out there in the way the press covers things , ” said Ron Kaufman , a Republican lobbyist who supports McCain .
“ We have to adjust , and we should .
It ’s not about us ; it ’s about him . ”
Still , McCain ’s tardy concern about lobbyists in his campaign and the strikingly public enforcement of the new policy has left many supporters bruised and sent others into hiding .
When two of McCain ’s part - time lobbyist supporters were contacted by Politico this week , both said they had filled out their compliance forms and assumed they were in the clear .
But neither wanted to go on the record and risk calling attention to themselves , either .
“ The McCain folks seem confused .
They ’ve created an issue for Obama , and it strikes me as mindless politics to start eating your own like this .
Not every lobbyist is Jack Abramoff , ” said one Republican operative who requested anonymity to speak frankly .
Even the anti-lobbyist policy itself is the subject of debate .
To have a formal role in the campaign , lobbyists must quit their day job — at some point .
Phil Gramm , the senator ’s top economic adviser for more than a year , deregistered last month as a lobbyist for UBS , a major financial house caught up in the subprime mess that is now the subject of legislation on Capitol Hill .
Lobbyist volunteers also are n’t allowed to serve as advisers on issues on which they once lobbied .
In other words , the experts on certain issues are n’t allowed to help McCain develop policy in those areas .
Meanwhile , lobbyists who help raise money appear to be able to keep their day jobs as long as they do n’t have an official title and they do n’t lobby McCain ’s Senate office on any issue .
“ I frankly do n’t understand the policy , and what parts of it I do understand actually do n’t make sense , ” said Jan Baran , a Republican campaign finance legal expert .
“ Even though someone has been a lobbyist for the last 30 years , if they are not a lobbyist for the next five months , they are OK for the campaign ? ”
But perhaps the greatest ironies to emerge from McCain ’s lobbyist roundup are the people who are enforcing and defending it .
They are campaign manager Rick Davis , who in 2006 took a leave from his lobbying firm , Davis Manafort & Freedman , but whose name is still a big draw on its shingle ; and chief political adviser Charlie Black , founder of another of Washington ’s biggest lobbying houses .
“ It ’s just ridiculous , ” said Jeffrey J. Connaughton , a veteran Democratic lobbyist at the bipartisan firm Quinn Gillespie .
“ To send a high - powered lobbyist out to say that you do n’t do business with lobbyists , it ’s myopic . ”
Despite his own partisan background , Connaughton also is no fan of Obama ’s policy .
“ What the lesson has been in the past is that when you try to appeal to people by saying that you are going to be more ethical than anybody in history , you sort of set yourself up for the media coming after you , ” Connaughton said .
Eamon Javers , Lisa Lerer , Samuel Loewenberg and Chris Frates contributed to this story .
Former Rep. Thomas G. Loeffler , one of McCain campaign ’s most important advisers and fund - raisers , has resigned as a national co-chair over lobbying entanglements .
Another top McCain official resigns
Former Rep. Thomas G. Loeffler , a Texan who is among the McCain campaign ’s most important advisers and fundraisers , has resigned as a national co-chair over lobbying entanglements , a Republican source told Politico on Sunday .
It ’s at least the fifth lobbying - related departure from the campaign in a week .

The McCain campaign , already facing the prospect of being badly outgunned in the general election , now also must cope with the disruption of the lobbying shakeout .
The McCain campaign ’s stringent approach to the issue is provoking a bit of grumbling from some of its Washington allies , who point out that a lobbyist ’s function is enshrined in the Constitution .
“ No one in real America cares , ” said one key Republican .
“ But McCain cares . ”
The senator , whose appeal to independent voters rests in part on his reformist image , recognizes that he will be held to a high standard in the coming campaign and wants to clean house before the general election formally kicks off , sources say .
The McCain campaign last week announced a restrictive “ McCain Campaign Conflict Policy ” that included a questionnaire to be returned to the campaign ’s legal department as part of a re-vetting of all staff .
“ No person working for the Campaign may be a registered lobbyist or foreign agent , or receive compensation for any such activity , ” the policy says .
Officials say Loeffler ’s resignation shows that McCain and his campaign is going to be serious about enforcing the policy , which was implemented following revelations about the lobbying ties of several campaign officials .
“ Everyone will have to become compliant with the policy or they 'll have to make a similar choice , ” a campaign official said on condition of anonymity .
“ But we 're not going to discuss every person affected . ”
The officials who have left include Doug Goodyear , who was McCain ’s top liaison to the Republican National Convention ; Doug Davenport , regional campaign manager for mid-Atlantic states ; Eric Burgeson , an energy policy adviser ; and Craig Shirley , a prominent Republican consultant who was a member of McCain ’s Virginia Leadership Team .
Loeffler was part of the rescue mission for the campaign last year after its spending badly outstripped its fundraising , leading to a contraction of the campaign that left McCain running a bare - bones operation in the lead - up to his breakout New Hampshire primary victory .
Loeffler ’s departure followed a report this weekend by Newsweek ’s Michael Isikoff that Loeffler ’s “ lobbying firm has collected nearly $ 15 million from Saudi Arabia since 2002 and millions more from other foreign and corporate interests , including a French aerospace firm seeking Pentagon contracts . ”
Isikoff wrote : “ Loeffler last month told a reporter ‘ at no time have I discussed my clients with John McCain . ’
But lobbying disclosure records reviewed by NEWSWEEK show that on May 17 , 2006 , Loeffler listed meeting McCain along with the Saudi ambassador to ‘ discuss US - Kingdom of Saudi Arabia relations . ’ ”
A Republican source who has talked to Loeffler played down the revelation , saying : “ I doubt he meant he had never lobbied McCain in his life .
And if it were only the one time pre-campaign , that 's pretty remarkable considering they 've been friends for many years . ”
Campaign Manager Rick Davis told his staff in a memo dated Thursday announcing the policy : “ Those staff members who have been registered lobbyists or foreign agents must ensure that their registrations have been formally terminated by asking their former employers to terminate their status and by filing the necessary paperwork with the appropriate authorities . …
“ Those staff members who have been registered lobbyists or foreign agents must certify with their Division Directors that they have given the Campaign a complete and accurate list of former lobbying employers and clients and that they have filed the necessary paperwork to terminate their status . ”
Whether new investors are causing the market ’s problems or keeping them from getting worse is in dispute .
But there is no question that the grain markets are now experiencing levels of volatility that are running well above the average levels over the last quarter - century .
Mr. Grieder ’s crop insurance premiums rise with the volatility .
So does the cost of trading in options , which is the financial tool he has used to hedge against falling prices .
Some grain elevators are coping with the volatility and hedging problems by refusing to buy crops in advance , foreclosing the most common way farmers lock in prices .
“ The system is really beginning to break down , ” Mr. Grieder said .
“ When you see elevators start pulling their bids for your crop , that tells me we ’ve got a real problem . ”
Until recently , that system had worked well for generations .
Since 1877 , grain producers have been able to hedge the price of their wheat and corn crops on the Chicago Board of Trade through the use of futures contracts , which are agreements to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity for a fixed price on some future date .
Soybean futures contracts were introduced in 1936 .
More recently , the exchange has offered another tool : options on those futures contracts , which allow option holders to carry out the futures trade , but do not require that they do so .
Trading in options is not as effective a hedge , farmers say , but it does not require them to put up as much cash as is required to trade futures .
These tools have long provided a way to lock in the price of a crop as it is planted , eliminating the risk that prices will drop before it is harvested .
With these hedging tools , grain elevators could afford to buy crops from farmers in advance , sometimes a year or more before the harvest .
But that was yesterday .
It simply is not working that way today .
Futures , for example , are less reliable .
They work as a hedge only if they fall due at a price that roughly matches prices in the cash market , where the grain is actually sold .
Increasingly  for disputed reasons  grain futures are expiring at prices well above the cash - market price .

Eighteen American war veterans kill themselves every day .
One thousand former soldiers receiving care from the Department of Veterans Affairs attempt suicide every month .
More veterans are committing suicide than are dying in combat overseas .
These are statistics that most Americans do n’t know , because the Bush administration has refused to tell them .
Since the start of the Iraq War , the government has tried to present it as a war without casualties .
In fact , they never would have come to light were it not for a class action lawsuit brought by Veterans for Common Sense and Veterans United for Truth on behalf of the 1.7 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The two groups allege the Department of Veterans Affairs has systematically denied mental health care and disability benefits to veterans returning from the conflict zones .
The case , officially known as Veterans for Common Sense vs. Peake , went to trial last month at a Federal Courthouse in San Francisco .
The two sides are still filing briefs until May 19 and waiting for a ruling from Judge Samuel Conti , but the case is already having an impact .
" Shh ! "
That ’s because over the course of the two - week trial , the VA was compelled to produce a series of documents that show the extent of the crisis affecting wounded soldiers .
" Shh ! " begins one e-mail from Dr. Ira Katz , the head of the VA ’s Mental Health Division , advising a media spokesperson not to tell CBS News that 1,000 veterans receiving care at the VA try to kill themselves every month .
" Our suicide prevention coordinators are identifying about 1,000 suicide attempts per month among the veterans we see in our medical facilities .
Is this something we should ( carefully ) address ourselves in some sort of release before someone stumbles on it ? " the e-mail concludes .
Leading Democrats on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee immediately called for Katz ’s resignation .
On May 6 , the Chair of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs , Bob Filner ( D - CA ) convened a hearing titled " The Truth About Veteran ’s Suicides " and called Katz and VA Secretary James Peake to testify .
" That e-mail was in poor tone but the content was part of a dialogue about what we should do about new information , " Katz said in response to Filner ’s questions .
" The e-mail represents a healthy dialogue among members of VA staff about when it ’s appropriate to disclose and make public information early in the process . "
Filner was nonplused and accused Katz and Peake of a " cover-up . "
" We should all be angry about what has gone on here , " Filner said .
" This is a matter of life and death for the veterans that we are responsible for and I think there was criminal negligence in the way this was handled .
If we do not admit , assume or know then the problem will continue and people will die .
If that ’s not criminal negligence , I do n’t know what is . "
A Pattern
It ’s also part of a pattern .
The high number of veteran suicides were n’t the only government statistics the Bush Administration was forced to reveal because of the class action lawsuit .
Another set of documents presented in court showed that in the six months leading up to March 31 , a total of 1,467 veterans died waiting to learn if their disability claim would be approved by the government .
A third set of documents showed that veterans who appeal a VA decision to deny their disability claim have to wait an average of 1,608 days , or nearly four and a half years , for their answer .
Other casualty statistics are not directly concealed , but are also not revealed on a regular basis .
For example , the Pentagon regularly reports on the numbers of American troops " wounded " in Iraq ( currently at 31,948 ) but neglects to mention that it has two other categories " injured " ( 10,180 ) and " ill " ( 28,451 ) .
All three of these categories represent soldiers who are so damaged physically they have to be medically evacuated to Germany for treatment , but by splitting the numbers up the sense of casualties down the public consciousness .
Here ’s another number that we do n’t often hear discussed in the media : 287,790 .
That ’s the number of returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans who had filed a disability claim with the Veterans Administration as of March 25th .
That figure was not announced to the public at a news conference , but obtained by Veterans for Common Sense using the Freedom of Information Act .
Why all the secrecy ?
Why is it so hard to get accurate casualty figures out of our government ?
Because the Bush Administration knows if Americans woke up to the real , human costs of this war they would fight harder to oppose it .
Some ‘ Cakewalk ’
Think back to 2002 , before the invasion of Iraq , when leading neo-conservative thinker and Donald Rumsfeld aide Ken Adelman predicted the war would be a " cakewalk . "
Or consider this statement from Vice President Dick Cheney .
Two days before the invasion , Cheney told NBC ’s Tim Russert the war would " go relatively quickly … ( ending in ) weeks rather than months . "
Today , those comments are gone but the motivation behind them remains .
This is why the VA ’s head of mental health wrote " Shh ! " telling a spokesperson not to respond to a reporters ’ inquiry .
But all the shhing in the world cannot stop the horrible pain that ’s mounting after five years of war in Iraq and nearly seven years of war in Afghanistan .
Unpleasant Facts
According to an April 2008 study by the Rand Corporation , 300,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans currently suffer from post - traumatic stress disorder or major depression .
Another 320,000 suffer from traumatic brain injury , physical brain damage .
A majority are not receiving help from the Pentagon and VA system which are more concerned with concealing unpleasant facts than they are with providing care .
In its study , the RAND Corporation wrote that the federal government fails to care for war veterans at its own peril — noting post - traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury " can have far - reaching and damaging consequences . "
" Individuals afflicted with these conditions face higher risks for other psychological problems and for attempting suicide .
They have higher rates of unhealthy behaviors  such as smoking , overeating , and unsafe sex  and higher rates of physical health problems and mortality .
Individuals with these conditions also tend to miss more work or report being less productive , " the report said .
" These conditions can impair relationships , disrupt marriages , aggravate the difficulties of parenting , and cause problems in children that may extend the consequences of combat trauma across generations . "
" These consequences can have a high economic toll , " RAND said .
" However , most attempts to measure the costs of these conditions focus only on medical costs to the government .
Yet , direct costs of treatment are only a fraction of the total costs related to mental health and cognitive conditions .
Far higher are the long - term individual and societal costs stemming from lost productivity , reduced quality of life , homelessness , domestic violence , the strain on families , and suicide .
Delivering effective care and restoring veterans to full mental health have the potential to reduce these longer - term costs significantly . "
Bush and Congress have the power to stop this problem before it gets worse .
It ’s not too late to extend needed mental health care to our returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans ; it ’s not too late to begin properly screening and treating returning servicemen and women who ’ve experienced a traumatic brain injury ; and it is not too late to simplify the disability claims process so that wounded veterans do not die waiting for their check .
As the Rand study shows , this is n’t only in the best interest of veterans , it ’s in the best interest of our country in the long run .
To start with , the Bush Administration needs to give us some honest information about the true human costs of the Iraq War .

Barcelona is a dry city .
It is dry in a way that two days of showers can do nothing to alleviate .
The Catalan capital 's weather can change from one day to the next , but its climate , like that of the whole Mediterranean region , is inexorably warming up and drying out .
And in the process this most modern of cities is living through a crisis that offers a disturbing glimpse of metropolitan futures everywhere .
Its fountains and beach showers are dry , its ornamental lakes and private swimming pools drained and hosepipes banned .
Children are now being taught how to save water as part of their school day .
This iconic , avant - garde city is in the grip of the worst drought since records began and is bringing the climate crisis that has blighted cities in Australia and throughout the Third World to Europe .
A resource that most Europeans have grown up taking for granted now dominates conversation .
Nearly half of Catalans say water is the region 's main problem , more worrying than terrorism , economic slowdown or even the populists ' favourite – immigration .
The political battles now breaking out here could be a foretaste of the water wars that scientists and policymakers have warned us will be commonplace in the coming decades .
The emergency water - saving measures Barcelona adopted after winter rains failed for a second year running have not been enough .
The city has had to set up a " water bridge " and is shipping in water for the first time in the history of this great maritime city .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A tanker from Marseilles with 36 million litres of drinking water unloaded its first cargo this week , one of a mini- fleet contracted to bring water from the Rhone every few days for at least the next three months .
So humbled was Barcelona when prolonged drought forced it to ship in domestic water from Tarragona , 50 miles south along the Catalan coast , 12 days ago , that city hall almost delayed shipment and considered an upbeat publicity campaign to lift morale and international prestige .
The whole country is suffering from its worst drought in 40 years and the shipments from Tarragona prompted an outcry from regions who insist they need it more .
For now the clashes are being soothed by intervention from Madrid , and plans to ship water from desalination plants in parched Almeria in Andalusia are shelved until October .
But there is little indication of a strategy to deal not just with an immediate emergency but an ongoing crisis .
Buying water on an epic scale from France has given the controversy an international aspect as French environmentalists question whether such a scarce natural resource should be sold as a commodity to another country .
" It would be a mistake to consider this water bridge between Marseilles and Catalonia as simply an operation of solidarity , " said a group of ecologists calling themselves Robin des Bois ( Robin Hood ) .
They said the commercial deal struck between private contractors failed to consider the environmental impact on France .
The organisation blamed Barcelona 's water shortage on " wasted resources and ... lack of foresight by Catalan and Spanish authorities " .
What Barcelona authorities are fast discovering is that chronic water shortages are not a problem that money alone can solve .
Its 5.5 million inhabitants need a lot of the stuff : the 20 million litres / 20,000 tonnes / five million gallons of water brought from Tarragona on 13 May were enough for barely 180,000 people and were consumed within minutes of being channelled through the city 's taps .
Wednesday 's shipment from Marseilles was bigger , 36 million litres , but similarly short lived .
Barcelona has churned up a whirlpool of controversy over its handling of the water crisis , causing just the spray of negative publicity it hoped to avoid .
Even the arrival of rain has only made things worse .
Catalonia 's regional environment minister , Francesc Baltasar , rushed to announce last week that the hosepipe ban and swimming pool restrictions imposed in February would be lifted .
Tarragona – whose wells supply shipped - in water – protested furiously .
" Barcelona fills its swimming pools with water from Tarragona , " local headlines screamed , and the water authority demanded a halt to pumping Tarragona 's water for the Catalan capital .

Jose Montilla , Catalonia 's regional prime minister , countermanded Mr Baltasar and insisted water - saving measures remain .
" Obviously it makes little sense to lift certain measures when , if it stops raining , we 'll have to re-impose them in three weeks ' time , " he said .
But Tarragona re-opened the tap only after Mr Montilla visited , and insisted that " this effort of solidarity will supply only our basic needs " .
Barcelona 's daily El Periodico called Mr Baltasar 's proposal to end unpopular water - saving measures " irresponsible and demagogic " , increasing resentments in regions supplying water to Barcelona .
The shipments themselves came under fire .
Importing water gives the city a " lamentable , depressing image " and spreads " alarmism " , Miguel Angel Fraile , secretary of the Catalan Trade Confederation , said .
With reservoirs now filled to 30 per cent , authorities should scrap the plan and ship in water only as a last resort , he said .
But reservoirs remain two - thirds empty , half the national average and far lower than usual for May .
These are dangerously low in anticipation of another dry summer , raising the ghastly prospect of water rationing – painful for residents and offputting for summer visitors .
Extreme short - term measures might have been averted had Barcelona mended leaky old pipes and filtered polluted aquifers , critics grumble .
But Barcelona is among Europe 's most careful water users , better than Madrid , Milan or Paris , La Vanguardia newspaper argues .
Residents adapt their loos to flush less , shower rather than bath and brush their teeth without the tap running , but such individual measures are swamped by industrial usage , and waste in the infrastructure .
La Vanguardia urges an immediate public works programme to improve the creaking system .
" People are much more aware of the need to save water , " says Bridget King , a South African who settled in Barcelona 20 years ago to teach English .
" We put a bucket under the shower to catch water before it heats up , and have stopped buying petunias that need a lot of watering .
It 's a constant topic of conversation and we worry it 's a long - term thing .
But as a South African I 'm appalled to see people wash dishes under the running tap .
I was brought up to be very careful with water .
And although we feel relieved it 's started raining , everyone knows it 's only short term and probably not enough . "
Recent rains have sharpened conflicts , offering a foretaste of water wars to come .
Aragon straddles the mighty Ebro river but is a parched desert , cultivable only by sophisticated irrigation systems managed by an Association of Irrigators .
This ancient brotherhood agreed to sell the surplus from its irrigation quota , which usually flows back into the Ebro , to Barcelona as a short - term emergency measure .
If rains lift reservoirs from their emergency levels , Aragon warns it will halt supplies .
But Mr Montilla tweaked Catalona 's definition of " emergency " so it did n't rely solely on reservoir levels .
Then Spain 's Deputy Prime Minister , Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega , ordered Aragon to keep the water flowing " because conditions are n't sufficient to guarantee Barcelona 's water supplies " .
Water is now Catalans ' principle worry : 43 per cent considered shortage the country 's main problem .
Authorities promise the crisis will ease when a huge desalination plant comes on stream next year .
But they say little about how to tackle the long - term problem of water shortage afflicting the whole Mediterranean region .
Catalan winemakers recognise that the change is permanent ; some are planting new vineyards further north as traditional terrain becomes hotter and dryer .
Other entrepreneurs , including swimming pool manufacturers , have less room for manoeuvre .
" The authorities are criminalising us , " complained Josep Sadurni , of Catalonia 's association of swimming pool manufacturers , which predicts losses of up to € 200 m ( £ 160 m ) this year .
" Who 'll buy a pool if they can't fill it ? " Mr Sadurni asked .
A striking image of the seriousness of the drought is provided by the emergence of a church from the waters of a drying reservoir .
For 40 years , all you could see of the drowned village of Sant Roma was the belltower of its stone church , which peeped from time to time above the surface of the artificial lake in a valley flooded in the 1960s to supply Catalonia with water .
This year falling water levels have revealed the 11th - century church in its entirety for the first time , attracting curious onlookers who walk round it on the reservoir 's dusty bed .
Spain 's Socialist government recognises that climate change will intensify water shortages , and favours desalination plants .
One such plant , among the biggest in Europe – and 75 per cent EU funded – is being built on the outskirts of Barcelona and will supply 20 per cent of the city 's water .
But it will not be ready until next year .
" It was already very important when it was planned , but now with the urgent drought , it has become indispensable , " said Tomas Azurra , the chief engineer at the plant .
Ecologists warn that desalination plants are costly in energy use , and damage the environment with high CO2 emissions .
But developed European regions can afford them , and they 're preferable to diverting water from rivers , which critics say is even more damaging .
More than 70 per cent of Spain 's water goes on agriculture , much of it wasted on antiquated irrigation systems and the cultivation of thirsty crops unsuitable for arid lands .
But few politicians seek confrontation with farmers already struggling to scratch a living .
High - density tourist resorts sprinkled with swimming pools , patio showers and golf courses along Spain 's desertified southern coast , especially in Murcia where it rarely rains , are also unsustainable , ecologists say .
Spain needs to capture more rainwater , says Stephanie Blencker of the Stockholm International Water Institute , as climate change will produce alternating extremes of drought and heavy rain .
" Rain is the biggest resource we have , and we can make it available all year round if we have sensible storage opportunities , " she said .
Since the 1992 Olympics , Barcelona has enjoyed the reputation of being both cutting edge and user friendly .
But now , as climate change overwhelms a crumbling infrastructure , proud , autonomous Catalonia has to seek help from outside .

Another US soldier was killed on Thursday .
Guerrillas blew up an oil pipeline from a refinery south of Baghdad on Friday .
Iraqi oil production has declined somewhat lately , according to this report .
Adm. Michael Mullen , Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , sharpened his rhetoric against Iran on Friday .
Mullen appeared earlier to want to put the brakes on the Cheney war machine .
Is he weakening ?
Muqtada al - Sadr explained in his Friday sermon yesterday that the truce of his Mahdi Army militia with the Iraqi military should be maintained .
His recent threat of open warfare , he said , concerned only the US military in Iraq .
He called the Iraqi troops “ brothers . ”
Muqtada is offering an olive branch to his former ally turned deadly foe , Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
Al - Maliki seems in no mood to accept it .
First the Pentagon said that the Iraqi Army needed to be 390,000 strong .
Now it says Iraq needs 646,000 troops .
A new audit suggests that the Pentagon has substantially over - estimated how many trained Iraqi troops the al - Maliki government has .
Iraqis speak to the US Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff :
The US military was criticized by Iraqis for killing innocent persons in a bombing raid on Sadr City .

McClatchy has late news from Thursday evening :
From an interview with Warren Buffet in Fortune Magazine : What Warren thinks ...
Q : Are we a long way from turning a corner ?
Buffett : " I think so .
I mean , it seems everybody says it 'll be short and shallow , but it looks like it 's just the opposite .
You know , deleveraging by its nature takes a lot of time , a lot of pain .
And the consequences kind of roll through in different ways .
Now , I do n't invest a dime based on macro forecasts , so I do n't think people should sell stocks because of that .
I also do n't think they should buy stocks because of that . "
Buffett talks about not timing the market based on macroeconomics , but he did time the housing market perfectly .
He bought a Laguna Beach , CA house in 1996 for $ 1.05 million ( at the market bottom ) , and sold in 2005 for $ 3.5 million .
It 's not like he needed the money .
Here was Buffett 's comment at the time :
" People go crazy in economics periodically .
Residential housing has different behavioral characteristics , simply because people live there .
But when you get prices increasing faster than the underlying costs , sometimes there can be pretty serious consequences . "

Mr Mugabe has come under international pressure over the poll Zimbabwe 's ruling party has rejected criticism of its leadership by former South African President Nelson Mandela .
Mr Mandela said Zimbabwe was suffering a failure of leadership ahead of a run-off presidential poll from which the opposition has withdrawn .
A ruling Zanu - PF official described Mr Mandela 's comments as unacceptable and unfortunate for a man of his stature .
Southern African leaders have called on President Robert Mugabe to postpone the vote and negotiate with the opposition .
The leaders from the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) said conditions did not permit a free and fair election on Friday .
' No postponement ' Speaking to the BBC , the parliamentary chief whip for Zanu - PF said Mr Mandela 's statement was " very unfortunate " .
" I do n't see the merit in that kind of statement ... [ It 's ] totally unacceptable ... the judgement that he has made , " Jerome MacDonald Gumbo said .

Asked whether the final round of the presidential vote would be postponed , he said : " There is no chance of that .
There is no reason . "
Opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) leader Morgan Tsvangirai pulled out of the election on Sunday , over fears of increasing political violence .
Mr Mugabe came second to Mr Tsvangirai in the first round of the presidential vote in March .
Since then , the MDC says some 86 of its supporters have been killed and 200,000 forced from their homes by militias loyal to Zanu - PF .
The government blames the MDC for the violence .
President Mugabe , who will address his final campaign rally on Thursday , said his government was open to negotiations with " anyone " , but only after the vote .
Mr Tsvangirai said negotiations would not be possible if Mr Mugabe went ahead with the run-off .
Speaking to the UK's Times newspaper by telephone , Mr Tsvangirai said of Mr Mugabe : " How can you call yourself an elected president ?
You are illegitimate and I will not speak to an illegitimate president . "
Harare diary : Shell - shocked Can Sadc solve Zimbabwe 's crisis ?
Mugabe stripped of knighthood Despite Mr Tsvangirai's withdrawal , Zimbabwe 's election authority says Friday 's vote will go ahead because his letter of notice came too late .
A BBC contributor in the southern town of Masvingo said army chief of staff Major General Engelbert Rugeje told a rally that his soldiers would force members of the public to go vote for Mr Mugabe .
" We are soldiers who do not ask for things , but force things , " Maj Gen Rugeje said .
" On Friday , we are going to make sure that you go and vote not for a person of your choice , but Mugabe . "
Zimbabwean journalist Brian Hungwe also told the BBC that hundreds of people had sought shelter in the South African embassy in Harare , asking for political refuge .
The crisis has drawn growing international condemnation of Mr Mugabe and his government .
The US has said it will not recognise the results of the vote .
Diplomacy criticised Speaking at a dinner in London on Wednesday to mark his 90th birthday , Mr Mandela said : " We watch with sadness the continuing tragedy in Darfur .
Nearer to home we have seen ... the tragic failure of leadership in our neighbouring Zimbabwe . "
They were the former leader 's first comments on the crisis .
Mr Mandela had held his silence until now , says the BBC 's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins , to avoid undermining the efforts of South Africa 's President Thabo Mbeki as chief mediator on Zimbabwe .
Mr Mbeki 's policy of " quiet diplomacy " has been criticised for its failure to resolve the crisis in Zimbabwe .

CIA Director Michael Hayden said China was beefing up its military with " remarkable speed and scope , " calling the buildup " troubling . "
AFP / Saul Loeb
China and India will affect strategic planning , he said .
“ Competition for influence will characterize the relationships between China , India , Japan and other emerging powers , ” Hayden said during a speech at Kansas State University .
“ But China , a communist - led nuclear state that aspires to and will likely achieve great power status during this century , will be the focus of American attention in that region of the world . ”
Hayden said there are differing views about China ’s rise and its motivations .
His view is that China is an economic competitor and increasingly becoming a “ geopolitical ” competitor .
“ But China is not an inevitable enemy of the United States of America .
There are good policy choices available to both Washington and Beijing that can keep us on the largely peaceful , constructive path that we 've both been on now for about 40 years , ” he said .
China ’s military buildup is the most significant aspect of Beijing ’s growth , Hayden said , noting that the PLA has integrated the U.S. conflict lessons learned in both Persian Gulf wars .
“ They 've developed an integrated advanced weaponry into a modern military force , ” he said .
The new Chinese military power could pose a risk to U.S. forces and interest in the region , and the military buildup is also about projecting the image of strength , he said .
“ It sees an advanced military force as an essential element of great power status , and it is the intelligence community 's view that any Chinese government , even a democratic one , would have similar nationalist goals . ”

Thanks to the power of state - of - the - art satellite communications and high - definition video , I became a time traveler last weekend .
I went to a movie theater to see the Metropolitan Opera production of La Bohème , which had been recorded a week before .
So I was traveling back in time to a week ago , when they put on an opera that was written in the late 1800s , based on a book published in the mid-1800s , that was about life in the early 1800s .
Clearly I am a time traveler in every sense but the interesting one .
As a humorist , I 'm under a tremendous amount of pressure to hate opera .
It 's the easiest target on the planet .
Writers who can't handle the subtle nuances of insulting Jack Thompson or airline food are happy to take on opera .
Everyone speaks European !
It confuses the brain stem !
Large women sing in horn - hats !
Nobody fights on top of a train !

Well , yeah , OK , but I liked it .
Maybe it was just the novelty of being in a movie theater where nobody was making cellphone calls about how to silence their crying child who nearly choked on a noisy candy wrapper .
Everyone was extremely quiet and old in the theater .
They tucked their walkers in from the aisle , made sure their medical - alert bracelets were n't jingling , and watched the damn show .
If hanging out with old people is the only way I can get some quiet in the movie theater , then buy me a ticket to Cinema Fogy .
Bring on the newsreels and the water ballet !
I also enjoyed the opera itself .
I have to admit , I was expecting it to be more complicated .
I generally assume anything foreign and / or classical is going to be layered with deep meaning that can only be teased out of the experience afterward by drinking a macchiato while writing in a Moleskine about mise en scène .
This opera , however , followed a simple rule :
Only one thing can happen per act .
Act 1 : A guy and a lady fall in love .
Act 2 : Another guy and another lady fall in love .
Act 3 : Some people break up while others do n't .
Act 4 : One of the ladies dies .
That 's pretty much it , and it's all laid out for you in subtitles .
If you have trouble following this opera , then you 're going to be baffled by the plot twists in the average Garfield strip .
On the other hand , a Garfield strip does n't last 3 ½ hours .
That 's because Garfield does n't spend the first panel singing a long , slow aria called " Io Mangerè Questo Lasagne . "
This is where opera breaks down for geeks and their famously short attention spans .
They get bored spending hours watching people sing about dying .
I figure if I can enjoy grinding for Worn Dragonscales in Warcraft , I can sure as hell enjoy watching a busty Chilean soprano in a corset emote for a while .
Plus , there were two intermissions where Dreyer 's Dibs could be purchased for a merely outlandish price .
As a final selling point , La Bohème is about artists .
These artists were young , but some of them were older than me .
These artists were starving and emaciated , but some of them were fatter than me .
Plus , I was one of the most athletic people in the theater itself .
Compared with either the actors or the audience , I 'm Orlando Bloom .
Well , OK , Elijah Wood .
All right , Sean Astin , but the point is I 'm somewhere in that range .
All I need to do is learn to sing tenor in a voice that can make Amanda Holden ovulate at 20 paces , and I 'm in there .

RSSmeme , a project that has been described by our own Mark Hopkins as a “ less colorful competitor ” to the recently re-launched ReadBurner ( a service which , we should note , was also purchased in March 2008 by Mashable editor - in - chief Adam Ostrow ) , just last month introduced an update in the form of language filter , meant to aid users in seeking links to stories whose contextual languages they can understand and which are aggregated as shared items in Google Reader .
And today we hear from the creator of RSSmeme , Benjamin Golub , that the service has received yet more backend attention in the past few days .
According to Golub , the framework of RSSmeme has been “ completely overhauled , ” a process which has resulted in the creation of an API .
What does the API do ?
In Golub ’s words , it offers the ability to “ get feeds for any type of filter .
A basic example of this is something as simple as an English - only feed .
Or more specifically , users can sift RSSmeme for stories that , say , are published by Mashable and associated with stories pertaining to Google in one way or another .
The API is also promised to allow bloggers to “ pull notes out of RSSmeme and put them back on their blog (s ) . ”
Golub explains that one need only write a plugin to accomplish that task , as all necessary data can be easily accessed through the API .
Already Golub has created something of a starter example of the API ’s external utility in the form of a “ most shared stories ” widget for one ’s blog .
You can see the widget employed on his personal site .
Furthermore , he has established a mobile version of RSSmeme , for users interested in browsing shared stories on the go .
It is quite elementary in nature , having purportedly been created with some 50 lines of code .
It can be accessed at : ‘ http://m.rssmeme.com.'
Of course , ReadBurner has offered a website designed exclusively for mobile - access for about a month now .
It too is openly accessible .
Simply direct your phone ’s browser to : ‘ http://m.readburner.com.’

Colbert will someday be in the history books for his speaking truth to power at the 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner
There is a hidden section at the Randi Rhodes Message Board for feedback questions .
I asked how the original moderators acquired their positions .
The responses were mostly satiric spam .
What are they trying to hide ?
For a board that has yet to explain how over four years of archives have been scrubbed , this further obfuscation has me wondering how they are any different than the other major " progressive " boards who scrub , delete , and censor .
Astroturfing and controlled opposition appears to be everywhere on the internet .

Soc -
My general understanding ( from Randi ) is that the AAR folks scrubbed her site , even though it was hers , after she left AAR .
In any case , it was n't her , if that 's what you were implying , but rather the folks who were n't happy with her for leaving , as I understand it .

All internet moderators are definitely CIA plants , but do n't tell anyone because that would ruin it .
And Stephen Colbert is beyond all doubt the World 's Greatest Living Human for his work at that Correspondents ' Dinner .
It was beautiful and it was courageous and ultimately American .
He deserves a national holiday in his honor for it ... at the least .
Helen Thomas too .

Sorry for any confusion .
I 'm implying that Randi Rhodes has next to nothing to do with the RRMB .
It does seem to have been AAR 's decision to scrub the archives .
There is definitely a dark cloud over the " progressive " message boards .
I did not invent this .
Hey Agent 99 , how did you get the moderator position here ?
Did you post at Democratic Underground ?
A friend of Brad 's in real life ?
Perhaps it does n't really matter , but simple questions like this should n't be so tough to explain .
And it would n't be CIA , we 're talking more like netvocates , advantage consultants , bivings group , astroturfers .
The FBI with Hal Turner .
The CIA is more about other countries .
NSA and DHS would be the types to post .
Along with the astroturfers like the groups I mentioned .

As I recall , I was intensely grateful to discover Brad existed and was doing what he was doing .
It had been months since 2004 was stolen and I was beside myself about it ... with no relief from my fellow liberals ... just a lot tsking .
So I braved the assault to my senses of his old theme and found myself practically living on this blog .
I found myself helping answer questions that hung in the air .
I reiterate , I was profoundly grateful for Brad 's focus and work .
So , naturally , I merely told him I would help him however I could .
I still feel that way ....
I have never so much as read a line of DU .
I thought people were talking about depleted uranium whenever they mentioned it .
A troll , who accused me of being from DU , had to explain to me what DU was .
I have no other internet identity .
It 's Agent 99 here , and just plain 99 elsewhere .
And , besides , my bosses at The Agency gave him no choice .

Thanks for the response .
That makes sense .
I found this place because Bev Harris and Brad were getting attacked as fakes .
I 've yet to see any proof of that .
I started to write here a bit , when Brad fought back against DailyKos to set that record straight .
I know firsthand what it 's like to be labelled a " conspiracy nutter " based on ad hominems rather than on the truth .
It is unsettling to realise that we can't trust our electoral system .
Thanks to BradBlog for documenting this specific problem and for allowing freedom of thought , expression , and association .

Baby boys should be treated gently , says Dr Sebastian Kraemer
Baby boys who are taught to be tough are less confident and more aggressive , says Dr Sebastian Kraemer from London 's Whittington Hospital .
He told doctors at the Royal College of Psychiatrists ' annual conference in Harrogate boys were naturally fragile .
Parents should treat boys as gently as girls to compensate for this , he said .
In his lecture , The Fragile Male , Dr Kraemer said if boys were treated more like girls as young babies they would develop better social skills .
If you want a real man treat your baby boy as weak not as strong
Dr Sebastian Kraemer , child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Whittington Hospital
He said newborn baby boys lagged behind baby girls in most respects .
Boys were more likely to experience reading difficulties and have autism , Asperger 's syndrome and disruptive behaviour .
They got poorer examination grades , were more vulnerable to depression and were more likely to commit crimes than girls , he said .
" If parents know that boys are a bit behind in their development and generally weaker in every way except muscle then they will do a better job than they are doing now , " he said .
" If you want a real man treat your baby boy as weak not as strong , then he will become strong . "
Dr Kraemer said , by looking at research , the critical period appeared to be in the first month of life when the brain is still developing .
This is when parents should pay extra care , he said .
" It means looking after your baby like a fragile creature not a little lump of muscle .
Tough love
" If boys are treated in a tough slugs and snails way they are more likely to become football hooligans than generous , strong , courageous men . "
He said mollycoddling hardwired self - confidence that was not based on bluster , but was genuine and did not need to be constantly asserted .
Dr Nick Barlow , consultant paediatric psychologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary , said : " We know that boys who are brought up to be macho and to overcome anything that threatens them are more likely to get into trouble in adolescence and adulthood . "
He said this was because men were more competitive and single - minded , and less likely to appreciate the other side of arguments .
" They go straight forward for doing what they believe is right in their own eyes and they can't be seen to back down .
" That is a dangerous , anti-social and not very understanding view of how to get your own way , " he said .
" The attitudes of the parents when the child is born are extremely important on how the child is going to integrate during school years and later on . "
The discovery of an ancient city buried beneath the sands of modern - day Syria has provided evidence for a Hellenistic settlement that existed for more than six centuries extending into the time of the Roman Empire .
The site provides a unique insight into the structures of a pre-Roman Hellenistic settlement .
The project , funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF , sheds new light on city life in the Hellenistic period .
The Syrian deserts have long kept an important secret hidden deep beneath their sands ­ the remains of the pre-Roman Hellenistic settlement of Palmyra .
Until now , the only evidence for the existence of such a settlement was to be found in historical writing .
As part of an FWF - funded joint project , the Institute of Classical Archaeology at the University of Vienna , the German Archaeological Institute and the Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums in Syria have been the first to track down the location of this early city .
Six centuries of Hellenistic culture lay hidden under the sand .
The site has provided a unique insight into the structures of settlements at that time .
( Excavations as at 2007 , © A. Schmidt - Colinet )
Moreover , their findings are now producing a unique insight into the structures of a pre-Roman Hellenistic settlement .
" Although a settlement dating back to the second millennium BC has already been identified as Palmyra , a new settlement was evidently established at another site in the third century BC and was later abandoned in the Roman period .
While we know a great deal about the later Roman city , the Hellenistic settlement of Palmyra has never been investigated , " explains Project Manager Prof .
Andreas Schmidt - Colinet from the Institute of Classical Archaeology at the University of Vienna .
" The current investigation gives us a unique opportunity to analyse the transition from the Hellenistic period to the time of the Roman Empire by studying the settlement structures that have been uncovered here over a wide area . "
CHRONOLOGY OF THE SETTLEMENT & TRADE ROUTES
In view of the large size of the area , the project has thus far focussed on small sections of the ancient urban settlement structures .
This work is already yielding results , particularly as regards the chronology of the individual phases of construction and the trade and commercial background of the Hellenistic " Sand City " .
The investigations show that building activities were divided across various major phases stretching from the third century B.C. to the end of the third century A.D.
This indicates that the site could have fallen out of use around the time when the city was conquered by the Roman emperor Aurelian or around the construction of the wall under the emperor Diocletian .
Pottery finds are particularly important for helping to determine the trade routes used by the citizens of Palmyra .
Overall , the archaeologists have found far larger amounts of local domestic pottery than imported ceramic goods from other areas .
Nevertheless , amphorae from Rhodes ­ large clay containers used to transport wine ­ and goods imported from Africa show that Palmyra had connections with far flung corners of the world from the late Hellenistic period until the late Roman period .
Prof. Schmidt - Colinet comments on the team 's discoveries : " Our pottery finds reveal a continuous progression of Hellenistic - Roman ceramics over a period of 600 years .
What 's more , we now have the first ever archaeological evidence for a Hellenistic settlement with continuous habitation over six centuries extending into the Roman period . "
ANIMALS ON THE MENU
The team of archaeologists has also uncovered initial evidence for the keeping and usage of domestic animals .
" Kitchen waste " shows that the inhabitants kept and ate primarily sheep and goats , as well as dromedaries , cattle and pigs .
In contrast , gazelles , wildfowl and fish seldom appeared on the menus of the Hellenistic inhabitants of Palmyra .
Looking to the future , the archaeologists aim to completely uncover a monumental courtyard - type structure at the centre of the Hellenistic settlement that has close parallels with Syrian caravan structures .
However , the team is not just hoping to reveal how or why the individual rooms were built , it also wants to determine the overall importance of the structure for the city of Palmyra .
At the end of the project , the findings from the excavations , which have been made possible by the FWF , will be combined with aerial photographs and structures that are still visible above ground to provide a topographical map of Palmyra .

The planet may be orbiting a " failed star " called a brown dwarf Astronomers have sighted the smallest extrasolar planet yet which orbits a " normal " star , or a brown dwarf .
Discovering a planet with a similar mass to that of Earth is considered the " holy grail " of research into planets that lie outside our Solar System .
It is vital because researchers want to find other worlds that could host life .
A smaller world has been found orbiting a spinning neutron star known as a pulsar , but these produce radiation that would be lethal to any life forms .
The latest planetary discovery orbits an object which is itself of such low mass it may be either be a " failed star " known as a brown dwarf , or a very low - mass hydrogen burning star called a red dwarf .
Astronomers found the new world using a technique called gravitational microlensing .
This takes advantage of the fact that light is bent as the rays pass close to a massive object , like a star .
The planet , called MOA - 2007 - BLG - 192Lb , is about 3.3 times the size of Earth .
Some researchers have suggested the planet could have a thick atmosphere and have even speculated there could be a liquid ocean on its surface .
Internal heat coming from within the planet could be warming up the surface
Nicholas Rattenbury , University of Manchester Nasa 's planned James Webb Space Telescope , due to launch in 2013 , could search for signatures of life on Earth - mass planets orbiting low - mass stars in the vicinity of the Sun.
Lead author David Bennett , from the University of Notre Dame , commented : " This is leading the way to finding lower mass planets , including Earth - mass planets , by microlensing .
He added : " It also encourages astronomers who search for planets in the habitable zones of very low - mass stars . "
Water world ?
The planet orbits its host star , or brown dwarf , with an orbital radius similar to that of Venus .
But the host is likely to be between 3,000 and one million times fainter than the Sun , so the top of the planet 's atmosphere is likely to be colder than Pluto .
It would also be extremely dim if one were to stand on its surface .
Nicholas Rattenbury , a co-author from the University of Manchester and Jodrell Bank , told BBC News : " Our best ideas about how planets form suggests the planet could have quite a thick atmosphere .
This atmosphere could act like a big blanket , keeping the planet warm .
" So even though there 's very little energy coming from its host star , hitting the planet and warming it up that way , internal heat coming from within the planet could be warming up the surface .
" This has led to some speculation that there could , possibly , be a liquid ocean on the surface of this planet .
The reason why that 's exciting , is one of the properties we'd like to have on a habitable planet is liquid water on the surface . "
MOA - 2007 - BLG - 192Lb was found with the new MOA - II telescope at New Zealand 's Mount John Observatory .
The technique employed to find the new planet uses the gravitational field of a star like a lens - magnifying the light from a distant background star .
This effect occurs only when the two stars are in almost perfect alignment .
Astronomers are able to detect planets orbiting the lens star if the light from the background star is warped by one or more planets .

The reasons for the diminishing wild salmon stocks By Rajesh Mirchandani
BBC News , California and Oregon
The US government will decide next week whether to issue a complete season - long ban on salmon fishing off the Pacific coast of the US .
Wild salmon is big business on the Pacific coast of the US The proposal comes in response to a drastic collapse in fish stocks .
But fishermen 's groups say it will devastate their industry and cost the local economy billions of dollars .

He has worked on the ocean for 41 years , many of them in his current role , running charter tours for sports fishing enthusiasts .
We pass dozens of other such boats , testament to this important part of San Francisco 's tourist infrastructure .
But the fishing tour business is quiet these days .
In fact , Mr Bentivegna tells me : " Last year was probably the slowest year I have ever had for catching salmon . "
Economic cost Commercial fishermen are facing tough times too .
California and Oregon , western states with considerable commercial and recreational fishing industries , are looking at the very real possibility of not being able to fish any salmon at all this year .
It could cost the local economy more than $ 3bn ( £ 1.5 bn ) .
I just do n't think this is the industry to get into any more
Phil Bentivegna
The reason is that stocks of wild Pacific Chinook salmon - a staple food along America 's west coast for hundreds of years - are in drastic freefall .
One measure of the population is the number of salmon heading from freshwater spawning grounds to the ocean , a process called " returns " .
This year , the Chinook return is expected to number some 56,000 ; the minimum needed to keep the salmon fishing industry sustainable is at least 122,000 .
In past years , returns upwards of 200,000 salmon have been common .
The recreational salmon fishing season should have opened any day now ; instead a temporary ban is in place , while experts decide how to respond .
Next week , the US government is widely expected to ban all salmon fishing - affecting Chinook and also the coho salmon - off a 1,200 - mile stretch of the west coast of the US for the whole season , up to seven months .
An alternative option would allow very limited catches .
Duncan Maclean , who advises California 's fishing industry , says fishermen realise there is no alternative .
" I 'm supposed to fight for every fish we catch and I have no fight this year , " he says .
" I can not justify a fishery because the numbers are so low . "
Ocean conditions
For once , fishermen are not getting most of the blame .
This is not simply a problem of over - fishing .
There are a variety of factors at play , some natural , others man-made .
Changes in ocean conditions , perhaps brought about by global warming , mean less food for salmon to eat , so fewer make it upstream to spawn .
Those that do face risks too : river water contains pollution from agriculture and industry , a potentially toxic environment for salmon , while river levels are often low as water is increasingly diverted to irrigate crops and supply large cities such as Los Angeles .
There may be no respite ahead either .
Putah Creek is a shallow tributary of the Sacramento River , exactly the type of watercourse where most wild Pacific salmon start life .
Fish biologist Professor Peter Moyle leads a team of scientists from nearby University of California at Davis .
They are pulling 20 ft ( 6 m ) nets through the muddy water , then dragging them on to the bank and examining the contents .
The process , called seining , is a crude way of counting the number of young salmon in a river .
In a normal year , each haul should contain between five and 10 young salmon .
" We got nothing , " Prof Moyle announces , " except one little sunfish . "
According to Prof Moyle , the number of young salmon this year is at best a quarter of what it should be .
He , like many other experts , foresees further gloom ahead .
" The fishery is going to be shut down for at least two years , " he predicts .
' Time to clean up '
Some 600 miles to the north , the mist clings to the wooded hills of Oregon and a cloud hangs over the quiet fishing port of Tillamook .
This is a town dependent on salmon and crab .
As Darus Peake , owner of the Tillamook Bay Boathouse and a state fishing adviser , says : " It 's going to hurt everybody from the gas station owner on the corner to the gift shop to the motel to the restaurant ... it 's quite a trickle down . "
Prof Peter Moyle foresees further gloom ahead for salmon fishermen
In Mr Peake 's mind a salmon - fishing ban would be a quick fix for a deeper , man-made , problem .
" We have got to start looking at ourselves ... we need to go back to our natural resources , clean up our natural resources and then go on from there , " he says .
Back in San Francisco Bay , Mr Bentivegna is pointing out the famous landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island , just as he has for many years .
He is running a few sightseeing tours now , no fishing trips and expects to lose nearly half his business this year .
The prospect of a season - long ban on salmon fishing makes him fear for future generations .
" I 'm glad I 'm at the end of my career instead of at the beginning of my career when this is happening , " he says .
" I know a couple of young skippers that are in their late 20s or early 30s with families and house payments .
I really feel bad for them ...
I just do n't think this is the industry to get into any more . "

Bei der Tätigkeit im Büro ist das lange statische verharren oft nachteilig für Leib und Leben und führt oft zu Rückenproblemen .
Ein dynamisches Sitzen ist mit in der Höhe verstellbaren Schreibtischen denkbar .
Der mittlere Büroarbeiter verbringt 80.000 Std. in seinem Arbeitsleben am Schreibtisch .
Dabei war unser aller Körper nie dafür gedacht , im zeitverlauf seines Lebens einen so führenden Teil sitzend zu verbringen .
An Stelle wie unsre Ahnen durch die Wälder zu durchstreifen und Nahrung einzusammeln , verleben wir heute im Auto , am Büroeinrichtung und vorm Fernseher .
Eigentlich hat der unruhige Zappelphilipp alles richtig gemacht .
Weil der Bub nicht ruhig am Tisch sitzen wollte , hat er sich ständig mit dessen Stuhl bewegt .
Hätte es ihm seine Mutter} nicht verboten , wäre er während des Mahlzeit zu sich nehmens wahrscheinlich auch aufgestanden .
Der junge Philipp wollte in einer Sitzweise einfach nicht verharren .
Aus pädagogischer Perspektive war es eher gedankenlos , aus physiologischer Sicht jedoch sinnvoll .
Die Schwierigkeit der starren Körperhaltung tritt heute weniger im Esszimmer auf , sondern am Arbeitsplatz , in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland nahezu 20 Hundertausende Leute wenigstens acht Std. jeden Tag sitzen .
Die modernen Arbeitsplätze sind mehr und mehr ergonomisch gestaltet und dazu zählen auch in der Höhe verstellbare Schreibtische .
Sie erfüllen die Anforderungen der Arbeitsmediziner und offerieren einen gesünderen Tag im Büpro .
Der Steh - Sitz - Tisch kann von dem Arbeitnehmer entsprechend Wunsch in ein Pult oder einen Büroschreibtisch transformiert werden .
Eine
Welt des ruhigeren Arbeitens wir dadadurch erschaffen , da durch die ständige Motorik geringere Beschwerden entstehen .
Höhenverstellbare Bürotische erlauben Abwechslung zwischen Sitzen und Stehen am Arbeitsplatz im Büro .
Ein eben solches dynamisches Arbeiten steigert das Wohlbefinden und als Folge auch die Rentabilität .
Erscheinungen von Ermüdung tauchen viel kaum auf , da der Angestellter nicht für Stunden in der gleichen Stellung vorm Display sitzt .
Da auf Schreibtischen Gerätschaften mit einer Stromversorgung , d.h. mit Leitungen positioniert werden , müssen senkrechte und horizontale Installationskanäle gegeben sein .
Dies vermeidet ein Stolpern wegen freiliegender Kabel .
Was ist beim Büroschreibtisch Kauf wesentlich ?
Welche Höhe ist die richtige ?
So stellen Sie Ihren Büroschreibtisch durch und durch ein Die Optik : vom persönlichen Geschmack geprägt .
Arbeit am in der Höhe verstellbaren Schreibtisch Warum an Steh - Sitz - Tischen arbeiten ?
Ergonomisch Arbeiten am höhenverstellbaren Schreibtisch Der richtige Pult : vor dem Kauf Einsatz beachten Die ideale Größe der Arbeitsplatte
Flexible Bürotische : Stehplatz auf der Arbeit bevorzugt
Es gibt höhenverstellbare Schreibtische , die mit Hilfe einer Kurbel verstellt werden können .
Die luxuriösere Variante kann elektrisch hoch und herunter gefahren werden .
Sie kostet jedoch auch mehr Geld .
Alle Schreibtische gibt es in diversen Maßen und Modellen , entsprechend Geschmack .
Unser Körper ist nicht zum Sitzen erschaffen .
Leider erhöhen sich jedoch die Jobs , die größtenteils im in sitzender Position zu erledigen sind .
Deshalb ist neben dem geeigneten Möbelstück ( z.B. : Ergonomischer Bürosessel oder Aktivstuhl ) vor allem auch ein ergonomischer Bürotisch wichtig .
Nicht korrektes Sitzen , in erster Linie statisches Sitzen führt zu Verspannungen im Schulter - Nacken - Bereich und nachhaltig zu muskulären Dysbalancen , wie Muskelverkürzungen , Muskelschwächung oder Muskelverhärtungen .
So weit muss man es auf keinen Fall kommen lassen .
Zur wichtige Bewegung im Arbeitsleben sorgt ein Bürotisch , der sich manuell oder automatisch in der Höhe verstellen lässt .
Es ist wichtig , dass zunächst der Drehstuhl korrekt eingestellt wird und anschließend erst der höhenverstellbare Büroschreibtisch .
Die passende Höhe kann bei jedem andersartig aussehen .
Das Höhenniveau der Armlehne am Drehstuhl gibt die Höhe des Schreibtisches vor .
Dementsprechend muss die Armlehne eine verlängerte Tischkante sein .
Besitzt der Stuhl keine Armlehnen , ist die Höhe des Schreitisches korrekt ausgewählt , wenn die Arme locker auf diesem liegen .
Dabei bilden Oberarm und unterer Arm etwa 90 Grad aus .
Die Vorzüge für Ihr Wohlbefinden
Bewegung ist das Wichtigste !
Leider prallen der natürliche Drang sowie die Notwendigkeit zur körperlichen Bewegung stets mit unserem Büroalltag , der sich meist ausschließlich sitzend mit Arbeitshandlungen verbringt .
Und das meist zu Ungunsten unserers Wohlbefindens .
Durch das ständige arbeiten im Sitzen nehmen wir nicht alleine Rückenbeschwerden in Kauf , auch unsere Effektivität sinkt enorm unter der monotonen Arbeitshaltung .
Umso bedeutender ist deshalb eine ergonomische Arbeitsstelle , um den typischen Krankheiten des Sitzens entgegenzuwirken .
Unter der Steh - Sitz - Dynamik versteht man den Wechsel zwischen Stehen und arbeit im Sitzen am Arbeitsstelle mittels in der Höhe verstellbaren Schreibtischen .
Letztendlich findet man nur einen einzelnen Grund die Arbeitsstelle durch einen höhenverstellbaren Bürotisch auszustatten : Die Gesundheit .
Was ist ein höhenverstellbarer Schreibtisch ?
Dass an Büroschreibtischen auch im Stehen gearbeitet wird kann , ist praxistauglich .
Im Stehen und Sitzen der Arbeit nachzugehen , schafft Vielfalt vom reinen Sitzen und es wird keiner länger missen wollen .
Warum das so ist , spüren sensible Menschen sofort und belegen Untersuchungen schon seit einiger Zeit .
Im Stehen regt den Kreislauf des Blutes an , tiefere Atemzüge werden durchgeführt , weil der Bauch entspannter ist , die Puls steigt , und der Körper verbrennt mehr Energiereserven als beim Sitzen .
Die Unterschiede zur reinen Sitzen sind nicht schwerwiegend , aber sie fördern die Gesundheit .
Das gilt auch für den Aufbau der Körpermuskulatur .
Eine übliche Entgegnung des Körpers ist die Abnahme von Körpergewicht .
Beine oder Arme in Gips werden schon nach wenigen Tagen kraftloser . …
Anatomy of Linux synchronization methods
Kernel atomics , spinlocks , and mutexes
This article explores many of the synchronization or locking mechanisms that are available in the Linux kernel .
It presents the application program interfaces ( APIs ) for many of the available methods from the 2.6.23 kernel .
But before you dig into the APIs , you need to understand the problem that 's being solved .
Concurrency and locking
Synchronization methods are necessary when the property of concurrency exists .
Concurrency exists when two or more processes execute over the same time period and potentially interact with one another ( for example , sharing the same set of resources ) .
Concurrency can occur on uniprocessor ( UP ) hosts where multiple threads share the same CPU and preemption creates race conditions .
Preemption is sharing the CPU transparently by temporarily pausing one thread to allow another to execute .
A race condition occurs when two or more threads manipulate a shared data item and the result depends upon timing of the execution .
Concurrency also exists in multiprocessor ( MP ) machines , where threads executing simultaneously in each processor share the same data .
Note that in the MP case there is true parallelism because the threads execute simultaneously .
In the UP case , parallelism is created by preemption .
The difficulties of concurrency exist in both modes .
The Linux kernel supports concurrency in both modes .
The kernel itself is dynamic , and race conditions can be created in a number of ways .
The Linux kernel also supports multiprocessing known as symmetric multiprocessing ( SMP ) .
You can learn more about SMP in the Resources section later in this article .
To combat the issue of race conditions , the concept of a critical section was created .
A critical section is a portion of code that is protected against multiple access .
This portion of code can manipulate shared data or a shared service ( such as a hardware peripheral ) .
Critical sections operate on the principle of mutual exclusion ( when a thread is within a critical section , all other threads are excluded from entering ) .
A problem created within critical sections is the condition of deadlock .
Consider two separate critical sections , each protecting a different resource .
For each resource , a lock is available , called A and B in this example .
Now consider two threads that require access to the resources .
Thread X takes lock A , and thread Y takes lock B .
While those locks are held , each thread attempts to take the other lock that is currently held by the other thread ( thread X wants lock B , and thread Y wants lock A ) .
The threads are now deadlocked because they each hold one resource and want the other .
A simple solution is to always take locks in the same order , which allows a thread to complete .
Other solutions involve detecting this situation .
Table 1 defines important concurrency terms covered here .
Table 1 . Important definitions in concurrency
Term Definition Race condition Situation where simultaneous manipulation of a resource by two or more threads causes inconsistent results .
Critical section Segment of code that coordinates access to a shared resource .
Mutual exclusion Property of software that ensures exclusive access to a shared resource .
Deadlock Special condition created by two or more processes and two or more resource locks that keep processes from doing productive work .
Linux synchronization methods
Now that you have a little theory under your belt and an understanding of the problem to be solved , let 's look at the various ways that Linux supports concurrency and mutual exclusion .
In the early days , mutual exclusion was provided by disabling interrupts , but this form of locking is inefficient ( even though you can still find traces of it in the kernel ) .
This method also does n't scale well and does n't guarantee mutual exclusion on other processors .
In the following review of locking mechanisms , we first look at the atomic operators , which provide protection for simple variables ( counters and bitmasks ) .
Simple spinlocks and reader / writer spinlocks are then covered as an efficient busy - wait lock for SMP architectures .
Finally , we explore kernel mutexes , which are built on top of the atomic API .
Atomic operations
The simplest means of synchronization in the Linux kernel are the atomic operations .
Atomic means that the critical section is contained within the API function .
No locking is necessary because it 's inherent in the call .
As C can't guarantee atomic operations , Linux relies on the underlying architecture to provide this .
Since architectures differ greatly , you 'll find varying implementations of the atomic functions .
Some are provided almost entirely in assembly , while others resort to C and disabling interrupts using local_irq_save and local_irq_restore .
Older locking methods A bad way to implement locking in the kernel is by disabling hard interrupts for the local CPU .
These functions are available and are used ( sometimes by the atomic operators ) but are not recommended .
The local_irq_save routine disables interrupts , and local_irq_restore restores the previously - enabled interrupts .
These routines are reentrant , meaning they may be called within context of one another .
The atomic operators are ideal for situations where the data you need to protect is simple , such as a counter .
While simple , the atomic API provides a number of operators for a variety of situations .
Here 's a sample use of the API .
To declare an atomic variable , you simply declare a variable of type atomic_t .
This structure contains a single int element .
Next , you ensure that your atomic variable is initialized using the ATOMIC_INIT symbolic constant .
In the case shown in Listing 1 , the atomic counter is set to zero .
It 's also possible to initialize the atomic variable at runtime using the atomic_set function .
Listing 1 . Creating and initializing an atomic variable
atomic_t my_counter = ATOMIC_INIT(0 ) ; ... or ... atomic_set ( & my_counter , 0 ) ;
The atomic API supports a rich set of functions covering many use cases .
You can read the contents of an atomic variable with atomic_read and also add a specific value to a variable with atomic_add .
The most common operation is to simply increment the variable , which is provided with atomic_inc .
The subtraction operators are also available , providing the converse of the add and increment operations .
Listing 2 demonstrates these functions .
Listing 2 . Simple arithmetic atomic functions
val = atomic_read ( & my_counter ) ; atomic_add ( 1 , & my_counter ) ; atomic_inc ( & my_counter ) ; atomic_sub ( 1 , & my_counter ) ; atomic_dec ( & my_counter ) ;
The API also supports a number of other common use cases , including the operate - and - test routines .
These allow the atomic variable to be manipulated and then tested ( all performed as one atomic operation ) .
One special function called atomic_add_negative is used to add to the atomic variable and then return true if the resulting value is negative .
This is used by some of the architecture - dependent semaphore functions in the kernel .
While many of the functions do not return the value of the variable , two in particular operate and return the resulting value ( atomic_add_return and atomic_sub_return ) , as shown in Listing 3 .
Listing 3 . Operate - and - test atomic functions
if ( atomic_sub_and_test ( 1 , &my_counter ) ) { // my_counter is zero } if ( atomic_dec_and_test ( & my_counter ) ) { // my_counter is zero } if ( atomic_inc_and_test ( & my_counter ) ) { // my_counter is zero } if ( atomic_add_negative ( 1 , & my_counter ) ) { // my_counter is less than zero } val = atomic_add_return ( 1 , & my_counter ) ) ; val = atomic_sub_return ( 1 , &my_counter ) ) ;
If your architecture supports 64 - bit long types ( BITS_PER_LONG is 64 ) , then long_t atomic operations are available .
You can see the available long operations in linux / include / asm - generic / atomic.h .
You 'll also find support for bitmask operations with the atomic API .
Rather than arithmetic operations ( as explored earlier ) , you 'll find set and clear operations .
Many drivers use these atomic operations , particularly SCSI .
The use of bitmask atomic operations is slightly different than arithmetic because only two operations are available ( set mask and clear mask ) .
You provide a value and the bitmask upon which the operation is to be performed , as shown in Listing 4 .
Listing 4 . Bitmask atomic functions
unsigned long my_bitmask ; atomic_clear_mask ( 0 , &my_bitmask ) ; atomic_set_mask ( ( 1<< 24 ) , &my_bitmask ) ;
Atomic API prototypes Implementations for the atomic operations are architecture dependent and can therefore be found in ./linux / include/asm-<arch>/atomic.h .
Spinlocks
Spinlocks are a special way of ensuring mutual exclusion using a busy - wait lock .
When the lock is available , it is taken , the mutually - exclusive action is performed , and then the lock is released .
If the lock is not available , the thread busy - waits on the lock until it is available .
While busy - waiting may seem inefficient , it can actually be faster than putting the thread to sleep and then waking it up later when the lock is available .
Spinlocks are really only useful in SMP systems , but because your code will end up running on an SMP system , adding them for UP systems is the right thing to do .
Spinlocks are available in two varieties : full locks and reader / writer locks .
Let 's look at the full lock variety first .
First you create a new spinlock through a simple declaration .
This can be initialized in place or through a call to spin_lock_init .
Each of the variants shown in Listing 5 accomplishes the same result .
Listing 5 . Creating and initializing a spinlock
spinlock_t my_spinlock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
; ... or ... DEFINE_SPINLOCK ( my_spinlock ) ; ... or ... spin_lock_init ( &my_spinlock ) ;
Now that you have a spinlock defined , there are a number of locking variants that you can use .
Each is useful in different contexts .
First is the spin_lock and spin_unlock variant shown in Listing 6 .
This is the simplest and performs no interrupt disabling but includes full memory barriers .
This variant assumes no interactions with interrupt handlers and this lock .
Listing 6 . Spinlock lock and unlock functions
spin_lock ( &my_spinlock ) ; // critical section spin_unlock ( &my_spinlock ) ;
Next is the irqsave and irqrestore pair shown in Listing 7 .
The spin_lock_irqsave function acquires the spinlock and disables interrupts on the local processor ( in the SMP case ) .
The spin_unlock_irqrestore function releases the spinlock and restores the interrupts ( via the flags argument ) .
Listing 7 . Spinlock variant with local CPU interrupt disable
spin_lock_irqsave ( &my_spinlock , flags ) ; // critical section spin_unlock_irqrestore ( &my_spinlock , flags ) ;
A less safe variant of spin_lock_irqsave / spin_unlock_irqrestore is spin_lock_irq / spin_unlock_irq .
I recommend that you avoid this variant because it makes assumptions about interrupt states .
Finally , if your kernel thread shares data with a bottom half , then you can use another variant of the spinlock .
A bottom half is a way to defer work from interrupt handling to be done later in a device driver .
This version of the spinlock disables soft interrupts on the local CPU .
This has the effect of preventing softirqs , tasklets , and bottom halves from running on the local CPU .
This variant is shown in Listing 8 .
Listing 8 . Spinlock functions for bottom - half interactions
spin_lock_bh ( &my_spinlock ) ; // critical section spin_unlock_bh ( &my_spinlock ) ;
Reader / writer spinlocks
In many cases , access to data is indicated by many readers and less writers ( accessing the data for read is more common than accessing for write ) .
To support this model , reader / writer locks were created .
What 's interesting with this model is that multiple readers are permitted access to the data at one time , but only one writer .
If a writer has the lock , no reader is allowed to enter the critical section .
If only a reader has the lock , then multiple readers are permitted in the critical section .
Listing 9 demonstrates this model .
Listing 9 . Reader / writer spinlock functions
rwlock_t my_rwlock ; rwlock_init ( &my_rwlock ) ; write_lock ( & my_rwlock ) ; // critical section -- can read and write write_unlock ( & my_rwlock ) ; read_lock ( & my_rwlock ) ; // critical section -- can read only read_unlock ( & my_rwlock ) ;
You 'll also find variants of reader / writer spinlocks for bottom halves and interrupt request ( IRQ ) saving depending on the situation for which you require the lock .
Obviously , if your use of the lock is reader / writer in nature , this spinlock should be used over the standard spinlock , which does n't differentiate between readers and writers .
Kernel mutexes
Mutexes are available in the kernel as a way to accomplish semaphore behavior .
The kernel mutex is implemented on top of the atomic API , though this is not visible to the kernel user .
The mutex is simple , but there are some rules you should remember .
Only one task may hold the mutex at a time , and only this task can unlock the mutex .
There is no recursive locking or unlocking of mutexes , and mutexes may not be used within interrupt context .
But mutexes are faster and more compact than the current kernel semaphore option , so if they fit your need , they 're the choice to use .
You create and initialize a mutex in one operation through the DEFINE_MUTEX macro .
This creates a new mutex and initializes the structure .
You can see this implementation in ./linux / include/linux/mutex.h .
DEFINE_MUTEX ( my_mutex ) ;
The mutex API provides five functions : three are used for locking , one for unlocking , and another for testing a mutex .
Let 's first look at the locking functions .
The first function , mutex_trylock , is used in situations where you want the lock immediately or you want control to be returned to you if the mutex is not available .
This function is shown in Listing 10 .
Listing 10 .
Trying to grab a mutex with mutex_trylock
ret = mutex_trylock ( & my_mutex ) ; if ( ret != 0 ) { //
Got the lock !
} else { //
Did not get the lock }
If , instead , you want to wait for the lock , you can call mutex_lock .
This call returns if the mutex is available ; otherwise , it sleeps until the mutex is available .
In either case , when control is returned , the caller holds the mutex .
Finally , the mutex_lock_interruptible is used in situations where the caller may sleep .
In this case , the function may return - EINTR .
Both of these calls are shown in Listing 11 .
Listing 11 .
Locking a mutex with the potential to sleep
mutex_lock ( &my_mutex ) ; //
Lock is now held by the caller .
if ( mutex_lock_interruptible ( &my_mutex ) != 0 ) { //
Interrupted by a signal , no mutex held }
After a mutex is locked , it must be unlocked .
This is accomplished with the mutex_unlock function .
This function cannot be called from interrupt context .
Finally , you can check the status of a mutex through a call to mutex_is_locked .
This call actually compiles to an inline function .
If the mutex is held ( locked ) , then one is returned ; otherwise , zero .
Listing 12 demonstrates these functions .
Listing 12 .
Testing a mutex with mutex_is_locked
mutex_unlock ( & my_mutex ) ; if ( mutex_is_locked ( &my_mutex ) == 0 ) { //
Mutex is unlocked }
While the mutex API has its constraints because it 's based upon the atomic API , it 's efficient and , therefore , worthwhile if it fits your need .
Big kernel lock
Finally , there remains the big kernel lock ( BKL ) .
Its use in the kernel is diminishing , but the remaining uses are the most difficult to remove .
The BKL made multiprocessor Linux possible , but finer - grained locks have slowly replaced the BKL .
The BKL is provided through the functions lock_kernel and unlock_kernel .
See ./linux/lib/kernel_lock.c for more information .
Summary
Linux tends to be a Swiss Army knife when it comes to options , and its locking methods are no different .
The atomic locks provide not only a locking mechanism but also arithmetic or bitwise operations simultaneously .
Spinlocks offer a locking mechanism ( mostly for SMP ) and also reader / writer spinlocks that permit multiple readers but only a single writer to obtain a given lock .
Finally , mutexes are a relatively new locking mechanism that provides a simple API built on top of atomics .
Whatever you need , Linux has a locking scheme to protect your data .

Sporting thigh - high stockings and a debonair smile , the 19 - year - old ignored the dropped jaws and wide - eyed stares as she boarded a Bloor line train yesterday .
Hein was among some 75 semi-naked people who boarded the train together as part of a multi-city exercise by Improv Everywhere – an online collective dedicated to causing public chaos and joy .

Two other riders – Lindsay Olson and Mandy Leinbach , both 15 – took good looks at the bared flesh and traded comments as they gripped a pole to keep their balance .
" What is wrong with this civilization ? " asked a mystified Olson while one prankster , Jeremy Dziewir , 19 , did chin-ups in his briefs at the risk of revealing too much .

Two weeks ago , The Observer revealed how 17 - year - old student Rand Abdel - Qader was beaten to death by her father after becoming infatuated with a British soldier in Basra .
In this remarkable interview , Abdel - Qader Ali explains why he is unrepentant - and how police backed his actions .
Afif Sarhan in Basra and Caroline Davies report
For Abdel - Qader
Ali there is only one regret : that he did not kill his daughter at birth .
' If I had realised then what she would become , I would have killed her the instant her mother delivered her , ' he said with no trace of remorse .
Two weeks after The Observer revealed the shocking story of Rand Abdel - Qader , 17 , murdered because of her infatuation with a British soldier in Basra , southern Iraq , her father is defiant .
Sitting in the front garden of his well - kept home in the city 's Al - Fursi district , he remains a free man , despite having stamped on , suffocated and then stabbed his student daughter to death .
Abdel - Qader , 46 , a government employee , was initially arrested but released after two hours .
Astonishingly , he said , police congratulated him on what he had done .
' They are men and know what honour is , ' he said .
Rand , who was studying English at Basra University , was deemed to have brought shame on her family after becoming infatuated with a British soldier , 22 , known only as Paul .
She died a virgin , according to her closest friend Zeinab .
Indeed , her ' relationship ' with Paul , which began when she worked as a volunteer helping displaced families and he was distributing water , appears to have consisted of snatched conversations over less than four months .
But the young , impressionable Rand fell in love with him , confiding her feelings and daydreams to Zeinab , 19 .
It was her first youthful infatuation and it would be her last .
She died on 16 March after her father discovered she had been seen in public talking to Paul , considered to be the enemy , the invader and a Christian .
Though her horrified mother , Leila Hussein , called Rand 's two brothers , Hassan , 23 , and Haydar , 21 , to restrain Abdel - Qader as he choked her with his foot on her throat , they joined in .
Her shrouded corpse was then tossed into a makeshift grave without ceremony as her uncles spat on it in disgust .
' Death was the least she deserved , ' said Abdel - Qader .
' I do n't regret it .
I had the support of all my friends who are fathers , like me , and know what she did was unacceptable to any Muslim that honours his religion , ' he said .
Sitting on a chair by his front door and surrounded by the gerberas and white daisies he had planted in the family garden , Abel - Qader attempted to justify his actions .
' I do n't have a daughter now , and I prefer to say that I never had one .
That girl humiliated me in front of my family and friends .
Speaking with a foreign solider , she lost what is the most precious thing for any woman .
' People from western countries might be shocked , but our girls are not like their daughters that can sleep with any man they want and sometimes even get pregnant without marrying .
Our girls should respect their religion , their family and their bodies .
' I have only two boys from now on .
That girl was a mistake in my life .
I know God is blessing me for what I did , ' he said , his voice swelling with pride .
' My sons are by my side , and they were men enough to help me finish the life of someone who just brought shame to ours . '
Abdel - Qader , a Shia , says he was released from the police station ' because everyone knows that honour killings sometimes are impossible not to commit ' .
Chillingly , he said : ' The officers were by my side during all the time I was there , congratulating me on what I had done . '
It 's a statement that , if true , provides an insight into how vast the gulf remains between cultures in Iraq and between the Basra police the British army that trains them .
Sources have indicated that Abdel - Qader , who works in the health department , has been asked to leave because of the bad publicity , yet he will continue to draw a salary .
And it has been alleged by one senior unnamed official in the Basra governorate that he has received financial support by a local politician to enable him to ' disappear ' to Jordan for a few weeks , ' until the story has been forgotten ' - the usual practice in the 30 - plus cases of ' honour ' killings that have been registered since January alone .
Such treatment seems common in Basra , where militias have partial control , especially in the districts on the outskirts where Abdel - Qader lives .
While government security forces and British troops have control over the centre , around the fringes militants can still be seen everywhere on the streets or at the checkpoints they have erected .
And they have imposed strict laws of behaviour for all the local people , including what clothing should be worn and what religious practices should be observed .
There are reports of men having their hands cut off for looting and women being killed for prostitution .
Homosexuality is punishable by death , a sentence Abdel - Qader approves of with a passion .
' I have alerted my two sons .
They will have the same end [ as Rand ] if they become contaminated with any gay relationship .
These crimes deserve death - death in the name of God , ' he said .
He said his daughter 's ' bad genes were passed on from her mother ' .
Rand 's mother , 41 , remains in hiding after divorcing her husband in the immediate aftermath of the killing , living in fear of retribution from his family .
She also still bears the scars of the severe beating he inflicted on her , breaking her arm in the process , when she told him she was going .
' They can not accept me leaving him .
When I first left I went to a cousin's home , but every day they were delivering notes to my door saying I was a prostitute and deserved the same death as Rand , ' she said .
' She was killed by animals .
Every night when go to bed I remember the face of Rand calling for help while her father and brothers ended her life , ' she said , tears streaming down her face .
She was nervous , clearly terrified of being found , and her eyes constantly turned towards the window as she spoke .
' Rand told me about the soldier , but she swore it was just a friendship .
' She said she spoke with him because she was the only English speaker .
I raised her in a religious manner and she never went out alone until she joined the university and then later when she was doing aid work .
' Even now , I can not believe my ex-husband was able to kill our daughter .
He was n't a bad person .
During our 24 years of marriage , he was never aggressive .
But on that day , he was a different person . '
The mother is now trying to raise enough money to escape abroad .
' I miss my two boys , ' she said .
' But they have sent a message saying that I am wrong for defending Rand and that I should go back home and live like a blessed Muslim woman , ' said Leila , who is now volunteering with a local organisation campaigning for better protection for women in Basra .
One of those running the organisation , who did not want to be identified , said that Rand 's case was similar to so many reported in Basra , with the only difference being she was in love with a foreigner , rather than an Iraqi .
' There is n't too much to say .
Rand is dead .
It is a tragedy and will be a tragedy for many other families in Iraq in the days to come .
' According to information we have been given , some from Rand 's colleague , we have doubts that her love was reciprocated .
We have the impression that Rand was in love , but the English soldier was n't .
But , for a girl to be paid nice compliments about her beauty and her intelligence , it was enough for her to think she was in love .
' She is n't here any more for her mother to ask any of the questions she would like to .
Rand 's case had repercussions because she fell in love with a foreigner .
But what about the other girls murdered through " honour " killings because they fell in love with some of a different sect , or lost their virginity , or were forced to become prostitutes ?'
Rand 's mother used to call her ' Rose ' .
' That was my nickname for her because when she was born she was so beautiful , ' she said .
' Now , my lovely Rose is in her grave .
But , God will make her father pay , either in this world ... or in the world after . '

President Met Disgraced Lobbyist At Least Six Times
A congressional report reveals new ties between the WH and Jack Abramoff .
June 9 , 2008  --
The White House had stronger ties to disgraced superlobbyist Jack Abramoff than it has publicly admitted , according to a draft congressional report released Monday .
President Bush met Abramoff on at least four occasions the White House has yet to acknowledge , according to the draft report by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
And White House officials appeared as comfortable going to Abramoff and his lobbyists seeking tickets to sporting and entertainment events , as they did seeking input on personnel picks for plum jobs , the report found .
President Bush himself met Abramoff on at least six occasions , the report said , citing White House documents ; the White House had previously acknowledged only two .
When questions were first raised about Abramoff 's connection to Bush officials in January 2006 , then - White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush had personally met Abramoff on just two occasions , both at White House Hanukkah receptions .
McClellan told reporters there had also been " a few staff - level meetings " between officials and Abramoff and his team , but declined to provide more information .
That number was significantly higher , White House lawyer Emmet Flood indicated in correspondence to committee chairman Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , two years later , according to the draft report .
Flood 's letter identified six photographs of Bush with Abramoff or Abramoff 's family members , which the White House provided ( http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20080609142441.pdf) to investigators .
" Give me a break , " responded White House spokesman Tony Fratto when asked about the apparent discrepancy .
" Do you know how many people get their picture taken with the President of the United States ? "
McClellan , now publicizing his kiss - and - tell memoir , " What Happened , " did not respond to a request for comment made to his publicist .
" What Happened " does not mention Abramoff .
The committee 's draft report is based on documents it obtained from the White House and Abramoff 's old lobby firm as well as with interviews with former White House officials .
At least three former officials declined to answer some or all of the investigators ' questions , citing their Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination , the draft report said .
The report follows up on a September 2006 report on Abramoff and the White House by the same panel , which found Abramoff and his associates had billed clients for 485 contacts with the White House .
At that time , the White House criticized the document for relying on billing records which were " widely viewed as fraudulent , " and insisted that Abramoff " got nothing " for his efforts to influence White House decisions .
In its new draft report , the committee said that it could not confirm the majority of those 485 contacts by using the new documents it obtained from the White House and Abramoff 's old lobby firm , though the new documents identified others .
While investigators could not corroborate roughly 400 of the 485 contacts reported in Abramoff 's billing records , the new documents -- mostly emails -- indicated 70 other contacts had taken place between Abramoff 's team and White House officials which were not included in the billing records , the report said .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto called the report " warmed up leftovers " and " a joke . "
" Abramoff carried no weight here as the report makes clear , " Fratto wrote in an e-mail Monday afternoon .
" Abramoff was spectacularly unsuccessful in affecting policy , " he said .
" There 's nothing new here . "
The draft report 's findings , however , stated that " communications from Mr. Abramoff and his associates carried weight with White House officials . "
On " some occasions , " investigators found , " White House offiicals initiated contact with Mr. Abramoff and his associates to solicit recommendations on nominations for Administration posts . "
However , aside from ousting a Clinton - era State Department employee Abramoff had drawn a bead on -- one who had already inflamed other conservatives -- the report shows little evidence of Abramoff getting results from the White House .
The committee 's 2006 report found 19 instances in which White House officials asked for tickets to events from Abramoff and his associates , or were offered them .
The new draft report said the new documents confirmed 15 of those and indicated six more instances , including tickets for soprano Sarah Brightman , to an NCAA basketball tournament game , tickets to the Washington Wizards and tickets to the Baltimore Orioles .
White House officials are generally restricted from receiving gifts worth more than $ 20 each , and from taking more than $ 50 in gifts from one source in a year .
The White House did not respond to whether it was concerned about its employees violating federal gift rules .

IN MAY many investors took comfort in the view that the worst of the credit crisis may be over .
But , as in 1939 - 40 , says one hedge - fund manager , it was just “ the phoney war .
The tanks are about to roll into France . ”
The gunners have certainly had plenty to aim at this week .
Whether it was the downgrading of investment - bank debt , the purging of top brass at Wachovia and Washington Mutual , two large American banks , or the reconfigured rights issue at Bradford & Bingley , a troubled British mortgage lender , the news on both sides of the Atlantic has been grim .
Many hoped that the Bear Stearns bail - out in mid-March would prove the climactic event of the subprime crisis .
After all , it seemed to imply that the Federal Reserve was standing behind the banks to prevent any systemic collapse .
The cost of insuring banks against credit defaults fell sharply .
But that trend reached its limit in mid-May and since then , according to one index , the price of insuring against default has risen by more than a third .
In any case , stockmarket movements suggest that bank shareholders were far less enthused by the Bear Stearns news .
That is partly because investors fear the banks will have to follow Bradford & Bingley and Royal Bank of Scotland , a big British bank , and tap shareholders for additional capital .
Another sign of strain is the gap between money - market rates and official rates , which is still much wider than the historical average .
Matt King , a strategist at Citigroup , says that this is not so much the banks ' fear for the health of their competitors , as their reluctance to lend altogether .
Ever since last summer , the cost of funding for banks in the bond market has been higher than the cost of borrowing by non-financial companies .
That makes bank lending unprofitable .
In addition , the breakdown of the securitisation market makes it hard to get rid of loans .
Worst of all , a forthcoming accounting change known as FAS 140 may force banks to take previous securitisations back onto their books ;
Mr King reckons some $ 5 trillion of assets will return to banks ' balance sheets .
There has been , as yet , not much sign of a slowdown in lending .
But that is because borrowers are taking advantage of the loan commitments made by banks during the boom years ; some $ 6 trillion of these are still to be drawn down , double the level of five years ago .
When it comes to new loans , the trend is clear .
Surveys in both Europe and America show that banks are tightening their standards .
In Britain the number of home mortgages taken out in April was just 58,000 , down from 73,000 at the start of the year ; in the euro zone bank lending to households is rising at its slowest rate since 2001 .
The squeeze comes at an awkward time for consumers , hit as they have been by rising food and fuel prices and by ( in America , at least ) a softening labour market .
Measures of consumer confidence have fallen sharply , although actual spending has not yet weakened to the same extent .
But consumer - default rates have started to climb sharply , as Bradford & Bingley 's results revealed .
And there will be write - offs on business loans as the year goes on .
This bad news may already be reflected in the general level of corporate - debt spreads .
But specific failures will still come as a nasty surprise to investors and institutions , and add to the malaise .
Of enduring concern are the monoline insurers , the institutions that agreed to guarantee some classes of debt against default .
On June 4th Moody's , a rating agency , said it was thinking again about downgrading the AAA ratings of MBIA and Ambac , two of the main monolines .
The pessimists ( who are betting on a further fall in the price of the shares ) reckon their losses on subprime - related debt will turn out to be many times bigger than the monolines ' present capital .
If the theme of last year was turmoil in financial services , then 2008 could be the year when financial stress goes on to harm the economy .
And it is not too fanciful to imagine a vicious circle : as the economic downturn causes more financial pain , so confidence will crumble further .
It seems far too early to say the financial world has seen “ the beginning of the end ” of the credit crunch .
Indeed , the rest of Winston Churchill 's quote about the progress of the war may even be too optimistic .
The world may not even have seen “ the end of the beginning ” .
The phrase “ stunning lipstick ” is now literally true .
Women ( and men who are very secure in their self - image ) can now carry this wonderful little number that combines a flashlight and 350,000 volts of self - protection .
OK , is it just me or is the possibility of a self - inflicted injury pretty impressive here ?
BTW , if stun guns are n’t your thing , you can also get knives and pepper spray in lipstick - shaped containers .
( A more stylish selection of lipstick stun guns can be found here , if you think the ones at right are too plain to show to any potential muggers . )
If you do n’t mind that it ’s ugly as all get out , you can wear a ring / pepper spray combo .
And if someone tells you they think it ’s unattractive … well I know one way to win that argument .
The cell phone is another popular shape when it comes to disguising personal protection implements .
Again , I have to wonder why Mr. Bad Guy would allow you to grab your cell phone , but if that ’s what people are comfortable carrying then I am all in favor of it .
One of the best ways to make sure you do n’t have to use gadgets like these is to make it obvious that you are carrying these items .
In the past this has meant choosing function over form and strapping something in basic black to your side .
Fortunately this is no longer the case .
Now , you can combine whimsy and a true drop - dead attitude with this leopard - skin print Taser .
Have to say I was a bit disappointed to see that the Taser holster is still only available in basic black .
However should that not be nearly cute enough for you ( where ’s Hello Kitty when you need her ? ) , there is always the Do n’t touch Me! Lovely Pink Seal Stun Gun Lovely Taser Weapon !
Gotta warn you though , with only 195 volts of shocking power ( I think ) you ’re giving up a lot for the cuteness factor .
But , as they say , that ’s not all .
There ’s also a very cute pink camo pepper - spray holder .
( Which I suppose you could also use to hold actual lipstick . )
“ Oh dear !
Mr. Collateral Damage , ” you may ask , “ what do I do if I am going to a more formal event ? ”
Have no fear my dear , the invisible hand of the marketplace is there to help you keep someone else ’s visible hands to himself AND look good with diamonds or pearls .
The wonderfully named PepperFace sells all sorts of glam pepper spray dispensers adorned with actual authentic Swarovski crystals .
Stun guns and pepper - dispensers come in all sort of less , well , girly shapes as well .
For dual functionality nothing can top the old stun gun and flashlight combo as far as I ’m concerned .
Although I ’ve always preferred the basic MagLite with six D cells .
It ’s a flashlight AND a giant honkin’ piece of metal that you can whack someone with .
No worrying about whether the little electronic doohickies made contact with that .
However , I now know of something that would be more effective — the combination flashlight AND sharp pointy stick !
This is called a “ tactical flashlight ” and the one that caught my eye promises , “ Unlike ordinary tactical lights with crenellated bezel that can often inflict unnecessary harms to oneself , K2 features sharpened spikes around the bezel that protrude outward only when the spike protector is lowered .
With the spikes protected when not needed , the fast turn threading allows the rapid retraction of the spike protector .
These spikes are sharpened far more than those ordinary crenellated bezel light . “
The one drawback with this as far as I ’m concerned is that it does n’t come in a version big enough to house six D cell batteries .
Nor does it come in pink .
C’mon invisible hand of the marketplace , a need is going unmet !
Congratulations , .001 % of NYC 's population that will ever actually see these .
May you be slightly more successful than our famous ' Lets hang orange crap in central park ' installation .
I ride over the bridge 2 + times a day , $ 10 says I never actually see the waterfalls .
@xint :
It 's funny .. my first thought was that i could use this as part of a setup to shoot still life .
just put a tent on it to bounce the light around from the sides and top .

But your a Jesus freak .
I mean , I know about the guy , and I think it 's cool to have a spritual side and all , but you 're really all about him , are n't you ?
It took about 5 minutes for me to realize that we were going to talk about god all night .
And I really tried to sympathize with your faith that Jesus gave you a second chance at life after a rough childhood .
I was struggling to find encouraging things to say , and I held my toungue pretty well .
But here 's the deal : I do n't believe in god , babe .
Nope , not even an inkling .
I 'm what you call an Atheist , because your organization needs a word to describe people who do n't believe what you believe .
Atheist is a newer , kinder word .
I would have been a heretic , sinner , witch , blasphemer or satanist had we met in another century , but now , I 'm an atheist .
Or secular humanist , or , as I like to say , normal .
And , sadly , you 're in a cult .
A Messianic cult , which may be better than some other cults , but it 's still a cult , and you 're completely brainwashed .
I mean , there 's very little room in your thinking for any kind of science , let alone philosophy or literature that is n't written in praise of your Leader , and that just sucks , conversationally speaking .
I mean we can't really talk about anything without your ultimate arbiter coming into play , at which point the conversation is over .
Here 's an example from the other night :
Me : Yeah , there was another protest about same sex marriage downtown today , I checked it out .
You :
Well homosexuality is a sin against god 's plan , you know .
Me : Right .
More wine ?
What do I say then ?
You trump everything with the J man , and I have to change the subject , because to debate the issue is to bring up your faith , which is pretty much not debatable .
I mean , sure , I could just say I believe this because a magic pie I worship tells me so , but where would that leave us ?
Pretty much right here .
The toughest part is , all of your holiness is really getting in the way of my porno titfuck fantasy of you .
I mean , I really want to do this , it 's completely absorbing my thoughts lately , but I feel like Jesus is standing between me and my desire to make love to your breasts .
I can almost see his face right in your cleavage saying , No !
You will not fuck these titties , non-believer !
So , since nobody really knows what Jesus would do anyway , I 'm enlisting the Son of God to get me on your tits .
And here 's my plan : I 'm going to play along with your Jesus land fanstasy for a bit , and slowly convince you that , yes , Jesus wants us to get freaky .
Any act that inspires you to yell his name in ecstasy HAS to be god 's will .
So , baby , let 's fuck for Jesus .
Amen . this is in or around Loop
For the most part , Clinton supporters appeared to be sticking with the New York senator .
Clinton asks supers to commit in private
Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s visit to Capitol
Hill this week may have been more about weighing her support than it was about wooing superdelegates .
According to a senior Democratic aide , Clinton asked some uncommitted superdelegates if they could commit to her privately — without the political risks of a public endorsement — so that she could gauge whether she has the support she feels she needs to remain a viable candidate .

A Clinton staffer acknowledged Thursday that the campaign was in the process of “ counting up ” superdelegates because “ at the end of the day , we have to know where our numbers are . ”
“ We do have some private supporters , ” the staffer said .
“ [ But ] for their own political purposes , they ca n’t be on record . ”
The staffer conceded that lawmakers could , in theory , “ privately back ” Clinton then ultimately support Obama but said : “ We need to track where we are , and there ’s no other way . ”
Clinton met with a smattering of superdelegates Wednesday ; aides and lawmakers said she appeared at the offices of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and simply asked to meet with any uncommitted superdelegates who happened to be around .
One Clinton supporter familiar with the meetings described the senator ’s “ ask ” as “ vague . ”
Obama , by contrast , took the Hill by storm Thursday .
In the morning , he met with a large group of uncommitted Blue Dog Democrats at a townhouse owned by UPS .
Then he walked over to the House and spent half an hour working the left side of the chamber , shaking hands , signing autographs and posing for pictures .
In the afternoon , he spent nearly three hours at the Democratic National Committee , where he met with a number of superdelegates , including four North Carolina congressmen .
“ We seem to be making progress , ” Obama told reporters after his meetings ended on Thursday .
The Democratic front - runner said he would n’t “ count any chickens before they ’re hatched , ” but he managed to pluck at least one from the nest :
On Thursday afternoon , Obama picked up the endorsement of Rep. Brad Miller ( D - N.C. ) .
The Clinton campaign had a harder time gaining traction .
After a number of media outlets — including Politico — reported that Indiana Rep. Brad Ellsworth was backing Clinton , his spokeswoman put out the word that there was some “ nuance ” to the congressman ’s position : Ellsworth is actually remaining neutral in the race but will cast his superdelegate vote for the candidate who carried his district ( Clinton ) if the nomination process goes all the way to convention , " unless , ” of course , “ there is a compelling reason to do otherwise . "
And adding insult to injury , Clinton backer Rep. Yvette Clarke ( D - N.Y. ) eagerly approached Obama during his visit to the House on Thursday and asked him to autograph the cover of the day ’s New York Daily News .
The headline : “ It ’s His Party . ”
Another Clinton supporter , Rep. Alcee Hastings of Florida , gave Obama a bear hug .
But for the most part , Clinton supporters appeared to be sticking with the New York senator , even as countless newspapers and television news pundits were writing her off .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) said Wednesday that the prolonged Democratic presidential campaign was beginning to hurt the party .
But after talking with Clinton on Thursday morning , Feinstein said her candidate is “ persevering , very collected , very determined . ”
“ She ’s going to make the decision if the time comes , ” Feinstein said .
“ Her strategy is to win this , and she ’s entitled to her opportunity to try .
I ’m sticking with her . ”
Rep. Steve Israel ( D - N.Y. ) , a Clinton supporter , crossed paths with Obama on Thursday during meetings at the DNC but told reporters he merely said hello .
“ I ’m committed to Sen . Clinton until she becomes president , ” Israel said .
Other superdelegates insisted that they were still undecided even after meeting with both candidates this week .
Florida Rep. Tim Mahoney was courted by Clinton on Wednesday and Obama on Thursday , and said he was equally impressed by both .
“ It ’s a difficult decision , ” he said .
“ They ’re two great candidates . ”

Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki met Monday with Iran ’s Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
According to Farsnews writing in Persian , Khamenei told al - Maliki that the most important and fundamental problem for Iraq at present is the presence of Occupation forces .
He affirmed , “ We are certain that the people of Iraq , through their intrinsic unity and effort , will cross over these difficult conditions and arrive at a place befitting them .
The dream of the Americans most certainly will never be realized . ”
He emphasized that the Islamic Republic of Iran considers helping the government and people of Iraq a religious duty .
He expressed the hope that al - Maliki ’s visit to Iran and the agreements he signed there would strengthen relations between the two countries .
Al - Maliki expressed his conviction that Iraqis were attaining a consensus and beginning to speak with a single voice .
Khamenei expressed his concern that the Americans would interfere illegitimately and “ impudently ” in Iraqi affairs and disrupt this building consensus .
He compared the current role of the US with the one the British used to play in promoting divide and rule policies even in independent Iraq after 1932 .
He also expressed his worry that the US would worm itself into every aspect of Iraq ’s affairs .
Al - Hayat writes Tuesday morning in Arabic that Khamenei advised al - Maliki not to sign any such security agreement .
Leila Fadel reports that Shiite lawmakers in Iraq told her that the US has requested 58 bases from the Iraqi government as part of the security agreement now being negotiated .
The US also is said to want the authority to decide when Iraq has been attacked , and when and how to respond .
The lawmakers are afraid that Washington will use that provision to drag them into the middle of a war between the US and Iran .
On being informed by McClatchy of some of these details , the campaign of Senator Barack Obama demanded that any such stipulation of 58 bases be submitted to the US Congress for approval , and that the Iraqis be told that the US does not seek permanent bases in that country .
The McCain campaign had no comment .
Al - Hayat reports that Kurdish MP Mahmud Osman is saying that he has seen a second version of the agreement in which the Americans reduced their demands .
McClatchy reports political violence in Iraq for Monday :
Skydiver 's 130,000 ft space plunge foiled ... after his giant balloon floats off without him
A French skydiver , who planned to make a record - breaking jump from the edge of space , was dealt a fresh blow after his balloon left without him on board .
The helium balloon Michel Fournier was going to use detached from the capsule as it was inflated on the ground .
Mr Fournier , 64 , appeared disappointed as left the capsule and walked to the hanger .
He was hugged by members of his entourage .
The balloon was reported to have cost at least £ 127,000 and Fournier was said to have already exhausted his finances .

And away :
The helium balloon of Michel Fournier disappears into the distance
The daredevil had already delayed lift - off on Monday because of weather conditions .
But he had said : " I feel that tomorrow I 'm going to be lucky . "
He had hoped to reach the stratosphere above Canada in a capsule attached to a massive helium balloon and then step out and free fall 130,000 feet in a specially designed suit , helmet and parachute .
But the balloon drifted off without him into the sky at North Battleford airport in Saskatchewan .
Fournier , a former army paratrooper with more than 8,000 jumps under his belt , wanted to bring back data that will help astronauts and others survive in the highest of altitudes .
He made a couple of attempts at the record in previous years , but they ended in failure .
He wants to break the record for the fastest and longest free fall , the highest parachute jump and the highest balloon flight .
The jump would take him three - times higher than a commercial jetliner .
A mountain climber would have to ascend the equivalent of four Mount Everests stacked one on top of the other .
Fournier 's launch manager , Dale Sommerfeldt , acknowledged that the overcast skies and wind gusts of 40 kph ( 25 mph ) at the launch site were troublesome on Monday .
" Times like this look really , really bad , but in less than 12 hours it could be completely changed , " Sommerfeldt said yesterday .
Ideally , the ground speed winds would be no more than 10 kph ( 6 mph ) in order for the crew to launch the massive balloon .
Back to the drawing board : Michel Fournier watches his helium balloon that lifted off without him
Sommerfeldt is one of an army of technicians , data crunchers , balloon and weather specialists who have arrived at North Battleford , a city of 14,000 near the Saskatchewan - Alberta boundary , for Fournier 's third attempt .
The first two - in 2002 and 2003 - ended when wind gusts shredded his balloon before it even became airborne .
Michel Fournier leaves the capsule after aborting his first attempt to launch his helium balloon on Monday
It was expected to take Fournier 15 minutes just to come down , screaming through thin air at 1,500 kilometres an hour ( 932 mph ) , - 1.7 times the speed of sound - smashing through the sound barrier , shock waves buffeting his body , before finally deploying his chute about 6,000 metres above the prairie wheat fields .
Joe Kittinger , from Altamonte Springs , Florida , near Orlando , set the record almost 50 years ago , in 1960 .
As a U.S. Air Force captain , he leapt from a balloon at 31,000 metres ( 101,700 feet ) , about three - quarters of the height Fournier is now shooting for - as a research experiment for the space programme .

Not if the " incensed " Philadelphia Eagles fan in Congress has anything to do with it .
Sen . Arlen Specter on Wednesday called for an independent investigation of the New England Patriots ' taping of opposing coaches ' signals , possibly similar to the high - profile Mitchell report on performance - enhancing drugs in baseball .
" I have documented the strong factual case that a NFL investigation was neither objective nor adequate , " Specter told ESPN.com on Wednesday evening .
" If the commissioner does n't move for an independent investigation , then there will be a permanent black mark on the NFL and the Patriots ' record will be historically tainted .
Depending on the public reaction , I may ask the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on the NFL antitrust exemption . "
At an earlier news conference in the Capitol , Specter put it bluntly :
" What is necessary is an objective investigation .
And this one has not been objective . "
The Pennsylvania Republican was unforgiving of his criticism of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell , saying that Goodell has made " ridiculous " assertions that would n't fly " in kindergarten . "
The Senator said Goodell was caught in an " apparent conflict of interest " because the NFL does n't want the public to lose confidence in the league 's integrity .
" They are enormous role models for everybody , " Specter said .
" If you can cheat in the NFL , you can cheat in college , you can cheat in high school , you can cheat on your grade - school math test .
There 's no limit as to what you can do .
I think they owe the public a lot more candor and a lot more credibility . "

It ’s not just for elites anymore .
A survey of Midwesterners finds that even average food shoppers are willing to pay a premium for locally grown food .
They ’ll pay as much as a third more if the food comes from a small local farm rather than a corporate farm .
The study from Ohio State University , published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics , shows that more shoppers are willing to pay for ripe local food — suggesting small farmers might be less efficient on the production side and still manage to be more profitable on the revenue side by selling at the premium price .
Shoppers were surveyed at 17 Ohio locations , including seven retail grocery stores , six on - site farm markets and four farmers ’ markets .
They were presented with two product options .
Both were baskets of strawberries , but they were presented under 80 combinations of price , freshness , farm location , and farm type .
Data from 477 surveys revealed the average shopper was willing to pay 48 cents more for local strawberries .
Shoppers at farm markets were willing to pay almost a third more , 92 cents above the $ 3 base for a quart of berries .
Freshness was also important .
Farm market shoppers were willing to pay 73 cents more for newly - harvested food and retail shoppers 54 cents more .
The researchers tested interest in supporting small versus large farms by naming one fictional berry producer “ Fred ’s ” and the other “ Berries Inc . ”
Shoppers in grocery stores were willing to pay 17 cents extra for berries from Fred ’s , and farm market shoppers were willing to pay 42 cents more .
Listen up small farmers , boutique farmers , disenchanted farmers , your day may be coming ( again ) .
Many of us want fresher , tastier food grown carefully and closer to home .

A user calls a programmer and says , “ We need a button on screen ______ to do _____ . ”
What is the right answer ?
a) Sure we can do that for you .
b ) Wow that screen already has way too much stuff on it .
Adding another button will make it way too busy .
c ) That screen was n’t designed for that .
But you can do it by .
. .
d) Hmmm .
Help me understand the context a bit better and where this fits in .
Sorry , I just do a better job coding if I understand the big picture .
. .
Answer A sounds helpful , but it will result in patch after patch being applied haphazardly .
Eventually this will break down the technical unity / cohesiveness of the system .
In the end the system will be what the users requested , but probably not what they wanted .
Answers B and C put the user on the defensive .
Even if the argument is “ successful ” it may leave lingering resentment .
The right answer is D .
It opens that critical two - way communication channel between programmer and user .
Over the years I ’ve noticed that the most effective programmers understand the frustrations of the user ’s world and write their programs to solve those problems ( not add to them ) .
The flip - side is true for users .
The most effective users understand the applications / technology they use .
Neither programmers nor users automatically know such things — they must teach each other .
One of the best times to exchange that knowledge is when a request is being made .
Always start by asking the user about their world — people like to talk about what they do .
And what they do is the basis for your application — and for their change request .
Once they ’ve described their processes , start drawing connections between those processes and the application .
You ’ll probably realize with a shock that the application does n’t even come close to matching the user ’s world .
That mismatch is the “ root cause ” of the request .
Next , discuss various options to resolve the “ root cause ” .
Usually the best option is not adding a button , but something else that is both technically sound and often far better at fixing the user ’s problems .
You ca n’t fault the user — a button was probably the only technical term they knew . *
In the last few years after learning this technique I ’ve had these conversations many times .
It takes a few minutes , but in the end it saves a ton of time / trouble .

He prepared briefs for Dick Cheney , when Cheney was at the Pentagon , for the upper echelons of the CIA and even for the Oval Office .
But when he uncovered a political scandal - a conspiracy to enable a rogue nation to get the nuclear bomb - he found himself a marked man .
In the late 80s , in the course of tracking down smugglers of WMD components , Barlow uncovered reams of material that related to Pakistan .
It was known the Islamic Republic had been covertly striving to acquire nuclear weapons since India 's explosion of a device in 1974 and the prospect terrified the west - especially given the instability of a nation that had had three military coups in less than 30 years .
Straddling deep ethnic , religious and political fault - lines , it was also a country regularly rocked by inter-communal violence .
" Pakistan was the kind of place where technology could slip out of control , " Barlow says .
He soon discovered , however , that senior officials in government were taking quite the opposite view : they were breaking US and international non-proliferation protocols to shelter Pakistan 's ambitions and even sell it banned WMD technology .
In the closing years of the cold war , Pakistan was considered to have great strategic importance .
It provided Washington with a springboard into neighbouring Afghanistan - a route for passing US weapons and cash to the mujahideen , who were battling to oust the Soviet army that had invaded in 1979 .
Barlow says , " We had to buddy - up to regimes we did n't see eye - to - eye with , but I could not believe we would actually give Pakistan the bomb .
How could any US administration set such short - term gains against the long - term safety of the world ? "
Next he discovered that the Pentagon was preparing to sell Pakistan jet fighters that could be used to drop a nuclear bomb .
Barlow was relentless in exposing what he saw as US complicity , and in the end he was sacked and smeared as disloyal , mad , a drunk and a philanderer .
If he had been listened to , many believe Pakistan might never have got its nuclear bomb ; south Asia might not have been pitched into three near - nuclear conflagrations ; and the nuclear weapons programmes of Iran , Libya and North Korea - which British and American intelligence now acknowledge were all secretly enabled by Pakistan - would never have got off the ground .
" None of this need have happened , " Robert Gallucci , special adviser on WMD to both Clinton and George W Bush , told us .
" The vanquishing of Barlow and the erasing of his case kicked off a chain of events that led to all the nuclear - tinged stand - offs we face today .
Pakistan is the number one threat to the world , and if it all goes off - a nuclear bomb in a US or European city - I 'm sure we will find ourselves looking in Pakistan 's direction . "
US aid to Pakistan tapered off when the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan .
Dejected and impoverished , in 1987 Pakistan 's ruling military responded by selling its nuclear hardware and know - how for cash , something that would have been obvious to all if the intelligence had been properly analysed .
" But the George HW Bush administration was not looking at Pakistan , " Barlow says .
" It had new crises to deal with in the Persian Gulf where Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait . "
As the first Gulf war came to an end with no regime change in Iraq , a group of neoconservatives led by Paul Wolfowitz , Dick Cheney , Lewis " Scooter " Libby and Donald Rumsfeld were already lobbying to finish what that campaign had started and dislodge Saddam .
Even as the CIA amassed evidence showing that Pakistan , a state that sponsored Islamist terrorism and made its money by selling proscribed WMD technology , was the number one threat , they earmarked Iraq as the chief target .
When these neocons came to power in 2001 , under President George W Bush , Pakistan was indemnified again , this time in return for signing up to the " war on terror " .
Condoleezza
Rice backed the line , as did Rumsfeld , too .
Pakistan , although suspected by all of them to be at the epicentre of global instability , was hailed as a friend .
All energies were devoted to building up the case against Iraq .
It is only now , amid the recriminations about the war in Iraq and reassessments of where the real danger lies , that Barlow - the despised bringer of bad news about Pakistan - is finally to get a hearing .
More than 20 years after this saga began , his case , filed on Capitol Hill , is coming to court later this month .
His lawyers are seeking millions of dollars in compensation for Barlow as well as the reinstatement of his $ 80,000 a year government pension .
Evidence will highlight what happened when ideologues took control of intelligence in three separate US administrations - those of Reagan , and of the two Bushes - and how a CIA analyst who would not give up his pursuit for the truth became a fall guy .
Born in Upper Manhattan , New York , the son of an army surgeon , Barlow went to an Ivy League feeder school before attending Western Washington University on America 's northwest tip .
Even then he was an idealist and an internationalist , obsessively following world events .
He majored in political science , and his thesis was on counter - proliferation intelligence ; he was concerned that the burgeoning black markets in nuclear weapons technology threatened peace in the west .
" I got my material from newspapers and books , " he recalls .
" I went to congressional hearings in Washington and discovered that there was tonnes of intelligence about countries procuring nuclear materials . "
After graduation in 1981 , shortly after Reagan became president - avowedly committed to the non proliferation of nuclear weapons - Barlow won an internship at the State Department 's Arms Control and Disarmament Agency ( ACDA ) , which had been established by John F Kennedy in the 60s .
At first Barlow thought he was helping safeguard the world .
" I just loved it , " he says .
His focus from the start was Pakistan , at the time suspected of clandestinely seeking nuclear weapons in a programme initiated by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , the father of Benazir .
" Everywhere I looked I kept coming up against intelligence about Pakistan 's WMD programme , " Barlow says .
" I thought I was telling them what they needed to hear , but the White House seemed oblivious . "
Immersed in the minutiae of his investigations , he did n't appreciate the bigger picture : that Pakistan had , within days of Reagan 's inauguration in 1981 , gone from being an outcast nation that had outraged the west by hanging Bhutto to a major US ally in the proxy war in Afghanistan .
Within months Barlow was out of a job .
A small band of Republican hawks , including Paul Wolfowitz , had convinced the president that America needed a new strategy against potential nuclear threats , since long - term policies such as détente and containment were not working .
Reagan was urged to remilitarise , launch his Star Wars programme and neutralise ACDA .
When the agency 's staff was cut by one third , Barlow found himself out of Washington and stacking shelves in a food store in Connecticut , where he married his girlfriend , Cindy .
He was not on hand in 1984 when intelligence reached the ACDA and the CIA that Pakistan had joined the nuclear club ( the declared nuclear powers were Britain , France , the US , China and Russia ) after China detonated a device on Pakistan 's behalf .
Soon after , Barlow was re-employed to work as an analyst , specialising in Pakistan , at the Office of Scientific and Weapons Research ( OSWR ) .
The CIA was pursuing the Pakistan programme vigorously even though Reagan was turning a blind eye - indeed , Reagan 's secretary of state , George Schultz , claimed in 1985 : " We have full faith in [ Pakistan 's ] assurance that they will not make the bomb . "
Back on a government salary , Barlow , aged 31 , moved to Virginia with his wife Cindy , also a CIA agent .
From day one , he was given access to the most highly classified material .
He learned about the workings of the vast grey global market in dual - use components - the tools and equipment that could be put to use in a nuclear weapons programme but that could also be ascribed to other domestic purposes , making the trade in them hard to spot or regulate .
" There was tonnes of it and most of it was ending up in Islamabad , " he says .
" Pakistan had a vast network of procurers , operating all over the world . "
A secret nuclear facility near Islamabad , known as the Khan Research Laboratories , was being fitted out with components imported from Europe and America " under the wire " .
But the CIA obtained photographs .
Floor plans .
Bomb designs .
Sensors picked up evidence of high levels of enriched uranium in the air and in the dust clinging to the lorries plying the road to the laboratories .
Barlow was in his element .
However , burrowing through cables and files , he began to realise that the State Department had intelligence it was not sharing - in particular the identities of key Pakistani procurement agents , who were active in the US .
Without this information , the US Commerce Department ( which approved export licences ) and US Customs ( which enforced them ) were hamstrung .
Barlow came to the conclusion that a small group of senior officials was physically aiding the Pakistan programme .
" They were issuing scores of approvals for the Pakistan embassy in Washington to export hi-tech equipment that was critical for their nuclear bomb programme and that the US Commerce Department had refused to license , " he says .
Dismayed , he approached his boss at the CIA , Richard Kerr , the deputy director for intelligence , who summoned senior State Department officials to a meeting at CIA headquarters in Langley .
Barlow recalls : " Kerr tried to do it as nicely as he could .
He said he understood the State Department had to keep Pakistan on side - the State Department guaranteed it would stop working against us . "
Then a Pakistani nuclear smuggler walked into a trap sprung by the CIA - and the Reagan administration 's commitment to rid the world of nuclear weapons was put to the test .
US foreign aid legislation stipulated that if Pakistan was shown to be procuring weapons of mass destruction or was in possession of a nuclear bomb , all assistance would be halted .
This , in turn , would have threatened the US - funded war in Afghanistan .
So there were conflicting interests at work when Barlow got a call from the Department of Energy .
" I was told that a Pakistani businessman had contacted Carpenter Steel , a company in Pennsylvania , asking to buy a specific type of metal normally used only in constructing centrifuges to enrich uranium .
His name was Arshad Pervez and his handler , Inam ul - Haq , a retired brigadier from the Pakistan army , had been known to us for many years as a key Pakistan government operative . "
Barlow and US customs set up a sting .
" Pervez arrived to a do a deal at a hotel we had rigged out and was arrested , " Barlow says .
" But ul - Haq , our main target , never showed . "
Trawling through piles of cables , he found evidence that two high - ranking US officials extremely close to the White House had tipped off Islamabad about the CIA operation .
Furious , Barlow called his superiors .
" The CIA went mad .
These were criminal offences , " Barlow says .
The State Department 's lawyers considered their position .
They argued that an inquiry would necessitate the spilling of state secrets .
The investigation was abandoned just as Reagan made his annual statement to Congress , testifying that " Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device . "
But the Pervez case would not go away .
Congressman Stephen Solarz , a Democrat from New Jersey , demanded a closed congressional hearing to vet the intelligence concerning Pakistan 's bomb programme .
Barlow was detailed to " backbench " at the meeting , if necessary offering advice to the White House representative , General David Einsel ( who had been chosen by Reagan to head his Star Wars programme ) .
An armed guard stood outside the room where the hearing was held .
Barlow recalls that Solarz got straight to the point : " Were Pervez and ul - Haq agents of the Pakistan government ? "
Without flinching , Einsel barked back : " It is not cut and dried . "
It was a criminal offence to lie to Congress , as other hearings happening on the same day down the corridor were spelling out to Colonel Oliver North , the alleged mastermind behind Iran - Contra .
Barlow froze .
" These congressmen had no idea what was really going on in Pakistan and what had been coming across my desk about its WMD programme , " he says .
" They did not know that Pakistan already had a bomb and was shopping for more with US help .
All of it had been hushed up . "
Then Solarz called on Barlow to speak .
" I told the truth .
I said it was clear Pervez was an agent for Pakistan 's nuclear programme .
Everyone started shouting .
General Einsel screamed , ' Barlow does n't know what he 's talking about . '
Solarz asked if there had been any other cases involving the Pakistan government and Einsel said , ' No ' . "
Barlow recalls thinking , " ' Oh no , here we go again . '
They asked me and I said , ' Yes , there have been scores of other cases . ' "
The meeting broke up .
Barlow was bundled into a CIA car that sped for Langley .
It was a bad time to be the US 's foremost expert on Pakistan 's nuclear programme when the administration was desperate to prove it did n't exist .
Shortly after , Barlow left the CIA , claiming that Einsel had made his job impossible .
Later that year , Reagan would tell the US Congress : " There is no diminution in the president 's commitment to restraining the spread of nuclear weapons in the Indian subcontinent or elsewhere . "
Once again , Barlow was able to bounce back .
In January 1989 , he was recruited by the Office of the Secretary of Defence ( OSD ) at the Pentagon to become its first intelligence analyst in WMD .
For a man uncomfortable with political pragmatism , it was a strange move : he was now in a department that was steeped in realpolitik , balancing the commercial needs of the US military industry against America 's international obligations .
Within weeks , he had again built a stack of evidence about Pakistan 's WMD programme , including intelligence that the Pakistan army was experimenting with a delivery system for its nuclear bomb , using US - provided technology .
" Our side was at it again , " Barlow says .
Still optimistic , still perhaps naive and still committed to the ideal of thwarting the Pakistan programme , Barlow convinced himself that his experience in the CIA was untypical , the work of a handful of political figures who would now not be able to reach him .
When he was commissioned to write an intelligence assessment for Dick Cheney , defence secretary , giving a snapshot of the Pakistan WMD programme , he thought he was making headway .
Barlow 's report was stark .
He concluded that the US had sold 40 F - 16 fighter jets to Pakistan in the mid-80s - it had been a precondition of the sale that none of the jets could be adapted to drop a nuclear bomb .
He was convinced that all of them had been configured to do just that .
He concluded that Pakistan was still shopping for its WMD programme and the chances were extremely high that it would also begin selling this technology to other nations .
Unbeknown to Barlow , the Pentagon had just approved the sale of another 60 F - 16s to Pakistan in a deal worth $ 1.4bn , supposedly with the same provison as before .
" Officials at the OSD kept pressurising me to change my conclusions , " Barlow says .
He refused and soon after noticed files going missing .
A secretary tipped him off that a senior official had been intercepting his papers .
In July 1989 , Barlow was hauled before one of the Pentagon 's top military salesmen , who accused him of sabotaging the new F - 16 deal .
Eight days later , when Congress asked if the jet could be adapted by Pakistan to drop a nuclear bomb , the Defence Department said , " None of the F - 16s Pakistan already owns or is about to purchase is configured for nuclear delivery . "
Barlow was horrified .
On August 4 1989 , he was fired .
" They told me they had received credible information that I was a security risk . "
Barlow demanded to know how and why .
" They said they could not tell me as the information was classified . "
All they would say was that " senior Defence Department officials " , whose identities were also classified , had supplied " plenty of evidence " .
The rumour going around the office was that Barlow was a Soviet spy .
Barlow went home to Cindy .
" We were in marriage counselling following my fall - out at the CIA .
We were getting our relationship back on track .
And now I had to explain that I was being fired from the Pentagon . "
Barlow still would not give up .
His almost pathological tenacity was one of the characteristics that made him a great analyst .
With no salary and few savings , he found a lawyer who agreed to represent him pro-bono .
At this point , more documents surfaced linking several familiar names to Barlow 's sacking and its aftermath ; these included Cheney 's chief of staff , Libby , and two officials working for Wolfowitz .
Through his lawyer , Barlow discovered that he was being described as a tax evader , an alcoholic and an adulterer , who had been fired from all previous government jobs .
It was alleged that his marriage counselling was a cover for a course of psychiatric care , and he was put under pressure to permit investigators to interview his marriage guidance adviser .
" I had to explain to Cindy that her private fears were to be trawled by the OSD .
She moved out .
My life , professionally and personally , was destroyed .
Cindy filed for divorce . "
Barlow 's lawyers stuck by him , winning a combined inquiry by the three inspector generals acting for the Defence Department , the CIA and the State Department ( inspector generals are the equivalent of ombudsmen in Britain ) .
By September 1993 , the lead inspector , Sherman Funk , concluded that the accusation of treachery was " an error not supported by a scintilla of evidence .
The truth about Barlow 's termination is , simply put , that it was unfair and unwarranted . "
The whole affair , Funk said , was " Kafka - like " - Barlow was sacrificed for " refusing to accede to policies which he knew to be wrong " .
It seemed Barlow had been vindicated .
However , when the report was published it had been completely rewritten by someone at the Pentagon .
Funk was appalled .
When Barlow 's lawyers called the Pentagon , they were told it was the department that had been exonerated .
Now it was official : Pakistan was nuclear - free , and did not have the capability of dropping a bomb from an American - supplied F - 16 jet and the reputation of the only man who claimed otherwise was destroyed .
Later , Barlow 's lawyers would find his brief to Cheney had been rewritten , too , clearing Pakistan and concluding that continued US aid would ensure that the country would desist from its WMD programme .
The Pentagon officials who were responsible for Barlow 's downfall would all be out of government by 1993 , when Bill Clinton came into the White House .
In opposition they began pursuing an aggressive political agenda , canvassing for war in Iraq rather than restraining nuclear - armed Pakistan .
Their number now included Congressman Donald Rumsfeld , a former Republican defence secretary , and several others who would go on to take key positions under George Bush , including Richard Armitage , Richard Perle and John Bolton .
Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz headed the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States , which concluded in July 1998 that the chief threat - far greater than the CIA and other intelligence agencies had so far reported - was posed by Iran , Iraq and North Korea : the future Axis of Evil powers .
Pakistan was not on the list , even though just two months earlier it had put an end to the dissembling by detonating five nuclear blasts in the deserts of Balochistan .
It was also difficult not to conclude that Islamist terrorism was escalating and that its epicentre was Pakistan .
The camps that had once been used to train the US - backed mujahideen had , since the Soviet retreat from Afghanistan , morphed into training facilities for fighters pitted against the west .
Many were filled by jihadis and were funded with cash from the Pakistan military .
It was made clear to the new president , Bill Clinton , that US policy on Pakistan had failed .
The US had provided Islamabad with a nuclear bomb and had no leverage to stop the country 's leaders from using it .
When he was contacted by lawyers for Barlow , Clinton was shocked both by the treatment Barlow had received , and the implications for US policy on Pakistan .
He signed off $ 1 m in compensation .
But Barlow never received it as the deal had to be ratified by Congress and , falling foul of procedural hurdles , it was kicked into the Court of Federal Claims to be reviewed as Clinton left office .
When the George Bush came to power , his administration quashed the case .
CIA director George Tenet and Michael Hayden , director of the National Security Agency , asserted " state secrets privilege " over Barlow 's entire legal claim .
With no evidence to offer , the claim collapsed .
Destroyed and penniless , the former CIA golden boy spent his last savings on a second - hand silver Avion trailer , packed up his life and drove off to Bear Canyon campground in Bozeman , Montana , where he still lives today .
Even with Barlow out of the picture , there were still analysts in Washington - and in the Bush administration - who were wary of Pakistan .
They warned that al - Qaida had a natural affinity with Pakistan , geographically and religiously , and that its affiliates were seeking nuclear weapons .
Some elements of the Pakistan military were sympathetic and in place to help .
But those arguing that Pakistan posed the highest risk were isolated .
Cheney , Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz were in the ascendant , and they returned to the old agenda , lobbying for a war in Iraq and , in a repeat of 1981 and the Reagan years , signed up Pakistan as the key ally in the war against terror .
Contrary advice was not welcome .
And Bush 's team set about dismantling the government agency that was giving the most trouble - the State Department 's Nonproliferation Bureau .
Norm Wulf , who recently retired as deputy assistant secretary of state for non-proliferation , told us : " They met in secret , deciding who to employ , displacing career civil servants with more than 30 years on the job in favour of young , like - thinking people , rightwingers who would toe the administration line . "
And the administration line was to do away with any evidence that pointed to Pakistan as a threat to global stability , refocusing all attention on Iraq .
The same tactics used to disgrace Barlow and discredit his evidence were used again in 2003 , this time against Joseph Wilson , a former US ambassador whom the Bush administration had sent to Africa with a mission to substantiate the story that Saddam Hussein was seeking to buy material to manufacture WMD .
When Wilson refused to comply , he found himself the subject of a smear campaign , while his wife , Valerie Plame , was outed as a CIA agent .
Libby would subsequently be jailed for leaking Plame 's identity ( although released on a presidential pardon ) .
Plame and Wilson 's careers and marriage would survive .
Barlow and his wife , Cindy's , would not - and no one would be held to account .
Until now .
When the Republicans lost control of both houses of Congress in 2006 , Barlow 's indefatigable lawyers sensed an opportunity , lodging a compensation claim on Capitol Hill that is to be heard later this month .
This time , with supporters of the Iraq war in retreat and with Pakistan , too , having lost many friends in Washington , Barlow hopes he will receive what he is due .
" But this final hearing cannot indict any of those who hounded me , or misshaped the intelligence product , " he says .
" And it is too late to contain the flow of doomsday technology that Pakistan unleashed on the world . "

· The following clarification was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday October 19 2007 .
Lewis " Scooter " Libby was not jailed for leaking the identity of a CIA agent , as we said in this article .
He was convicted of perjury and obstructing an investigation into the leak .
President Bush did not pardon him , but commuted the sentence to a fine and probation .
President George Bush and his tag - along buddy John McCain are repeating almost word for word about Iran the pattern of lies and threats they used to justify the war against Iraq .
Our intelligence agencies have said that Iran gave up the pursuit of a nuclear weapon three years ago .
President Bush makes speeches as if he ’s never heard of any intelligence agencies .
That ’s what worries me about President Bush .
His words very often defy and contradict reality .
Recently , he almost repeated word for word a theme he often used in the buildup to the Iraq aggression .
It was , he said , unthinkable to allow " the most dangerous regime to acquire the most dangerous weapons . "
This guy might actually launch an attack on Iran before his term expires .
If he does , you can kiss the world economy goodbye .
You do n’t like $ 4 - a - gallon gas ?
How about $ 10 a gallon ?
In the first place , Iran is far from the most dangerous regime in the world .
I would say it is not dangerous at all , so far as the United States is concerned .
Except for idiots , sane people assess threats based on capability , not on political rhetoric , intentions or imagination .
So what are the capabilities of Iran ?
It has no nuclear weapons .
We have about 3,000 or more .
One American submarine could destroy the entire country of Iran and its population .
Iran has no missiles that could reach us .
It has no aircraft that could reach us .
Its army could n’t even defeat Iraq .
So what I want to know is how in the blankety - blank Hades Bush and McCain define the word " dangerous " ?
When their statements about Iran are placed side by side with the known facts , Bush and McCain sound insane .
Nothing alarms me more than the thought of an irrational person in the White House .
I ’m OK with stupid .
I can live with venal .
I can tolerate a womanizer , even a drunk , but a crazy person in command of our nuclear forces gives me the heebie - jeebies .
Somebody who ca n’t tell the difference between a nuclear - free Iran with no ICBMs and Russia with thousands of nuclear warheads sitting atop advanced intercontinental missiles has no business being allowed in the White House , even as a tourist .
There are two countries that have the capability of being a threat to us  Russia and China .
That ’s foreign policy and geopolitical strategy at the kindergarten level .
They have the capability .
No other country in the world does .
Only a moron would worry more about an ex-college professor with a long name whose office does n’t even control the armed forces than he would about Vladimir Putin .
This present American administration , in one of the dumbest moves in the history of diplomacy , neglected our relations with Russia while it got us bogged down in two small desert countries that do n’t amount to a hill of coffee beans .
Also bear in mind that it does n’t matter diddly squat if some small country manages to make a few nuclear weapons .
A few is no threat to many .
Nobody with a few would be tempted to attack any country with many nuclear weapons .
Deterrence worked when the Soviet Union had 30,000 nuclear warheads , but these moronic , unscrupulous , intellectually dishonest , dishonorable neocons would convince you that deterrence would n’t work against Iran .
I know most secular folks equate religion with insanity , but they are not the same .
Iran is a religious nation , but its leaders are not crazy .
They are smart and well - educated .
They fought a long , grueling war with Iraq , and I think what they want more than anything else is a little peace and prosperity .
But I think they are worried about Bush , McCain and Israel , and I do n’t blame them .
It 's too bad George Carlin died this week , as the prickly comedian 's scathing wit would be perfect for the current debate over whether AM / FM radio should pay money to the artists whose music it plays .
It sounds like a simple question , but billions of dollars are at stake , and neither side looks interested in taking anything resembling the " high road . "
How else to explain the fact that cans of herring are being sent through the mail and foreign ducks with suitcases are appearing in newspapers ?
While radio currently pays the songwriters who pen the music and lyrics , it does n't have to pay the performers ; by contrast , satellite radio and Internet radio have to pay both groups .
As music label revenues have declined , labels and artists have naturally turned to what they see as a huge potential revenue source .
The two bills under consideration in Congress would make all forms of broadcasting liable for public performance fees , but broadcasters militantly insist that they provide crucial promotional support for artists and should be able to keep spinning discs without paying .
Nothing says " I have disdain for your
ideas " like canned herring
The spat between artists and record labels on one side and broadcasters on the other has exploded into the open recently as Congress has taken up a piece of legislation that would force radio to start paying artists for music .
At a House subcommittee hearing this morning , HR 4789 was marked up and passed on to the full committee for a vote , while S 2500 waits for action on the Senate side .
" Today 's vote comes as a complete nonsurprise , given the House IP Subcommittee 's history of support for the RIAA - backed tax on local radio stations , " said the National Association of Broadcasters after the vote .
" Despite today 's action , there remains broad bipartisan resistance to the RIAA tax from members of Congress who question whether a punitive fee on America 's hometown radio stations should be used to bail out the failing business model of foreign - owned record labels . "
New tax or old loophole closed ?
The rhetoric of taxation and punishment might seem a bit extreme , considering that radio does pay such a royalty already to songwriters and that other media have to pay the artists as well .
Indeed , the artists claim that this is n't so much a tax as an attempt to close a Congressional loophole only brought about through the power of the broadcasting lobby back in the 1930s .
Nancy Sinatra ( daughter of Frank ) sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week in which she said that " the fact is people who do the work , regardless of any promotional effect either way , should have the right to be paid fairly for it . "
All other developed countries do require radio to pay performers .
musicFIRST , a group backed by the RIAA and SoundExchange , certainly has an argument to make , one that Congress is currently considering .
But it 's also not above stooping to odd publicity stunts , such as sending the National Association of Broadcasters a can of herring and then issuing a press release about it .
The goal ?
To show that the broadcasters ' arguments are nothing more than " red herrings . "
Clever .
The broadcasters were n't amused , with NAB Vice President Dennis Wharton saying that the stunt was " so lame that it barely warrants a response .
Instead of sending fish to radio stations that advanced the careers of artists , RIAA should send food to the entertainers that foreign record labels have abused for decades . "
The dig about " foreign record labels " should give you a clue about just how nasty this debate is going to get .
That 's right , " xenophobia " is the new " logic . "
The NAB is today running ads in DC publications that show a duck with a briefcase full of cash .
On the briefcase are stickers from Japan , England , and France , helpfully marked with the music label that is based in each country ( Sony , EMI , and Universal ) .
No mention is made of the fourth label , Warner , which is based in the US , nor of the fact that EMI is by far the smallest of the four .
" While three of the four major record labels are located outside the US , free , local radio stations are the lifeblood of towns and communities right here in our country — delivering vital local news , weather and emergency information to your constituents , " says the ad .
" Do n't let the recording industry hurt local radio stations just to put money in the hands of big international companies . "
Instead , the money should apparently stay in the deep , deep pockets of US broadcasting execs at companies like Clear Channel .
If the entire debate sounds like it 's teetering on the edge of full - blown farce , that 's only because each side is pulling out all the stops due to the massive money at stake .
The Free Radio Alliance , which also represents broadcasters , says that a performance royalty could cost US radio stations between $ 3 billion and $ 7 billion each year .
When US recorded music sales currently hover in the $ 10 billion - per - year range , an extra infusion of $ 3 billion to $ 7 billion must look like a pretty meaty prize .
I recently heard from David Goss , editor - in - chief of the Journal of Number Theory , that the journal is planning on introducing video abstracts for papers that they publish .
Here ’s his e-mail explaining this :
Dear Colleagues :
By now I believe that all of us have had the pleasure of watching a famous scientist or mathematician discuss their work on internet video .
I have certainly done so myself and learned much .
Indeed I can readily give a long list of mathematicians who I would very much like to view presenting the ideas behind their great works .
For example , it would be fabulous to watch a young Serre discussing the ideas behind FAC or GAGA ; or a young Faltings discussing his solution on the Mordell Conjecture etc .
I am sure that each of you can compile your own long list ( and obviously not just papers on number theory ! ) .
It is in this spirit that I suggested to Elsevier that all JNT authors be allowed to present a short ( 4 minutes max ) “ video abstract ” of their accepted manuscript .
Elsevier has kindly accepted this idea and is now quite excited about it .
The idea is very simple :
When a paper is * finally accepted * for JNT , the author will be notified and given the option of putting up a video abstract — THIS IS ONLY FOR ACCEPTED PAPERS !
The video will be watched to check for professionalism etc. , and those videos deemed offensive will not be used ( and the author sanctioned ! ) .
The video will then be linked next to the paper on the JNT website .
Information on how to upload files , etc. , will be on the JNT website by April 23 , 2008 .
Videoing virtually anything is now deeply a part of our culture as witness the rise of YouTube .
In fact , we will be using YouTube itself temporarily until Science Direct is augmented to handle flash files ( which I hope will be within a few months ) .
The url is :
http://www.youtube.com/user/JournalNumberTheory
where there is a short video about these multimedia abstracts !
I expect the video to be very low key like the one on the above url .
I also think that , frankly , it will be a fun thing to do after all the hard work producing an accepted manuscript !
Certainly the technology to produce such videos is now ubiquitous worldwide .
It is important to note that ALL such videos will be archived by Elsevier and thus will be available for future scholars and mathematicians .
With a little thought one can see vast possibilities here :
For instance a paper on the topology of elliptic curves could be proceeded by a short video of computer graphics narrated by the author etc .
' Nearly 60 % ' of parents would send their children to private school if they could afford it
Record numbers of parents want their children to go to private schools amid fears of collapsing discipline and ' moral standards ' in the state sector , a poll found yesterday .
Fifty - seven per cent said they would go private if they could afford the fees - up from 51 per cent in 1997 and 48 per cent four years ago .
A change of heart among Labour voters was behind the increase , according to the Mori poll for the Independent Schools Council .
Poll : Record numbers of parents want to send their children to private schools that enforce classroom discipline ( picture posed by models )
It is revealed today that private school pupils are tightening their grip on top universities including Oxford and Cambridge .
More state school students are going on to higher education - but the most prestigious institutions are accepting fewer of them .
Just 53 per cent of entrants to Oxford in 2006 attended state schools - down from 53.7 per cent in 2005 .
At Cambridge , the proportion has fallen from 57.9 per cent to 57.6 per cent .
Other leading institutions recording a decline or no change in recruitmentof state pupils include Bristol , Durham , Manchester - and Prince William 's alma mater , St Andrews .
The state system educates 93 per cent of children but dons have complained that too few achieve top grades in traditional A - levels .
The figures , produced by the Higher Education Statistics Agency , will dismay ministers who have waged an eight - year campaign to close the social class gap at university .
Today 's figures also show that the number of state school pupils at university increased overall , from 86.9 per cent to 87.2 per cent .
But leaders of the Russell Group of 20 elite universities said students from state schools and working - class backgrounds remained under - represented due to a combination of 'low aspirations , lack of advice and guidance and most importantly under- achievement at school ' .
Wendy Piatt , its director - general , said : ' These are complex problems which our universities alone cannot solve .
Quite simply , we cannot consider students who do not apply . '

The first annual Gotham Prize for Cancer Research went to Alexander Varshavsky , the Smits Professor of Cell Biology at California Institute of Technology , the organizers of the prize announced on Tuesday .
“ His idea stood out because it was truly a novel approach to cancer therapy , ” said Dr. Gary Curhan of Harvard Medical School , who teamed up with two hedge fund managers to develop the prize .
“ Many of the current treatments have potential side effects and are not specific to the cancer .
The one that he is proposing is very specific and has the potential to have few side - effects or even none , ” Curhan told Reuters in a telephone interview .
Last May , Curhan joined hedge fund managers Joel Greenblatt and Robert Goldstein of private investment firm Gotham Capital to announce they had established a " club , " Web site and a cash prize at www.gothamprize.org/.
They said federal funding of cancer research has been flat , and the system of seeking money to do research is based around pleasing either National Institutes of Health supervisors or gatekeepers at the advocacy organizations that pay for research on specific types of cancer .
“ We believe that making progress in cancer research means sharing ideas and encouraging out - of - the - box thinking , ” said Greenblatt .
Varshavsky proposed an idea he called deletion - specific targeting , based on DNA that is missing from tumor cells but found in normal healthy cells .
“ ( It ) involves , in a nutshell , the finding of a genuine Achilles Heel of cancer cells , i.e. , their potentially vulnerable feature that wo n’t change during tumor progression , ” Varshavsky said in a statement .
“ A deletion - specific targeting - based drug is envisioned as a sophisticated molecular device that enters a cell , ‘ examines ’ it for the presence of cancer - specific DNA deletions , and thereafter ‘ decides ’ whether it entered a cancer cell , in which case the drug activates its warhead and kills that cell , ” he added .
“ There has n’t been funding from government or a foundation or commercial enterprises for this approach , ” Greenblatt told Reuters .
Varshavsky won the 2000 Lasker award , a prestigious prize for medical research , for his work in discovering a gene called ubiquitin , which is active in many cell types .
“ When we evaluate the prizes we do n’t look at the individual ’s qualifications , ” Curhan said .
He said the group wanted to get ideas from all sources -- including from people who are not experts in cancer .
“ Our hope is that people will go to the site and read all the ideas that are there .
The focus of the site is sharing all the ideas , ” Curhan said .
“ We hope that this will jump start other investigators to start looking at these ideas . ”
The group also awarded the $ 250,000 Ira Sohn Conference Foundation Prize in Pediatric Oncology to Dr. Mark Carol , a neurosurgeon and entrepreneur , for his idea to deliver low - energy X - rays in sufficient amounts to kill cancer cells while at the same time protecting healthy cells and tissue .
Carol helped set up several California - based companies involved in diagnosing and treating cancer .
“ Sometimes you have to make a prototype to get the point across . ”
This morning I listening to the Scoble interview of the Twitter guys , and Biz Stone , the co-founder of the company , was explaining how the concept for Twitter was born .
It ’s an interesting story because nobody at the company thought it was a good idea .
It was n’t until they actually built a prototype that people started to see the usefulness of Twitter .
Biz puts it best when he said :
“ We had to build a prototype to get the point across .
Sometimes you have to do that . ”
As creative people , there are going to be times when you have ideas that no one will fully understand but you .
And that ’s ok .
Do n’t let that discourage you .
But you ca n’t expect people to believe in a concept for too long .
Build that prototype and show them what it does .
Seeing is believing .
Oh , and you can follow me on Twitter too .
Have a great weekend !
Researcher Daan Hobbelen of TU Delft ( The Netherlands ) has developed a new , highly - advanced walking robot : Flame .
This type of research , for which Hobbelen will receive his PhD on Friday 30 May , is important as it provides insight into how people walk .
This can in turn help people with walking difficulties through improved diagnoses , training and rehabilitation equipment .
If you try to teach a robot to walk , you will discover just how complex an activity it is .
Walking robots have been around since the seventies .
The applied strategies can roughly be divided into two types .
The first derives from the world of industrial robots , in which everything is fixed in routines , as is the case with factory robots .
This approach can , where sufficient time and money are invested , produce excellent results , but there are major restrictions with regard to cost , energy consumption and flexibility .
Human
TU Delft is a pioneer of the other method used for constructing walking robots , which examines the way humans walk .
This is really very similar to falling forward in a controlled fashion .
Adopting this method replaces the cautious , rigid way in which robots walk with the more fluid , energy - efficient movement used by humans .
PhD student Daan Hobbelen has demonstrated for the first time that a robot can be both energy - efficient and highly stable .
His breakthrough came in inventing a suitable method for measuring the stability of the way people walk for the first time .
This is remarkable , as ‘ falling forward ’ is traditionally viewed as an unstable movement .
Next he built a new robot with which he was able to demonstrate the improved performance : Flame .
Flame contains seven motors , an organ of balance and various algorithms which ensure its high level of stability .
advertisement
For instance , the robot can apply the information provided by its organ of balance to place its feet slightly further apart in order to prevent a potential fall .
According to Hobbelen , Flame is the most advanced walking robot in the world , at least in the category of robots which apply the human method of walking as a starting principle .
Rehabilitation
Modelling the walking process allows researchers to construct two - legged robots which walk more naturally .
More insight into the walking process can in turn help people with walking difficulties , for example through improved diagnoses , training and rehabilitation equipment .
TU Delft is working on this together with motion scientists at VU University Amsterdam .
Hobbelen cites ankles as an example .
These joints are a type of spring which can be used to define the best level of elasticity .
Research conducted by Hobbelen into Flame ’s ankles has provided motion scientists with more insight into this topic .
Football - playing robots
Over the next few years , TU Delft intends to take major steps forward in research into walking robots .
These include developing walking robots which can ‘ learn ’ , see and run .
One very special part of the robot research concerns football - playing robots .
On Thursday 29 May , together with the University of Twente , TU Eindhoven and Philips , TU Delft will present the Dutch RoboCup team which is to participate in the 2008 RoboCup Soccer in China this summer .
This presentation will take place at TU Delft during the international Dynamic Walking 2008 conference held from 26 - 29 May .
Biomechanics experts , motion scientists and robot experts will come together at this event to exchange expertise on the walking process .
Just a little over three months ago , President Bush declared he " had n't heard " that gasoline would soon reach $ 4 a gallon .
Today , the milestone anticipated by all save the President of the United States came to pass :
" Drivers are paying an average of $ 4 for a gallon of gasoline for the first time .
AAA and the Oil Price Information Service say the national average price for a gallon of regular gas rose to $ 4.005 overnight from $ 3.988 .
But consumers in many parts of the country have already been paying well above that price for some time . "
Given the stratospheric - and uninterrupted - rise in oil and gas prices , Bush 's February 28 display of ignorance is all the more jaw - dropping .
Asked by a reporter about the looming arrival of $ 4 gas , Bush the former oil man did what comes naturally and played dumb :
Q What 's your advice to the average American who is hurting now , facing the prospect of $ 4 a gallon gasoline , a lot of people facing -- THE PRESIDENT : Wait , what did you just say ?
You 're predicting $ 4 a gallon gasoline ?
Q
A number of analysts are predicting -- THE PRESIDENT : Oh , yeah ?
Q -- $ 4 a gallon gasoline this spring when they reformulate .
THE PRESIDENT : That 's interesting .
I had n't heard that .
Perrspectives has more on Bush 's mind - numbing mindlessness and his dismal history of broken promises to " jawbone " his Saudi and Kuwaiti friends into opening the spigots .

Stephen Colbert looks at the miraculous profits realized by oil companies despite their claim of the high cost of providing the oil .
Download Download ( h/t Bill W )
As you can see here , 72 % goes to the price of crude oil .
Another 16 % is eaten up by refining , distribution and service stations , and the last 12 % is taken away by taxes .
That is a total of 100 % .
That is right , Nation .
Oil is a zero - profit business . [..]
And yet somehow , in 2007 , Exxon / Mobil earned $ 1,300 a second .
$ 1,300 .
Yes , that ’s a lot of money , but it is an unlucky number of 100s .
Nation , that means even though 100 % of gasoline prices are canceled out by costs , these companies are somehow able to wring mind - bending revenue out of their not - for - profit venture .
I think it ’s pretty impressive .
WASHINGTON In recent weeks , France has been swamped with events commemorating the student uprising of May 1968  which actually started in March and finished in June .
Less attention has been paid to the 40th anniversary of the student revolts in other countries , including the United States .
Was the May 1968 French uprising an anarchist attack on all forms of authority , as some libertarians believed ?
Was it an assault on conservatism , as its most visible leader , Daniel Cohn - Bendit , predicted ?
Was it an attempt to rescue the left from Soviet - style communism , which would explain why the communist unions opposed the students ?
Was it an act of hypocrisy by young protesters who embraced Che Guevara and Mao Zedong at the same time that they targeted Charles de Gaulles authoritarianism and Stalins European heirs ?
Was it just a tantrum by the rich kids who ripped up the cobblestones in the Latin Quarter out of boredom ?
Or was it , as the protest slogans invited us to think , one noisy pretext for poetry ( all power to the imagination ,  it is forbidden to forbid ) ?
It was all of the above a massive contradiction .
Which is why , 40 years on , the legacy is also contradictory .
Despite the fact that the uprising lasted only a few months and de Gaulle later won a landslide in the legislative elections that he was forced to call , the individualist spirit of that uprising did a lot to unleash European customs from the corset in which they were confined .
In doing so , it may have paradoxically helped to accelerate Frances globalization .
Perhaps no one puts it better than the French academic Serge Audier :  The 68 generation played a key role in the development of capitalism at the end of the 1970s , by lifting the last barrier to unfettered commercialism : traditional values . 
And yet the spirit of 1968 , with its silly denunciation of private enterprise and its glorification of socialist terrorists , also brought about a conformism in French society that is greatly responsible for the economic decline of recent decades .
With French students , civil servants and union members today protesting against timid attempts by President Nicolas Sarkozy to streamline the bureaucracy , and intellectuals providing them with academic respectability , the heirs of May 1968 are now the guardians of privilege .
In 1968 , students claimed they wanted liberty from the state .
Today , they want security paid by the state .
What in 1968 was a revolt against authority turned into the sacralization of government power .
In other countries , we have seen a similar effect .
In the United States , those who protested on college campuses against authority and inequality were doing so at a time when the Lyndon Johnson administration was achieving the biggest increase in government programs since Franklin D. Roosevelts New Deal .
Furthermore , the protest movement later provoked a conservative reaction against the excesses of the counterculture that caused an unhealthy blurring of politics and religion spearheaded by an evangelical movement that , under the cloak of traditional values , sought to impose its moral agenda on the rest of society .
In France , the contradiction is visible in Sarkozy himself .
He defied every social convention after assuming power by divorcing his second wife and then marrying Italian model Carla Bruni , turning his first year in office into a tabloid spectacle .
Andre Gluckman , a former soixante - huitard , as the May 1968 rebels are called in France , said that the French president doesnt know how much he owes to the mental or moral revolution of 1968 .
Without  68 , a divorced man , a man of his background , would never have gotten to the presidential palace .
He was referring to Sarkozys Jewish and immigrant background .
On the other hand , Sarkozy has reneged on his pledges to end the 35 - hour workweek and engage in other reforms , exhibiting a conformism not unlike his predecessors .
In March 1968 , the French minister for youth and sports was confronted at Nanterre University by a red - haired student who complained about the fact that men and women could not share the same dormitories .
 If you have a sexual problem , go and take a cold shower ,  the minister famously replied to Cohn - Bendit , who was known as Danny the Red .
A few weeks later , the student revolt was in full swing , and it soon caught the worlds imagination .
Forty years later , it looks like the French student movement and its heirs actually decided to take that shower and dampen their appetite for real change .
The outbreak of criticism in response to the acquittal of several New York City police officers in the shooting death of 23 - year - old Sean Bell has prompted rapper / activist Immortal Technique to compile a list of stories showing the pervasiveness of police brutality across the United States .
“ Police State Chronicles ” will be a collection of experiences of real people from different ethnicities and socio-economic statuses — including Technique himself — across the country detailing police misconduct .
After the stories are compiling , Technique intends to distribute “ Police State Chronicles ” to the media , Congress , the Department of Justice and even the United Nations .
“ The violation of people ’s fundamental human rights , is not just a race issue , or an inner city issue , this is a national issue , ” Technique said via statement .
“ The state is taking people ’s most precious belongings , their lives , without any sort of due process . ”
“ Historically , the police in this country have been kept separate from the military so as to protect people ’s civil rights , but as this police state becomes more militarized and its abuses grow , it is a harbinger of the fragmentation of our democracy . ”
Technique also made an appeal to all readers and fans that have had an experience with police brutality to contribute .
“ We would genuinely appreciate people ’s participation in sharing their stories , ” he said .
“ Please do not think your story is too small or too insignificant to share . ”
People interested should include their name , location and permission for Immortal Technique to use the name / story in the packet .
E-mail stories to policestatechronicles@yahoo.com .
The first story , from Immortal Technique , can be found by clicking here .
A common practice found in many extensions is using XMLHttpRequest ( or some other mechanism ) to download JavaScript or JSON ( they are different ) from a remote website .
Once the content has been downloaded , the extension authors proceed to use eval ( ) to decode the string content into JavaScript objects .
This practice is dangerous and will not , in fact , pass an AMO review .
So the extension will not be allowed to move out of the AMO sandbox .
The practice is dangerous because the decoded JavaScript has full chrome privileges and could perform some nasty actions .
How could the JavaScript an extension downloads perform nasty actions ?
Fairly easy if the webserver where the JavaScript is hosted were to be hijacked or compromised .
It happens to the best of us .
AMO takes the threat very seriously .
The good news is there are several ways to workaround the problem .
Downloading JSON
If the extension is downloading JSON , then the developer should be using one of the JSON decoding methods discussed here and not using eval ( ) at all .
JSON is about state and does not allow functions to be decoded .
The JSON decoding methods available to extension developers protect the extension from malicious JSON and JavaScript .
Downloading state from a remote webserver using JSON is becoming extremely popular .
Use the JSON decoders , not eval ( ) !
Downloading JavaScript
Of course there are times when JavaScript code modules are downloaded and injected into the extension .
This usually happens because the extension is trying to keep some of its code fresh and dynamic , and the developers do n't want to create a new version of the extension for each script change .
In this case , JavaScript sandboxing should be used to isolate the downloaded JavaScript from the rest of the extension , and host application .
The article is all about cell phone recycling the poison in our cell phones .
This article explains why recycling of cell phone is necessary .
Is cell phone recycling necessary ?
Why recycle cell phones ?
Yesterday , we discussed the sorry state of cell phone recycling in America , and as I mentioned in that post , there ’s a large percentage in our population who are unaware that cell phone recycling is possible or that it ’s necessary .
The iSuppli survey , cited in that article , identified over 10 percent of cell phone users in the US threw their cell phones away last year or declared these as lost or stolen .
In actual numbers , that ’s approximately 10 million cell phones from 2007 ending up in our landfills .
In this follow - up post , we will be exploring one of the most compelling reasons why cell phone recycling is absolutely necessary to protect ourselves and the environment .
Let ’s look at the poison in our cell phones .
Electronic waste or e-waste ( TV sets , computers , cell phones , etc. ) contain highly - toxic heavy metals and chemicals .
The circuit boards , batteries , and casing of these products contain lead , cadmium , mercury , brominated flame retardants ( BFRs ) , polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) , etc .
The danger lies in the absence of cell phone recycling and improper disposal .
Deposited in our landfills and exposed to the elements , e- waste could potentially leach these dangerous chemicals into the surrounding soil and into our underground water systems .
How dangerous are these chemicals and metals ?
Lead –
Here ’s the Wikipedia excerpt on the toxicity of this metal :
Lead is a poisonous metal that can damage nervous connections ( especially in young children ) and cause blood and brain disorders .
Long term exposure to lead or its salts ( especially soluble salts or the strong oxidant PbO2 ) can cause nephropathy , and colic - like abdominal pains .
According to Dr. Anne Marie Helmenstine , author and leading authority in biomedical sciences , lead has been found to cause development problems in children and diminishes brain functions even in adults .
In a recent publication , Dr. Kim Dietrich from the University of Cincinnati , has associated lead exposure during childhood to deviant criminal behavior in adults .
According to Dr. Dietrich ’s report , their findings “ implicate early exposure to lead as a risk factor for behaviors leading to criminal arrest . ”
Although each cell phone contains only minute amount of lead compared to a TV set or a computer monitor , for instance , which can contain 4 - 5 lbs.
of lead , the sheer number of cell phones thrown into our landfills multiply this amount a million times .
It is estimated that the total 500 million cell phones dumped into our landfills could potentially leak 312,000 pounds of lead into our underground water systems .
Mercury – Found in the batteries of cell phones , Mercury is a cumulative metal poison .
Mercury exposure can :
… damage the central nervous system and other organs or organ systems such as the liver or gastrointestinal tract .
Symptoms typically include sensory impairment ( vision , hearing , speech ) , disturbed sensation and a lack of coordination .
Dr. Richard Lathe , a specialist in childhood autism and former professor at the University of Edinburgh , and author of Autism , Brain And Environment has identified exposure to heavy metal like mercury as one of the primary factors in the increase in the incidence of autism .
Cadmium –
Also found in cell phone batteries , Cadmium exposure can lead to “ liver and irreversible kidney problems ( often fatal ) , respiratory and bone density problems .
Compounds containing cadmium are also carcinogenic .
Brominated flame retardants ( BFRs ) and polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) , used in cell phone casing , have come under fire in recent years because these chemicals have been found to leach highly - toxic and / or carcinogenic chemicals , under certain conditions .
Most of our landfills today are scientifically designed with special protective lining and cover to contain chemicals leaking from the solid waste , but will you gamble the health of your children and your own health , on the chance that cell phones and other electronic wastes we so carelessly throw to our landfills will not leach chemicals into our underground water systems ?
Or contaminate the surrounding areas near our homes ?
The likelihood of these dangerous and deadly chemicals seeping into our water systems is just too high .
By not doing cell phone recycling or by dumping cell phones and other electronic wastes in our landfills , we are practically poisoning ourselves .
In the light of these , do you still think cell phone recycling is unnecessary ?
The Health Ranger 's $ 10,000 Health Challenge to Big Pharma
Rules for the challenge
Frequently Asked Questions
( Natural News )
It is the position of Big Pharma that pharmaceuticals make people healthier .
That 's the whole point of taking them , of course -- to enhance your health in some way that the human body apparently cannot achieve on its own ( if you believe the drug ads , anyway ) .
The drug industry 's direct - to - consumer advertisements further imply this cause / effect relationship between pharmaceuticals and health by portraying drug consumers to be happy , healthy and fit .
Taking medications , these ads imply , will make you happy , healthy and fit !
The conventional medical community further supports this idea by insisting that medications alone can treat disease , cure disease or enhance a person 's health .
Nutritional supplements , they claim , are worthless and provide no health benefits whatsoever .
No medical doctor in America can legally prescribe herbs , nutritional supplements or even healing foods forhealth condition whatsoever !
Remarkably , this is also the official position of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration which claims that any nutritional supplement with any biological effect whatsoever is no longer a " supplement " but is magically transformed into an " unapproved drug " and therefore can no longer be legally sold in America .
Only inert substances , according to the FDA , can be sold as nutritional supplements .
Through the exaggeration of pharmaceutical benefits and the ongoing campaign of censorship against functional foods , superfoods and nutritional supplements , the conventional medical industry has managed to convince the majority of health consumers that medications keep them healthy while nutritional supplements are dangerous .
Yet I sayBut rather than argue these points with a room full of corrupt , on - the - take scientists who work for Big Pharma and have intentionally engineered clinical trials to discredit nutrition while touting the rigged results of their own fraudulent drug trials , I 've come up with a much simpler way to counter the lies and deceptions of the entire pharmaceutical industry : I 've decided to put their claims to the test with a public challenge .
On behalf of the natural health community and all the free citizens of our world who have had their health freedoms stolen from them by a corrupt , dishonest and utterly criminal pharmaceutical industry , I'm offering $ 10,000 to any drug company that can produce a single person taking eight " health enhancing " pharmaceuticals ( see below ) who can beat me in the competition described here .
If they beat me , I write them a $ 10,000 check out of my own personal bank account .
On the other hand , if I win , they have to donate $ 10,000 to the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center , where I will direct the funds to be spent on providing nutritional supplements for low - income expectant mothers .
Watch the YouTube video of this $ 10,000 health challenge here : https://www.naturalnews.com/023475.html
The drug companies , you see , claim that the more drugs you take , the healthier you become !
Cardiovascular drugs , they say , improve the health of your cardiovascular system .
Antidepressant drugs improve the health of your brain , and blood thinning drugs improve the flow of blood through your veins , they insist .
So should n't a person taking five , six , or even eight drugs be healthier than a person who takes no such drugs ?
According to the messages broadcast in Big Pharma 's television ads , because I take no drugs whatsoever :
No prescription drugs , no over - the - counter drugs and no recreational drugs .
If you believe Big Pharma 's position that drugs make you healthier , then it should be a very simple matter for Big Pharma to come up with somebody who has better cardiovascular health than myself , right ?
Think about it :
There are over 300 million people in America .
More than half of them take prescription drugs .
That 's over 150 million people from which Big Pharma can choose in order to beat one guy ( me ) in a contest of physical health .
And yet , as you 're about to find out , .
They simply do n't exist .
And why ?
Because drugs make you sicker , not healthier , and My challenge is extended to any pharmaceutical company with more than $ 250 million in annual sales .
Subjects selected for the competition must be taking the following pharmaceuticals ( and must have been taking them for one full year in order for the " health effects " to fully kick in ) : • COX - 2 inhibitor ( anti-inflammatory ) •
Blood thinner drug ( like Coumadin ) •
Blood pressure drug ( like Toprol ) • Statin drug ( anti-cholesterol ) • SSRI drug ( antidepressant ) •
Sleep drug ( like Ambien ) • Hypertension drug ( like Norvasc ) • Antibiotic ( like Amoxicillin ) Furthermore , subjects cannot be taking any nutritional supplements or eating superfoods , since these are precisely the things that conventional medicine insists have no health benefits whatsoever in the human body .
So I 'll be taking all the nutritional supplements , and the drug company participant will be taking all the medications .
Participants will have to sign a full disclosure relieving me of any responsibility for their own death , since the level of physical exertion in this competition may very well be enough to cause a medicated person to die of a heart attack or stroke .
( After all , these drugs kill 100,000 people a year , and most of those people are n't even exerting themselves ... )
Furthermore , given the overwhelming advantage of allowing the drug companies to select any person from among 150 million drug - taking American consumers , I 'm giving myself the relatively minor advantage of choosing the five events of the competition , which will be revealed when the challenge begins .
To prove they are serious in this challenge , any participating pharmaceutical company must deposit $ 10,000 with the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center , which will keep their deposit if they lose the competition .
If they win , the Consumer Wellness Center will return their deposit , and I will personally write them a check for an additional $ 10,000 .
Challenge participants can be of any age over 18 .
Yes , at the age of 38 , I will gladly compete with challengers half my age , as long as they are on the required medications .
If any participants have the gumption to show up , this event will be filmed and broadcast on NaturalNews.com , YouTube , Google Video and other online video outlets .
Further details of the participation requirements and legal contract are available by contacting NaturalNews through our feedback form : https://www.naturalnews.com/feedback.html
There are quite a few other details to this , such as travel arrangements , who pays for the blood tests , video broadcast rights , and so on , so if any drug company seriously wants to step up to this challenge , contact us for full legal details .
Answer :
No , pharmaceutical companies sell drugsMany of the marketing messages for these drugs today emphasize that you do n't have to be sick or diseased to benefit from taking these drugs !
They 're often prescribed on a " preventive " basis , with the claim that they " prevent disease ! "
Thus , I 'm only competing with people who have been told their health would beby taking pharmaceuticals , regardless of whether they are actually sick or diseased .
Answer : I know I can win because I pursue an extremely high - end diet of superfoods , fresh juices , nutritional supplements , herbs and other edible plants .
I do not eat junk foods , processed foods , microwaved foods or animal products of any kind .
Thus , my body is in such a high state of human health ( which is actually just a " normal " state for a human being ) that no person consuming junk foods and pharmaceuticals can possibly keep up .
I 'm so confident in this fact that I 'm willing to back it up with $ 10,000 of my own money . , regardless of their age .
Answer : Somebody had to stand up and declareRather than waiting around for somebody else to state the obvious , I 've decided to state it myself .
This is n't about me , it 's about defending the credibility of the natural health community and demanding that the drug companies either put up , or shut up .
If their drugs really make people healthier , then they should have no problem finding someone to beat me , right ?
Meanwhile , there are lots of people in the raw foods community who have greater endurance , strength and stamina than me .
Note that I am intentionally not challenging all the raw , living foods consumers with this !
( Because people who eat lots of superfoods are really , really healthy and fit ! )
Answer : I do not approach strength training from a cosmetic standpoint .
Rather than building bulky - looking muscles , I focus on building , which is deep in the skeletal system .
Besides , my physical strength my surprise you :
In the gym , I regularly out - lift hulking " gym apes " on all kinds of exercises .
Size does not equal strength .
Just ask Peter Ragnar ( www.RoaringLionPublishing.com
Answer :
That 's up to me .
There will be five exercises , with one focused on each of the five areas : Strength , endurance , flexibility , coordination and adaptability .
These exercises will not be revealed until the day of the competition .
Answer :
We require blood tests in the months leading up to the event in order to document their consumption of the eight required pharmaceuticals .
We fully expect drug companies to try to cheat in this competition , since that 's the way they routinely conduct business with the world .
But we 'll do our best to prevent them from cheating .
Answer : I now eat a 100 % plant - based diet .
( Until recently , I did eat some oily fish , but now my diet is 100 % plant - based . )
My diet is about 80 % raw , living foods , and 20 % cooked foods ( cooked veggies ) .
I do not drink cow 's milk or eat cheese , hamburgers , pizza , donuts , white bread , fried foods , sodas , refined sugars or any other similar items .
My breakfast is a superfood smoothie , my lunch is a delicious blend of fresh fruit and vegetable juices , and my dinner is made from fresh , plant ingredients .
I take over 20 nutritional supplements a day , I get hours of direct sunshine on my skin each day , and I exercise regularly .
Answer :
Most humans have crippled their health with medications , junk foods and toxic chemicals in their homes and personal care products .
Most people live their lives as little more than a shadow of what they 're truly capable of , both physically and mentally ( not to mention spiritually ) .
I do not claim to be superhuman , I only claim to be maintaining the normal state of health that all human beings were meant to achieve .
Anyone can achieve the same level of health I have achieved by simply eating what I eat and doing what I do .
Achieving an extremely high level of human health is not a mystery ( unless , of course , you 're a medical doctor , in which case the whole universe of nutrition is a great mystery to you ... )
Answer : Big Pharma is committing chemical atrocities against the human race .
By medicating children , adults and senior citizens with medically unnecessary ( and downright dangerous ) drugs , Big Pharma has become the single greatest threat to the health and safety of the citizens of our world .
It is an industry based on lies , deception and criminal conduct , and it is time that someone stood up to the industry and called them to the mat on their lies .
Since the mainstream media has hopelessly sold out to Big Pharma , and government regulators have become the unabashed promoters of patented pharmaceuticals , it is up to independent health journalists like me to stand up and question the credibility of this entire drug industry .
Because , when you really look at it , you 'll find that Drugs simply do not work .
They do not make people healthier , period .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Grammy - nominated rapper Remy Ma was sentenced to eight years in prison on Tuesday for shooting and wounding an acquaintance after discovering money was missing from her purse after a night out in Manhattan .
Rap artist Remy Smith , better known by her stage name Remy Ma , arrives at state court regarding shooting charges , in New York , March 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Chip East
In sentencing the rapper , criminal court judge Rena Uviller said Remy Ma , whose real name is Remy Smith , was “ an extremely angry young woman whose anger is completely out of control . ”
In March , a New York jury found Smith , nominated for a 2004 Grammy for her part in Terror Squad ’s song “ Lean Back , ” guilty of assault , weapons possession and attempted coercion .
Smith ’s lawyer , Ivan Fisher , called the shooting in the early hours of July 14 , 2007 , accidental and suggested the victim , Makeda Barnes - Joseph , was exaggerating the facts to win a large sum in a separate civil suit .
Smith believed her friend had taken $ 3,000 from her and that her gun went off as the pair struggled over her purse .
The bullet pierced Barnes - Joseph ’s colon and hit her rectum and sent her to a hospital for three weeks .
In appealing for leniency , Smith tearfully described how she had grown up in homeless shelters , “ surrounded by poverty and drugs and violence and failure . ”
“ Remy Ma is not even close to who I really am .
I ’m not a thug , ” she said .
“ I ’m not a threat or a menace to society , and I still have so much to offer . ”
But prosecutor Michael McIntosh said that Smith had a habit of traveling with a loaded weapon and said something like this “ was bound to happen one day . ”
The sentence was read aloud to a packed courtroom , including the rapper ’s fiance , the rapper Papoose .
Smith and Papoose had planned to marry yesterday at New York ’s Rikers Island jail , but the ceremony was canceled after a handcuff key was discovered on Papoose , officials said .
After the sentencing , as Smith ’s friends and family gathered outside the courtroom , Papoose had to be restrained as he lurched at one of the 15 court officers who had been stationed in the courtroom .
In a phone interview from prison last week on the satellite radio show with New York DJ Kay Slay , Smith said she was innocent and that there is a “ whole conspiracy against rappers right now . ”
“ Do n’t be mistaken by a jury that was not my peers .
Like , there was not tan , dark brown , black , nothin ’ on that jury , ” she said .
The human race is living beyond its means .
A report backed by 1,360 scientists from 95 countries - some of them world leaders in their fields - today warns that the almost two - thirds of the natural machinery that supports life on Earth is being degraded by human pressure .
The study contains what its authors call " a stark warning " for the entire world .
The wetlands , forests , savannahs , estuaries , coastal fisheries and other habitats that recycle air , water and nutrients for all living creatures are being irretrievably damaged .
In effect , one species is now a hazard to the other 10 million or so on the planet , and to itself .
" Human activity is putting such a strain on the natural functions of Earth that the ability of the planet 's ecosystems to sustain future generations can no longer be taken for granted , " it says .
The report , prepared in Washington under the supervision of a board chaired by Robert Watson , the British - born chief scientist at the World Bank and a former scientific adviser to the White House , will be launched today at the Royal Society in London .
It warns that :
· Because of human demand for food , fresh water , timber , fibre and fuel , more land has been claimed for agriculture in the last 60 years than in the 18th and 19th centuries combined .
· An estimated 24 % of the Earth 's land surface is now cultivated .
· Water withdrawals from lakes and rivers has doubled in the last 40 years .
Humans now use between 40 % and 50 % of all available freshwater running off the land .
· At least a quarter of all fish stocks are overharvested .
In some areas , the catch is now less than a hundredth of that before industrial fishing .
· Since 1980 , about 35 % of mangroves have been lost , 20 % of the world 's coral reefs have been destroyed and another 20 % badly degraded .
· Deforestation and other changes could increase the risks of malaria and cholera , and open the way for new and so far unknown disease to emerge .
In 1997 , a team of biologists and economists tried to put a value on the " business services " provided by nature - the free pollination of crops , the air conditioning provided by wild plants , the recycling of nutrients by the oceans .
They came up with an estimate of $ 33 trillion , almost twice the global gross national product for that year .
But after what today 's report , Millennium Ecosystem Assessment , calls " an unprecedented period of spending Earth 's natural bounty " it was time to check the accounts .
" That is what this assessment has done , and it is a sobering statement with much more red than black on the balance sheet , " the scientists warn .
" In many cases , it is literally a matter of living on borrowed time .
By using up supplies of fresh groundwater faster than they can be recharged , for example , we are depleting assets at the expense of our children . "
Flow from rivers has been reduced dramatically .
For parts of the year , the Yellow River in China , the Nile in Africa and the Colorado in North America dry up before they reach the ocean .
An estimated 90 % of the total weight of the ocean 's large predators - tuna , swordfish and sharks - has disappeared in recent years .
An estimated 12 % of bird species , 25 % of mammals and more than 30 % of all amphibians are threatened with extinction within the next century .
Some of them are threatened by invaders .
The Baltic Sea is now home to 100 creatures from other parts of the world , a third of them native to the Great Lakes of America .
Conversely , a third of the 170 alien species in the Great Lakes are originally from the Baltic .
Invaders can make dramatic changes : the arrival of the American comb jellyfish in the Black Sea led to the destruction of 26 commercially important stocks of fish .
Global warming and climate change , could make it increasingly difficult for surviving species to adapt .
A growing proportion of the world lives in cities , exploiting advanced technology .
But nature , the scientists warn , is not something to be enjoyed at the weekend .
Conservation of natural spaces is not just a luxury .
" These are dangerous illusions that ignore the vast benefits of nature to the lives of 6 billion people on the planet .
We may have distanced ourselves from nature , but we rely completely on the services it delivers . "
" We 'll just fix that in post ! " has always been the rallying cry for filmmakers in the middle of a troubled production .
Unfortunately , sometimes things have a nasty habit of actually getting broken in post - production , usually thanks to studio interference .
5 I Am Legend
The Way It Was Supposed To Be :
In this adaptation of Richard Matheson 's classic horror novella , Will Smith plays Doctor Robert " Legend " Neville , the last man alive in a city overrun with CGI vampire mutants .

In the film 's original ending , Neville is trapped as vampires break through his barricades and infiltrate his hideout ( who would have guessed that locking yourself in an enclosed space in the middle of a city full of vampires would turn out to be a bad idea ? ) .
Then , this happens :
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Yeah .
In the original , the vampires are revealed to be thinking , benevolent creatures who were merely attempting to rescue a vampire that Neville had captured earlier .
Not only does the book end in a similar way , but it in fact was the entire freaking point of the book .
That 's where the title " I Am Legend " came from , Neville 's realization at the end that the vampires were the good guys and that he was the monster of their legends , since he had been mindlessly driving stakes through their heart at every opportunity .
Maybe a title like So I'm The Asshole would have been clearer .

The " Improved " Version :
Because test audiences apparently did n't like the original ending , the studio opted to go with a new one in which Neville fights back against the vampires to protect his new allies .
He does so by igniting a grenade about two inches from their face , destroying the once - safe stronghold and severely injuring his companions .
It should also be noted that going by the original ending , Will Smith just murdered scores of reasoning creatures who were attempting to rescue a little girl .
This brings up the other problem , which is that all of the little hints that had been inserted along the way indicating the creatures had intelligence ( the complex traps they set , the same creature reappearing in some kind of leadership role ) are completely ignored .
In the new ending , the vampires are mindless savages with no other purpose but general horror movie mayhem .
Beijing Olympic chiefs are introducing an official cheer for patriotic spectators to spur on Team China at the Games , Chinese media reports .
The authoritative , four - part Olympic cheer , accompanied by detailed instructions , will be promoted on TV , in schools and with a poster campaign .
It involves clapping twice , giving the thumbs - up , clapping twice more and then punching the air with both arms .
The cheer is accompanied by chants of " Olympics " , " Let 's go " and " China " .
The Beijing Olympic Organising Committee has hired 30 cheering squads who will show spectators how it is done at Games stadia , reports Xinhua state media .
' Civilized cheering '
A committee official said the simple chants and gestures were designed to help spectators cheer for their favourite athletes in a smooth , civilized manner .
The Ministry of Education is also arranging special training sessions in schools for the 800,000 students who are expected to attend the Games .
Li Ning , president of the Beijing Etiquette Institute , told the Beijing News that the cheer was in line with general international principles for cheering , while at the same time possessing characteristics of Chinese culture .

See , if you ’re a musician as I am , you know that music is just a bunch of patterns .
It ’s mathematical , really .
So it ’s not all that unusual for “ progressions ” to repeat or be duplicated between songs .

No one has more invested in cluster munitions than the United States , which Human Rights Watch says has been the largest producer , stockpiler and user , using them in the former Yugoslavia , Afghanistan and Iraq .
Others that have used them include Britain , France , Sudan , NATO , Israel and Hezbollah .
United States officials insist the Pentagon must have such munitions .
That is what the Clinton administration said when it opposed the land - mine treaty in 1997 .
It is a weak argument : cluster bombs are weapons for conventional wars with conventional battlefields .
America is less likely to fight big conventional wars than counterinsurgency conflicts in population centers , no place for munitions that kill indiscriminately .
As the main holdout , the United States gives cover to countries like Russia and China , which also rejected the ban .
The treaty is weaker for it : together , these three nations have more than a billion cluster munitions stockpiled , far more than the number of weapons expected to be destroyed .
Also weakening the pact is a loophole that will let America continue military cooperation with treaty signers , even if it uses cluster munitions .
At least this treaty , like the land - mine ban , will stigmatize cluster munitions and make it harder to use them .
Since the land - mine treaty entered into force , experts say more than 40 million have been destroyed , trade in land mines has virtually ended , and in 2007 only two countries  Russia and Myanmar  used them .
The United States has paid $ 1.2 billion ( more than any other nation ) to defuse land mines and clean up war zones .
Modern nations need a range of weapons to protect their legitimate interests .
Cluster munitions that disproportionately harm civilians are not among them .
President Bush must resist the temptation to further sabotage this worthy treaty and let it take effect .
It is not clear where the candidates stand on the treaty , but the next president , whoever it is , should repudiate Mr. Bush ’s opposition and sign it .
Mr Sarkozy opposes a full boycott of the Games
France 's human rights minister has set three conditions for President Nicolas Sarkozy 's attendance of the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony .
Rama Yade told Le Monde newspaper Mr Sarkozy would miss the event unless China sought talks with the Dalai Lama and freed political prisoners .
She added that violence against Tibetans should end and the recent clashes be investigated .
The news came amid new reports of riots in a Tibetan area of western China .
The Olympic torch is due to arrive in Paris on Monday as part of the global relay ahead of the Games .
' Indispensable '
Ms Yade said Mr Sarkozy would decide whether to attend the Games after consulting European Union partners , because he would then be president of the EU .
Pro-Tibet protests have been taking place around the world
But she added that he would still boycott the ceremony if three vital conditions were not met by China .
" Three conditions are indispensable for him to go , " she said .
" An end to violence against the population and the release of political prisoners , investigation of the events in Tibet and the opening of dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
" These discussions should be about the recognition of Tibetan autonomy and the spiritual , religious and cultural identity of Tibetans . "
Mr Sarkozy said last month he was opposed to a full boycott of the Games but did not rule out pulling out of the opening ceremony .
US President George W Bush plans to attend the opening , while UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown intends to go to the closing ceremony .
Several Western nations have called for dialogue with the Dalai Lama , but China has accused him of orchestrating the recent violence .
Dr. Arthur Kramer is a Pro­fes­sor in the Uni­ver­si­ty of Illi­nois Depart­ment of Psy­chol­o­gy , the Cam­pus Neu­ro­science Pro­gram , the Beck­man Insti­tute , and the Direc­tor of the Bio­med­ical Imag­ing Cen­ter at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Illi­nois .
I am hon­ored to inter­view him today .
Dr. Kramer , thank you for your time .
Let ’ start by try­ing to clar­i­fy some exist­ing mis­con­cep­tions and con­tro­ver­sies .
Based on what we know today , and your recent Nature piece ( ref­er­enced below ) , what are the 2 – 3 key lifestyle habits would you sug­gest to a per­son who wants to delay Alzheimer ’s symp­toms and improve over­all brain health ?
First , Be Active .
Do phys­i­cal exer­cise .
Aer­o­bic exer­cise , 30 to 60 min­utes per day 3 days per week , has been shown to have an impact in a vari­ety of exper­i­ments .
And you do n’t need to do some­thing stren­u­ous : even walk­ing has shown that effect .
There are many open ques­tions in terms of spe­cif­ic types of exer­cise , dura­tion , mag­ni­tude of effect but , as we wrote in our recent Nature Reviews Neu­ro­science arti­cle , there is lit­tle doubt that lead­ing a seden­tary life is bad for our cog­ni­tive health .
Car­dio­vas­cu­lar exer­cise seems to have a pos­i­tive effect .
Sec­ond , Main­tain Life­long Intel­lec­tu­al Engage­ment .
There is abun­dant prospec­tive obser­va­tion­al research show­ing that doing more men­tal­ly stim­u­lat­ing activ­i­ties reduces the risk of devel­op­ing Alzheimer ’s symp­toms .
Let me add , giv­en all media hype , that no “ brain game ” in par­tic­u­lar has been shown to have a long - term impact on Alzheimer ’s or the main­te­nance of cog­ni­tion across extend­ed peri­ods of time .
It is too ear­ly for that - and con­sumers should be aware of that fact .
It is true that some com­pa­nies are being more sci­ence - based than oth­ers but , in my view , the con­sumer - ori­ent­ed field is grow­ing faster than the research is .
Ide­al­ly , com­bine both phys­i­cal and men­tal stim­u­la­tion along with social inter­ac­tions .
Why not take a good walk with friends to dis­cuss a book ?
We lead very busy lives , so the more inte­grat­ed and inter­est­ing activ­i­ties are , the more like­ly we will do them .
Great con­cept : a walk­ing book club !
Now , part of the con­fu­sion we observe is due to the search of “ mag­ic solu­tions ” that work for every­one and every­thing .
We pre­fer to talk about sev­er­al pil­lars of brain health , and dif­fer­ent pri­or­i­ties for dif­fer­ent indi­vid­u­als .
Can you elab­o­rate on what inter­ven­tions seem to have a pos­i­tive effect on spe­cif­ic cog­ni­tive abil­i­ties and indi­vid­u­als ?
Per­haps one day we will be able to rec­om­mend spe­cif­ic inter­ven­tions for indi­vid­u­als based on genet­ic test­ing , for exam­ple , but we do n’t have a clue today .
We are only begin­ning to under­stand how the envi­ron­ment inter­acts with our genome .
But I agree on the premise that there prob­a­bly wo n’t be a gen­er­al solu­tion that solves all cog­ni­tive prob­lems , but we need a mul­ti­tude of approach­es .
And we ca n’t for­get , for exam­ple , the cog­ni­tive ben­e­fits from smok­ing ces­sa­tion , sleep , phar­ma­co­log­i­cal inter­ven­tions , nutri­tion , social engage­ment .
Phys­i­cal exer­cise tends to have rather broad effects on dif­fer­ent forms of per­cep­tion and cog­ni­tion , as seen in the Col­combe and Kramer , 2003 , meta - analy­sis pub­lished in Psy­cho­log­i­cal Sci­ence ( Note : ref­er­enced below ) .
Cog­ni­tive train­ing also works for a mul­ti­tude of per­cep­tu­al and cog­ni­tive domains but has shown lit­tle trans­fer beyond trained tasks .
No sin­gle type of inter­ven­tion is suf­fi­cient .
Today there is no clear research on how those dif­fer­ent lifestyle fac­tors may inter­act .
The Nation­al Insti­tute on Aging is start­ing to spon­sor research to address pre­cise­ly that .
Ear­li­er you said that no brain soft­ware in par­tic­u­lar has been shown to main­tain cog­ni­tion across extend­ed peri­ods of time .
Now , did­ n’t the ACTIVE tri­al ( Note : ref­er­enced below ) 5 ‑ year results show how cog­ni­tive train­ing ( com­put­er­ized or not ) can result in pret­ty durable results ?
For con­text , are there com­pa­ra­ble con­trolled stud­ies to ACTIVE where 10 or so hours of phys­i­cal exer­cise today can result in mea­sur­able ( yet , incom­plete ) cog­ni­tive ben­e­fits 5 years from now ?
The ACTIVE study showed a good deal of 5 ‑ year reten­tion of the tasks that were trained for 10 hours each , but lim­it­ed trans­fer of train­ing was found for oth­er untrained tasks .
It seems unlike­ly that sig­nif­i­cant trans­fer may ocur­ring with the rel­a­tive­ly lit­tle train­ing ( e.g. 10 hours in the ACTIVE study ) and focused tasks that have been pro­vid­ed in train­ing stud­ies thus far .
On whether there are con­trolled stud­ies sim­i­lar to ACTIVE that have mea­sured the long - term cog­ni­tive ben­e­fits of phys­i­cal exer­cise , not that I know of .
To wrap up this part of the con­ver­sa­tion , what ’s in your mind the best way to explain the rel­a­tive ben­e­fits of phys­i­cal vs. cog­ni­tive exer­cise ?
From a fun­da­men­tal point of view , it seems clear that phys­i­cal exer­cise can help enhance neu­ro­ge­n­e­sis ( Note : the cre­ation of new neu­rons ) , yet learning / cog­ni­tive exer­cise con­tributes to the sur­vival of those neu­rons by strength­en­ing synaps­es , so I see more how those two “ pil­lars ” are com­pli­men­ta­ry than “ one or the oth­er ” .
I agree .
Giv­en what we know today I would rec­om­mend both intel­lec­tu­al engage­ment and phys­i­cal exer­cise .
How­ev­er , we do know , from a mul­ti­tude of ani­mal stud­ies , that phys­i­cal exer­cise has a mul­ti­tude of effects on brains beyond neu­ro­ge­n­e­sis , includ­ing increas­es in var­i­ous neu­ro­trans­mit­ters , nerve grown fac­tors , and angio­gen­e­sis ( the for­ma­tion of new blood ves­sels ) .
Tell us more about your work with cog­ni­tive train­ing for old­er adults .
We have now a study in press where we eval­u­ate the effect of a com­mer­cial­ly avail­able strat­e­gy video game on old­er adults cog­ni­tion .
Let me first give some con­text .
It seems clear that , as we age , our so - called crys­tal­lized abil­i­ties remain pret­ty sta­ble , where­as the so - called flu­id abil­i­ties decline .
One par­tic­u­lar set of flu­id abil­i­ties are called exec­u­tive func­tions , which deal with exec­u­tive con­trol , plan­ning , deal­ing with ambi­gu­i­ty , pri­or­i­tiz­ing , mul­ti- task­ing .
These skills are cru­cial to main­tain inde­pen­dent liv­ing .
In this study , we exam­ined whether play­ing strat­e­gy - based video game can train those exec­u­tive func­tions and improve them .
We showed that play­ing a strat­e­gy - based video game ( Rise of Nations Gold Edi­tion ) can result in not only becom­ing a bet­ter video game play­er but it trans­ferred to untrained exec­u­tive func­tions .
We saw a sig­nif­i­cant improve­ment in task switch­ing , work­ing mem­o­ry , visu­al short - term mem­o­ry , and men­tal rota­tion .
And some , but more lim­it­ed , ben­e­fits in inhi­bi­tion and rea­son­ing .
I can share a few details on the study : the aver­age age was 69 years , and the exper­i­ment required around 23 hours of train­ing time .
We only includ­ed indi­vid­u­als who had played video games 0 hours / week for the last 2 years .
That last cri­te­ria is inter­est­ing .
We typ­i­cal­ly say that good “ brain exer­cise ” requires nov­el­ty , vari­ety and chal­lenge .
So , if you take adults who are 69 - years - old and have n’t played a videogame in 2 years , how do you know if the ben­e­fit comes from the par­tic­u­lar videogame they played vs. just the val­ue of deal­ing with a new and com­plex task ?
That ’s a great ques­tion .
The real­i­ty is that we do n’t know , since we had a “ wait­ing list con­trol group .
In the future per­haps we should com­pare dif­fer­ent videogames or oth­er men­tal­ly stim­u­lat­ing activ­i­ties against each oth­er and see what method is the most effi­cient .
Per­haps the Nation­al Insti­tutes on Health may be inter­est­ed in fund­ing such research .
In any case , your study rein­forces an impor­tant point : old­er brains can , and do , learn new skills .
Yes .
The rate of learn­ing by old­er adults may be slow­er , and they may ben­e­fit from more explic­it instruc­tion and tech­nol­o­gy train­ing , but , as a soci­ety , it is a mas­sive waste of tal­ent not to ensure old­er adults remain active and pro­duc­tive .
Anoth­er recent study we con­duct­ed , this one still under review , is titled Expe­ri­ence - Based Mit­i­ga­tion of Age - Relat­ed Per­for­mance Declines : Evi­dence from Air Traf­fic Con­trol .
It deals with the ques­tion : “ Can Age Itself Be an Obsta­cle for some­one to per­form as an Air Con­troller ?
And the Answer is : age itself , with­in the age range that we stud­ied , is not an obsta­cle .
Our results sug­gest that , giv­en sub­stan­tial accu­mu­lat­ed expe­ri­ence , old­er adults can be quite capa­ble of per­form­ing at high lev­els of pro­fi­cien­cy on fast - paced demand­ing real - world tasks .
Now , the field of com­put­er­ized cog­ni­tive train­ing has poten­tial in a vari­ety of appli­ca­tions beyond “ healthy aging ” .
You are obvi­ous­ly famil­iar with Daniel Gopher ’s work train­ing mil­i­tary pilots using Space Fortress .
Is your lab doing some­thing in that cog­ni­tive enhance­ment direc­tion ?
Yes , I have been involved in that area of work since the late 70s , when I helped design the pro­to­cols for Space Fortress .
Which pro­vides indeed a very inter­est­ing exam­ple of real - life trans­fer : pilots do seem to fly bet­ter as mea­sured by real - life instru­ments .
Our lab is now embark­ing on a 5 ‑ year study for the Navy to explore ways to cap­i­tal­ize emerg­ing research on brain plas­tic­i­ty to enhance train­ing and per­for­mance .
MIT and my lab will ana­lyze the best train­ing pro­ce­dures to increase the effi­cien­cy and effi­ca­cy of train­ing of indi­vid­ual and team per­for­mance skills , par­tic­u­lar­ly those skills requir­ing high lev­els of flex­i­bil­i­ty .
The results from this study will be in the pub­lic domain , so I hope they con­tribute to the matu­ri­ty of the field at large .
That ’s an impor­tant point .
What does the field of cog­ni­tive fit­ness at large need to mature and become more main­stream ?
We need more research .
But not any kind of research .
What we need is a kind of inde­pen­dent “ Seal of Approval ” based on inde­pen­dent clin­i­cal tri­als .
Most pub­lished research of cog­ni­tive train­ing inter­ven­tions is spon­sored and / or con­duct­ed by the com­pa­nies them­selves .
We need inde­pen­dent , objec­tive and clear stan­dards of excel­lence .
The Depart­ment of Edu­ca­tion main­tains a What Works Clear­ing­house to review exist­ing evi­dence behind pro­grams that make edu­ca­tion - relat­ed claims .
Per­haps we need a sim­i­lar approach for pro­grams mak­ing cog­ni­tive claims with adults .
We also see a need for more sol­id and wide­ly - avail­able cog­ni­tive assess­ments , to have bet­ter base­lines and inde­pen­dent mea­sures of cog­ni­tive abil­i­ties .
Good news there : the NIH is prepar­ing an “ NIH Tool­box ” to pro­vide valid , reli­able instru­ments to researchers and clin­i­cians , to solve the prob­lem that exists today , name­ly , the lack of uni­for­mi­ty among many mea­sures used .
The ini­tia­tive was launched in 2006 , and it is a 5 ‑ year effort , so we ’ll need to wait to see results .
Dr. Kramer , many thanks for your time and work .
My apolo­gies for hav­ing you stay by your desk dur­ing this inter­view .
Next time I am in Illi­nois , I will invite you to a walk­ing inter­view .
Excel­lent idea !
The plea­sure has been mine .
Let me thank you as well , for the very impor­tant work you are doing .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Federal health officials are checking into the possibility that an outbreak of salmonella - caused illness originally linked to tomatoes may instead be linked to something else , they said Friday .
The spread of a salmonella - related illness may not be linked to tomatoes , according to the FDA .
" Produce investigations are very difficult , because a lot of times , vegetables are eaten all together , " said Dr. Patricia Griffin , chief of the Enteric Diseases Epidemiology Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Georgia .
That makes it hard to trace back any one item to a source of contamination , she added .
" We continue to keep an open mind about the possible source of this outbreak , as does FDA . "
Dr. David Acheson , associate commissioner for foods at the Food and Drug Administration , agreed .
" There is a strong epidemiological association with tomatoes , " but the agency is also " looking into other ingredients , " he said .
The scare has prompted grocery chains nationwide to pull tomatoes from their shelves and some restaurants to stop offering them as ingredients .
Acheson said FDA officials and tomato growers were involved in " a two - way dialogue . "
The CDC says the outbreak , which is linked to a rare form of bacteria called Salmonella Saintpaul , has spread to include 810 cases in 36 states and the District of Columbia .
And there is no sign that it 's abating .
" We are still getting reports of recent illnesses , " Griffin said .
Watch a report on the outbreak »
The true incidence is probably much higher , because the agency has estimated that about 30 cases occur for every one that is reported .
Griffin said the most recent report of someone becoming ill with the type of salmonella linked to the outbreak came June 15 .
This weekend , teams of investigators will focus on fields , warehouses and distribution centers in Mexico and Florida as possible sources of the outbreak .
Investigators have collected about 1,700 tomato samples , " and so far , all of these have been negative , " Acheson said .
He said the investigators ' ability to find the source of the bacterium has been complicated by the practice among processors of repacking as many as 90 percent of tomatoes .
It is not unusual for domestic and imported tomatoes to be packed in the same box , he said .
" This outbreak is not over , " he said .
" We are still putting all resources into it that we have . "
But Acheson reiterated comments he made last week , that investigators may never find the source of the outbreak .
Griffin said it was not clear whether the outbreak is tailing off , because the average time between when a person becomes ill with the salmonella and when it is reported is 16 days .
" It 's very difficult to say much about illnesses in June , " she said .
" Any illness that is occurring now would not be reported until several weeks from now . "
Acheson added , " just because this outbreak is ongoing does n't mean it 's not tomatoes . "
The bacteria can cause diarrhea , fever , abdominal pain , headache , nausea and dehydration .
Infection is sometimes fatal .

When use of the phrase “ linkbait ” first started to achieve critical mass , some dismissed it as nothing more than a fad that would be dead in a year .
Some truly understood linkbait and tried to explain it while some of those who grasped it ran with it and went on to profit from it ( and still do ) .
Below , what linkbait really is and where its value lies .
What Linkbait Is
“ Linkbait ” is n’t some internet fad or “ new ” way to “ game the Google algorithm ” .
It is simply the name for the online version of what has been going on offline for years .
If magazines perfected the linkbait title , then politicians perfected linkbait promotion .
In fact , politicians are guiltier of “ linkbait ” than even the most talented social media exploiters .
Let me to show you what I mean :
Politicians Linkbaiters
They brainstorm for a big event they can hold to gain attention from the press and the masses showcasing themselves as a good candidate .
They brainstorm for a big content piece they can write to gain attention from the press and the masses showcasing themselves as a good website .
During the event , they shake hands with individuals and appear to take notice and recognize each individual ’s unique story .
While writing the content piece , they link out to other articles and appear to take notice and recognize each article ’s unique story .
They invite the media to the event , put out press releases , encourage their supporters to publicize and endorse the event , make special outreaches to groups and demographics they feel will endorse their candidacy and call in favors from celebrities and / or other public figures to help promote their event .
They contact the media via email , put out online press releases , encourage their twitter followers to vote for and re-tweet their story , make special outreaches to websites with demographics that they feel may want to link to their story and call in favors from Digg power users and StumbleUpon gurus to help promote their content piece .
They hope that all the effort they ’ve put in and favors they ’ve called in result in a favorable showing in the press which earns them media coverage , new supporters and eventual donations to support their campaign .
They hope that all the effort they ’ve put in and all favors they ’ve called in result in a favorable showing in the blogosphere which earns them media coverage , new subscribers and eventual revenue to support their website .
Why Create Linkbait
You ’ll find some who will say that any linkbait engineered to be linkbait is a bad thing .
And to them , I say you ’re wrong .
Linkbait done correctly often takes over a week to research , write and format and receives a ton of traditional online marketing along with the social media plays .
The point of linkbait is not to gain some backlinks from Digg , Mixx , Reddit or any other social media site .
Whether or not Sphinn , Propeller or StumbleUpon nofollows their links has absolutely zero bearing on our desire to reach their homepages .
Linkbait is all about visibility .
Visibility to the masses via social media ( and a hope that they will write about our content on their blog as individuals ) and visibility to a targeted niche by writing a piece that promotes many of the medium and higher trafficked sites within it and then letting them know about it and hoping they promote you back .
You often hear a lot about “ gaming Digg ” [ Digg is the example here , but insert the name of any social media website ] and the opinion some have about the atrocity of asking friends for votes … but the reality is , it does n’t matter how a story gets to the homepage .
Whether the votes were all natural or done by the same person utilizing 100 Digg accounts in a way that avoids throwing a red flag up to the Digg algorithm or mods ( and no , I ’m not recommending that ) – if the story does n’t belong on the homepage , you better believe that the community will bury it within a matter of minutes .
Social media is only one part of the linkbait promotional pie .
If you think linkbait is all about hitting the Digg homepage and profiting from those who click through when they click on your ads that day , then you do n’t get it .
As a matter of fact , one of the most successful pieces of engineered linkbait I personally have even done was buried on Digg and did poorly on almost all of the social media websites .
But it gained 900 links , is the most trafficked page on our website and even though it ranks number one for the commercial term the linkbait was about , the page still gets more direct traffic through links than it does search engine referrals month after month after month .
Now that ’s what I call linkbait .
What Linkbait Is n’t
The big story this week has been the possibility of Google penalizing “ fake Linkbait ” .
But , a fake story on a reputable website , to me , is n’t “ linkbait ” .
It ’s a fake story on a reputable website that pulled a con on the media .
Money .co.uk will pay for it in their own way as those who were duped in the ruse are likely to hold that grudge , and withhold future publicity over it , for a long time .
The niche media in our own industry may want to think twice about calling a con “ linkbait ” .
There is enough ignorance in the mainstream media on the topic without further adding to the confusion .

It is currently believed that many , if not all , galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers .
In general , matter and light that come near enough to a black hole will never make it back .
Some supermassive black holes , however , have jets of super high - velocity matter streaming out from the center of the black hole 's accretion disk .
The behavior of these relativistic jets has long been a mystery in the astrophysics world .
CREDIT : Marscher et al. , Wolfgang Steffen ,
Cosmovision , NRAO / AUI / NSF
Theories that attempt to explain the relativistic jets suggest that the magnetic field in the vicinity of the black hole is incredibly twisted by the dynamics of the black hole 's warping of space itself .
It is believed that a fraction of the matter captured in the black hole 's accretion disc is accelerated to near light speeds by these tightly wound magnetic fields , forming a spiral of particles that is ejected from the area of the black hole .
Until recently , no observations were able to confirm this explanation for the relativistic jets .
A paper published in the April 24th edition of Nature describes how researchers from around the world , led by Boston University researcher Alan Marscher , used the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 's Very Long Baseline Array to directly look into the region of a relativistic jet that 's closest to the accretion disk .
" We have gotten the clearest look yet at the innermost portion of the jet , where the particles actually are accelerated , and everything we see supports the idea that twisted , coiled magnetic fields are propelling the material outward , " said Marscher .
The observations come from a blazar galaxy , BL Lacertae ( BL Lac ) , about 950 million light years from Earth .
In addition to seeing the coiled structure , the team was able to see flares that were predicted to occur when the ejected material hit a stationary shock wave some time after it left the immediate vicinity of the black hole .
Further support for the current theory came when bursts of light , X - rays and gamma rays appeared right when theory predicted .
According to Marscher , " we got an unprecedented view of the inner portion of one of these jets and gained information that 's very important to understanding how these tremendous particle accelerators work . "

The new prime minister says the fight against terrorism is his top priority
There is a buzz of excitement in the wood - panelled assembly hall of Pakistan 's parliament .
After eight years of military rule , the new legislators feel empowered by an enormous popular mandate .
And they are ready to tackle unpopular policies , especially Pakistan 's participation in what is called the War on Terror .
" We 've gone through enough problems because of following different agendas of different countries - we need to follow our own agenda , " said one parliamentarian from the governing coalition , speaking to a crush of reporters outside .
" Pakistan must get out of America 's fatal embrace , " said another .
Out of the loop Comments like these alarm the Americans , because Pakistan is crucial to their Afghan policy .
Since 9/11 they have relied on President Pervez Musharraf and the army for cooperation against al - Qaeda and the Taleban , in exchange for billions of dollars .
Until now parliament was out of the loop .
" No one in this country knows what General Musharraf has agreed with the Americans or anyone else ! " says Ahsan Iqbal , a minister in the new cabinet .
The president apparently agreed to an increase in US air strikes in the Taleban strongholds near the Afghan border .
Militants killed almost a thousand people in suicide attacks last year
These have killed around 50 people this year , including militants .
Like everyone else , Mr Iqbal read about the tacit understanding in the newspaper .
Such heavy handed tactics " give a cause for these militants to fight for " , he says , " so therefore I think whatever strategy we work out , the sovereignty of Pakistan must be respected and we should not give more fuel to these militants " .
Security Pakistanis believe a deadly bombing campaign in the country is the price they are paying for missile strikes and large scale army operations against the militants .
Nearly a thousand people were killed in suicide attacks last year .
And massive injections of American aid have made little difference to their security .
" The general perception in Pakistan is that the deal over the War on Terror was favourable only to one party and unfavourable to Pakistan , " says Aseff Ahmad Ali , a member of the governing Pakistan Peoples ' Party and a former foreign minister .
If the armed force is withdrawn , there may be a resurgence
Retired General Shujaat Ali Khan " The Americans give us a billion dollars a year for the War on Terror .
But where has the money gone ?
We do n't know , maybe to the army .
" But we do know there 's been no trickle - down effect - there is neither internal ( security ) nor food security nor development .
" To the common man the US - Pakistan deal looks absolutely awful .
It has to be renegotiated . "
Negotiation
In a speech outlining the government 's policies , Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gillani emphasized social and political reforms to address the causes of militancy .
Pakistan 's military may be wary of peace deals with militants
He also said the government would negotiate with those who laid down their arms .
Some of his coalition partners go further , like the Pashtun Awami National Party ( ANP ) , which has gained power in the North West Frontier Province near the Afghan border .
" This problem is not going to be solved by my going to talk to the tribal elders only , " the provincial chief minister , Amir Haider Khan Hoti , told the Dawn newspaper .
" Unless we somehow approach the one who has taken up arms , or is involved in suicide bombing or has gone to the other extreme , and reach an understanding with him , the problem would not be solved . "
' Clear and present danger '
This is a long term solution , but does America have the patience to wait ?
The head of its Central Intelligence Agency is sounding very impatient .
" The situation on the Afghanistan - Pakistan border presents a clear and present danger to ... the West in general and the United States in particular , " Michael Hayden said during a recent interview on NBC television .
" It 's very clear to us that al - Qaeda has been able for the past 18 months or so to establish a safe haven along the border area that they have not enjoyed before .
" Operationally , we are turning every effort to capture or kill that leadership from the top to the bottom . "
Tanvir Ahmed Khan , a former Pakistani ambassador to Afghanistan argues that " the Americans have leverage ( in Pakistan ) , but not the same degree as before " .
" There would be a restive parliament .
There is no strong opinion in parliament for reversing the policy , but there is a strong opinion for moderating it , for a better mix between military and diplomatic measures . "
Military wary But will Pakistan 's powerful army agree ?
President Musharraf 's attempts at peace deals only strengthened the militants and put the military on the back - foot , says retired General Shujaat Ali Khan .
The military would be wary of going down the same path again .
" There may be an ( initial ) agreement on the part of the militants , to sort of pull back their punches " , he says , " but during this two or three month period there is a danger that they may regroup .
" And if the armed force is withdrawn , there may be a resurgence , and they 'll strike again . "
Many here also believe that peace inside Pakistan will be difficult , as long as American and Nato troops remain in Afghanistan .
On Sunday the Pakistan Taleban Movement ( Tehreek - e - Taliban Pakistan ) responded to the government 's overtures .
It said it was ready to end attacks inside Pakistan if the authorities showed flexibility , but the ' jihad ' against America would continue in Afghanistan .
" Our war is with America " , local Taleban leader Maulvi Faqir Muhammed told a rally .
" Whenever Pakistan will work for American interests as its ally , we will oppose it . "

GOOSING THE ECONOMY …. Larry Bartels says that Democratic presidents produce higher economic growth than Republican presidents , and that the differences in average growth rates for middle - class and poor families ( but not affluent families , apparently , who do well under both parties ) are statistically significant by conventional social - scientific standards .
Charts here .
So what ’s going on ?
Paul Krugman says he ’s uncertain about Bartels ’s results because he can’t figure out a “ plausible mechanism ” for them — a common reaction among economists , who generally do n’t believe that presidents influence the economy enough to produce the kinds of differences Bartels documents .
Bartels himself is n’t sure what causes the effect either , but takes a crack at an explanation here :
One of my aims in writing Unequal Democracy was to prod economists and policy analysts to devote more attention to precisely that question .
Douglas Hibbs did important work along these lines in the 1980s , documenting significant partisan differences in post - war macroeconomic policies .
He found that Democrats favored expansionary policies producing substantially higher employment and growth rates , while Republicans endured and sometimes prolonged recessions in order to keep inflation in check .
( Not coincidentally , unemployment mostly affects income growth among relatively poor people , while inflation mostly affects income growth among relatively affluent people . )
In recent decades taxes and transfers have probably been more important .
Social spending .
Business regulation or lack thereof .
And do n’t forget the minimum wage .
Over the past 60 years , the real value of the minimum wage has increased by 16 cents per year under Democratic presidents and declined by 6 cents per year under Republican presidents ; that ’s a 3 % difference in average income growth for minimum wage workers , with ramifications for many more workers higher up the wage scale .
So , while I do n’t pretend to understand all the ways in which presidents ’ policy choices shape the income distribution , I see little reason to doubt that the effects are real and substantial .
Tyler Cowen , noting that the biggest changes in inequality come in the second year of a president ’s term , suggests that anti-inflationary zeal is the causal mechanism :
Republicans are more willing to break the back of inflation and risk an immediate recession .
Alternatively , it could be said that central bankers expect enough support for tough , anti-inflation decisions only from Republican Presidents … .
Other plausible channels for income inequality effects , such as tax and regulatory decisions , would not be concentrated in the second year of each administration .
….
Inflation is good for the poor in the short run , since many poor are debtors .
But inflation is bad for the poor in the long run .
Just ask anyone who lived through the New Zealand inflation of the 1970s .
So Bartels could have entitled his key graph : “ Democratic Presidents live for the short run and we need a Republican President every now and then . ”
It ’s worth noting that there ’s a fair amount of agreement between these two views .
The low - inflation environment of the past decade or two may have broken the link , but before that Democrats were certainly more oriented toward wage growth than Republicans , who were generally more obsessed with keeping a check on budget deficits and inflation .
But policy almost certainly matters too , and I ’m not sure Tyler is right about this being inconsistent with the observation that growth differences are highest in the second year of an administration .
Presidents tend to be at the peak of their power in their first year , and that ’s when they ’re most able to pass major economic reforms : think of Bush and Reagan ’s tax cuts , Clinton ’s economic plan , and LBJ ’s Great Society .
It ’s not implausible that , on average , the biggest changes come in the first year of a new administration and show their biggest effect in the second year .
In any case , the evidence that Democratic administrations provide higher growth is surprisingly robust .
And it ’s not just growth : Democratic presidents also provide lower inflation , lower unemployment , higher stock market growth , and lower inequality — and they do so regardless of whether you build a lag time into the analysis to account for the time it takes for economic policies to have an effect .
It ’s true that , by all accounts , nobody believes presidents have enough impact on the economy to be responsible for this , but there are now enough postwar data points to make coincidence an unlikely explanation .
Something seems to be going on .
It ’s well worth some serious investigation .

Unfortunately for the Winnipeg Jets , many seem to think that this contract is a precursor to Jacob Trouba bolting town at the earliest opportunity .
( LifeWire ) --
When Susan Harris divorced her husband of five and a half years last December , she got the apartment , extra closet space and the covers all to herself .
Her ex ?
He got $ 37,440 .
That money is being doled out in 48 monthly alimony payments .
Or , as it's called in some circles , " manimony . "
Over the course of the couple 's marriage , Harris , 31 , who makes more than $ 100,000 working in ad sales in Alameda , California , brought in more than two - thirds of the household income , while her ex-husband ( who declined to comment for this article ) worked toward becoming a credentialed teacher .
The couple had no children or joint property other than a rental apartment .
When things started getting rocky in the relationship around year two , Harris was loath to end things , partially because she was concerned that she'd be obligated to continue supporting him financially , even though he was employed .
Her concerns were well founded .
Legally - under state laws - both women and men are entitled to alimony if there 's a large discrepancy in spousal income .
However , that does n't mean men seek alimony .
" Thirty - three percent of higher - earning spouses are women , but fewer than four percent of alimony payers are women , " says Ned Holstein , president of Fathers & Families , a family - court reform organization in Boston , citing U.S. Census Bureau data .
Finances of marriage
For most of the history of marriage , money changed hands before the ceremony , often in the form of dowries .
But as divorce started to become more common in the 1900s , so did post - separation monetary agreements .
" Traditionally , marriage was a financial arrangement .
Joining hands in marriage meant joining bank accounts , and bank accounts were largely in the hands of men , " says Roderick Phillips , a professor of history at Carleton University in Ottawa , and author of " Untying the Knot : A Short History of Divorce . "
" The trend in the 20th century has been to allow women to recover what they had before the marriage and to compensate them for anything they sacrificed during the marriage , " says Phillips .
The Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act of 1970 gave men as well as women the right to ask for alimony .
Up until the 1980s , however , there were only a handful of cases in the U.S. in which a woman was ordered to give money to her spouse in a divorce case .
However , " in recent years there 's been a greater movement towards gender equality , " says Phillips .
' I 'm a man !
I can take care of myself '
Some husbands have settled for increased custody instead of going to the mat for money , says Holstein .
" I hear a lot of men say , ' She earns way more than I do , but I was n't going to ask for alimony because I get the kids 40 percent of the time and I do n't want to rock the boat . '
Then there are a lot of men who are just ashamed to ask for it . "
Nancy Chemtob , a divorce attorney and a founding partner of Chemtob Moss Forman & Talbert , a New York City law firm that focuses on divorce , family and matrimonial law , agrees .
" Men do n't brag about it , and women are n't proud of it . "
" I think men are chided for not making money and women are not .
It 's not even brought up if a woman in court says she is not working .
Where if it is a man , it 's brought up , says Chemtob .
" The law is equal , but ... the mentality is n't . "
Mark Berlin , 45 , an office manager at Office Depot in Chicago , was awarded $ 250 a month in alimony on top of $ 925 a month in child support when he divorced the mother of his two sons in 2005 .
" I did n't really even want the alimony , but she made more than me and [ the court ] said that 's what she had to pay , " says Berlin .
He puts the payments , which will continue through 2010 , into college savings for his kids .
" I do think that there should n't be discrimination against one sex or the other , says Berlin .
" Still , when I first realized she was going to be paying me , I felt very embarrassed .
I felt like , ' I 'm a man !
I can take care of myself ! ' "
Changing times , changing attitudes
Not all women resent paying money to their exes -- and not all men feel uncomfortable being on the receiving end .
As the number of alimony cases increases , attitudes are gradually beginning to change .
Jeffrey Leving , an Illinois divorce lawyer and author of the book " Fathers ' Rights " attributes a rising trend in women paying spousal support in part to an increased number of fathers serving as primary caregivers .
" I also think that there are more men wanting to function as the sole parent and raise children than ever before , " says Leving .
" It 's becoming more socially acceptable for men to be primary parents . "
Chemtob says close to one - tenth of her clients are women who pay alimony to their exes .
" When I first started 14 years ago , that number was zero , " she says .
For the last two years Alexis Martin Neely , a family lawyer and author of the financial planning guide " Wear Clean Underwear , " has paid her ex-husband between $ 1,300 and $ 2,000 a month in alimony -- in addition to child support .
During their six - year marriage , he was a stay - at - home dad .
Currently he is unemployed and has custody of the children half the time .
" I 'm grateful to be able to support him being able to spend time with the kids , " says Neely , who is 34 and lives with her two children in Hermosa Beach , California .
" It 's just money -- I can always make money .
But I see people embroiled in conflict for years of their life , and that 's something you can't ever get back . "

NEW YORK — I had the filet mignon .
The great game designer had the tuna .
On Friday , I was one of 10 people seated at a broad wooden table having a two - hour lunch with game designer Sid Meier and his wife , Susan .
Meier is the creator of one of the most popular gaming series of all time , " Civilization , " though he has also picked up fans for his " Pirates ! " and " Railroad Tycoon " games , among more than a dozen others .
We were at the Algonquin Hotel , in a small red room called the Library that was lined both with real bookshelves and bookshelf - style wallpaper .
The intention was to emulate the high - minded literary chats held on the premises by writer Dorothy Parker about 80 years ago — except with a game maker and a bunch of gaming journalists .
Apparently genuine literary figures were not available .
The setup made this the first gaming event I can recall during which a publicist said , essentially , yes , the developer here has a new game coming out , but we do n't really think you need to talk about it .
So while Meier talked about opening games up to wider audiences and ate his meal , some of us followed orders and did n't ask him about " Civilization : Revolutions , " coming out June 3 for Xbox 360 , PS3 and DS .
I asked him about Bach , " Spore " and what game journalists were like 20 years ago .
Before the tuna had arrived and before the salad , too , Meier had mentioned that he liked classical music .
His favorite is Johann Sebastian Bach , the first musical reference I 'd heard from a game designer since three weeks earlier , when Cliff Bleszinski , lead designer of " Gears of War , " told me about attending a Killswitch Engage concert .
What did being a student of Bach offer him as a game designer ?
Meier said he was moved by the idea that Bach came from common roots , that his ordinary origins showed what a regular person who hones his craft can accomplish .
And he was impressed with the kind of creator whose work can be popular centuries after it 's made .
No one else wanted to talk about Bach .
I did n't even know the proper Bach - related follow - up .
There were reporters from Maxim , Popular Mechanics , AOL and other outlets around the table .
( Sid only said , " Oh , cool ! " when it was mentioned there was someone there from MTV News ) .
Someone asked him what the most important innovations in gaming history were .
Meier should know , since he'd been making games for about two decades .
I think the question came from a public - relations guy who was otherwise asking questions that somehow kept involving mentions of " Civilization : Revolutions . "
This one question , though , elicited a good response .
Meier stopped to think of three innovations more important than anything else in gaming history .
The first he mentioned was IBM making a personal computer .
Another was the development of " Sim City " and other games that encouraged construction , rather than just destruction .
The third , Meier said , was Nintendo 's Official Seal of Quality , a 1980s stamp of gaming quality that he said helped counter the flow of bad games that had drowned so many previous video game consoles .
Nintendo came up a lot at lunch , mostly in reference to the Wii .
Meier has n't worked on a Wii game , but he is clearly inspired by the system 's broad reach .
For a time , he was quiet at lunch , as the reporter from Maxim expressed frustration that the Wii's simple games — " Wii Sports " bowling , for instance — were distracting people from the cultural depth of the philosophical Xbox 360 first - person shooter " BioShock . "
I argued back , saying that any game could have depth or encourage a deep thought .
Sid Meier was n't having any of it .
He kept quiet during this argument .
We learned things about the Meiers .
Their condo has lots of games in it .
Susan does n't play games .
Sid does .
He likes " Guitar Hero " but has n't really been obsessed with a game since " Gran Turismo 3 . "
We talked about the wife - o- meter Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto introduced at the Game Developers Conference last year , an informal measure of Miyamoto 's long - standing struggle to get his wife interested in any games he makes .
Susan Meier revealed that the wife - o- meter still was n't registering for her .
She works at Firaxis , running the human - resources department , but she does n't play the things — mostly .
She did play one of Sid's before it was released and cheerfully mentioned finding a bug in it .
Sid smiled sheepishly , laughed and turned red .
Sid and I talked about games crossing over to the mainstream and arrived at a very non-Wii idea .
I proposed that " Civilization " had spread to the masses without adopting simplified Wii -style controls and asked why that would be .
He said he thought that the subject matter at the game 's beginning — getting food and shelter — were things people could relate to .
He said even a " Guitar Hero " or a " Grand Theft Auto " has some connection to the real world but with an added layer of fantasy that makes them worth experiencing .
I had n't thought much about realism before , nor had I considered one of Meier 's casually tossed - off ideas , which seemed plenty profound .
Early during the lunch , he was talking about multiplayer gaming , though I can't recall why .
He seemed disappointed with where multiplayer game design is .
Most of the big multiplayer games and game modes out there are simply single - player modes with added people , he observed .
He hoped for progress .
In a room full of journalists , he was n't going to get it .
But hopefully Meier occasionally lunches with other top developers , because that kind of group could get somewhere .
I was curious how gaming journalists have changed over the years .
Aside from joking that they have gotten smarter and better - looking , Meier said they have understandably gotten more engaged with the medium .
He said that early in his career , he encountered people who were threatened by games , not because such people represented the mainstream or concerned parents , but because such people , gaming reporters among them , were fans of military board games .
They were part of a subculture that celebrated the complexity of wars waged on game boards divided by hexagons and populated with miniatures .
They thought video games were a threat , that they 'd overwhelm their hobby .
And they did .
To get a measure of how much journalism about games has changed , I asked Meier how long it was before he was interviewed by a woman .
He laughed and said it was awhile and that it took at least until one of his colleagues became one .
Became a woman , he meant ?
I thought that , but did n't ask , as the inside joke reverberated from Sid to his wife to another member of the Firaxis team .
We moved on .
Somehow we got to talking about Tasers .
This brought us far afield of Dorothy Parker material , I 'm sure .
But among the 11 of us , we concocted some basic ideas for a Taser Wii game .
Sid had a good chuckle out of it .
The lunch wound down .
One reporter stayed to chat with Sid .
The rest of us got our coats ; some waited for car service .
I thanked Sid and Susan for the meal and the conversation .
Let 's do it again , I should have said .
I do n't know if we made Dorothy Parker proud .
Were we supposed to have a big argument ?
To solve a major problem ?
I left with ideas I had n't brought to the lunch .
I call it a success .
It felt ... civilized .

Compton Gamma Ray Observatory equipment helps to sniff out radioactive sources .
Remnants of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory ( pictured ) , are being used in other fields .
NASA
The 9 - year mission of NASA ’s Compton Gamma Ray Observatory ended in 2000 with a plunge into the Pacific Ocean .
But its spare parts are living on — as a detector of dirty bombs .
James Ryan , an astrophysicist at the University of New Hampshire in Durham , has recycled parts from one of the space telescope ’s old instruments , realizing that they can work just as well pointing horizontally as they did vertically up into the heavens .
The telescope once spotted gamma rays streaming from radioactive elements in the sky .
Now its technology is being used to detect gamma rays emitted by radioactive substances , such as plutonium , uranium and caesium , which could be used in dirty bombs combining conventional explosives with radioactive material .
“ If we can detect aluminum 26 on the other side of the galaxy , we can detect this stuff on the other side of the street , ” says Ryan , who will present results from a prototype detector on Monday in Boston at a conference sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the US Department of Homeland Security .
Getting warmer
There are many techniques for spotting radioactive materials .
Some sensors pick up neutrons spat out by radioactive atoms .
This technique is very sensitive — neutrons cannot be shielded by lead or concrete walls — but somewhat non-discriminatory .
Gamma rays , although they can be shielded , are emitted with specific energies depending on their parent nuclei , thus providing a potential fingerprint of the radioactive material ( although it can still be difficult to tell one thing from another , including , bizarrely , cat litter and uranium ; see ' The quest for a finer gamma ray detector ' ) .
Many commercial gamma-ray detectors , however , ca n’t detect the direction of a source .
Directionality is particularly useful , for example , if scanning rows of shipping containers rather than single trucks at border crossings , or when tracking a dirty bomb .
Ryan recalls watching a US National Guard field exercise in Cape Cod , Massachusetts , as the soldiers struggled to track down a radioactive source in a building , as if they were playing a game of Hot and Cold .
“ I said , ‘ Good grief , that ’s a piece of cake .
I can spot that a block away ’ , ” Ryan says .
He went back to his lab and dusted off the spare instruments from the Compton Observatory that he had kept since its launch .
Pinpointing the source
The Compton device detects light emitted by electron scattering , caused by gamma rays hitting two layers in the instrument .
These two detections allow a user to track the direction of the incoming rays .
Ryan says that , from a distance of 10 metres , he can pinpoint a source like caesium to within a third of a metre from side - to - side .
“ It ’ll work , but it ’s not optimal , given the fact it ’s so dated , ” says Nick Mascarenhas , a physicist at Sandia National Laboratory in Livermore , California , who is building his own directional radiation detector .
“ It ’s probably going to have limitations . ”
Even if the nearly 20 - year - old Compton telescope technology is n’t the best available kit to turn into a commercial bomb - sniffing tool , homeland security is certainly benefiting by learning from , or borrowing , astrophysical tools that can ' image ' the location of radioactive sources , rather than just detecting their presence .
“ We ’re showing that imaging has very powerful advantages , ” says Mascarenhas .
Trickle down
Mascarenhas is building a neutron detector that also relies on an astrophysical device — a detector that was first flown in high - altitude balloons to look for neutrons coming from the Sun .
It also has directional capabilities , which makes it easier to filter out background radiation - whether from trace uranium and thorium in rock in the ground , or background radiation in the sky .
The signal of interest can thus be isolated in a shorter amount of time , he says .
ADVERTISEMENT
Steve Ahlen , an astrophysicist a Boston University in Massachusetts , says that it is natural that approaches in high - energy physics and astrophysics trickle down into security applications .
Ahlen himself is working on a 30 - centimetre cube full of carbon tetrafluoride gas , originally designed to seek elusive dark - matter particles .
He realized that by adding helium , his cube could also hunt for neutrons .
Now he ’s getting funding from the Department of Homeland Security , for a device with two applications : “ I really believe it ’s the world ’s best neutron detector , ” he says .

When a Newsweek poll showed last week that Barack Obama had a fifteen - point lead over John McCain , it was widely dismissed as an outlier .
But a new Bloomberg / Los Angeles Times poll released last night showed another big lead for Obama : twelve points in a two - way race and fifteen points with independent candidates Ralph Nader and Bob Barr included .
One poll , that ’s nothing , do n’t waste our time with that garbage .
But two polls — that ’s a horse of a completely different color .
And that color , if it were in a box of creatively named Crayola crayons , let ’s say , would be called “ Ascendant Obama . ”
Not only is he looking dominant in the polls , but he ’s hoping to use his bazillions of dollars to expand the electoral map thisNovember .
• John B. Judis says that while national polls this early should be taken with a grain of salt , one question “ jumps off the page ” :
When asked which candidate “ cares more about people like you , ” Obama walloped McCain , 50 to 23 , which “ says a lot to me about John McCain ’s difficulties as a presidential candidate and does say something about Obama ’s prospects in the fall . ” [ Stump / New Republic ]
• Ben Smith writes that Obama thinks he can broaden the electoral map and will “ focus his resources largely in 14 states George W. Bush won in 2004 , ” hoping to overturn states like Virginia , Indiana , and Georgia .
[ Politico ]
• Mike Dorning writes that if Obama can motivate about 10 percent more young and African - American voters to turn out on election day , he could make major gains in nine states Bush won in 2004 , and even win Iowa and New Mexico .
[ Swamp / Tribune ]
• Brian Montopoli says that it ’s tempting for Democrats to believe that Obama has already wrapped up the race , but it may not be that simple .
Michael Dukakis was up by ten points over George H.W. Bush in May 1988 , and while Obama “ is a far more charismatic campaigner ” than Dukakis , “ McCain ’s chances may be better than these early national polls suggest . ”
Still , “ it may be extremely difficult ” for McCain to close the gap if Obama does n’t make any “ serious mistakes . ”
[ Horserace / CBS News ]
• Rick Klein and friends think one more poll like this one will result in “ real panic in the GOP . ” [ Note / ABC News ]
• Alex Koppelman writes that “ it might be time to take these numbers seriously . ”
But he also notes that both the Los Angeles Times poll and the Newsweek poll surveyed a high proportion of Democrats , and that an accurate sample composition ( meaning , “ how many Democrats to include , how many Republicans and how many independents ” ) may be hard to figure out this year , as a “ lot more Americans are identifying as Democrats than in previous years . ” [ War Room / Salon ]
• David Weigel is n’t surprised that Nader and Barr take votes away from McCain : Voters want a Democrat for president , but if they find Obama too “ weird and treasonous - seeming , ” they ’ll still not vote for McCain because he ’s failed to “ differentiate himself from the GOP brand . ”
[ Hit & Run / Reason ]
• John Podhoretz warns his readers not to kid themselves ; “ the lead is real . ” [ Contentions / Commentary ]
• Eric Kleefeld points out that for all the talk about Obama ’s problems with white voters , he ’s actually tied with McCain in white support .
In fact , “ [ i ] n the unlikely event that every last white undecided were to break for McCain , Obama would be almost where John Kerry was in 2004 exit polling . ”
[ TPM Election Central ]
• Heidi Przybyla mentions some areas where Obama could use improvement :
He is losing to McCain among independents , he ’s with the minority on offshore drilling , and many votes say that he ’s “ too naïve and inexperienced for the job of president . ” [ Bloomberg ] — Dan Amira

LONDON — Every year , Sweden publishes everyone 's income tax returns .
So do Finland and Norway .
And nobody really cares .
By contrast , U.S. law prohibits releasing anybody 's tax information .
Imagine the howl if the IRS put tax returns online , so co-workers , neighbors and mothers - in - law could see what someone earns .
That happened in Italy earlier this year , when the outgoing government of prime minister Romano Prodi briefly posted taxpayers ' incomes on the Internet , and newspapers picked up the list .
Magnus Graner , state secretary for Sweden 's Justice Ministry , says people 's tax returns are available for viewing in a series of " tax calendars , " or books , each year .
" If it 's what you want to do , you can see what your brother - in - law made , your neighbor made , " Graner says .
" Not everybody does it , although we joke about it and say , ' Have you checked on your future in - laws ? '
No one in my family has done it — I do n't think . "
Two weeks ago , Sweden published the tax returns of ordinary wage - earners .
In November or December , Swedes can see how much high - rollers made — with their income from dividends and other investments — plus how much they paid in taxes for 2007 .
Sweden 's policy of making tax returns public — as in Finland and Norway — stems from a tradition of open records and transparency in government , except in cases of national security and some aspects of criminal investigations .
" The right of public access to documents is laid down in the constitution , " Graner says of Sweden 's practice since the 18th century .
Making the data public demonstrates the Scandinavian tradition of jantelag , which translates roughly as nobody is better than anyone else , says Veera Heinonen , spokeswoman for the Finish Embassy in London .
" Finland is a very egalitarian country , and it's a very high - tax society , so it provides checks and balances , " Heinonen says .
She says people 's earnings can be a good source of gossip .
Is anybody embarrassed ?
" Well , maybe some chief executives , " she says .
Ida Ragnarsson , 22 , of Helsingborg , Sweden , says she does n't mind if anyone sees what she earns .
Ragnarsson , who coaches sales people , says she has checked up on her family .
" It 's fun to know how much they earn , " she says .
Italians did n't think so in April when Vincenzo Visco , a deputy economy minister who spearheaded Italy 's fight against tax evasion , posted 2005 tax returns on the agency 's website .
The gesture , Visco told Italian news organizations , was to encourage greater " transparency and democracy . "
The information was quickly removed from the website , but it was available long enough for newspapers to grab and publish figures about the rich .
Among the incomes posted : Silvio Berlusconi , the conservative media mogul who replaced Prodi as prime minister .
His 2005 earnings : $ 43.5 million , on which he paid $ 18.6 million in taxes .
Philip Lindquist , 19 , a student in Stockholm , says he does n't understand the fuss in Italy .
" The model on which Sweden is built demands this " public information , he says .
Norway had parliamentary hearings several years ago on whether to continue making the information public , but nothing came of it , says Marietta Christophersen in Norway 's embassy in London .
It 's very popular , she says .
Norwegians can go on newspaper websites , she says , and " search for celebrities ' tax details or those of your neighbor or in - laws . "
Americans would likely be outraged , says Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington .
That wo n't happen , says Internal Revenue Service spokesman Rob Marvin .
" Federal law prohibits the release of that private information . "

Roadrunner uses the powerful " cell " chip designed for the PS3 A supercomputer built with components designed for the Sony PlayStation 3 has set a new computing milestone .
The IBM machine , codenamed Roadrunner , has been shown to run at " petaflop speeds " , the equivalent of one thousand trillion calculations per second .
The benchmark means the computer is twice as nimble as the current world 's fastest machine , also built by IBM .
It will be installed at a US government laboratory later this year where it will monitor the US nuclear stockpile .
It will also be used for research into astronomy , genomics and climate change .
" We are getting closer to simulating the real world , " Bijan Davari , vice president of next generation computing systems at IBM , told BBC News .
It would be of particular use for calculating risk in financial markets , he said .
" The latency of the calculations is so small that for all practical purposes it is real time . "
Chip stacks
The current fastest supercomputer is IBM's Blue Gene / L , at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California .
It is used in the US Department of Energy 's Stockpile Stewardship Program , which oversees the country 's nuclear weapons .
TOP FIVE SUPERCOMPUTERS Blue Gene/L , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , California . ( 478.2 teraflops ; 212 , 992 processors ) Blue Gene / P , Forschungszentrum Juelich , Germany .
( 167.3 teraflops ; 65536 processors ) SGI Altix ICE 8200 , SGI / New Mexico Computing Applications Center , Wisconsin , US .
( 126.9 teraflops ; 14336 processors ) EKA - Cluster Platform 3000 BL460c , Computational Research Laboratories , Pune , India .
( 117.9 teraflops ; 14240 processors ) Cluster Platform 3000 BL460 c , government agency , Sweden . ( 102.8 teraflops ; 13728 processors ) Source : Top 500 Supercomputers
It was recently upgraded and now runs at a speed of 478.2 teraflops ( trillions of calculations per second ) , using 212,992 processors .
By comparison , Roadrunner will use fewer than 20,000 chips .
This is because the new computer is a so - called " hybrid " design , using both conventional supercomputer processors and the powerful " cell " chip designed for the PS3 .
The eight - core chip runs at speeds greater than 4 GHz and was designed by a consortium of companies including IBM , Sony and Toshiba .
It has been modified for Roadrunner to allow it to handle a greater bandwidth of data and to carry out more specialist calculations .
Roadrunner packs more than 12,000 of the processors - known as " accelerators " - on top of nearly 7,000 standard processors .
The standard processors are used to handle the general computation needed to keep the machine running , whilst the cells are left to crunch vast swathes of unstructured data .
" For these kinds of simulations of very complex natural phenomena the cell chip is extremely powerful , " said Dr Davari .
" It is a lot more effective than combing many , many , many more smaller , general purpose computational engines . "
The machine was the first to pass through the petaflop barrier , said Dr Davari .
Currently , BlueGene / L is the most powerful computer in the world " The exciting part for me as a technical person is that we can now see the recipe for high performance computing for the next 10 to 15 years , " he said .
It will now be disassembled and moved to New Mexico where it will be housed in 288 refrigerator - sized cases connected by 57 miles ( 92 km ) of fibre optic cable .
Although Roadrunner will run at extraordinary speeds , other computers could soon challenge its record .
IBM currently has another petaflop machine in the pipeline based on its Blue Gene / P technology .
When finished , it will be the world 's fastest commercial supercomputer .
" Blue Gene / P continues the path of Blue / Gene L , " said Dr Davari .
The machines share much of the same software and hardware .
Blue Gene / P will be installed at the Department of Energy 's ( DOE ) Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois later this year .
Both Sun and Cray supercomputers have also unveiled plans for petaflop machines in the near future .

Baghdad , Jun. 10 , ( VOI ) � David Satterfield , U.S. State Department 's Coordinator for Iraq , on Tuesday said that the bipartisan long - term agreement between Iraq and the U.S. , currently being debated , will be executive , legal , and international between two sides .
He added that the treaty will embrace no items that require Senate approval .
" The bipartisan long - term agreement between Iraq and the U.S. will be executive , legal , and international between two sides , and during the negotiations with the Iraqi government 's negotiators , the U.S. government stresses that Iraq is a state that has sovereignty , and a partner in the negotiations that rely on the Iraqi national decision , " Satterfield said in a press conference in Baghdad .
" The agreement will embrace no items that require Senate approval , as it is not the first treaty that the U.S. holds with a state that has sovereignty , " he added .
" This agreement 's importance is not symbolic , but perceptible , " he explained .
" In December 2007 , the Iraqi government explained to the U.S. that the authorization of Multi National Forces ( MNF ) presence in Iraq ends by the end of 2008 , and that the Iraqi government demands having an agreement that arranges the relation with the present forces on its lands , " he noted .
" The U.S. responded to the demand , especially that there is a mutual tendency between us and the Iraqi government to establish the bases of mutual relations between the two countries , " he proceeded .
The agreement arranges U.S. forces presence in Iraq after 2008 , as those forces currently operate in that country according to UN clearance that is renewed on year basis per the Iraqi government 's request .
The treaty will require the 275 members Iraqi Parliament 's enactment .
" There is no relation between the Iraqi funds in the U.S. banks and imposing pressures on Iraqi negotiators concerning the bipartisan agreement between Iraq and U.S.A , " he said .
" Iraqi funds are in U.S. banks to protect them , as per an order from the U.S. president , " he asserted .
" Yesterday , we had a negotiations session with the Iraqi side , and we concentrated on the security dimension , because it is the most important , and we achieved tangible progress , in addition to the other dimensions , especially in how both sides ' proposals are mutual and flexible ; a matter that any negotiations require to accomplish the mutual interests , after putting the agreement 's strategic frame , " he explained .
" The U.S. Ambassador in Iraq , Ryan Crocker , leads the U.S. team to the negotiations , while the Iraqi Deputy Premier , Barham Saleh , leads the Iraqi team that consists of members of Iraqi government 's quintuple council , which includes Iraqi components , not one component , " he added .
Concerning negotiations ' transparency , Satterfield said , " Transparency of negotiations between Iraq and U.S. will appear when the agreement 's draft is submitted to the Iraqi Parliament . "
" Points under discussions cannot be exposed to the public opinion , unless there is an agreement upon them , " he added .
" The U.S. has more than 80 treaties with different countries , and it has experience in holding agreements for tens of years , like those with Germany , Japan , and Korea , " he explained .
Regarding a question addressed by Aswat al - Iraq - Voices of Iraq - ( VOI ) of whether the agreement will include an item that allows reconsidering the agreement 's items , Satterfield said , " The agreement 's items can be reconsidered , especially that they are many and divergent to the fields of politics , security , economic , society , health , and education . "
" As the situation in Iraq is changeable , Iraq has the right , for example , to demand the cancellation of the agreement when its forces become capable of preserving security in Iraq , " he said .
" The agreement will allow Iraq to hold other agreements with other countries to achieve benefits , " he added .
In a second question about the deadline to sign this agreement , and whether Iraq is compelled to sign it by July 31 , 2008 , Satterfield said " The U.S. did not specify a date to sign the agreement , but the Iraqi and U.S. sides perceive that a date should be specified in this regard , and there is enough time until the end of July to sign it . "

Obama pays Clinton a private house call in Washington Associated Press
Published : Thursday June 5 , 2008
|
Print This Email This WASHINGTON - Hillary Rodham Clinton met late Thursday with Barack Obama , a day after saying she would end her quest for the Democratic nomination and endorse the Illinois senator .
A senior Obama campaign official confirmed that Obama delayed his departure from Washington Thursday night to meet with Clinton at her home here .
Earlier , Clinton had disavowed efforts by some supporters who have urged Obama to choose her as his running mate .
" She is not seeking the vice presidency , and no one speaks for her but her , " communications director Howard Wolfson said .
" The choice here is Senator Obama 's and his alone . "
More details appeared on the an MSNBC's Verdict , broadcast June 5 , 2008 .

Clinton was planning an event in Washington Saturday to thank supporters and urge them to back Obama 's candidacy .
But as she was bowing out of the race , supporters in Congress and elsewhere were ramping up a campaign to pressure him to put her on the ticket in the No. 2 spot .
Bob Johnson , the billionaire founder of Black Entertainment Television and a Clinton supporter , sent a letter to the Congressional Black Caucus Wednesday urging the group to encourage Obama to choose Clinton as his vice presidential pick .
He said he was doing so with her blessing .
Obama is seeking to become the first black president .
Clinton has told other friends and supporters she would be willing to be Obama 's running mate .
But her immediate task is bringing her own presidential bid to a close .
High stakes
In an e-mail to supporters , the New York senator said she " will be speaking on Saturday about how together we can rally the party behind Senator Obama .
The stakes are too high and the task before us too important to do otherwise . "
Clinton expressed the same sentiment in a conference call with 40 members of her national finance committee , whom she urged to begin raising money for Obama and for the Democratic National Committee .
" She was in good spirits and totally supportive , without qualification , of Senator Obama and his campaign , " finance co-chairman Alan Patricof said of the call .
It was a shift in tone by the former first lady , who announced 17 months ago that she was " in it to win it . "
Many of her supporters want her as the vice presidential candidate , in their minds a " dream ticket " that would bring Obama her enthusiastic legions and broaden his appeal to white and working - class voters .
But Obama indicated he intends to take his time making a decision .
" We 're not going to be rushed into it .
I do n't think Senator Clinton expects a quick decision and I do n't even know that she 's necessarily interested in that , " Obama told NBC in an interview .
Clinton 's move to formally declare that she is backing the Illinois senator came after Democratic congressional colleagues made clear they had no stomach for a protracted intraparty battle .
Now that Obama has secured the 2,118 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination , Clinton had little choice but to end her quest , and sooner rather than later .
Some of Clinton 's closest supporters  the nearly two dozen House Democrats from her home state of New York  switched their endorsements to Obama Thursday .
The public announcement from the 23 New York followed two days of private phone calls weighing her options .
" She was just as spunky as ever , " Rep. Charlie Rangel said of Clinton 's mood on the calls , as her friends and supporters urged her to come to a decision " sooner rather than later . "
Many of the lawmakers said it was important for them , as New Yorkers who are close to Clinton and helped launch her presidential bid , to work together to repair some of the rifts in the party .
" We 're Democrats .
Dammit to hell we fight .
When it 's over , we come together and go out there to win , " said Rangel , the dean of the New York delegation .
The New Yorkers , said Rep. Gregory Meeks , have a duty " to lead this transition " to full party support of Obama .
Another of Clinton 's most prominent supporters , Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland , also announced his " wholehearted and enthusiastic support " for Obama Thursday .
Exit strategy
The move to end her campaign came Tuesday , when Clinton told House Democrats during a private conference call that she would get behind Obama 's candidacy and congratulate him for gathering the necessary delegates to be the party 's nominee .
The only degree of uncertainty was how .
Clinton is exploring options to retain her delegates and promote her issues , including a signature call for universal health care .
The announcement closed an epic five - month nominating battle pitting the first serious female candidate against the most viable black contender ever .
Obama on Tuesday night secured the delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination .
But Clinton stopped short of acknowledging that milestone , defiantly insisting she was better positioned to defeat McCain in November .
" What does Hillary want ?
What does she want ? "
Clinton asked , hours after telling supporters she'd be open to joining Obama as his vice presidential running mate .
But by Wednesday , other Democrats made it abundantly clear they wanted something too : a swift end to the often bitter nominating contest .
Her decision to acquiesce caught many in her campaign by surprise and left them scrambling to finalize the logistics and specifics behind her campaign departure .

Kathe Baud rang 3 AW today after hearing her son , Tom , describing on radio how he had used ecstasy , speed and psychedelic drugs .
She said she was " surprised " because she thought she would have recognised the symptoms of illicit drug use .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - OPEC ’s Secretary General on Tuesday appealed for calm , saying the record - high crude oil price was unbearable and did not reflect any shortage of supply in the market .
Abdullah al - Badri also called for measures to curb market speculation , a factor OPEC says is sending prices to unjustified levels .
Oil hit a record $ 139.12 a barrel on Friday and was trading near $ 136 on Tuesday .
“ I ask through you , through Reuters , really we need some calm .
We are panicking too much , ” Badri told the Reuters Global Energy Summit .
“ The situation is unbearable as far as we are concerned .
I want to say , there is no shortage now and in the future . ”
The comments are the latest to underscore the view of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it is pumping more than enough oil and high prices reflect factors beyond its control .
“ We are not happy with the current level of price for one reason .
It has nothing to do with the fundamentals , ” he said .
“ Speculators are playing a big role in high oil prices .
Also there are other considerations , the value of the dollar and the geopolitical situation . ”

Saudi Arabia , the world ’s top exporter and OPEC ’s most influential member , said on Monday it would soon call for a meeting to discuss what it called unjustified rises in prices .
Badri supported holding such a meeting , which he said might happen before the next scheduled OPEC gathering on September 9 .
NO DEMAND FOR MORE
OPEC , source of two in every five barrels of oil , is pumping 32.2 million barrels per day ( bpd ) , more than estimates of demand for its oil in 2008 , Badri said .
The International Energy Agency , adviser to 27 industrialized countries , on Tuesday raised its forecast for the need for OPEC oil this year by 300,000 bpd to 31.6 million bpd -- still below OPEC ’s output .
In support of his point that prices are being driven by factors other than supply , Badri said world consumption of 87 million bpd is smaller than the value of trading in oil - related financial instruments .
Badri said the “ paper market ” equaled about 1.36 billion bpd and he was critical of investment banks , some of whose forecasts for rising prices have been partly credited for sending oil to new peaks .
“ Their practice at this time is not in favor of producers and consumers , ” he said .
“ We really can not be guided by one or two speculators . ”
OPEC , which currently has 13 member - countries , was willing to raise production if needed , although there was no demand for extra barrels .
“ Nobody is asking for oil at this time .
We are checking with our member countries .
There is no queue for oil , ” he said .
The IEA on Tuesday cut its forecast for world oil demand growth in 2008 by 230,000 bpd to 800,000 bpd , citing the impact on consumption of fuel subsidy cuts in Asia .
Demand remains robust despite rising prices and Badri said OPEC would not make as large a reduction in demand when it publishes its latest forecasts .
“ Maybe we would reduce by 40,000 - 50,000 barrels per day in the next report , but not more , ” he said , referring to OPEC ’s Monthly Oil Market Report for June scheduled to be published on Friday .
“ With the high price , there will be a slowdown in demand .
There ’s no doubt about it , but I do n’t think it ’s as much as the IEA forecast . ”
Those of you who mistook CN ’s April 2 post Wind Power That Floats for a belated April Fool ’s joke will want to consider last month ’s project launch by Norway ’s StatoilHydro .
The North Sea oil and gas giant has teamed up with engineering conglomerate Siemens AG to anchor a full - scale commercial wind turbine in over 200 meters of water off Norway ’s southwest tip .
StatoilHydro and Siemens plan to take a different tack from the startups profiled in the April 2 piece .
As I show today in Wind Power Moves into Deep Waters at TechnologyReview.com , these big players are selecting components conservatively to prove that the concept of floating wind turbines is workable rather than trying to engineer the optimal floating system from the start .
Consider the turbine itself .
Tech startup Sway is designing a downwind rotor , and rival Blue H Group is building a two - bladed rotor with hinged blades .
Both designs could reduce the forces on the machine and thus reduce the weight of the entire system–including the super - pricey counterweights required to anchor giant buoys to the seabed .
But both designs were also left behind as the commercial wind power industry went mainstream in the mid to late 1990s and coalesced around the less elegant but more durable upwind three - bladed rotors now universally used on utility scale turbines .
StatoilHydro and Siemens will use a well - tested Siemens three - blade upwind machine , thus simplifying both their design process and their demonstration of the floating wind concept .
As StatoilHydro ’s vp for wind power notes in my story , if the demo fails in any way they ’ll know that it ’s not the turbine itself that ’s to blame .

Man ’s Vomit Poisons 54 People
It was like a scene out of Resident Evil , when a man began to vomit in a hospital emergency room causing over 50 people surrounding him to be posioned and scrambling for medical attention themselves .
This was no movie though and no one was amused .
In Kumamoto , Japan , a man was rushed to the emergency room after drinking large amounts of pesticide and poisoning himself .
Doctors were attempting to pump the patients stomach when he started violently vomiting before dying .
The spray of chloropicrin , a very dangerous pesticide , was so toxic it cause 54 doctors , nurses , and patients to have breathing problems and sores in their eyes , leaving them desperate for medical help .
All of the injured hospital workers were transfered to a different hospital and 10 of them ended up being hospitalized themselves .
A 72 year - old pneumonia patient got the worst of it as her condition worsened after being exposed to the fumes .
90 additional hospital personnel were called in to assist in the emergency and the nearby fire department was called in to decontaminate the emergency room .
Detergent suicides have been a recent trend in Japan , which has caused a panic amongst officials .
With 50 people having killed themselves with detergent overdose recipes found on the internet , officials have tried to get internet providers to take down pages containing the recipe .

Normally , speculation drives up commodity prices by promoting hoarding .
Yet there ’s no sign of resource hoarding in the data : inventories of food and metals are at or near historic lows , while oil inventories are only normal .
Image Paul Krugman Credit ...
Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
The best argument for the second view , that the resource crunch is real but temporary , is the strong resemblance between what we ’re seeing now and the resource crisis of the 1970s .
What Americans mostly remember about the 1970s are soaring oil prices and lines at gas stations .
But there was also a severe global food crisis , which caused a lot of pain at the supermarket checkout line 
I remember 1974 as the year of Hamburger Helper  and , much more important , helped cause devastating famines in poorer countries .
In retrospect , the commodity boom of 1972 - 75 was probably the result of rapid world economic growth that outpaced supplies , combined with the effects of bad weather and Middle Eastern conflict .
Eventually , the bad luck came to an end , new land was placed under cultivation , new sources of oil were found in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea , and resources got cheap again .
But this time may be different : concerns about what happens when an ever - growing world economy pushes up against the limits of a finite planet ring truer now than they did in the 1970s .
For one thing , I do n’t expect growth in China to slow sharply anytime soon .
That ’s a big contrast with what happened in the 1970s , when growth in Japan and Europe , the emerging economies of the time , downshifted  and thereby took a lot of pressure off the world ’s resources .
Meanwhile , resources are getting harder to find .
Big oil discoveries , in particular , have become few and far between , and in the last few years oil production from new sources has been barely enough to offset declining production from established sources .
Replacement Hybrid Battery Costs Plummet
When someone on the EcoModder forums asks about buying a used hybrid , there is usually a flurry of excitement coupled with cautions about the age of the car and the price of a new battery pack .
Ecomodders , usually being budget - minded folks , are very wary of the seemingly astronomical price of battery replacement .
In the early part of this decade , some of the biggest worries about hybrids were how could the batteries possibly last , when would they finally give out , and how much would it cost to have them replaced .
These days , concerns about batteries have largely faded out of the minds of new car buyers .
Honda and Toyota have both had hybrids on the market for about a decade now , and there are no ominous junkyards filled with dead hybrids .
To underline the reliability of modern battery - electric hybrids , Honda says that out of over 100,000 hybrids on the road currently , only 200 have needed out - of - warranty battery replacement .
Toyota , on the other hand , has only needed to replace 0.003 percent of its hybrid batteries out of warranty on the second generation Prius .
Granted , these cars still arenâ€™t all that old , and the batteries will likely fail eventually , but it seems that they are living up to manufacturersâ€™ promises that they will last the life of a car .
Necessity aside , Honda and Toyota have both announced drastic cuts to the cost of replacement batteries for their hybrids .
It will now cost just under $ 2,000 to have new batteries installed in you Honda Insight , and just under $ 2,500 for your Accord hybrid .
These are about $ 1,000 reductions in the cost .
Toyota , on the other hand , has dropped prices from ~ $ 5,500 to $ 3,000 , but that does n’t include the installation , so the real cost is likely a bit more .
So , buyers of used hybrids , never fear !
It ’s unlikely that your batteries will fail prematurely , and even if they do , replacements are getting cheaper .

Both pro- and anti-choice activists are preparing the state legislative landscape on abortion for the next President and his or her Supreme Court nominees .
The right 's latest tactic is the ban - in - waiting -- a ban on abortion that springs into effect upon the reversal of Roe .
John McCain knows how to dog- whistle .
At Wake Forest University two weeks ago , in a speech outlining his judicial philosophy and describing the judges he would nominate for the Supreme Court , McCain decried justices who use " ‘ penumbras , ’ ‘ emanations , ’ and other airy constructs … as poor substitutes for clear and rigorous constitutional reasoning . "
There was n’t a word in McCain ’s speech about abortion , or Roe , but there did n’t need to be – he was referring , obliquely but distinctly , of course , to the " zones of privacy " found in the " penumbras and emanations " around certain amendments to the Constitution .
" He ’s learning the secret code , " Elizabeth Shipp , political director at NARAL Pro-Choice America , said in response .
" The secret code is what he has to say in public when people are actually paying attention to him to appeal to independent and pro-choice Republican voters .
He ca n’t come out in a major speech and say , ‘ Yeah , I want to see Roe v. Wade overturned . ’ "
Anti-choice activists nationwide hear the whistle and are getting ready for him – and his judicial nominees .
If McCain wins his bid for presidency , has the opportunity to nominate a Supreme Court justice , and puts forth a nominee who shares his disparaging view of the foundation of the right to privacy , Roe ’s vulnerability is guaranteed – and the legislative landscape in states across the country will have been strategically prepared .
Meanwhile , Americans are aware that federal protection of abortion is vulnerable , but 58 % are not aware of the laws protective of or hostile to abortion in their own states .
A widely - noted strategy of the anti-choice right is to introduce outright , immediate bans on abortion , bans state legislatures know are unconstitutional and pass with the explicit intention to challenge Roe at the Supreme Court level – a strategy that got underway in 2004 , when South Dakota introduced the first abortion ban to be considered by state legislature in over a decade .
The most notorious of such bans , lacking even an exception for rape , incest or a woman ’s health , the South Dakota ban was passed and signed into law in 2006 , but blocked from going into effect by a successful popular referendum process to overturn it .
This fall , South Dakota again will consider an outright ban , this time with exceptions for rape and incest .

While the outright outlawing of abortion puts a particularly urgent face on the issue of judicial nominees , there ’s a second , subtler prong to the strategy , one that suggests that anti-choice activists are setting their sights on a time far beyond Roe ’s reversal .
States with anti-choice legislatures have hit upon a novel way to use the law , creating bans on abortion that are not in constitutional conflict with Roe because they go into effect , or are " triggered , " only upon the overturn of Roe .
So- called " bans- in - waiting " go beyond states ’ proclamation of their intention to outlaw abortion when they can constitutionally do so to outline what specifically would be illegal and what penalties would be incurred for illegal abortion when it constitutionally can be outlawed .
As recently as 2004 , no state had a bans - in - waiting on the books .
In 2005 , in the wake of failure of the state ’s immediate abortion ban to survive popular referendum , South Dakota passed the first ; in 2006 , Louisiana followed , and Kentucky and Missouri considered bans - in - waiting .
In 2007 , Mississippi and North Dakota added bans - in - waiting to their books and Oklahoma , Texas , and Utah all considered them .
Bans - in - waiting reflect anti-choice activists ’ confidence that Roe will be overturned , says Katherine Grainger , vice - president of NARAL Pro-Choice New York , and demonstrate that " anti-choice activists are not waiting for Roe to fall to shape the post - Roe world . "
For Sondra Goldschein , state strategies attorney at the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project , bans - in - waiting are " just the same " as immediate bans .
" They show legislative intent to ban abortion , " she says , and they " come as no surprise " to the advocates on the ground who are well - acquainted with their state legislature ’s hostility to women ’s health and well - being .
Perhaps the most insidious aspect of bans - in - waiting is that because the bans are not currently in effect , and because there is therefore no individual who has standing to challenge the law , such bans cannot be challenged in court once they are passed into law .
" Courts stop laws from going into effect – there has to be some kind of immediate urgency that the court has to rectify .
And the bans - in - waiting do n’t have that effective date , " Grainger explains .
Goldschein notes that it ’s " unprecedented " for a legislature to pass laws with an unspecified future effective date .
While in some states , the state ’s own constitutional provisions on privacy – often far more expansive than federal constitutional protections – could conflict with the bans , reproductive rights litigators can’t make any arguments in court against the bans until they effectuate .
So , in the twenty - five states without a popular referendum process , the only way bans - in - waiting can be overturned is if the legislature that passed them will repeal them .
But legislatures passing bans - in - waiting are " packed with anti-choice legislators that keep getting re-elected year after year , " Grainger notes , so " the possibility of that occurring is slim . "
For anti-choice activists , bans - in - waiting have another advantage over outright bans – because they ca n’t be attacked in court , unlike unconstitutional bans on abortion , bans - in - waiting cost the state nothing to defend .
Grainger says that the Louisiana state legislature wanted to pass an outright ban shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit the state .
When pro-choice advocates asked legislators whether they really wanted to spend millions of taxpayer dollars defending an unconstitutional ban as the state recovered from a natural disaster , legislators responded , " ‘ Oh , that ’s going to look really bad , let ’s make it a ban - in - waiting , ’ " says Grainger .
" I think that ’s largely how these things are thought of .
‘ We do n’t want to pay ; we do n’t want to look bad .
We want to get re-elected , but we also want to outlaw abortion .
How can we do that ? ’ "
So , ‘ bans - in - waiting ’ allow them to do so . "
Though the period from 2005 to 2007 saw an increase in the number of states introducing and passing bans - in - waiting each year , 2008 has been a slow year for bans - in - waiting , says Celine Mizrahi , legislative counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights .
Only Virginia proposed a ban - in - waiting and it has n’t moved .
In this election year , Mizrahi sees that all the action is on ballot initiatives , including South Dakota ’s ban , Colorado ’s and Montana ’s personhood amendments , and California ’s parental notification measure .
A Lab of Our Own
South Dakota has been first out of the gate on both the immediate ban and the ban - in - waiting , turning the state into a laboratory for anti-choice legislation .
The pro-choice movement needs a lab of its own , says Grainger .
Galen Sherwin , director of the Reproductive Rights Project at the New York Civil Liberties Union , hopes legislation currently being considered by the New York state legislature can be one such model for other , more moderate states .
Roe ’s vulnerability has prompted many reproductive rights advocates to consider statutory codification of Roe in state law – analysis done by the Center for Reproductive Rights suggests that if Roe were overturned , abortion would likely become illegal in twenty - one states , remain legal in twenty , and in nine the future of legal abortion is unclear .
Sherwin and other New York state reproductive health advocates started working on the state ’s Reproductive Health and Privacy Protection Act ( RHAPP ) in the wake of the federal abortion ban and as Gonzalez v. Carhart was moving through the federal court system .
Concerned that New York might be vulnerable if Carhart resulted in a repeal of Roe , New York advocates learned that the state ’s own law on abortion had not been updated since 1970 .
" What we found when we looked at New York law was that in fact because New York changed its laws to legalize abortion in 1970 , which was before Roe v.
Wade was even decided , it ’s now significantly out - of - date and we ’ve never gone back and revised it , " Sherwin explains .
As such , it failed to include the health exception that Carhart itself compromised .
For some pro-choice legislators , RHAPP represents the first opportunity to take a stand on affirmative pro-choice legislation , rather than battling legislation designed to curtail abortion rights .
And some of those legislators have n’t been as quick to sign on to RHAPP as they may have been to oppose anti-choice legislation .
" New York has not had a germane abortion bill on the floor since the seventies , " Grainger explains .
" They ’ve never had to think about it , " says Sherwin .
" They ’re used to responding [ to choice issues ] in a defensive posture .
We ’re working to give them a sense of comfort that protecting women ’s health should not be an act of courage it should be the natural part of their job . "
In Illinois , reproductive health advocates are pushing what the ACLU ’s Goldschein calls reproductive justice legislation : the Reproductive Justice and Access Act would not just codify Roe but ensure access to funding for abortion services – as well mandating comprehensive sexuality education , contraceptive access , and other reproductive health care .
Goldschein credits reproductive health advocates in New York and Illinois for being " at the point of legislation " on affirmative reproductive health bills , but notes that states all across the country are n’t just fighting back restrictions but that " all states have as their ultimate goal the right to access the full spectrum of reproductive health care , including abortion . "
Seven other states have already passed statutory protection for abortion , including California , Connecticut , Hawaii , Maine , Maryland , Washington , and Nevada .
One thing is clear to advocates working on affirmative legislation : no bill could be incremental , or moderate , enough to placate anti-choice protesters .
Working on the RHAPP , a bill that does little more than codify existing federal law into state statute , has still aroused the ire – and misinformation – the anti-choice right is famous for .
" It ’s obvious that opponents are not responding to any particular provision of the bill but that they oppose the notion of women ’s reproductive freedom and of the freedom to decide whether or not to become pregnant or whether or not to bear a child , " Sherwin observes .
" Over-arching protection for liberty and dignity for women : that is what is the focus of opponents . "
And it will be John McCain ’s target too , should he get the chance .

The Bush administration lost no time in seeking to exploit the devastating tragedy in Burma ( Myanmar ) .
It has seized upon the cyclone that struck the country over the weekend , killed at least 20,000 and likely many more , to aggressively push its foreign policy agenda in Asia .
On Tuesday , Bush held a special ceremony at the White House to sign a bill giving Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi a Congressional Gold Medal .
He used the occasion to place deliberately provocative conditions on any disbursement of aid to the ravaged country , beyond an initial token sum .
“ The United States has made an initial aid contribution , but we want to do a lot more , ” Bush declared .
“ We ’re prepared to move US Navy assets to help find those who ’ve lost their lives , to help find the missing , to help stabilize the situation .
But in order to do so , the military junta must allow our disaster assessment teams into the country . ”
So far , the US embassy has authorized the release of a paltry $ 250,000 — less than half the cost of a single Tomahawk cruse missile of the type used by the US Navy to kill a Somali rebel last week .
Later Tuesday , the administration pledged an additional $ 3 million to be allocated by a USAID disaster response team .
The very fact that the US is making aid to Burma conditional upon the satisfaction of certain demands is itself an outrage .
Bush did not say why it was necessary for the US to carry out its own assessment in order to release more aid , nor did he elaborate on what was meant by promises that the US military would help “ stabilize the situation . ”
US Navy ships are standing by off the coast of Thailand to intervene .
These pledges are certainly not intended as selfless humanitarian gestures .
The Bush administration has been seeking to undermine the Burmese military regime for years and seized on protests last year by Buddhist monks to slap economic sanctions on the country and its rulers .
There is no doubt that the United States would be happy to exploit the current tragedy to get a military foothold in the country .
The World Socialist Web Site holds no brief for the Burmese military junta , a brutal regime that has exercised dictatorial control over a largely impoverished country .
However , US and European machinations , including the promotion of Suu Kyi , have nothing to do with concern for the democratic rights or economic well - being of the population .
As always , the humanitarian pretensions of the US government are carefully calibrated to coincide with the interests of the American ruling class .
In the case of Burma , the US is interested in countering the influence of China , which has closer ties with the military regime and sees the country as a critical point of access into the Indian Ocean .
As far as the Bush administration is concerned , the population of the country is only a bargaining chip in the pursuit of geo-strategic objectives .
US energy giants , including the Chevron oil corporation , also have interests in Burma .
While the Bush administration has placed economic sanctions on the country , these have not affected Chevron ’s multibillion - dollar investments through its subsidiary Unocal .
Human rights groups have accused Chevron of complicity in abuses in Burma intended to protect its pipeline routes .
The statements by the Bush administration must also be seen in the context of its treatment of populations around the world , including in the United States itself .
On Monday , US First Lady Laura Bush was the first from the White House to respond to the cyclone , using the opportunity to chastise the government for failing to warn the population and adequately prepare for the consequences .
“ Although they were aware of the threat , ” she said , “ Burma ’s state - run media failed to issue a timely warning to citizens in the storm ’s path .
The response to the cyclone is just the most recent example of the junta ’s failure to meet its people ’s basic needs . ”
The hypocrisy and cynicism of this statement are so glaring that one wonders if it is not intentionally provocative .
This August 29 will mark the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina , the massive storm that struck Louisiana and Mississippi , killing at least 1,800 people .
The hurricane destroyed and flooded New Orleans , a major American city .

Tens of thousands remained trapped for days in the Louisiana Superdome .
Many thousands who lost their homes were placed in temporary FEMA trailers , and in 2007 it was revealed that these trailers contained extremely high levels of formaldehyde , a toxic chemical .
The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina was largely preventable , but due to gross governmental indifference and negligence , the levee systems of New Orleans were denied necessary investments and allowed to decay — only one of many examples of the American government ’s “ failure to meet its people ’s basic needs . ”

The right to be tried by a jury of your peers is a fundamental human right .
To abdicate those freedoms and duties because it is boring is pure selfishness Andy , USA " Some of the evidence is rather drawn out , and I find it difficult to maintain my attention the whole time , " the juror told the Australian Associated Press .

" We actually all thought they were quite a diligent jury , " lawyer Robyn Hakelis told ABC local radio .
" The judge had made many comments about what a good jury they were , how they were taking copious amounts of notes . "
There is no legal action that can be taken against jurors for doing puzzles during a trial , so they will face no penalty for their behaviour .
A fresh trial is expected to begin in a few weeks , once a new jury has been called .

The mathematicians were trying to extend an illustrious result in their field , the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra .
The astrophysicists were working on a fundamental problem in their field , the problem of gravitational lensing .
That the two groups were in fact working on the same question is both expected and unexpected :
The " unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics " is well known throughout the sciences , but every new instance produces welcome insights and sheer delight .
In their article " From the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to Astrophysics : A ` Harmonious ' Path " , which appears in the Notices of the AMS , mathematicians Dmitry Khavinson ( University of South Florida ) and Genevra Neumann ( University of Northern Iowa ) describe the mathematical work that surprisingly led them to questions in astrophysics .
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra ( FTA ) , proofs of which go back to the 18th century , is a bedrock mathematical truth , elegant in its simplicity : Every complex polynomial of degree n has n roots in the complex numbers .
In the 1990s , Terry Sheil - Small and Alan Wilmshurst explored the question of extending the FTA to harmonic polynomials .
In a surprising twist in 2001 , Khavinson , together with G. Swiatek , applied methods from complex dynamics to settle one of the cases of Wilmshurst 's conjecture , showing that for a certain class of harmonic polynomials , the number of zeros is at most 3n - 2 , where n is the degree of the polynomial .
When she was a postdoc at Kansas State University , Neumann mentioned the 3n - 2 result in a talk , and Pietro Poggi- Corradini wondered whether Khavinson and Swiatek 's complex dynamics approach could be extended to counting the zeros of rational harmonic functions .
( A rational function is a quotient of polynomials , and a rational harmonic function is the sum of a rational function and the complex conjugate of a rational function . )
She later asked Khavinson about this possibility .
" We did n't have any idea what the answer would be , " she said .
And they certainly had no idea that an astrophysicist had already conjectured the answer .
" We were slightly surprised that the number came out different , 5n - 5 vs. 3n - 2 , " recalled Khavinson .
They also wondered whether the bound of 5n - 5 was " sharp " --- that is , whether it could be pushed any lower .
" After checking and re-checking it , we posted a preprint on the arXiv and then returned to our respective business , " Khavinson said .
" Literally , a week later we received a congratulatory e-mail from Jeffrey Rabin of UCSD kindly telling us that our theorem resolves a conjecture of Sun Hong Rhie in astrophysics . "
Khavinson and Neumann had no idea that anyone outside of mathematics would be interested in this result .
Rhie has been studying the problem of gravitational lensing , a phenomenon in which light from a celestial source , such as a star or galaxy , is deflected by a massive object ( or objects ) between the light source and the observer .
Because of the deflection , the observer sees multiple images of the same light source .
The phenomenon was first predicted in the early 19th century , using Newtonian mechanics .
A more accurate prediction was made by Einstein in 1915 using his theory of general relativity , and early observational support came in 1919 during a solar eclipse .
The first gravitational lensing system was discovered in 1979 .
It turns out that at least in some idealized situations one can count the number of images of the light source seen in a gravitational lensing system by counting the number of zeros of a rational harmonic function --- exactly the kind of function Khavinson and Neumann had been studying .
While investigating the possible number of images produced by a gravitational lens that has n point masses deflecting the light , Rhie had conjectured the bound of 5n - 5 that so surprised Khavinson and Neumann .
Rhie also came up with an ingenious way of constructing an example of a rational harmonic function with exactly 5n - 5 zeros .
Together with the result of Khavinson and Neumann , this example establishes that their 5n - 5 bound is sharp .
After hearing about Rhie 's work , Khavinson and Neumann contacted other mathematicians and astrophysicists who worked on similar problems and received feedback they then used to revise their paper ( it has since appeared in Proceedings of the AMS ) .
These interactions led Khavinson into fruitful collaborations with astrophysicists on related questions .
Some of the new results from this work are mentioned in the Notices article .
" I find this kind of interdisciplinary collaboration extremely exciting and stimulating , " said Khavinson .
" I just hope that I will be able to continue these collaborations .
It is one of the most exciting experiences I have had in my life . "
Neumann is just as enthusiastic , and is grateful to Kansas State physicist Larry Weaver , who helped her to understand the physics of gravitational lensing , and to Rabin , who acted as the link between mathematics and astrophysics .

Alice Walker , best known as the author of the novel The Color Purple , is one of the most renowned feminist authors and activists of her generation .
She is also a mother , and that fact brought her public and private lives into direct conflict .
That is because Alice Walker ’s brand of feminism was the kind that taught that “ motherhood was about the worst thing that could happen to a woman . ”
So says her daughter , Rebecca , who suffered the consequences of that thinking .
In a recent London Daily Mail article , Rebecca Walker reflected on the neglect she experienced with her divorced father across the country and her mother too busy for her , frequently leaving her alone for long periods as a teenager .
With her mother ’s knowledge — and even support —
Rebecca became sexually active at 13 and had an abortion at 14 .
She was well aware that her mother thought of her as a burden .
The younger Walker — who lives in England — writes now , “ My mother ’s feminist principles coloured every aspect of my life .
As a little girl , I was n’t even allowed to play with dolls or stuffed toys in case they brought out a maternal instinct .
It was drummed into me that being a mother , raising children and running a home were a form of slavery .
Having a career , travelling the world and being independent were what really mattered according to her . ”
After years of private and public feuding , their estrangement is so deep that Alice has never yet even seen Rebecca ’s own son , her grandson .
In an early interview , Rebecca suggested that this was the natural result of putting “ ideology ” before relationships .
As an African - American woman born in 1944 , Alice Walker saw her share of injustices .
Her instinct to try to put things right was not the problem here .
The problem was that she was part of a generation of feminists who believed that the way to correct injustice was to put yourself first and everyone else , including your family , last .
Women taught their daughters this by both precept and by example .
And as a result , Rebecca says now , “ Feminism has betrayed an entire generation of women into childlessness .
It is devastating . ”
Rebecca has met many women who avoided having children because they thought that it was their duty to do so , and now are despondent that it is no longer possible for them to do so .
Rebecca
Walker is no one ’s idea of a cultural conservative — she and her child ’s father are unmarried by choice , though they are raising their son together ; and she still considers herself a feminist .
Rebecca wrote in the Daily Mail , “ Having a child has been the most rewarding experience of my life .
Far from ‘ enslaving ’ me , three - and - a - half - year - old Tenzin has opened my world .
I simply love hearing his little voice calling : ‘ Mummy , Mummy . ’ ”
In her own way , Rebecca — like many other daughters of the feminist revolution — is trying to put her own set of injustices right , not through selfishness and neglect , but by loving her child .
Such women , even when they are not coming at family life from a Christian perspective , are living out the larger truth :
We find our own fulfillment not by putting ourselves first , but by living for others .
And that means accepting our responsibilities , and moving toward — not away from — God ’s design for families .
IS FREE SPEECH BEING MANIPULATED BY INTERNET RATING ORGANIZATIONS ?

ï¿½ 2008 - NewsWithViews.com
I was not asked by NewsWithViews.com to write this short piece nor am I being compensated .
Like millions of Americans , I am fed up with media manipulation .
There are some questions here that need answering .
NWVs as well as other constitutionally oriented web sites are constant targets of hackers as well as ISP providers blocking NWVs email alerts to their account holders or flagging NWVs email alerts as spam .
We know this has been going on with AOL and others .
After strong complaints it gets corrected .
Strangely , it keeps happening and I do n't believe for a second it 's accidental .
I can tell you it also goes on for You Tube and Google videos that are posted - especially 911 and Ron Paul videos .
As an experiment , I have watched the number of views go up or down within minutes tracking the numbers for a specific video ; many of us have seen the numbers not change for days at a time when dozens of people deliberately clicked on that video .
There 's no question the numbers are being fudged to give the appearance of " lack of interest " by the American people .
As for NWVs , they track internally as I do my web site , the number of unique visitors , etc. NWVs does this to verify traffic numbers for advertising .
Like all the top news sites , NWVs has to operate like a business or they can't stay on line .
These monster servers alone cost a bundle every month .
There appears to be a problem with Alexa , the premier Internet rating organization and NWVs does n't know why .
They have done the comparisons using Alexa and Quantcast .
The latter shows much higher numbers during the same targeted dates , while Alexa drops NWVs in huge numbers over night .
One computer expert indicated it might be because NWVs does not post the Alexa tool bar on their site to show the number of hits .
This would amount to involuntary free advertising .
I find this very disturbing if true .
If that 's not the case , I would like Alexa to explain these huge discrepancies in the numbers .
As a result of these helter - skelter numbers , NWVs has suffered in getting those critical advertising dollars .
If NWVs were to go off line , I would be able to find another site to write for as would all the superb columnists who willingly and for no compensation bring you the best analysis and writing every day of the week , 52 weeks a year .
That 's not what I want to see happen and I hope you do n't either .
The principles at NWVs do not get a day off nor do they get a vacation .
I know this for a fact .
This news site has to be maintained and new columns posted 365 days a year .
These are highly dedicated Americans who deserve your support .
We cannot allow our right to speak out and expose the truth to be manipulated if that 's what 's happening with these Internet rating organizations .
I hope if you have a nationwide product / service , or even a regional one like the State of Oregon where NWVs is operational , that you will contact Paul Walter about advertising .
Please keep in mind that it's not just the unique hits to NWVs that brings the reader to your ad and let me give you an example .
NWVs columns get linked and / or reprinted with permission on other web sites .
This increases the number of individuals who see your ad .
When my ' Enron - The Smokin ' Cannon of 911 ? ' was posted , it hit the stratosphere because of the subject matter .
Go to www.yahoo.com and type in Enron -- the smokin ' cannon of 9/11 ?
This is what will appear : 1 - 10 of about 1,570 for Enron - The Smokin ' Cannon Of 9 / 11 ?
That 's just one search engine .
This means that your ad is also seen by readers from a large number of other web sites if it appeared on my column page .
Americans read lots of sites and they forward columns from them and , well , you get the picture .
NWVs writers are very popular and well respected .
NWVs also depends on reader sponsorship - 12 months a year .
Donations are down , but they are needed .
If you appreciate NewsWithViews , I ask you to please open your wallet and make a donation .
If everyone reading this made a $ 10.00 donation , it would fund their operation for a year .
I know that wo n't happen and NWVs appreciates that times are getting more difficult .
However , if we all make a small donation each month , the job gets done .
NWVs can set you up with automatic monthly donations that makes it easy .
NWVs now has a shopping cart .

For a man aged over 80 , Pope Benedict XVI walks surprisingly quickly , racing into the Vatican 's Salle Clemente yesterday lunchtime as if determined to show those waiting for him that he was compensating for being late .
Then he took to the papal throne amid the splendour of the chapel , listening to the lead participants at an extraordinary Vatican conference on social capital and human development briefly reaffirm their commitment to the church 's aim to champion a Catholic social doctrine .
As they spoke , he eyed up the rest of the room , an assembly of some of the Catholic world 's richest and most influential businessmen and women along with a sprinkling of cardinals , archbishops and invited ' men and women of good will ' .
It was not to be a debate or a conversation ; that had happened the previous day .
Rather , it was his opportunity to give a carefully drafted pep talk to the Fondazione Centesimus Annus - Pro Pontifice - the foundation launched by his predecessor John Paul II to develop Catholic social policy - to think through how the church should react and try to reshape today 's turbo capitalism , its unstable and powerful financial markets along with desperately widening inequality , and to listen to what we had to say on the great issues he confronts .
He is working on a new papal encyclical on capitalism and society to be published later this year and this weekend was about giving him better ammunition .
Stalin was famously dismissive of the Pope , demanding to know how many armed divisions he could command .
But Catholicism has outlasted both communism and socialism .
And although the religion 's critics are right to point to the paradox of its championing of the poor with its own love of the good life and exquisite art , together with its extraordinary capacity to be as deft as any secular politician in the pursuit of its aims , there is an integrity , appeal and spirituality about its purpose that even an agnostic non-Catholic like me has to concede .
And having survived and entrenched itself for so long in so many countries , it finds itself as a genuinely global institution with a global capacity to make its values felt and heard ; what a successful religion needs to be in an era of globalisation .
I was invited to the Vatican as one of those ' men and women of good will ' to give my thoughts on what is happening in contemporary capitalism , and what could be done if it is not to become as destructive , iniquitous and unstable as it was 100 years ago .
The ' Centennius ' in the Fondazione 's title is the centennial of the first great papal encyclical on capitalism in 1891 delivered by Leo XIII .
' Rerum Novarum ' ( Of New Things ) was the church 's response to the then class war between capital and labour that threatened to end in revolution and worldwide communism , which the Russian Revolution in 1917 seemed to portend .
Casting himself as the peacemaker , Leo XIII recognised the validity of the claims of an increasingly militant working class for better pay , working conditions and dignity at work .
Capitalism could and should only survive if capital dropped its class war with labour , he warned , and instead should organise itself as a moral system accepting that turning work into mechanical drudgery was not in the interests of capital or labour .
Instead , he argued , capitalism had to understand that ' man 's life is built from work ' and that the quest for profit was not an end in itself .
Rather , it was a necessary but insufficient condition in a larger human endeavour , development as a common good in which every man and woman could realise the potential - and here enters religion - with which God had endowed them .
A century later and the Catholic church is again alarmed by the way capitalism is developing .
Whether sweatshop call centres , declining trade unions , directors paid tens of millions for failure while wages stagnate for all forms of unskilled labour , the church does not like what it sees .
Hence the coming encyclical .
The church , like New Labour , is careful not to be anti-business or anti-capital .
But where New Labour is silent , Catholics are prepared to mount a challenge .
They want decent wages ; more autonomy and dignity at work ; they want the rich to accept obligations to promote the common good ; firms to recognise that there is only any morality to profit making if it is as a consequence of delivering a declared economic purpose - to manufacture a great car , build a safe plane or whatever .
When Unilever was founded , I said in my remarks to the conference , it committed itself to make the best ' everyday things for everyday folk ' , Boeing to build the planes that flew fastest , safest , furthest , Sony to permanent innovation and so on .
These great companies sought to make profits as a consequence of delivering a great economic objective ; it was that purpose that is the social glue that makes a firm hang together and drives it forwards successfully over time .
If capitalism organises itself along the lines of a private equity firm , interested only in financial leverage , avoiding tax and vast personal gain while putting two fingers up to concepts of the common good , it has lost the plot .
Sooner or later , there will be a backlash and it is not even good for the business in the long term .
Yet what worries the church - and the businessmen and women who fund the Fondazione - is that this is where contemporary capitalism is heading .
They want the stakeholder capitalism that to my surprise John Paul II advocated in his 1991 Encyclical .
My position , which I outlined at the Vatican , is that stakeholder capitalism and the accompanying social policies are even more important in a ' knowledge economy ' in which so much economic activity involves problem - solving , team - working , mental dexterity and the application of skill .
All over the advanced industrialised world , knowledge work is becoming more important ( more than half of Swedish workers are now knowledge workers ) and it is impossible to get the best out of knowledge workforces if the relationship with managers and owners is exploitative .
Workers demand respect , inclusion and meaningful work , and that means firms with committed , engaged managers and owners .
This does not mean a land of Elysian fields in which no firm ever has to restructure , lay people off or take tough decisions .
But it does mean trying to shape capitalism so that it does things in its own long - term interests and those of society .
In the corridors afterwards , I was approached by business leaders worried that so many of their shareholders chose to be anonymous rather than accept ownership responsibilities .
They wondered whether their firms could be organised along stakeholder principles if they subcontracted and offshored too much work and to what extent they could pay decent wages and still remain competitive .
A lot of businessmen and women in Britain share these worries , but our discourse rarely allows them to surface .
Any politician who dares to voice them rather than be a cheerleader for the superclass , rampant profit - making and ' flexible ' wages risks the ludicrous sobriquet of being anti-business .
It has been a surreal weekend .
What was I doing standing in the beautiful Vatican gardens at an open - air morning Mass watching the green parrots swoop overhead ?
But there are a billion Catholics worldwide , not a trivial force for change if they can be mobilised .
Gordon Brown would rather lose a finger than argue for this stuff as an overarching , interconnected doctrine .
We stakeholders , believers in social justice and good work , make common cause with anybody we can find .
And I 'm delighted the Pope is one of them .
In Lithuania they create cars from PU - foam and luxury CL - klasse Mercedes .
Just a few short months after Verizon 's Open Development Conference which laid out everything you wanted to know about their open door " any app , any devce " policy , they 've just certified the first device that 'll run on their open network .
What is it , who made it and when can you buy it ?
Good questions !
They 're not telling us .
They just wanted everyone to know things are going well .
Uh , thanks ?

The Barker Ranch was the last redoubt of the gaggle of hippies , hitchhikers and lost souls that called itself the Family and followed the twisted beliefs of the convicted pimp , sex offender and would - be musician Charles Manson .
It was to this lonely outpost in the California desert that the group of 26 came after committing the gruesome Sharon Tate and LaBianca murders , and it was here , on August 12 1969 , that Manson was arrested hiding under a bathroom sink .
The story of how Manson came to form his sex and drug - fuelled cult , and turned his followers ' adulation into blood lust , has become the stuff of criminological legend , marking the low point of the 60s revolution .
Members of the Family were prosecuted for nine murders , the most famous victim being Tate , the pregnant wife of the film director Roman Polanski , but rumours have consistently claimed that the true death toll was much higher .
Now a group of interested individuals - including Tate 's younger sister , Debra , a local police detective , and forensics experts - have begun searching the desert around the ranch and believe they have found evidence of two , perhaps three , human graves that may be linked to the Manson Family .
The local sheriff 's office in Inyo County , about 200 miles from Los Angeles , is expected to decide next week whether to order an official dig of the potential grave sites to follow up on the amateur sleuthing .
The sheriff is weighing up the cost and police time that would be involved against the public interest in bringing closure to one of America 's most notorious criminal sprees .
The team of investigators made use of technology that was unavailable in 1969 to identify what they believe are sites where human remains are buried .
Sergeant Paul Dostie , a local police officer working off - duty , used his sniffer dog that has been trained to detect the smell of bodies , and researchers from a laboratory in Tennessee used ground probing equipment and radar to detect signs of refilled holes in the ground .
Debra
Tate , who has dedicated her life since her sister 's murder to preventing any of the jailed Family members being released , is insistent that the excavation should take place .
She told an LA television station : " If there 's a chance that we can send some children home , then we need to do that . "
There has long been conjecture that Manson may have been responsible for more murders than those ascribed to him and the four members of the Family who he got to do his bloody bidding .
An informant who associated with Manson in jail has said the cult leader once confessed that he had killed 35 , though such bragging from a recognised psychopath and fantasist must be treated with a degree of scepticism .
Susan Atkins , one of the Manson devotees who was involved in the murders and like him is serving a life sentence , was also said to have bragged to her cell mate soon after she was arrested that there were " three people out in the desert that they done in " .
Tales have swirled around Death Valley , where the Barker ranch is located , that Manson and his main accomplice , Tex Watson , took a woman who was proving to be awkward within the group for a walk away from the building into the desert , returning an hour later without her .
Dostie said the first site that received the attention of his sniffer dog fits the description of the direction in which they had been walking .
An abandoned haversack was found at the ranch , leading to speculation that its owner may also be a victim .
In nearby Bishop police have reopened the case of Fillippo Tennerelli , who was thought to have killed himself in a motel room in 1969 but is said to have been a victim of the Family .
Police are taking seriously the findings of the amateur investigators , though they have pointed out that loose ground resembling a burial site can be created by animals , and that even if there are human remains present they could be those of a prospector or rancher from long ago .
" At this point we 're looking at whatever shreds of evidence we can gather , " police chief Kathleen Sheehan told the Associated Press .
" There 's no statute of limitations on murder . "
The murders
" Maybe I should have killed 400 or 500 people , then I might have felt better . "
So said Charles Manson , speaking from high - security prison .
In the 39 years since he orchestrated the multiple murders known as the " two nights of madness " , fascination and revulsion at his acts have only grown more intense .
He used his power over his cult members , many of whom were women , initially to bond them into a virtual state of sexual and domestic servitude , and then to persuade them to commit brutal slayings at his command .
Manson told them that the murders were all part of an apocalyptic vision of the future which he called Helter Skelter , named after the song on the Beatle 's White Album which had recently been released .
America , he said , would erupt in a racial war between whites and blacks .
Manson sent four of his followers out on the night of August 8 1969 and told them to break into the mansion owned by Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate .
Polanski was filming in London , but Tate - who was more than eight months pregnant - and four other people were murdered , and the word " pig " scrawled in blood on the front door .
The next night Manson himself and six Family members murdered Leno and Rosemary LaBianca , writing " Helter Skelter " in blood on their fridge .
Manson was sentenced to death , which was later commuted to life imprisonment .
The mystery of how migratory birds exploit the Earth 's magnetic field using an internal compass may have been solved by scientists who have discovered how molecules in the eye can be orientated by weak magnetic lines .
About 50 species of animals are known to use the direction of Earth 's magnetic field to help them find their way , but scientists have been mystified as to how they could do it because the field seems to be too weak to have an effect on the nervous system .
Now , though , scientists have come up with a possible method based on a series of complex photochemical reactions that can occur within the eyes of birds , as well as other animals , which could help them use an internal compass .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Professor Peter Hore , a physical chemist at Oxford University , explained : " Because the Earth 's magnetic field is so weak , many people found it difficult to understand how it could affect bird or animal sense organs in a way that would help them to navigate .
" Our experiments with a model chemical system prove it is possible for molecules to detect weak fields and to respond to their directions .
Birds may use similar chemical reactions in their retinas , where photochemical reactions could lead to nerve signals which help them to orientate . "
Scientists have shown that animals can use a variety of cues to help them migrate long distances and return to the same breeding or feeding grounds .
These include visual landmarks , the position of the Sun in the day or the stars at night , and even the smell of specific locations en route .
But over the past few decades , scientists have found that animals ranging from birds and mammals to sea turtles and even insects can use the Earth 's magnetic field either as a compass to orientate themselves in a particular direction , or as a map to help them determine their location .
One suggestion is that animals do this by using an iron - containing molecule called magnetite which orientates according to the north - south direction of the Earth 's magnetic field , in much the same way that a compass needle always points to magnetic north .
But Professor
Hore and the co-leader of his Oxford research team , Christiane Timmel , have come up with another possible mechanism , which they explain in an experimental study published in the journal Nature .
Instead of magnetite , the scientists suggest that birds might be able to use photo - sensitive molecules which can be turned into one of two different chemical states depending on the direction of a magnetic field as weak as that of the Earth's .

The chemical the scientists used in their study is not the one that would be used by birds , but Professor Hore said that similar molecules with the same properties are known to exist in the retina of a bird 's eye .
" It 's one source of orientation information they could use .
It could not be used at night , but birds may use it at dusk to orientate themselves and set themselves up for night - time migration , " he said .
" Over millions of years , birds and other animals have evolved exquisitely sensitive chemical compasses which we are only beginning to understand .
Our work outlines the principles behind such a compass . "

How much would it cost to convert the entire U.S. fleet of passenger cars , which collectively burn 40 percent of the oil that we use , to electric cars ?
Let ’s look at some numbers :
total oil consumption in the U.S. : 21 million barrels every day ( CIA Factbook )
cost per barrel : $ 130
days in year : 365
total spent per year : $ 1 trillion
percentage of oil consumed by passenger cars : 40 ( source )
total spent per year on oil for passenger cars : $ 400 billion [ refining into gasoline , distributing , and retailing add even more to this ; looking at the 138 billion gallons the U.S. consumed in 2006 , at $ 4 per gallon this is about $ 552 billion every year ( subtract perhaps 5 percent for gasoline used by non-diesel trucks ; add 1 percent for oil used by diesel - powered cars ) ]
at 5 percent interest , how much we could we borrow and pay $ 400 billion every year in interest : $ 8 trillion [ current 10 - year T - bill yields enable government to borrow at 3.84 percent ]
number of registered cars in the U.S. : 250 million ( Wikipedia )
cost of a new electric car , if mass - produced : $ 20,000
value of a used car , if exported to Latin America or China : $ 5,000
cost to upgrade average existing American car to a brand - new electric car : $ 15,000
number that could be converted for $ 8 trillion : more than 500 million cars ( i.e. , twice as many as we have now )
percentage of electricity in the U.S. currently being generated from burning oil : about 1 percent ( the rest is coal , natural gas , nuclear , hydro , wind )
Instead of sending $ 400 billion each year to countries such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela , we could spend it on electric car production in the U.S. , Mexico , and China .
At current oil prices , it would n’t cost us a dime extra to stop importing and burning oil for passenger cars .
In fact , if the goal were to end up with the same number of cars on the road , we would have a few trillion dollars left over .
One or two trillion dollars would be sufficient to build nuclear , solar , or wind electric power plants to replace all of our plants that currently burn coal and oil ( note that less than 1 percent of current electricity generation in the U.S. is from oil ( source ) ; most electricity that we use today is from coal , natural gas , or nuclear ) .
So … simply by stopping our purchases of oil we could finance the construction of power plants that emit no CO2 and electric cars that emit no CO2 .
[ Many folks quickly commented that I did not figure in the cost of electricity to run the electric cars .
I thought that it was common knowledge that electric cars cost very little to run , even at today ’s high electricity rates , somewhere between 1 and 4 cents per mile .
The gas engine in a car is much less efficient than the generator in a power plant , about 20 percent for the car versus 40 - 60 percent for fossil fuel plants and 80 percent for hydroelectric .
The electric motors in an electric car are often quoted as roughly 90 percent efficient .
The U.S. has a near - infinite supply of coal for generating electricity and plenty of existing surplus electric generating capacity in the evening hours ( see wikipedia ) .
As noted above , oil is so expensive now that we could use the leftover trillions of dollars to build solar , nuclear , or wind - powered generating plants .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car offers some numbers for electric car running costs .
Periodically replacing the batteries in electric cars costs more than buying the electricity to run them .
Of course , nobody has ever seen what would happen to battery costs and reliability if there were a multi-trillion market for batteries . ]
[ Some other folks noted that it might be tough to borrow between $ 4 and $ 8 trillion to finance this conversion .
To that I would say that the Three Trillion Dollar War authors claim that the U.S. government has borrowed $ 2 trillion for our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Perhaps our creditors would be even happier to lend if it were for something that might pay some dividends . ]
[ Others have objected that selling our old cars to Latin America or China is not environmentally correct and would not cut down on CO2 emissions .
That ’s mostly true but remember that this posting was not about cutting CO2 emissions .
It was about using the money that we currently spend on oil to pay interest on a loan big enough to replace all of our passenger cars with electric .
Why not convert existing cars ?
A 7000 lb. SUV is not that amenable to electric power .
If we leave the 7000 lb. SUV on the road , piloted by a fearless teenager , it becomes a serious hazard to anyone in a 2000 lb. electric car .
Exporting the old cars and driving electric cars still saves quite a bit of CO2 .
Folks in developing countries are going to buy more cars , whether or not we sell them , and they will probably make more efficient use of any cars they have ( a 7 - seat SUV in the U.S. is occupied by one person ; a 7 - seat SUV in Peru would be occupied by 10 people ) .
Folks in the U.S. are going to buy newer cars , whether or not they are gas or electric .
The entire U.S. fleet of cars will be replaced within 10 years .
Currently we are on track to replace our gas guzzling fleet with a newer shinier gas guzzling fleet .
I ’m not sure that qualifies as progress . ]
Brain's ' trust machinery ' identified
The brain centers triggered by a betrayal of trust have been identified by researchers , who found they could suppress such triggering and maintain trust by administering the brain chemical oxytocin .
The researchers said their findings not only offer basic insights into the neural machinery underlying trust ; the results may also help in understanding the neural basis of social disorders such as phobias and autism .
Thomas Baumgartner and colleagues published their findings in the May 22 , 2008 , issue of the journal Neuron , published by Cell Press .
In their experiments , the researchers asked volunteer subjects to play two types of games — a trust game and a risk game .
In the trust game , subjects were asked to contribute money , with the understanding that a human trustee would invest the money and decide whether to return the profits , or betray the subjects ’ trust and keep all the money .
In the risk game , the subjects were told that a computer would randomly decide whether their money would be repaid or not .
The subjects also received doses of either the brain chemical oxytocin ( OT ) or a placebo via nasal spray .
They chose OT because studies by other researchers had shown that OT specifically increases people ’s willingness to trust others .
During the games , the subjects ’ brains were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging .
This common analytical technique involves using harmless magnetic fields and radio waves to map blood flow in brain regions , which reflects brain activity .
The researchers found that — in the trust game , but not the risk game — OT reduced activity in two brain regions : the amygdala , which processes fear , danger and possibly risk of social betrayal ; and an area of the striatum , part of the circuitry that guides and adjusts future behavior based on reward feedback .
Baumgartner and colleagues concluded that their findings showed that oxytocin affected the subjects ’ responses specifically related to trust .
“ If subjects face the nonsocial risks in the risk game , OT does not affect their behavioral responses to the feedback .
Both subjects in the OT group and the placebo group do not change their willingness to take risks after the feedback .
In contrast , if subjects face social risks , such as in the trust game , those who received placebo respond to the feedback with a decrease in trusting behavior while subjects with OT demonstrate no change in their trusting behavior although they were informed that their interaction partners did not honor their trust in roughly 50 % of the cases . ”
The researchers also wrote that “ our insights into the neural circuitry of trust adaptation , and oxytocin ’s role in trust adaptation , may also contribute to a deeper understanding of mental disorders such as social phobia or autism that are associated with social deficits .
In particular , social phobia ( which is the third most common mental health disorder ) is characterized by persistent fear and avoidance of social interactions . ”
Rutgers University psychologist Mauricio Delgado , in a preview in the same issue of Neuron , wrote that the paper “ represents an ambitious and informative development in the literature , ” He commented that the study “ has significant implications for understanding mental disorders where deficits in social behavior are observed .
Betrayal aversion , for example , could serve as a precursor to social phobia , a disorder characterized by aversion to social interactions , with the reported oxytocin finding providing a bridge for potential clinical applications . ”
A Paris appeals court ruled in favor of a self - styled media watchdog accused of libel for claiming that French footage of the shooting death of a Palestinian boy was faked , his lawyer said .
In acquitting Philippe Karsenty , the court ruled that he had acted in good faith and '' exercised his free criticism against a power , that of the press , '' said his attorney , Patrick Maisonneuve .
The court confirmed the acquittal but said it would not explain its ruling before Thursday .
France 2 network 's images from Sept. 30 , 2000 , showed the death of Mohammed al - Dura , cowering terrified with his father amid furious gunfire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip .
On his Web site Media - Ratings , which casts a critical eye on the reliability of French mainstream media , Karsenty had claimed that the report was '' pure fiction . ''
The public broadcaster and its Israel correspondent , Charles Enderlin , filed a libel suit against Karsenty , and a Paris judge ruled in their favor in 2006 .
Karsenty appealed .
France 2 said Wednesday it would challenge the latest ruling .
In the network 's report , the father gestured frantically to try to stop the shooting as the boy screamed in
terror .
It then cut to a shot of the motionless boy slumped in his father 's lap .
The report asserted the gunfire came from nearby Israeli positions but the circumstances remain in dispute .
several independent investigations have determined Enderlin 's claim may have been erroneous .
The IDF , after completing a full military investigation into the incident , said it was '' quite plausible that the boy was hit by Palestinian bullets in the course of an exchange of fire . ''
A bill essentially legalizing Bushs warrantless surveillance program just sailed through the Democratic House and is expected to sail through the Democratic Senate .
It would expand wiretapping powers against foreign targets , extend the grace period of warrantless domestic eavesdropping on Americans at home , and grant retroactive immunity to telecom companies that cooperated in illegal domestic spying .
The New York Times calls it  the most significant revision of surveillance law in 30 years ,  but it is also just the latest example in 30 years of Democratic betrayals of the Fourth Amendment .
In 1978 , Democratic President Carter signed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act into law .
A meager response to Nixons surveillance of peaceful activists and other such abuses , FISA established a secret court within the Justice Department to issue special warrants for wiretapping foreign suspects .
Even when spying on a  United States person ,  intelligence officials now had 72 hours before they needed a warrant .
Carter said in his signing statement ,  This is a difficult balance to strike , but the act I am signing today strikes it .
The Fourth Amendment lost its teeth .
From 1979 to September 11 , 2001 , more than thirteen thousand FISA warrants were issued .
Not a single application was rejected .
But that wasnt enough for Bush .
He demanded the Patriot Act , which amended FISA to widely expand executive spying powers and weaken judicial review .
FISA had obstructed intelligence gathering before 9/11 , we were told .
( But the real problem was ineptitude for example , the FBI in the weeks before 9/11 had legitimate cause to search twentieth hijacker 
Zacarias Moussaouis computer , but FBI agents misunderstood the FISA process and blew the opportunity . )
Intimidated by the administration in October 2001 , the Democrats including all but one senatorvoted for the Patriot Act .
They gave the president what he said he needed , on top of the rubberstamping FISA process he already had , to protect America .
But that was still not enough for Bush .
In December 2005 , we learned that the president had secretly ordered the National Security Agency , a military intelligence organ of the Defense Department , to ignore FISA and wiretap calls within the United States .
Upon this revelation , Congressional Democrats complained they werent consulted about the program .
Bushs defenders responded he had this unilateral warrantless spying power as commander in chief ,  or due to Congresss post - 9/11 authorization of military force , or just because it was an inherent executive prerogative going back to George Washington .
In January 2007 , the Democrats retook the House and Senate with a mandate to curb Bushs domestic and foreign abuses in the War on Terror .
And now the Democratic leadership and almost half the Democrats in Congress have codified Bushs brazen , extrajudicial surveillance policy into law and given retroactive immunity to those companies that illegally cooperated with the NSA .
Missouri Republican Senator Christopher Bond , who led this legislative compromise ,  says ,  the White House got a better deal than even they had hoped to get . 
This Congress has outdone the last one in encouraging Bushs surveillance power grabs .
As Salon.com civil liberties expert Glenn Greenwald notes , in 2006 , when the Congress was controlled by [ Republicans ]
Bill Frist and Denny Hastert , the administration tried to get a bill passed legalizing warrantless eavesdropping and telecom amnesty , but was unable .
They had to wait until the Congress was controlled by [ Democrats ] Steny Hoyer , Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to accomplish that . 
Some Democrats dissent .
Wisconsins Russ Feingold , the lone senator to vote against the Patriot Act , calls the new bill a capitulation . 
Senator Barack Obama , in contrast , expresses superficial misgivings but assures us this compromise preserves substantial judicial oversight .
 Given the legitimate threats we face , providing effective intelligence collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay ,  the presidential candidate says , pledging that once in the White House he will carefully monitor the program . . . and work with the Congress to take any additional steps [ he deems ] necessary to protect the lives and the liberty of the American people . 
But that is nt enough for America .
The point of judicial oversight is we cant , and shouldnt have to , trust the executive branch .
FISA created too many loopholes in the Fourth Amendment .
The litany of unspeakable surveillance abuses under this and past administrations ( both Republican and Democratic ) and the executives tendency to defy even the flimsiest safeguards suggest that Americans serious about civil liberties should hold their representatives to a higher standard and bolder agenda : repeal this last monstrosity , scrap the Patriot Act , and give FISA itself the axe .
Americas founding generation had just lost twenty - five thousand men in a gruesome war against the British Empire when they crafted the Bill of Rights .
Despite their dangerous world , they saw no need for wartime exceptions to the Fourth Amendment .
And neither should we .

Canadian researcher launches science version of Google News .
A Canadian graduate student dissatisfied with science coverage on online sites such as Google News and Yahoo News has created a news aggregator especially for scientists .
Michael Imbeault , an HIV researcher at the Université Laval in Quebec , launched his fully automated site called e!
Science News ( http://esciencenews.com) last month .
It has already attracted 300,000 different users , and averages 5,000 visits a day , he says .
News aggregators display headlines and snippets from other media sources , but do n't produce their own content .
Of the top five online US news sites , three are aggregators — Google News , AOL News and Yahoo News — and only two — CNN.com and MSNBC.com — generate original content .
Yahoo and AOL use human editors and source almost all science stories from wire agencies , such as Reuters .
Google News uses computer algorithms to aggregate headlines from thousands of news sources , ranking them by how often and on which sites stories appear .
Science and technology coverage on Google News , for example , is notoriously devoid of basic science .

Imbeault 's site indexes science news sites , clusters similar articles together on the basis of the frequency of word co-occurrence , and then uses Bayesian statistics to automatically assign articles to topics such as astronomy , health and climate .
It then ranks them using factors such as timeliness , and the number of sites reporting the same news , which indicates the story 's importance .
At present , it is limited to around 40 news sources — including Nature News , The New York Times science section and institutional news sites such as NASA , which offer free content for at least a period — but this will be increased , he says .
Imbeault built the site on top of the Drupal open - source content management software .
He says that his aggregator will also be improved by moving to semantics - based techniques that better capture the meaning of a text .
It 's Tuesday morning and the streets of Bangalore are , as always , jammed with traffic and saturated with smog .
A young tech worker and his pregnant wife navigate the dusty roads on a tiny scooter , a 125 - cc Hero Honda .
Srinivasan Chandra 's hands sweat onto the handlebars as he waits for the light to turn green .
The journey from home to office is only 6 miles , but road conditions and rush hour have turned the four - lane highway into a cross between a parking lot and a demolition derby .
Still in her first trimester , his wife sits sidesaddle on the vinyl seat and adjusts her sari so it wo n't get caught in the wheel .
Srinivasan eyes the Yamaha alongside him and calculates his next move .
If he guns the throttle just before the light turns green , he might get a jump on the other guy and swerve around a nasty - looking pothole ahead to make the next light .
But if he 's too slow off the mark , or if the Yamaha does n't give ground , he might bottom out on the pothole .
" One mistake and we lose our baby to the road , " he says .

Too proud to ride a bus , too poor to buy a car , risking life and limb to keep moving forward — Srinivasan is the perfect reflection of modern India .
Yes , he 's enjoying the tech boom that is slowly boosting the country 's standard of living .
But the promise of middle - class comforts — or even a safe morning commute — remains a distant dream for him and most other people here .
For more , visit wired.com / video Promotional video from Tata Motors .
Now that dream may be closer to reality .
In January , at New Delhi's Auto Expo , Tata Motors introduced a bubble - shaped car called the Nano .
Integrating sleek curves , a roomy interior , and a small but powerful engine , the vehicle has a shockingly low price : less than $ 3,000 .
When the Nano arrives at dealerships in India late this year , it will be the cheapest car ever made , a four - seat family ride for the price of an upmarket laptop .
Middle - class household incomes in India start at roughly $ 6,000 a year , so a $ 3,000 car is the kind of innovation that could create millions of new drivers .
Eight million Indians currently own cars , according to the Mumbai - based credit - rating agency Crisil .
Another 18 million have the means to buy one .
However , the Nano could increase that pool of potential auto owners by as much as 65 percent , to 30 million , the organization reports .
" This goes beyond economics and class , " says Ravi Kant , managing director of Tata Motors .
" This crosses the urban - rural divide .
Now a car is within the reach of people who never imagined they would own a car .
It 's a triumph for our company .
And for India . "
India is just the beginning .
Tata Motors is the fifth - largest manufacturer of medium and heavy trucks in the world , boasting an international distribution network and $ 7.2 billion in revenue last year .
The global market for the Nano and similarly low - priced cars could be immense — the World Bank counts more than 800 million people who earn between $ 3,600 and $ 11,0000 annually .
In India , the new vehicle could change the taxi business overnight and energize a cadre of small - time entrepreneurs by providing new levels of mobility , carrying capacity , and social status .
At the same time , the prospect of a flood of additional cars terrifies city planners and environmentalists .
Metropolises throughout the developing world are expanding at breakneck speed .
In many places , the crumbling roads are already crammed beyond capacity .
Traffic fatalities are on the rise , and air pollution threatens to choke remaining pockets of green space .
Sure , a single Nano is a step toward independence , security , and social mobility — but to some observers , millions of Nanos spell apocalypse .
It takes almost an hour for Srinivasan to negotiate the traffic to his wife 's office .
By the time he arrives at the IT center where he manages a small team designing ads for mobile phones , his white shirt is gray with dust .
He shows his ID badge to the security guards and makes his way through a sea of cubicles to his desk .
He boots up his computer and taps an email to coworkers :
He wants to know how to join the waiting list to buy a Nano .
Girish
Wagh is a short , unassuming man , but the 500 people on his team give him a wide berth in the hallway of the Tata Motors factory in the western city of Pune .
The lead engineer on the Nano project , he 's not accustomed to talking to the press .
He clasps his hands nervously as he acknowledges that it wo n't be easy to convince potential customers that a car can be both ridiculously inexpensive and seriously solid .
Early reports erroneously said the body would be made of plastic .
" Can you believe it ? " he says .
" At the expos , people actually began tapping on it to see if it was made of metal . "
I cross the word plastic off of my list of questions .
The Tata Group is the General Electric of India , a sprawling conglomerate with a commanding presence in media , telecom , outsourcing , retailing , and real estate .
Started in 1868 as a textile wholesaler , the company branched out into luxury hotels after , as legend has it , founder Jamsetji Tata was turned away from a posh establishment because of his skin color .
In 1945 , a few years before the British left India , Tata started producing locomotives and , eventually , autos .
In 1998 , Tata Motors introduced the country 's first indigenously designed car .
The homegrown Indica , which now sells for around $ 6,000 , became ubiquitous as a taxi .
Meanwhile , the Tata Group has been expanding globally .
It bought the tea company Tetley in 2000 and acquired Anglo - Dutch steel giant Corus last year .
It maintains Tata Consultancy Services offices in 54 countries and owns hotels in Boston , New York , and San Francisco .
In March , Tata Motors bought Jaguar and Land Rover .
Division head Ravi Kant says the company will start exporting Nanos " in the next few years , " possibly sooner if the car gets an enthusiastic reception domestically .
Where to ?
He 's not saying , but Africa , South America , and Europe are probably on the short list .
Ratan Tata , the company 's chair and the great - grandson of Jamsetji , got the idea for the Nano when he was — what else — sitting in traffic .
One morning a few years ago , he was battling Mumbai 's gridlock when he noticed a single scooter carrying an entire family .
Suddenly it struck him :
The poor driver and his passengers represented not just a vast social need but an immense market opportunity .
The success of the Indica gave him the confidence to try to tap it .
The Nano wholesales for 1 lakh , or 100,000 rupees ( roughly $ 2,500 plus taxes and shipping , which dealers are expected to mark up to around $ 3,000 ) .
The number carries a symbolic weight as the minimum amount for a major life purchase , and that 's the price Ratan envisioned when he set out to build the world 's most affordable automobile .
India 's next - cheapest car , the bare - bones Suzuki Maruti 800 , is twice the price at 2.1 lakh .
Even India 's iconic auto - rickshaw , a three - wheeled death trap made of metal and canvas , costs roughly 1 lakh .
When it comes to keeping the price down , Tata Motors starts with major advantages .
Labor , raw materials , facilities — all cost far less in India than in Detroit .
And it does n't hurt to be part of the country 's most powerful industrial combine .
Tata Steel 's plant is just a couple of hundred miles from Tata Motors '
West Bengal manufacturing plant — a proximity that further cuts costs .
But Wagh says the supply chain is only part of the equation .
His team scrutinized every detail with expense in mind .
They quickly dispensed with AC , radio , and passenger - side mirror .
" We calculated every bolt fitting and sheet metal casing , " he says .
" We had multiple variations for every aspect of the car and calculated them against the price . "
While every automaker factors cost into the equation , overruns are common .
For Tata , intent on hitting the 1 lakh price point , overruns were n't an option .
A major factor was weight .
The final design stands at 1,322 pounds , 528 pounds lighter than the flyweight Honda Insight .
To power it , the engineers settled on a 33 - horsepower , 623 - cc , two - cylinder engine housed in the rear ; to service it , the mechanic must remove a set of bolts in the 5.4 - cubic - foot trunk .
The payoff : an uncommonly efficient 47 miles per gallon running at top speed ( 65 mph ) .
But that does n't mean Nano owners wo n't spend a lot of time pumping gas — the minuscule tank holds just 3.9 gallons .
Wagh 's team is also examining the way cars get to dealers .
One plan is to export Nanos as kits that snap together like Legos , a strategy that might save money by multiplying the number of vehicles that fit into a shipping container .
Cars would then be assembled and spot - welded on arrival .
Wagh tries to convince me that local workshops can put together Nanos without sacrificing quality , but when I continue to ask questions , he gives up .
" Perhaps it 's time we see the car , " he says .
The Engineering Research Centre is a megawarehouse that holds most of Tata Motors ' test equipment .
The building is off - limits to outsiders ; employees are forbidden to talk about what happens inside , even to one another .
Wagh leads me down a wide corridor past the Thermocube , a car - sized chamber that replicates the extremes of India 's climate .
Then he pushes open the door to a garage containing a small white vehicle , the same prototype displayed at the auto show in Delhi .
It looks like a cross between a Smart car and George Jetson 's rocket pod .
Wagh tells me it's about to take a spin on the Buzz , Squeal , and Rattle Machine , a device that simulates India 's pothole - riddled byways by pounding the wheels with hydraulic pistons .
" Too long on the Buzz , Squeal , and Rattle and a poorly constructed car will fall to pieces , " he says .
This one looks as though it has already been through a few rounds of testing .
The rearview mirror rests on the dashboard .
Sections of the interior have been dissected and hastily reassembled .
The engineers wo n't let me take it for a test run , but I 'm allowed to settle into the driver 's seat .
The pedals feel good under my feet , and I imagine working them as I dodge Pune traffic .
Since the engine is tucked next to the rear axle , I can comfortably fit my 6 ' 2 " frame behind the controls .
That 's unusual for any Indian car , let alone a cheap one .
And that 's when it hits me .
I had expected something like a matchbox with a motor .
But this is a real vehicle .
More than that , it 's a cool machine .
My reaction is visceral : I want one .
And that 's precisely the response the Tata Group is counting on .
The Nano is the kind of product that transforms a company from a massive global conglomerate into a massively cool global conglomerate .
The company wo n't give me an estimate of demand for Nanos , but analysts agree that it will be huge .
The credit - rating firm Crisil reckons that the vehicle could single - handedly boost total Indian car sales by 20 percent ( up from 1.2 million between early 2007 and early 2008 ) if Tata can keep up with demand .
But that 's not likely ; the factory in West Bengal can produce only 250,000 units in the first year .
( Ford turns out 173,000 budget - priced Focuses annually in the US . )
Ratan Tata recently acknowledged the possibility of shortfalls but said that the company would consider outsourcing its manufacturing to meet demand .
Either way , Tata 's baby signals a new era in automotive history .
From the backseat of a beat - up Indica , this street in downtown Bangalore does n't look four lanes wide .
Fruit stalls , parked vehicles , and scrap from construction sites crowd it into a single convoluted passage .
My taxi driver weaves through an endless stream of motorcycles , scooters , auto - rickshaws , and oxcarts .
On the side of the road , a small boy wearing a blue school shirt and supersize Lion King backpack squints at the traffic , looking for his chance to break across .
He takes three quick steps forward before he sees my taxi , jumping back just as the driver swerves into oncoming traffic .
I turn around and see that he 's unfazed , waiting for his next opportunity to cross .
The problem is n't just the sheer number of vehicles but the fact that India 's roads make no provision for people on foot .
Everyone shares the same narrow strip of concrete — with lethal consequences .
In 2004 , there were 92,618 traffic fatalities in India , a mortality rate of 14 per 10,000 vehicles .
In developed countries , the rate hovers around 2 per 10,000 vehicles .
Pedestrians account for the largest number of deaths , while drivers of two - wheelers rank second .
The numbers drop for people in cars , though autos and trucks are involved in roughly 80 percent of accidents .
In other words , you 're safer in a car but also far more dangerous to others .
And the number of cars is only going to rise as owners of two - wheelers upgrade .
Sales of two - wheelers dropped nearly 9 percent between 2007 and 2008 , while auto sales climbed more than 10 percent .
Experts estimate that congestion costs Bangaloreans $ 1.8 billion a year in fuel and vehicle maintenance alone , and the roadways are already packed .
Gridlock is n't the worst problem — air quality is bound to take a precipitous dive .
" The car itself is fuel efficient , but the city is already at emergency levels in terms of air and noise pollution , " says Leo Saldanha , director of the Bangalore - based Environmental Support Group .
The Nano is designed to be clean .
Its engine releases about 193 grams of carbon per mile , on a par with European requirements .
But low emissions is not the same as no emissions .
The state pollution control board rang alarm bells in 2006 , when it detected dangerous levels of sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxide , and other nasty chemicals in the air .
Clouds of suspended particles found their way into hospital wards .
And while a thick haze from vehicle exhaust and improperly regulated industry hangs over Bangalore , climatologists are more worried about the dark smudge that hovers a couple of miles above most of the region .
Called the Asian Brown Cloud , it comprises the combined airborne detritus of the continent 's developing economies .
Adding more vehicles wo n't help .
" In the 20th century , America learned that cars offer huge advantages for moving people around , " says Nancy Kete , director of Embarq , an urban transport think tank .
" But those benefits came with costs in terms of congestion , pollution , and road accidents because of poor planning .
In the 21st century , we know what the problems are .
India does n't need to repeat the mistakes of the past . "
The question is how to avoid them .
India 's haphazard route to development has left gaping holes in environmental and urban policies , and the number of cars on the road has increased steadily over the past decade .
Its cities are traffic - jammed , exhaust - choked nightmares even without the Nano .
But that growth puts the Nano at the heart of an emerging debate .
Should India embrace a future where every man , woman , and child owns a carbon - spewing , space - hogging , four - wheeled vehicle ?
Or should cities focus their efforts on public transportation systems that reserve private ownership as a luxury ?
Some experts believe the country can handle more cars .
" The problem is n't traffic , " says Ashwin Mahesh , a tech guru and former NASA climatologist who now lives in Bangalore .
" It 's that no one knows how to manage all the cars . "
His company , Mapunity , is located on a campus of the prestigious Indian Institute of Management — a sort of Harvard Business School for the South Asian crowd .
The lobby of his building is packed with students in sharp black business suits , but Mahesh shows up in shorts and a T - shirt .
It 's an outfit that screams geek bravado .
Mahesh cofounded Mapunity in December 2006 to devise solutions to urban traffic .
Recently , his company partnered with India 's largest cell phone network , Bharti Airtel , to gain access to records of every transaction on its system .
Cell phones constantly relay data to local towers even when they 're not in use , so Mapunity can track the location of as many as 3 million Bangaloreans in real time , giving the company a minute - by- minute snapshot of the city 's traffic .
When too many people crowd a given intersection , a red dot shows up on a map posted on the company 's Web site .
In his office , Mahesh taps on the screen in front of him , displaying the route from my hotel to his office .
It 's a string of red dots , bumper to bumper .
One block west , though , the streets are empty .
" If we planned the traffic flow a little better , we could use the excess capacity on the empty road to free up the one that 's clogged , " he says .
His point is simple :
The congestion on Bangalore 's streets is n't necessarily the result of too many cars but of a failure to manage that traffic properly .
Still , capacity will eventually become an issue .
And Mapunity 's efforts do nothing about pollution or carbon emissions .
For that , you can hope for either technological revolution in zero-emission cars or a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road .
But how do you deny a safer , more comfortable ride to 30 million upwardly mobile Indians like Srinivasan Chandra , ferrying his pregnant wife on a Hero Honda scooter ?
Some urban planners dream of a Bangalore where congestion taxes and state - of - the - art public transit systems discourage people from using their cars .
It 's the kind of vision that looks better on a think - tank drawing board than on the ground .
For one thing , building better bus routes and bike lanes would require large - scale government intervention , and the Indian government moves glacially .
As a legacy of the British colonial system , generalist administrators rotate through different departments during their career .
They 're expert managers , but they rarely have the knowledge to tackle specialized problems .
In Bangalore and throughout the surrounding state of Karnataka , the person in charge of managing traffic is Gaurav Gupta , commissioner of urban land transport .
He apologizes for arriving at our meeting two hours late .
Traffic , he says .
His department 's offices are disquietingly empty , with a few pieces of cheap furniture and only one computer .
The man working on it does n't seem to know how to touch - type .
The city has a transportation plan , Gupta tells me , but progress has been slow and piecemeal .
" Indian cities are just not designed for motorized transport , " he says .
He lists several proposed improvements : an aboveground rail corridor , new bus routes , and parking lots .
His voice trails off .
He sounds like he does n't believe in his own plan .
As for the Nano , he 's philosophical .
" When the printing press came to Europe and everyone could suddenly buy a Bible , people in the church thought it would be the end of religion .
They were wrong .
This is just like the Nano .
It will make cars affordable to many more people , and critics are scared .
But we will adjust .
That is the way it has always been . "
Back at Tata Motors , the mood is jubilant as the top brass anticipates the Nano 's launch .
Stretching out in a leather chair in his office , Ravi Kant rubs his hands on the knees of his pin-striped suit .
" A lot of people blame the carmakers for pollution and congestion , " he says .
" But the truth is that if the environmentalists ' worst fears were realized and people bought a couple of million Nanos to replace their outdated cars and motorcycles , there would be less pollution . "
He has a point .
Other Indian vehicles lack catalytic converters and belch the full spectrum of auto exhaust , mostly as a function of age and engine size .
If the vehicles currently on the road were replaced by Nanos , air quality might well improve .
Nanos will certainly replace some scooters , but they 'll also dramatically increase the number of vehicles on the road overall .
People who never dreamed they could own a car will start saving their pennies , up - and - comers who would have bought one will buy two , and entrepreneurs will invest in fleets .
Now that Tata Motors has shown the way , competitors are scrambling to offer their own budget vehicles .
Hyundai has announced a $ 3,700 car .
Renault - Nissan has teamed with Indian motorcycle maker Bajaj to put 400,000 of its own ultra - low - cost cars on the road by 2011 .
General Motors is rumored to be working on a Nano - killer with China 's Wuling Automotive .
A decade hence , millions of ultra -low - cost vehicles will crowd narrow alleyways throughout the world .
Thus , what happens in Bangalore will presage changes to come in Lagos , Rio de Janeiro , and Budapest .
The Asian Brown Cloud will likely obscure an ever greater region of the sky .
The story of the Trojan Horse , whether true or mythical , profoundly influenced Western civilization and inspired many artists .
Giovanni Tiepolo painted The Procession of the Trojan Horse into Troy in 1760 .
Courtesy National Gallery , London __1184 B.C. : __During the Trojan War , the Greeks depart in ships , leaving behind a large wooden horse as a victory offering .
It is hauled inside the walls of Troy , and Greek soldiers descend from the horse 's belly after dark to slay the guards and commence destruction of the city .
Whether this actually happened , and whether the traditional date given is true , archeological evidence has established that a Trojan War did occur in Asia Minor around 1200 B.C.
You can debate how much of the accounts in Homer 's Iliad , Virgil 's Aeneid and elsewhere is legend .
But it is in no way mere legend .
The war and its lore are a firm part of Western culture and have enriched our language .
The war began when a prince of Troy eloped with the king of Sparta 's wife , Helen .
Christopher Marlowe called her " the face that launch'd a thousand ships . "
( Three millenniums after the Trojan War , scientist and science - fiction author Isaac Asimov defined the milliHelen as the amount of feminine beauty sufficient to launch one ship .
Generations of snickering male college students would rate women in various hundreds of milliHelens . )
Cassandra was a Trojan prophet who warned against accepting the gift .
Today , her name means a person whose warnings are ignored .
Another skeptic was Laocoon , who Virgil says first uttered , " Beware of Greeks bearing gifts . "
Then , of course , there 's the name Trojan horse for software that seems to perform one action but actually performs another , usually with malicious intentions .
So , what cybersecurity lessons might we learn today from the first Trojan Horse ?
Persistence : The Greeks had besieged Troy for 10 years without result .
Epistemology :
Things are not always what they seem to be .
Virgil , updated : Beware of strangers bearing gifts .
Social engineering :
The horse flattered the Trojans , who loved horses and were delighted with the gift .
Engineering :
The horse was on wheels , designed to make it easy for the Trojans to pull it inside their defenses .
Ignoring warning messages : Cassandra and Laocoon were both disregarded .
Delay : The Trojan Horse did not do its damage immediately , but waited for the opportune moment .
Size :
It only took a handful of Greeks to unleash a lot of damage .
Negating security from inside :
They killed the guards and opened the gates from within , rendering Troy 's strong walls useless .
The Greek ships had come ashore again , and their army poured in .
Scope of damage : Troy was burnt and destroyed .
Permanent effects :
Troy lost the war .
You , of course , could only lose your data , your hard drive , your thesis , your job , your money , your business , your identity or some awful combination of these .

April 24 , 1967 : Last Day in the Life of Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov
Illustration by Kevin Kallaugher
ON MAY 25th a dysfunctional minor party picked a grumpy ex-Republican as its presidential candidate .
This may be just another quirk in the quirky history of the Libertarian Party .
But it just might be something more than this : a further sign that the Republican coalition is splintering under John McCain 's feet .
The new Libertarian champion , Bob Barr , a former four - term Georgia congressman , is most famous for his poor judgment and sour temper .
He led the fight to defang anti-terrorism legislation after the Oklahoma City bombing ( among his achievements : preventing the government from designating foreign groups as terrorists and denying their members visas to enter the country ) .
He championed social - conservative causes such as the Defence of Marriage Act , which he drafted , and the impeachment of Bill Clinton .
His moralistic fervour faltered only when it came to his own conduct : twice divorced , he was once photographed licking whipped cream off the breasts of a particularly buxom woman .
He says he was raising money for leukaemia research .
( Well , he would , would n't he ? )
The Libertarian Party is one of the perennial jokes of American politics .
Barry Goldwater , a party hero , once argued that “ extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice ” .
Many Libertarians have interpreted that as meaning that extremism in defence of liberty is a positive virtue : one of the liveliest debates in the party is whether all drugs should be legalised , and all federal taxes abolished , next Monday or next Tuesday .
The party 's best presidential performance was back in 1980 when Edward Clark won 921,128 votes , or 1.1 % of the electorate .
Most Libertarian candidates have hovered around just 400,000 votes .
The party is also badly divided between what might be called its Ruby Ridge wing and its Reefer Madness wing .
The Ruby Ridge wing , which has still not recovered from the terrible day when the FBI shot several survivalists at Ruby Ridge in Idaho , believes that freedom comes from the barrel of a gun .
The Reefer Madness wing is more interested in keeping the government 's hands off its spliffs .
Mr Barr 's candidacy is not likely to heal this division .
The Georgian has a solid record on guns — he once accidentally discharged an antique pistol at a gun show — but he is much dodgier on other Libertarian shibboleths .
He joined the party in 2006 only after being redistricted out of his congressional nest .
He once supported both the Patriot Act and the “ war on drugs ” , though he is now repentant .
He won the party 's nomination only after six ballots and five hours of voting .
Yet the Republicans would be unwise to write him off as irrelevant : instead , they would do well to consider the reasons for the enduring success of Ron Paul , a Republican who shares many of the Libertarians ' views .
His presidential campaign has been one of the wonders of this election cycle , powered by hyper - motivated supporters and an endless supply of small donations .
Mr Paul won 24 % of the Republican vote in the recent Idaho primary , despite the fact that Mr McCain has the nomination locked up .
His book , “ The Revolution : A Manifesto ” , leapt to the top of the New York Times 's bestseller list .
The libertarian pool also contains more fish than you might think .
Polls suggest that 10 - 20 % of the electorate are willing to define themselves as “ libertarians ” in the sense that , like this newspaper , they are “ conservative ” on economics and “ liberal ” on social issues .
These soft libertarians have been strikingly willing to break party ranks , whether to support John Anderson in 1980 or Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996 .
Libertarian - leaning Republicans are also hog - wrestling mad about what has become of their party under George Bush .
Mr Bush has presided over the fastest growth in federal spending since the Great Society in the 1960s .
He put the Republican seal of approval on the biggest intrusion of federal power into the classroom in history ( No Child Left Behind ) , the most expensive public - works programme ever ( the 2005 highway bill ) and the largest new entitlement programme since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid ( the prescription - drug benefit ) .
He launched an open - ended “ war on terror ” .
He rode roughshod over states ' rights on issues such as assisted suicide .
And he has expanded the government 's power to eavesdrop on its citizens .
Spot the difference
Mr McCain is not Mr Bush .
He has an honourable record as a fiscal conservative ( he opposed the prescription - drug benefit , for example ) .
He is Washington 's leading campaigner against pork .
He is a principled federalist on issues like gay marriage .
But there is plenty in his record to upset small - government conservatives .
He likes to think of himself as a latter - day Teddy Roosevelt blowing the trumpet of “ national greatness conservatism ” .
He broke the conservative covenant by supporting campaign - finance reform .
His defence of the Iraq war may also cost him votes from small - government conservatives .
Mr Barr and the Libertarian Party , as well as Mr Paul , are both imperfect vehicles for all this pent - up anger .
But they are vehicles nonetheless .
Libertarians claim that they will put their candidate on the ballot in 48 states , as they did in 2004 .
They have already managed 28 .
Mr Barr claims that ( admittedly sparse ) polls give him 6 - 8 % of the electorate .
He could do particularly well in his native Georgia and the libertarian - leaning West .
That could hurt Mr McCain badly in states like Colorado and Nevada , which he needs to hold on to .
The fact that Mr Barr 's running mate , Wayne Allyn Root , is the author of a self - help book entitled “ The Joy of Failure ! ” takes some of the air out of this speculation .
But it would be wrong to underestimate how angry many small - government Republicans are with Mr Bush .
Ronald Reagan once remarked that he did not leave the Democratic Party : the Democratic Party left him .
That is what many libertarian sorts now feel about the Republicans .

Oil executives were summoned to Washington , D.C to testify before Congress , and the Congressional weenies wanted the oil company weenies to somehow magically make the price of oil go down by , I assume , calling someone on their cell phones and saying " Drop the price of oil ! "
Part of the questioning by the Congressional weenies involved the enormous sums these oil weenies were making , which was posited as being excessive , and which was immediately proved when not one of them was smart enough to know why oil costs so much in dollars !
Hahaha !
Morons !
This is the Big , Big Reason ( BBR ) that I am now looking for a cushy job as an oil company CEO , because I would make a lot of money for doing practically nothing and apparently knowing even less .
It 's perfect for me !
And furthermore , if I had been there at this little inquisition , I could have grabbed the microphone and said , " I 'll gladly answer that question , Senator !
The reason that oil costs so much in dollars is that the purchasing power of the dollar has dropped by 40 % in 5 lousy years , thanks to you letting the Federal Reserve create so much damned money , you lowlife scumbag !
If the dollar still had its buying power , oil would still be $ 25 a barrel like it was in 2002 , but nooOOoooo !
You dumb , stupid , ignorant Congressional morons decided to borrow and then spend so insanely much money that the Federal Reserve was required ( and only too happy ! ) to create all the money and credit needed to finance the disgusting orgy of your irresponsible government spending , now totaling $ 9.4 trillion in national debt , because if the Fed did not create the money , your enormous borrowing needs would have sucked up every freaking dime of savings in the country a dozen times over , driving interest rates through the roof , called the ' squeezing out effect ' .
That 's why oil costs so much , you ignorant , preening Congressional moron ! "
My rude and insulting approach differs from that of Chris Mayer , writing at Agora Financial 's 5 - Minute Forecast , who calmly explains , " Since January 2001 , you can explain the move in the price of oil largely as a function of increasing money supply .
As the amount of money grows , the price of oil rises .
In fact , almost 87 % of the move in the price of oil can be explained by the increase in money supply . "
Apparently , this kind of stupidity is rampant all the way through the federal government , as evidenced by Junior Mogambo Ranger ( JMR ) Rob H. reporting that he has looked at the Department of Defense 's new " official " guidance for inflation indices to use for all submitted cost estimates and budget requests , and found " the one - liner " that made him laugh : " 1.034 % inflation per year " for the next 30 years !
Hahaha !
One percent inflation for the next third of a century , when the MZM money supply is increasing at almost 20 % a year right now !
And destined to go up from here !
Hahaha !
Wiping a tear of laughter from my eye , I note that the dollar has lost 40 % of its value in the last five years , inflation in food and energy are running at greater than to 20 % a year , and yet Congress wants to know why oil costs so much and the DOD forecasts inflation at less than one - third of one lousy percent per year !
Hahaha !
Peter Schiff of Euro Pacific Capital says inflation will be a " big problem for us is if the Chinese substantially allow their currency to rise " , which he figures could increase at least fivefold against the dollar over the span of a year or two . "
The advantage to the Chinese is " That [ it ] reduces the price of oil by 80 percent for 1.3 billion Chinese .
Consumption would go through the roof , and that will drive prices through the roof for us . "
And he thinks the dollar will down , not only against the Chinese yuan ( CNY ) , but against all other currencies , and by a lot , too !
He says , " At a minimum , the dollar will lose another 40 to 50 percent of its value .
I 'm confident that by next year we 'll see more aggressive movements to abandon the dollar by the [ Persian ]
Gulf region and by the Asian bloc .
That 's where the stuff really hits the fan . "
And by stuff you know what he means , and if you know what that kind of loss of buying power of the dollar means , then you know why he refers to it as " stuff " !

Scientists discover why plague is so lethal
Bacteria that cause the bubonic plague may be more virulent than their close relatives because of a single genetic mutation , according to research published in the May issue of the journal Microbiology .
“ The plague bacterium Yersinia pestis needs calcium in order to grow at body temperature .
When there is no calcium available , it produces a large amount of an amino acid called aspartic acid , ” said Professor Brubaker from the University of Chicago , USA .
“ We found that this is because Y. pestis is missing an important enzyme . ”
Bubonic plague has killed over 200 million people during the course of history and is thus the most devastating acute infectious disease known to man .
Despite this , we are still uncertain about the molecular basis of its extraordinary virulence .
“ Y. pestis evolved from its ancestor Y. pseudotuberculosis within the last 20,000 years , suggesting its high lethality reflects only a few genetic changes .
We discovered that a single mutation in the genome of Y. pestis means the enzyme aspartase is not produced , ” said Professor Brubaker .
Aspartase is present in almost all bacteria but it is curiously absent in many pathogenic types .
These include mycobacteria that are pathogenic to man , Francisella tularensis and rickettsiae ( both of which cause diseases transmitted to humans via insects ) .
“ This suggests that the absence of aspartase may contribute to serious disease , ” said Professor Brubaker .
Aspartase digests aspartic acid .
Because Y. pestis does n’t have the enzyme , it produces much more aspartic acid than is required by the person infected .
This may cause an imbalance to the host amino acid pools .
“ If this is the case then we might be able to reduce the death rates of these diseases by developing a treatment that removes some of the extra aspartic acid , ” said Professor Brubaker .
Mercury news is reporting Administration calls for giving Fed more powers .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson says the government must move quickly to give the Federal Reserve more powers to regulate the financial system .
Paulson said today that the central bank 's powers should be expanded in the wake of the near collapse earlier this year of Bear Stearns , the giant Wall Street investment firm .
He said there was a need to consider quickly how to give the Fed the power it needs to obtain information from investment banks and the responsibility to intervene to protect the overall financial system .
His comments were provided by the Treasury Department as excerpts from a speech he was to give later in the day .
Fed At Fault
Uncertainty Principle Corollary Number Two :
The government / quasi - government body most responsible for creating this mess ( the Fed ) , will attempt a big power grab , purportedly to fix whatever problems it creates .
The bigger the mess it creates , the more power it will attempt to grab .
Over time this leads to dangerously concentrated power into the hands of those who have already proven they do not know what they are doing .
Fed Is Cooking The Books
Flip through the footnotes to the Fed 's latest annual report , and you 'll come across an open secret .
The Fed does n't follow normal accounting rules , as promulgated by any of the major standard - setting boards .
Rather , the Fed writes its own , in a document called the Financial Accounting Manual for Federal Reserve Banks .
If you ever wanted to design an accounting regime to help a bank cook its books , the Fed 's would be perfect .
This does n't exactly inspire faith in the U.S. financial system , at a time when a good example might help a lot .
Imagine if there were no rules specifying when a bank must bring an Enron - style special - purpose entity onto its own balance sheet .
The Fed 's accounting manual has none .
Now picture an accounting system where a bank never had to recognize losses on any securities it holds , as long as it continues holding them .
That , too , is the Fed 's policy .
JPMorgan Chase & Co. , which completed its purchase of Bear Stearns this month , will lend the Delaware entity $ 1 billion and absorb the first $ 1 billion of any losses .
The Fed is on the hook for the rest .
The central bank has hired an outside company , BlackRock Inc. , to manage the sale of the assets over the next 10 years .
The proceeds will go back to the Fed and then , if anything is left over , to JPMorgan after the Fed is paid .
If the Fed were a normal bank , it probably would have to put the Delaware special - purpose entity 's assets and liabilities on its own balance sheet , under the Financial Accounting Standards Board 's rules .
The reason is that the Fed will bear most of the risk of losses .
Under the Fed 's 161 - page accounting manual , however , there 's no such requirement .
That 's because the manual does n't have any rules on the subject .
The Fed has n't said yet what it will do .

Last Updated : Thursday , 5 February , 2004 , 11:28 GMT E-mail this to a friend Printable version Has swearing lost its power to outrage ?
By Brian Wheeler and Jonathan Duffy
BBC News Online Magazine
The first time John Lydon turned the air blue on prime time television , one viewer was so outraged he kicked his TV set in .
It was 1976 , and the young punk , smirking like a guilty schoolboy , made his barely audible swearing debut as Sex Pistols bandmate Steve Jones , was goaded into uttering a stream of obscenities by ITV teatime presenter Bill Grundy .
The incident effectively ended Grundy 's career .
The tabloids went into a frenzy , with headlines such as " The Filth and the Fury " .
For a brief moment , it seemed as if civilization itself was under threat .
Nearly three decades later Lydon was at it again .
This time he went one step better - or worse depending on your point of view - spitting out both the f-word and the c-word on jungle game show I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here ! , with no provocation .
This time , however , there were only 100 complaints from viewers .
The former punk icon has apparently quit the ITV show after being told to mind his language .
But the world has remained on its axis .
In the era of foul - mouthed " gangsta " rap and casual bad language in Hollywood films - has swearing lost its power to shock ?
Or has our attitude remained essentially the same ?
Jonathon Green , lexicographer of slang " There have been three stages of swearing in modern English .
From about 1500 , swearwords were simply euphemisms for blasphemy : oddsbodkins - God 's body , cor blimey - god blind me ; bloody - by our lady .
Today 's swear words were perfectly acceptable , apart from the c-word .
" From 1700 , blasphemy lost its potency , and as England became a world power , there was an effort to clean up the language .
So then words for parts of the body and what you do with them , such as defecation , became taboo .
You would n't find them in Dickens , for example .
" In the past 40 years , young people have become less concerned with the traditional swear words .
Now it 's racist , sexist , homophobic language - the sort my father 's generation would n't think twice about using - that are totally forbidden .
" The right to swear is a necessary human expostulation .
I 've no qualms about swearing , although I would tame my language depending on who I was speaking to . "
Comedian Boothby Graffoe " I did a piece about this for radio recently , on why EastEnders is meant to be so realistic and cutting edge .
They 're perfectly prepared to depict the grittiest rape scene , incest , racism , but no - one ever swears .
" Maybe that 's why they 're called soap operas - they 've had their mouths washed out .
You could watch someone get their head kicked , but if they said " f*** ing hell that hurt " , the audience would be up in arms .
" Having said that , swearing 's not a big part of my act .
It 's not an easy way to get a laugh .
They 're ugly words and you 've got to be certain you 're using them carefully .
" When I started out playing the working men 's clubs , the audience hated swearing in an act .
They'd be at the bar , swearing their heads off as they downed pints but I 'd hear gasps if I swore in the act .
Now , when I play a comedy club , they 're at the bar ordering glasses of white wine and could n't give a toss if someone 's filling their act with bad language .
You 'd really have to work at upsetting someone now . "
Miranda Suit , of the broadcasting standards campaign group Media March " Swearing has become endemic , and we would say that had happened since it was widely exposed in the media .
Certainly the f-word has become normalised .
" What I 'm talking about is maintaining standards , thinking about children , thinking about family life and that 's where I think we have fallen far short of what the Americans do .
It 's much easier to bring up a child in America and not be constantly assailed by offensive , unpleasant , downright obscene material .
In this country you can't easily bring up a child in that way .
" We do need swear words , they are a useful expression of anger , but they need to be used sparingly .
The only real swear word there is now is the c-word , and we do n't want that to become normalised .
If people have no swear words left , who knows - they might not be able to express their anger and might end up hitting someone . "
Roger Mellie , Viz 's ' man on the telly ' " A lot of people think Desmond Lynam [ it was actually theatre critic Kenneth Tynan ] who was the first person to say the f-word on television .
Well , I want to set the record straight .
It was me .
" It was the 60s .
I had my own show , Blue Roger .
It was groundbreaking stuff for kids ' telly .
But it was n't my idea to invite the elephant on .
I 'd booked the Dagenham Girl Pipers , but there was a misunderstanding over the dressing rooms .
" It can get very slippery on those studio floors , and I think Jumbo had been on the vindaloo the night before .
I still remember the look on the floor manager 's face when I trod in it .
Priceless .
You can't buy moments like that .
" Course it 's all different now .
You do n't get where I am in TV by turning the air blue .
You 've got to know where to draw the line .
It 's called being a professional .
What do you mean I 'm not getting paid for this ?
You fu ... " Comedian Bernard Manning
" Swearing is realistic .
We all do it when we lose our temper .
Even prime ministers .
Do you remember John Major calling his MPs a shower of bastards ?
" It 's definitely become more acceptable now .
Back then we had Mary Whitehouse and you could n't say boo to a goose .
" I can be funny without being blue but I 'd rather be blue .
The jokes are funnier and better .
Who wants to hear about a f****** chicken crossing the road or the diddy men ?
If you are working a CID do , with loads of big coppers , hard men who do a tough job , you cannot go on talking about jam butty mines .
" Mind you , my mother , who was 95 when she died , never heard me swear .
When I had just backed a loser I used to close the living room door so she could n't hear me . "
The Bishop of Fulham , the Right Reverend John Broadhurst " We live in a world where people swear as a matter of course .
I will even own up to doing it myself occasionally .
" But what makes me angry is blasphemy .
I think it is disgraceful .
I would much rather they used the f-word .
It shows a total disregard for God .
It was considered deeply offensive until recently .
" I think swearing in general is a sign of decline in language .
It just reveals that people have n't got any vocabulary .
I know someone who can not put a sentence together without using the f-word .
" In working areas , men used to swear like troopers , but they would never swear in front of women .
It 's just to do with respect .
There is no respect for anything or anybody now .
I think a lot of people are offended by it .
It 's not just the old . "
Here are some of your comments so far :
Why does the Bishop believe that swearing " reveals that people have n't got any vocabulary " ?
Surely it actually signifies an expanded and more prolific vocabulary .
I use scores of swear words on top of my regular varied vocab , and also regularly read the Viz Profanisaurus : as a result of this I believe I can express myself far more fully than without .
I highly recommend any type of learning .
Barbara Foster , England
To say that swearing reveals a lack of vocabulary is nonsense .
I know precisely what I mean to say and swear - words are sometimes the best way of saying it .
I will tone down my swearing if there are children present , but my favourite way of swearing is blasphemy !
I do n't think that god gets offended , so why should you ?
Andy G , UK Swearing gives the impression that the person swearing is lacking in vocabulary and thus is also lacking in intelligence .
It 's a slack argument to claim that swearing helps to emphasise your point it does n't .
The English language is full of rich colourful descriptions without resorting to swear - words .
If you feel the need to swear all the time then read more and improve your vocabulary you ignorant f****** b********.
Andrew Forster , Scotland
It 's never been revealed but what I want to know is what exactly did the viewer say as he kicked the TV set in during Bill Grundy 's show ?
Something along the lines of ..
" That 's f******* disgraceful " perhaps ? ! "
Nick , Manchester , England I 'm moderately amused by John Broadhurst 's comment that " blasphemy ... is disgraceful .
It shows a total disregard for God " .
He 's right : it does .
I have absolutely no regard for God , because I 'm an atheist .
A bit rich of him to expect us to respect his beliefs by not " blaspheming " , when he uses words like " disgraceful " .
That does n't seem to show much respect for my belief that there is no God to blaspheme against !
Anyway , I 'm firmly of the view that swearing is a necessary part of everyday life .
What more effective intensifier is there than " f****** " , when you 're really annoyed ?
I do n't swear in front of children , though , because I believe that kids ' vocabularies should be based on " acceptable " .
English in the first instance .
Once they 've mastered that , they can eff and blind to their hearts ' content , bless 'em .
Rob A , UK I am by no means a prude but i find four letter words offensive and unnecessary .
i used to run a pub in the 80s and 90s and if the language got bad I would ask the customer to mind their language so as not to offend others .
Nowadays this is supposed to be old fashioned .
But if people swear all the time what have they got left when they are really angry ?
Carol Stewart , Britain
As an ex-RAF engineer swearing was part of everyday life , but never in front of the women .
We once had a comedian booked for a Christmas function with the wives and girlfriends .
He was n't going down too well so resorted to ' a bit of blue ' .
Needless to say he was heckled off stage and paid off ; even servicemen have standards !
Steve Farrington , UK Come on , get real - more people laughed when Johnny said " F *** ing C*** s " than were offended .
It may have been basic , crude and mildly shocking , but it appeared to be spontaneous ( and fit the situation perfectly ) which made it humorous .
Compare this to the dull and predictable Bernard Mannings and Roy Chubby Browns of this world where every " f***" and " C*** " is scripted .
Vinny Ramone , Romford
Why does it seem that those in the anti-swearing brigade seem to be so misogynistic ?
It 's OK to swear of course , so long as it does not reach the delicate ears of our women folk .
F*** off !
Katy , Manchester Following Miranda Suit 's comments , I personally would prefer any child of mine to be brought up in swearing culture than one that deifies the gun .
The pen may be mightier than the sword , but I 'd rather be on the receiving end of a four - letter - word tirade than a bullet any day .
Will , UK Context is everything in language .
I 'm far more offended by a well - spoken , educated person making comments that are racist , misogynist or right - wing , than by a perfectly decent person who swears like a trooper .
There is also a lot of class bigotry in the language debate .
A docker or lorry driver is considered foul - mouthed and a yob , but a Richard Curtis film where every other word is f**k is considered witty in an ever - so - public - school type of way .
Matthew , UK I agree with the Bishop in that the overuse of swear words is a sign of the decline in language .
The proliferation of any general terms usually demonstrates a lack of knowledge of the specific expression that could alternately be used .
Swear words are just the most common , and most incendiary , examples of these general terms .
Huw Davies , UK Swearing is a necessary and invaluable addition to anyone 's vocabulary .
Swear words are the closest to pure thought ; they require the least amount of mental preparation and as such represent a unique form of honesty when communicating .
John Lydon 's latest outburst was blown completely out of proportion , I mean is there anyone at all i the entire country who has n't heard those words at least a thousand times before ?
A perfect antidote to the sterilised blandness of the BBC 's swear - free programming .
Take note Eastenders , it 's about f****** time you grew up .
Wayne Matthews - Stroud , UK
What a fuss about nothing it all is .
Children and swearing ?
Who are we trying to kid ?
I learned every swear word I know in the playground of my primary school in a small country town in the north of Scotland , in the late 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s , before I reached the age of 10 !
Robin Angus , Scotland Like Boothby ( who ? )
I find it amazing that the public will tolerate despicable scenes of violence , sexual abuse , eroticism etc on TV , but get up in arms about a few swear words .
The thing that really baffles me is this intolerance of the ' c - word ' .
My wife sees it as ' beyond the pail ' but could give me no logical reason as to why she finds it more offensive than similar phrases for the same part of the anatomy !
My late mother 's family regular use the ' c - word ' with no more animosity than if they were calling the person ' an idiot ' , and therefore I personally cannot see what the fuss is about .
Given a choice I would allow any language , blue or otherwise , on TV at any time , but ban depictions of violence and sexual activity entirely .
What many people see on TV , they then copy in real life : would you rather be sworn at , beaten up , or raped ?
Dale Rumbold , Ipswich , England Fair enough if some people are offended by swearing but I 'm sure they'd be more offended if I punched them in the face which is what I usually feel like doing when I swear .
Swearing allows you to channel anger into a non physical form of violence and if other people were more tolerant and let the moment pass there would surely be less violence all round ?
Tucky , UK
The one thing that infuriates me about swearing on television is the inconsistency .
During a documentatary about friendly fire , you have beeps in one place but not in another .
On prime - time television you have Ozzy Osborne swearing at 8 pm without any editing of , what was obviously , a pre-recorded interview .
Films on Satellite are bleeped out for swearing , yet the subtitles for the hard of hearing are not edited .
Whilst all this is going on , at 6.30 pm on Radio 4 you can hear swearing on the News Quiz and other programmes .
Either ignore the social taboos and allow swearing , or edit everything , but for God 's sake be consistent .
Geoff , UK
Go on put my FCUKing comments on your damn site this time .
You 've got me really angry now - most of the comments you post are absolute b*******!
Jules , London similar to Geoff 's comment , i'm always especially annoyed by the use of st*rs in " naughty " words in print .
the assumption seems to be that if we can't read all of the letters in the offensive word , it is somehow less offensive .
if it is deemed neccessary to use a quotation containing swearing , it should be repeated verbatim , or not at all .
the same with " bleeping " on tv broadcasts .
either cut the whole sentence , do n't censor it at all [ which would be preferable ] , or do n't broadcast it until after the watershed
Adam , uk
The problem with swearing strikes me as being not so much a lack of vocabulary as a lack of discretion .
To say , as many teenagers are wont to do , " f******" after every few words is simply to reveal to their listeners how often they are thinking about sex .
Obviously , as many other commentators suggest , this is best toned down in front of children or people of the opposite sex but when you are among people with whom you are at ease then by all means speak out with whatever language is in your mind .
Colette , UK I also agree with the Bishop , lets stamp out blasphemy and to hell with that f****** c*** who used to be in the Sex Pistols .
Des , uk I teach Taboo Language as an English Language lecturer , and the students are perfectly well aware that it is the audience and not the language which makes something taboo .
And they become aware that this a fascinating area of linguistics .
But for the Bishop to say that language is ' in decline ' shows only ignorance .
This is an old argument and has always been unfounded .
There is as much evidence for that as there is for the existance of god .
The really sad bit is that a musician of John Lydon 's standard should be reduced to appearing on such a tacky show .
And given his track record , what exactly did the programme producers expect ?

This issue has been raised before , but Guido thought that changing things in 2.x would break too much code .
See :

I 'm bringing this up again because the arguments I 've seen in favour of fixing hasattr have been fairly weak , and I 'd like to raise some stronger ones .
Also , I have n't seen this issue considered specifically in the context of Python 3000 .
The problem is that hasattr behaves just like the following code : def hasattr ( obj , name ) : try : getattr ( obj , name ) return True except : return False In Python 3000 , all exceptions inherit from BaseException , so this is equivalent to : def hasattr ( obj , name ) : try : getattr ( obj , name ) return True except BaseException : return False
There are three major things that are broken by this behaviour , which I do n't think have been explicitly mentioned : 1 . If the Python interpreter receives SIGINT ( usually triggered by Ctrl - C ) while executing obj.__getattr__ ( or anything it calls ) , hasattr silently returns False and the program continues running .
Cause : KeyboardInterrupt is swallowed .
2 . If sys.exit is called within obj.__getattr__ , hasattr silently returns False and the program continues running .
Cause : SystemExit is swallowed .
3 . If an assert statement fails within obj.__getattr__ , hasattr silently returns False and the program continues running .
Cause : AssertionError is swallowed .
Also , because getattr( x , y,z ) swallows only AttributeError , users naturally expect hasattr to behave the same way .
( This argument has been raised before . )
I propose a few alternate behaviours for hasattr ( and their consequences ) : 1 . Swallow only AttributeError . - KeyboardInterrupt , SystemExit , and AssertionError are all passed through , solving all three of the above problems .
-
The behaviour of hasattr is made consistent with getattr( x , y, z ) .
2 . Swallow only Exception .
- KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit are passed through , but AssertionError is still swallowed .
- Breaks less code than the previous option .
3 . Swallow Exception unless it's an AssertionError .
- KeyboardInterrupt , SystemExit , and AssertionError are all passed through , solving all three of the above problems .
- Kind of ugly .
4 . Swallow everything except KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit . - AssertionError is still swallowed , but the other problems are fixed and this probably wo n't break any existing code .
I looked at bltinmodule.c , and any of these would be trivial to implement .
Ideally , I would like to see the first option implemented in Python 3000 and one of the other options implemented in 2.x . -- Dwayne C. Litzenberger <[ EMAIL PROTECTED ] > _______________________________________________

Note to readers :
This article contains discussion about the relationship between supply , demand , and price .
Check out my other article A cap on the price of gasoline is a bad idea – and the Nintendo Wii can tell us why for a review of the basics if you like .
With the rising cost of gasoline , many motorists are looking for relief .
Recent price increase do not seem to correlate with any real visible changes around them – and frustration results .
This frustration has turned into attempts at action for many , hoping for any way to reduce the amount of money spent on fuel .
There are many proposed solutions to the issue , however they tend to fall short .
Let ’s take a look at a few of them .
Strike !
This is a popular one that comes around at the start of every driving season .
The premise is that drivers stick together , and for ( a day / 3 days / a week ) decide to say “ screw you ! ” to the oil companies and not fill up at all .
This will cause billions of dollars of losses , and force the oil companies to drop prices overnight .
Let ’s address the first point , that this will cause the oil companies to lose billions .
For simplicity , let ’s assume there are two ways this could turn out :
Everyone stays home during the strike , buys zero gas , and then resumes normal activities afterwards .
( a “ strong ” strike )
No one buys gas during the strike , but still goes about normal activities and has to buy gas later .
( a “ weak ” strike )
We can agree that the premise of this strike is to reduce demand – which will cause the oil companies to respond .
Let ’s see how demand is affected by each of these scenarios .
In the first scenario , it ’s like a few days of gas buying dropped off the earth .
If we look at a graph of daily ( blue bars ) and average daily ( red line ) consumption , we can see that at the end of the gas strike , things are looking pretty good .
Average demand has gone down !
The companies have to respond !
Well , hold on a second .
Time marches on , after all .
Let ’s take a look at this a few days later .
Well damn , it looks like average demand is marching right back up again , since we really have n’t changed our habits for the long run , just for a few days .
So demand is the same as it was before !
Now lets look at the second scenario a few days after the strike .
Like before , at the end of the strike things look pretty good .
But it gets even worse than before .
Since we did n’t stay home and just kept driving , now we really , really need to fill up our tanks .
So daily demand shoots through the roof as we play catch up , and our long term average demand spikes up ( the exact opposite of what we wanted ! ) and then settles down to where it was before .
Again , no change in the long run .
Well , you ’re missing the point Geoff , some would say .
The “ weak ” strike definitely would n’t work , but the “ strong ” strike still took out a few billion dollars for a few days , did n’t it ?
Well yes , of course it did .
Unfortunately , this is spread out over many companies – you ’re a rounding error .
If this loss continued for months and years , companies would start to feel the pain – but at this point , you ’re no more aggravating than a large supply contract that was settled a few days later than expected .
These companies are very good at not being bullied .
Oil is a very cyclical industry , those companies than cannot weather a storm quickly fail .
Boycott !
Well fine !
That wo n’t work , but let ’s change our strategy .
Instead of a gas strike , let ’s pick a specific company ( say Shell ) , and simply not purchase gasoline from them .
Shell will watch it ’s profits sink while the other companies make tons of money , say “ screw this ! ” and reduce gas prices so they do n’t go under .
At first this seems reasonable .
The only problem arises when you ask yourself what the real change in supply and demand is .
Supply has n’t changed , the companies are n’t doing a damn thing .
Demand has n’t changed , we ’ve just switched gas stations .
Hrm , how is this going to work ?
But regardless , we are n’t buying from Shell !
They ’ll have to reduce prices , then the other companies will follow !
Right ?
Well , not quite .
Let ’s take a simplified look at the “ flow ” of gasoline between companies .
The “ futures market ” ( like a stock market that trades gasoline contracts instead of companies ) prices gasoline , and matches sellers to companies that need gas .
These companies then sell gas to you .
So let ’s take away one of those arrows .
Assume a perfect boycott , and not a soul purchases gas from Shell .
Everyone is now buying from other stations , but there ’s only one problem .
Overall demand is the same , but our new “ per station ” demand is higher .
The immediate reaction to this higher per station demand is higher prices .
“ Wait ! ” you say , in the long run demand has n’t changed !
Gas prices should stay the same at worst !
Well , you ’re right – in the long run .
In the short run prices spike up as gasoline stations experience temporary shortages .
Now , these stations need to get more gas from somewhere to sell to all the new customers they have .
It ’s obviously available , it just needs to get to the station – but where from ?
The answer is of course to buy it from Shell .
Our only hope at this point is that Shell will panic , see that it has this excess gas , and dump it on the market at a reduced rate .
Let ’s assume that Shell does exactly that .
Huzzah !
We finally did it !
Reduced gas prices !
Well , unfortunately for you ,
Shell is not run by idiots .
They know that overall supply and demand has n’t changed , just that no one buys from Shell anymore ( assuming our perfect boycott is still going strong ) .
So , prices end up stabilizing back at the old market rate ( since there ’s the same amount of people buying gas , and the same amount of gas available , we ’ve just changed companies ) , and Shell ends up selling gasoline to the other companies ( assuming best case of no excess transportation costs ) .
So assuming the best case scenario , we get a price spike , followed by a price dip , followed by the same damn price as before .
Since we have n’t changed overall supply or overall demand , the overall price will not change .
Lessons
The current energy situation is a deeply complex mess .
Proposing simple easy solutions that require little effort makes everyone feel better – but does nothing .
If internet petitions and email forwards worked on their own , world hunger would have already been abolished .
To those proposing a gas strike – I propose to you a different solution , the public transit swarm .
Get everyone you know to give up a car for a workweek and take public transit .
Get enough people so that it ’s a huge goddamn mess , subway stations are tied up , buses are jammed , and the situation is so bizarre that the media is forced to pay attention .
Shout as loud as you can that the reason we drive so much is because the alternatives frankly suck .
Have you tried walking to get your groceries in a suburb ?
Does the bus stop anywhere near your workplace ?
Does it bother to show up on time ?
We need real alternative solutions that will reduce our overall demand on gas .
Bringing attention and social acceptance to faster , cleaner , and more efficient public transit systems is a great start .
To those proposing a boycott of a specific company – I propose to you a different solution .
Boycott car manufacturers who insist on producing cars with poor gas mileage .
Buy an efficient car , or do n’t buy one at all .
A more efficient fleet of cars on the road reduces demand , and Ford ca n’t simply sell excess cars to Toyota that magically become greener – so a boycott of lazy companies who are more focused on bells and whistles rather than green technology is more effective .
I do n’t mean to insult anyone proposing these solutions – but simply to make you think them through .
Your motivation is admirable .
Let ’s work together to create cost effective sensible approaches to energy policy .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A 5.2 magnitude earthquake centered in southeast Illinois that was the strongest in the Midwest in 40 years startled residents before dawn on Friday , but officials reported no injuries and only minor damage .
The quake , the strongest since a 5.4 magnitude quake in November 1968 , could be felt as far west as Kansas , as far east as Georgia and as far north as Michigan ’s Upper Peninsula , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
“ Earthquakes of comparable size are felt over greater distances in the East than those occurring in the West , ” noted USGS seismologist Harley Benz .
Experts say soil conditions in the central United States are such that shocks in the region tend to travel farther and be felt in wider areas than in places such as California where they would be more quickly absorbed .
Friday ’s quake , classified as “ moderate ” by the USGS , was centered five miles northeast of Bellmont , Illinois , in the southeastern part of the state along the Indiana border in an area near Kentucky .
Some bricks were knocked from a building in Louisville , Kentucky , and residents near the epicenter reported being awakened by several seconds of shaking strong enough to knock pictures off walls .
Many others slept through it .
A tower at O’Hare International Airport swayed , with one controller telling the Chicago Tribune newspaper it felt like “ being on the end of a fishing pole . ”
The quake was felt in downtown Chicago buildings , and the city fire department said that while there was no damage reported it asked operators of construction cranes to check that they were still firmly anchored before resuming work .
The quake struck at a shallow depth of 7.2 miles , according to the USGS .
The agency initially said the quake had a magnitude of 5.4 but later revised it to 5.2 .
The temblor occurred in the Wabash Valley seismic zone , which produces quakes fairly frequently .
It is adjacent to the New Madrid fault zone that in the winter of 1811 - 1812 produced three of the strongest earthquakes ever to strike the continental United States .
Looks pretty cool as you can see the reading of the code , guessing placement , and after that the implementing of CSS and replacing everything again .

Experts doubt that the people in the new Brazilian pictures , or others who have been sighted , are truly “ uncontacted ” tribes , as was reported in some news accounts .
They think , instead , that the group in Acre was probably pushed out of Peruvian territory into Brazil by loggers sawing down their habitat .
After years of ignoring the situation , Peruvian authorities in the region of Madre de Dios announced last week their intention to protect isolated tribes and clamp down on illegal logging .
Whoever they are , the protection and continued survival of people like this and their way of life involves striking a careful balance between the ambitions of developers of resources and the best interests of the native population .
Anthropologists generally praise Brazil ’s efforts in recent years .
Sydney Possuelo , a former director for unknown tribes at Funai , is given much credit for establishing the practice of not contacting isolated people .
The government ’s policy now is to demarcate lands where they still live and put them off limits to developers .
Though the settlements are monitored from time to time , no attempt is supposed to be made to intrude or assimilate the people into the outside culture .
In an interview two years ago with BrazilMax.com , a travel Web site , Mr. Possuelo said he once believed that contact and assimilation benefited these people .
“ But as I went about my work , I saw that it was really bad for them , ” he said .
“ They get diseases .
They lose their autonomy .
They become dependent on our world . ”
This attitude is a far cry from previous experience .
Almost ever since the rubber boom in the 19th century , indigenous people have been forced off their lands to make way for rubber extraction , logging , mining and ranching .
Lately , cocaine trafficking in some parts of South America has contributed to the problem .
As a result , the uncounted numbers of those surviving on their original land are now few .
“ The hope is to avoid those mistakes , ” said Janet Chernela , an anthropologist at the University of Maryland .
“ But some say they are unavoidable . ”

The most recent supernova in our Galaxy has been discovered by tracking the rapid expansion of its remains .
This result , using NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory and NRAO 's Very Large Array ( VLA ) , has implications for understanding how often supernovas explode in the Milky Way galaxy .
The supernova explosion occurred about 140 years ago , making it the most recent supernova in the Milky Way as measured in Earth 's time frame .
Previously , the last known galactic supernova occurred around 1680 , based on studying the expansion of its remnant Cassiopeia A .
The recent supernova explosion was not seen in optical light about 140 years ago because it occurred close to the center of the Galaxy , and is embedded in a dense field of gas and dust .
This made it about a trillion times fainter , in optical light , than an unobscured supernova .
However , the supernova remnant it caused , G1.9+0.3 , is now seen in X -ray and radio images .
" We can see some supernova explosions with optical telescopes across half of the Universe , but when they 're in this murk we can miss them in our own cosmic backyard , " said Stephen Reynolds of North Carolina State University , who led the Chandra study .
" Fortunately , the expanding gas cloud from the explosion shines brightly in radio waves and X - rays for thousands of years .
X -ray and radio telescopes can see through all that obscuration and show us what we 've been missing . "
Astronomers regularly observe supernovas in other galaxies like ours , and based on those rates , estimate that about three should explode every century in our Milky Way , although these estimates have large margins of error .
" If the supernova rate estimates are correct , there should be the remnants of about 10 supernova explosions that are younger than Cassiopeia A , " said David Green of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom , who led the VLA study .
" It 's great to finally track one of them down . "
The tracking of this source began in 1985 when astronomers , led by Green , used the VLA to identify G1.9+0.3 as the remnant of a supernova explosion near the center of our Galaxy .
Based on its small size , it was thought to have resulted from a supernova that exploded about 400 to 1000 years ago .
Twenty two years later , Chandra observations of this object revealed that the remnant had expanded by a surprisingly large amount , about 16 % since 1985 .
This indicates that the supernova remnant is much younger than previously thought .
The young age was confirmed when new radio observations from the VLA were made just within the past several weeks .
This " apples to apples " comparison nails the age of the remnant to be about 140 years ( less if it has been slowing down ) , making it the youngest on record in the Milky Way .
Finding such a recent , obscured supernova is a vital first step in making a better estimate of the supernova rate in our Galaxy .
Knowing this rate is important because supernovas heat and redistribute large amounts of gas , pump large amounts of heavy elements out into their surroundings , and can trigger the formation of new stars , closing the cycle of stellar death and rebirth .
The explosion may also leave behind , in addition to the expanding remnant , a central neutron star or black hole .
In addition to being a record holder for youth , G1.9+0.3 is of considerable interest for other reasons .
The high expansion velocities and the extreme particle energies that have been generated are unprecedented and should stimulate deeper studies of this object with Chandra and the VLA .
" No other object in the Galaxy has properties like this , " said Reynolds .
" Finding G1.9+0.3 is extremely important for learning more about how some stars explode and what happens in the aftermath .
Scientists can also use it to probe the environment into which it exploded .
At perhaps only a few thousand light years from the center of the Galaxy , it appears to be embedded in the dense environment near the Milky Way 's supermassive black hole .
These results will appear in The Astrophysical Journal Letters .
NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center , Huntsville , Ala. , manages the Chandra program for the agency 's Science Mission Directorate .
The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory controls science and flight operations from the Chandra X-ray Center in Cambridge , Mass .
Being the whiney - ass jerks we are , we love to complain about our jobs .
“ Xpublisher is being a dick !
Every game I play sucks !
I hate doing a job that thousands of people would kill baby seals to do ! ”
In our defense , it is n’t easy sorting this hurricane of press releases , PR bullshit , speculation , trailers , screens , and boob jokes into something intelligible and interesting .
Nevertheless , we are far from the most crapped on people in this industry .
Apologies if we offend anyone who does these jobs – remember , we ’re not hating , we ’re just saying .
7. Game Tester
Sounds brilliant , does n’t it ?
Get paid to play games all day – oh , and it ’s totally a stepping stone into the games industry .
At least , that ’s what they tellyou - our quality assurance veteran thinks differently .
Here 's the gist of her experience :
You are n’t paid to play games , you are paid to break them .
Even that sounds abit fun , but it ’s different when you need to document and prove how you broke the game , work overtime all the time , live on coffee and Red Bull , and can expect to be fired at a moment ’s notice – not fired because you did a bad job , fired because that ’s just how the job works .
You work long hours shoulder to greasy face with a bunch of unhygienic recent high school grads , get yelled at by incompetent managers , accused of lying when bugs are difficult to reproduce , spit on by arrogant developers when you point out gaping flaws in their code , and are then fired simply because they ’re done with you .
You were n’t making much money to begin with , either .
Sound fun now ?
In defense of QA , not all testers hate it .
Ananonymous poster at Gamewatch.orgdescribeshis experience at EA :
% 26ldquo; Quality of life here , as best as I can tell , is great .
I absolutely love the work environment , I love the team I 'm on and all of my immediate supervisors are amazing .
We 're constantly rewarded and thanked for doing our jobs well , although the opposite is also true :
When we 're not performing up to our potential , we do get the lectures .
Standards for improvement when we 're not doing our best are very fair and reasonable , and any improvement at all is definitely recognized positively , even if we 're still not up to where we should be ideally .
Overall , positive reinforcement outweighs the negative .
%26rdquo ;
You seem to be the exception , Lemon Drop Disaster , and props to EA if this account is accurate .
As you 'll see later in this article , not everyone is as satisfied with the quality of life at the publishing giant .
6 . The person who has to wade through Xbox Live abuse reports
Yeah , this one is a bit specific , but we ’re really referring to all of the brain - meltingly dull and repetitive jobs in the games industry .
Our own CheatPlanet editor is an expert in tedium - his soul turned hard and crusty by the constant influx of ridiculous and mostly indecipherable user submissions ( do n’t worry , welet him ventnow and again ) .

If you ’ve ever administrated forums , you understand how much fun dealing with whiney kids and their whiney parents and all of their whiney shit all day is .
To whomever has to deal with XBL or PSN ’sshenanigans , or manage any community of irate gamers - we understand .
When you encounter issues with your iPhone , there is a tendency that you run a few tests by restarting the device , among other things .
When the problem persists , you often feel frustrated , particularly when your iPhone ’s touch screen ceases to work .
Here are a few things that you need to do when your iPhone ’s touch screen will cease to respond when swiping your fingers across it .
But first , you have to figure out why it has stopped working in the first place .
You should know that this part of the device stops working when the digitizer stops working correctly .
This can also happen when the software stops communicating to the hardware .
Basically , the problem can be related to hardware or the software or both .
Turn the iPhone off and on again when you repeatedly encounter this problem .
But this should be difficult to do when you ca n’t have your touch screen to respond .
Therefore , you need to do a hard reset .
Hold the Home and Power buttons down simultaneously .
After a few seconds , you can see the Apple logo that would appear on the screen .
That is the time you need to let go of the buttons you held earlier .
i Phone 7 , 7 Plus , 8 , and 8 Plus models migth require you to hold down the Power and the Volume down buttons simultaneously for several seconds .
When the Apple logo shows itself on the screen , release the buttons right away .
Remember that the hard reset can stop the processes in the background .
This can also cause software issues .
Therefore , you have to do a hard reset only when you need to .
You can also choose to restore your iPhone to the original settings .
But make sure that you have a backup of your information and settings using the iCloud or iTunes .
Gah !
A baby born with a penis on his back !

Update January 2013 : Best practice for this kind of this is Best practice for this kind of this is detailed here
Update May 2010 : I ’m considering this article deprecated .
I have an I ’m considering this article .
I have an updated article here , which covers this same type of material only with more features , updated technology , and better practices .
The more I learn about jQuery , the more natural it feels .
Probably because of how closely tied to CSS it is .
From a design perspective , the syntax for jQuery is :
“ When I do this , make the CSS do this . ”
The more common slogan is :
Find something , do something .
… which is also awesome .
So now instead of thinking about CSS as page layout and a way to style your page when it loads , you can use in animation and change it on - the - fly to react to events that happen on your page .
Take for example a menu .
You can take the “ click ” event that happens when clicking on a menu to do lots of stuff .
This example page has three menu items and three content areas : home , about , and contact .
By default , the home button is selected , meaning that it ’s menu graphic is at full opacity and it ’s content area is shown :
#home { display : block ; padding : 30 px ; } #home - button { opacity : 1.0 ; border - bottom : 1 px solid black ; }
By default , the other menu items are faded and their content areas are hidden , like so :
# about { display : none ; padding : 30 px ; } #about - button { opacity : 0.5 ; border - bottom : 1 px solid black ; }
With jQuery , we can listen for that click event and then act accordingly .
This is what we want to happen :
Fade IN the menu item being clicked on .
Fade OUT all other menu items .
DISPLAY the corresponding content area .
HIDE all other content areas .
Since the home button is active by default , let ’s look at the jQuery javascript for the about button :
< script type =" text / javascript " src="js/jquery.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " > $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " #about - button " ) .click ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .animate ( { opacity : 1.0 , borderWidth : 5 } , 600 ) ; $ ( " #home " ) .css ( { display : " none " } ) ; $ ( " #about " ) .css ( { display : " block " } ) ; $ ( " #contact " ) .css ( { display : " none " } ) ; $ ( " #home - button " ) .animate ( { opacity : 0.5 , borderWidth : 1 } , 600 ) ; $ ( " #contact - button " ) .animate ( { opacity : 0.5 , borderWidth : 1 } , 600 ) ; } ) ; } ) ; </ script >
Your complete javascript code would have similar chunks for all three buttons .
As I ’ve mentioned before , I ’m just learning here , so there is likely to be a way smarter way of writing this , but these are the basics and they work .
UPDATE : This is way smarter .
How do we view objects in four dimensions ?
The difficulty with viewing an object on a hypersphere is not being able to see it -- it is , after all , a three dimensional object living in a three dimensional space -- but being able to see all of it .
It is an object that lives in a curved space , and we want to see it flattened out .
Imagine , by analogy , a flatlander viewing something drawn on the surface of a two - dimensional sphere .
He could walk around on the sphere 's surface , looking at the object , but he could never see all of the sphere that way , because there would always be part of it beyond the horizon .
So any object that was drawn on the whole sphere would only partially be available to view .
Alternately , as Edward Abott famously describes in his book Flatland , he could view the sphere as it passes through his flat space .
However , it takes quite an act of imagination to reconstruct a full sphere from its successive cross-sections .
This is n't impossible : if we are willing to accept some distortion we can project the whole surface of the sphere onto three dimensional space .
So what are we looking at ?
Suppose a flatlander wished to view structures on a sphere from his comfortable planar home .
He could arrange for a transparent sphere to sit on the plane with a light placed at the top , so that all the circles drawn on the sphere would cast shadows down onto his plane .
Now these shadows would be distorted images of the original circles , so the images would still seem unnaturally large in the distance , but angles and approximate shapes would be preserved .
The flatlander could sit well away from the point where the sphere rested , and watch the play of shadows as the sphere rotated .
It is easiest to understand this process by looking at the analog in two dimensions .
Above we see a sphere with the edges of dodecahedron projected onto it ( it is as if we took a dodecahedron with stretchy faces and blew it up unto a sphere , like a soccer ball ) .
Now imagine the sphere is transparent and we put a light on the top .
We can shine the light down on the plane and see the shadows of the edges of the dodecahedron on the plane .
The name for this method is stereographic projection .
Above right we see the twelve faces of the dodecahedron projected on the plane this way .
Can you pick them out ?
The projection of the bottom face is hidden underneath the small sphere ; the second row of five faces projects to the small five - pointed flower image ; the next row of five to the bigger more curved images , and the final top face is projected out to infinity , forming the " background " for the figure .
Since this might be difficult to see with the sphere in the way , I have provided another image of the projection , with the original sphere removed , to the left .
This projection distorts our shape , the dodecahedron , but in a predictable way .
All the faces of our dodecahedron are identical regular pentagons , but in the projection they look quite different from each other .
In particular , the images towards the center look abnormally small , while the images towards the edges seem abnormally large -- and any face that passes through the projection point gets blown up infinitely large and becomes the " background . "
Also , straight lines are no longer straight : they become sections of circles , and as they approach the edges of the projection they become more and more noticeably curved .
However , angles are preserved , so it is not too difficult to see that we are looking at pentagons -- distorted , for sure , but still most definitely pentagons .
The advantage of this projection is that it would help a flatlander to get a concept of a three - dimensional dodecahedron without having to mentally reconstruct slices of the body as it passed through his space .
He could wander among the shadow lines on his plane , and if he had the imagination to mentally correct for the funny distortion of lines and areas , he could get a sense of a figure with twelve equal pentagonal faces wrapped on a sphere .
Maybe he would n't know everything there is to know about a dodecahedron , but he could learn many of the most important things : how it was connected , its regularity and its symmetry .
He can still see the essential three - fold and five - fold symmetry of the dodecahedron .
We can imagine a flatlander looking at this projection and intuiting from it an idea of the original object .
In particular , this projection makes it possible to intuit the inherent symmetry of this object .
These properties are much harder to convey using the two - dimensional slices model .
Our next step is to assign the task we have just watched our hypothetical flatlander perform to ourselves .
We want to wander among the shadows of the " faces " of a four dimensional polyhedron and reconstruct in our imagination a concept of its connectedness , regularity and symmetry .
But in four dimensions an " face " will actually be a body , a three - dimensional object .
Look up above at the green object pictured at the start of this essay .
Does it have a form that looks familiar ?
See the small inner star , and the larger more curved outer leaves ?
Can you see the underlying regularity , the consistent pentagonal shapes , with , now another layer of consistent dodecahedrality ?
It looks like our original projection , except that now it is more complex .
The image above is , as you might have guessed , the projection of the faces of a four - dimensional analog of a dodecahedron .
We are looking at the " shadows " of the faces of this figure , which are ordinary three - dimensional dodecahedron .
We are n't seeing all of the faces : if we showed them all we would n't see anything but the inside of the one which projected to infinity .
Some faces have been removed to make the picture easier to view -- in fact , we are looking at exactly half the faces .
To imagine the whole shape one would have to imagine another exact copy of this figure fitted into this one -- but do n't worry too much about trying to bend your mind around this concept here , for we will talk more about it later .
The only thing that matters now is to get a sense of the regularity underneath the distortion .
Above we see another image of a selection of faces from the 4D dodecahdral polytope which might be easier to interpret .
The solid " faces " of this hyper - dodecahedron have been pulled away from each other slightly , which makes it easier to see that they are all reasonably similar dodecahedron .
The big mesh sphere is the projection of the " equator " of our sphere .
The middle dodecahedron on the section to the right of the " equator " lies at the north pole , while the middle one at the left lies on the south pole .
Perhaps this view makes the underlying regularity clearer : it is easier to see that the two halves are basically equal , with only slight distortion because of the projection .
Let us look at another example , to get a sense of how this works .
Above we see a pair of two - dimensional projections , this time of an icosahedron .
Notice the triangles have changed , in the projection , into another characteristic petal shape .
They distort slightly as the sphere is rotated under the light that sits at its top .
Notice the characteristic shapes of the distorted triangles .
Now , we can see a similar characteristic shape in the image above , which is a projection of a four - dimensional polytope called the 24 - cell .
In this image , only alternate solid " faces " are pictured , so we can get an idea of the shape .
Note the faces of this shape look like three dimensional analogues of our original petal - shaped triangles .
By comparing the projections in these different dimensions , we can gain an intuition which allows us to imagine the form of the original four - dimensional polytope .
How the four dimensional sphere is different .
In particular , to give you an idea of the new dimensions in hairstyle available in four dimensional , note that there is more than one way to divide all the " hair " into two sections , i.e. to make a part .
You can divide it much the same way one would make a part on a three - dimensional head .
In this case the dividing line of the " part " would not be a circle drawn on the " head " -- it would be a sphere .
Since we are dimension higher , the " part " is also an object of one higher dimension .
To get an idea of how this looks ( in projection ) we show above an image of a four sphere parted -- into six equal sections , not two .
This is how one would make parts if one was preparing to braid six cornrows on the head of our four - dimensional woman .
Notice how the dividing surfaces are portions of spheres .
This is not the only way to divide the sphere , however .
We can also divide the hair into two sections using a torus as our dividing line .
That is to say , we can also find a torus that cuts the four dimensional sphere into two pieces .
Above you can see images of the dividing torus ( projected ) .
The dividing torus has been cut into ribbons , so we can see it projected in our space .
The ribbons on the torus suggest how to comb the hair on a sphere : we can make the dividing line of the " part " into a torus -- and it is possible to comb the hair on a torus .
I have included a picture of the flow along this torus , from two different perspectives .
Because it would be hard to see individual " hairs " in this flow , I have taken two equally spaced " hairs " -- or " fibres " as they are called in mathematics -- and connected them with a surface to make a ribbon , as I mentioned before .
So we see ribbons twisting around a projected torus .
Look carefully at these ribbons .
Notice that every single one has a twist in it .
If this is hard to see in these small images , click on the picture to magnify it .
The flow that wraps smoothly around the torus is made up of circles that do not intersect , and each circle is linked inside every other circle exactly once .
So when we connect two circles as a ribbon , these ribbons have an elegant twist to them .
These linked circles and single twists are ubiquitous in images of the four dimensional sphere .
They add particular harmony to the images .
Below are examples drawn with more distance between the connected circles , so the ribbons are drawn wider .
In these images , the twist is more visible .
Now that we have looked at the torus that divides the sphere in half , and the family of circles in which each circle links every circle exactly once , I want to return again to the subject of four dimensional polyhedra , which are often called " polychora " .
The surprising property of the four dimensional sphere -- that you can " comb its hair " -- applies also to the polyhedra in four dimensional space .
That is , just as you can find a smooth flow that takes the whole sphere to itself , you can also find a flow of the discrete faces of a polychora onto each other that brings it back to itself .
That means it is interesting to look at subsets of the faces which make up elements of the flow .
This is an entirely emergent property of four dimensions -- by contrast , there are n't any subsets of the faces of a three dimensional polyhedron that have any particular physical or mathematical meaning .
Four dimensions is different , however .
This essay can not explain the full story of the exceptional properties of the four dimensional sphere , but it aspires to give you a taste for them .
Polyhedra , revisited .
For example , let us return , as promised , to consider the half hyper - dodecahedron which decorates the top of this article .
There are one hundred and twenty solid faces in this four dimensional version of the dodecahedron , and I show a solid made up of half of them , sixty in all .
How did I choose this particular half - object ?
Well , considering the earlier discussion , you may guess that I found a way to part the dodecahedron into two solid tori , in much the same way the sphere itself can be cut in half with a torus .
Now the next natural question is : can we find a smooth flow of linked circles that wraps around this torus ?
Yes we can : at left we see two linked circles which have been selected from sixty faces of our half - dodecahedron .
Each circle is made up of ten solid faces .
The whole tori that makes up our half - dodecahedron contains six of these linked circles .
If you look carefully again at the image of the whole tori , perhaps you can pick out the circles that wrap around the figure .
These characteristic linked circles show up everywhere in images of the denizens of four dimensional space , and lend the images their particular harmony .
The hyper - dodecahedron is not the only four dimensional polytope to contain these characteristic linked rings .
Below we see an image of the characteristic linked rings from another four dimensional figure .
This polygon is harder to name , because it does not have a three - dimensional analogue .
Its faces are made of truncated cubes , and it has forty - eight cells in all .
Just as was the case for the hyper - dodecahedron , we can pick out a torus made up of half of the faces .
We see those twenty - four faces pictured below .
In order to see the faces more clearly , we have drawn them slightly smaller , so they pull away from each other .
This makes it possible to actually see all twenty - four faces .
As you can see , this solid tori are made up of three linked rings of eight cells each .
In this case , it is actually possible to see how the entire torus is divided into these linked rings .
The linked rings show up in another manner as well .
Remember the 24 - cell that we mentioned earlier ?
We discussed it when we were explaining how to understand the projection into three dimensional space .
This is a polygon made up of twenty - four tetrahedral faces .
The image we showed of it earlier was the snaggle - toothed view : we drew every other point .
Now we show an image of one single ring of six faces chosen from the twenty - four .
The equator of the sphere is also drawn as a mesh in this image , to help us orient ourselves .
Now look carefully at this image .
Since the twenty - four cell is a relatively small polygon , these faces are relatively large , and the whole ring looks like a solid torus on its own .
Notice that the edges of the tetrahedra describe arcs which continue from one cell to the next .
These arcs make up circles that wrap all the way around our small torus .
So again we see the characteristic circles that wrap around a torus , this time in yet another context .
These are circles drawn on a single ring of faces , which is itself a circle that entwines with other circles .
Objects embedded in the four dimensional sphere contain circles within circles within circles .
This property gives them a particular harmony and beauty .
What else can we view ?
Windows developers are confirming the results of a survey released yesterday that found fewer than 1 in 12 programmers currently writing applications targeting Windows Vista .
" None of our customers are saying , 'G ****** it , we need those WPF controls now ! ' " said Julian Bucknall , CTO for Windows programming tools maker Developer Express Inc. , referring to one of Vista 's most highly - touted features , its new graphical subsystem , Windows Presentation Foundation .
Rather , " we find most are still sticking with ASP .
Net and Windows Forms applications . "
True to Microsoft 's form , ASP .
Net and Windows Forms and most of Windows XP 's other legacy technologies still work fine in Vista .
( The converse is also true : many Vista features can be installed as add - ons to XP . )
But as in every upgrade cycle , Microsoft runs the risk that developers may bypass the latest technologies -- in Vista 's case , WPF , the XPS printing format that Microsoft is touting as a rival to Adobe 's Portable Document Format ( PDF ) ; Windows Sidebar ' gadgets , ' and others -- in favor of those further down the road , such as those expected in Vista 's successor , Windows ' 7 ' .
" Microsoft tends to dump ten new technologies on us , but only 2 or 3 really stick , " said Michael Krasowski , vice - president of PDSA Inc. , a Microsoft - focused 20 - developer firm in Tustin Calif . , citing the Windows DNA Architecture as an example .
Microsoft Corp. undoubtedly wanted to avoid its current predicament .
It has been publicly talking up features in Vista since 2003 -- half a decade .
But such " overmarketing , " as Krasowski calls it , can rebound .
Experienced developers have become jaded towards the third - party apps Microsoft trots out as exemplars of Redmond 's latest technology -- " demoware , " he calls them -- that sparkle with flashy animation and video .
" You can't write an enterprise app like a demo .
It 'd be all soft and weak under the hood , " he said .
" We 'd never put all that stuff in because it could n't support 100 concurrent users . "
Some say it 's premature to declare Vista a flop with developers .
For one thing , despite the 140 million copies Microsoft claims to have shipped , the market has n't reached a tipping point yet .
" I can ???t see targeting something only to Vista when you have XP and Windows 2003 out there in huge numbers , " said Dave Noderer , a Microsoft MVP who runs the Florida .
Net User Group as well as his own software development firm , Computer Ways Inc. in Deerfield Beach , Fla .
Others point out the symbiotic relationship between most Windows developers and the large enterprises that hire and pay them .
Enterprises are proving even slower than the rest of the market at moving off XP , say analysts such as Forrester Research Inc .
" Large enterprise do n't transition overnight to the newest platforms , " said Shannon Braun , a Microsoft MVP and Minneapolis - area - based programming consultant .
" To me the adoption pace [ of Vista by developers ] seems pretty normal . "
" Vista is too bleeding - edge -- not for us , but for our clients , " Krasowski said .
PDSA 's clients include large , blue - chip customers such as Kaiser Permanente and Boeing Inc .
" They 're all leery of Vista . "
And why should n't they be ?
According to data released this spring by migration software vendor AppDNA Ltd. , about a fifth of enterprise applications running on XP break when moved straight to Vista , mostly due to pre-XP - era code still lingering in the app .
That increases to nearly half for apps migrated from 32 - bit XP straight to 64 - bit Vista .
Another reason is that Microsoft , in an attempt to catch up to the Mac , emphasized consumer -y aesthetic features with Vista , with WPF , Aero and the DirectX 10 3 - D graphics rendering engine all aimed at making Vista or its apps more pleasing to the eye .
More attractive apps are more user - friendly apps , says Microsoft , and that translates into increased user productivity .
But that message remains a hard sell to enterprises , who demand their apps stay " lean and mean , " said Krasowski , not get " confused and cluttered . "
Others say learning how to take advantage of Vista 's new visual features remains daunting .
Improving data presentation is " a good thing to do , but there is a lot of hacking through the undergrowth first , " Bucknall said .
" I do n't think a lot of developers know how to get to that stage . "
Noderer is optimistic .
While XP - era technologies such as Windows Forms " will be around for many years to come , " he said , Vista - era ones such as WPF " will slowly rise as the way to do Windows applications . "
But others think that the rise in popularity of server - delivered business apps -- coupled with Microsoft 's recent moves to make its Internet Explorer 8 browser behave more like other Web browsers -- could make Vista 's client - side graphics - enhancing features irrelevant .
" 98 % of the apps we write are for the Web , " Krasowski said .
" They 're more flexible and easier to maintain .
Many of our clients are migrating from apps written in VB6 or .
Net . "

Domestic energy is getting expensive , but what does that mean compared to the situation in our parents ' or grandparents ' days ?
Should we grumble ?
The chart above shows domestic fuel prices for Great Britain from 1914 to 2007 .
The data up to 1985 was compiled by Horace Herring and Rodney Evans and been updated with more recent figures from UK government statistics .
It is expressed in UK pounds for the year 2000 , adjusted by the retail price index ( i.e the price of energy related to other ' real ' goods such as food ) .
At the beginning of the 20th century , Britain 's fuel situation was dominated by cheap coal .
In RPI terms domestic coal was a third of the price that it is today and the domestic sector consumed vast amounts of it .
Town gas made from coal was about five times the price of coal .
It was locked in a battle with electricity for the lighting market .
This gas / coal price ratio decreased and was down to about 3:1 by the middle of the 20th century due to economies of scale and improved production techniques .
Electricity was initially staggeringly expensive .
When Brighton Corporation first started producing it in 1885 they sold it at a shilling ( 5 p ) a kWh .
Translated in RPI terms that is about £ 900 / GJ in today 's money , i.e. way off the top of the chart .
Indeed it only gets below £ 80 / GJ in the 1930s , around the time that the National Grid was being created .
Yet it was such a desirable commodity that it sold into ordinary working class homes for lighting and appliances .
Oil for heating was not widely available before World War 2 and so does n't enter the GB statistics .
After the war it became available in larger amounts at progressively lower and lower prices and ate into the town gas heating market .
However this fought back with a process to produce town gas from imported naptha rather than coal .
In RPI terms electricity prices bottomed out in the 1960s when it became cheap enough for ' all electric homes ' to be considered .
The bulk of electricity was generated from coal plus some nuclear power .
The oil price rises of 1973 and 1979 put paid to most of the gains of heating oil in the 1960s .
North Sea natural gas came to the rescue .
The whole country was converted from town gas and it was priced to be competitive with coal .
Effectively it wiped out the oil and coal heating markets and much of the rising electric heating market .
Britain became a nation of homes with gas - fired central heating .
In the 1990s even the power stations started to burn gas rather than coal .
We can also look at this price history through ' earnings deflated ' prices ( above ) .
As per capita GDP and earnings have increased so an ' average wage ' has been able to purchase more and more energy .
This has the effect of ' tilting ' the whole price curve making energy look even cheaper today than it has been in the past .
So although the price of electricity in 1960 was not that much different to today 's price in ' real ' terms ( i.e. in the equivalent number of loaves of bread or eggs ) , the average wage can afford to buy over twice as much electricity .
It is also noticeable that the ' earnings deflated ' price of coal is amazingly flat over the whole of the 20th century .
I suspect that this is because the price was mainly determined by the wages of the miners .
But now things are going awry .
In RPI terms all of the fuel prices have risen since 2000 .
GDP and earnings are still going up , but apparently not fast enough to deflate away the fuel price rises .
Domestic energy is now set to consume an increasing proportion of the household budget .
In 2000 ' fuel and power ' made up 3.3 % of the UK household expenditure .
However , this is a long way short of the peak of over 6 % in the mid-1960s .
If you go back a really long way a budget study of a 1760s Berkshire family estimated that it took 1 % of their income just to buy two candles a day .
I 'm not sure where the road forward ( to the Olduvai Gorge ? ) will take us .
But surely if we 're all so much richer than we were in the past ( through the magic of economic growth ) we should be able to afford decent insulated homes and a genuinely sustainable energy system .

This study was supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and by MIT 's Office of the Provost and Laboratory for Energy and the Environment .
An interdisciplinary MIT faculty group decided to study the future of nuclear power because of a belief that this technology is an important option for the United States and the world to meet future energy needs without emitting carbon dioxide and other atmospheric pollutants .
Other options include increased efficiency , renewables , and carbon sequestration , and all may be needed for a successful greenhouse gas management strategy .
This study , addressed to government , industry , and academic leaders , discusses the interrelated technical , economic , environmental , and political challenges facing a significant increase in global nuclear power utilization over the next half century and what might be done to overcome those challenges .
MIT RELEASES INTERDISCIPLINARY
STUDY ON " THE FUTURE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY "
Professors John Deutch and Ernest Moniz Chaired Effort to Identify Barriers and Solutions for Nuclear Option in Reducing Greenhouse Gases
July 29 , 2003
Washington , D.C. —
A distinguished team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and Harvard released today what co-chair Dr. John Deutch calls " the most comprehensive , interdisciplinary study ever conducted on the future of nuclear energy . "
The report maintains that " The nuclear option should be retained precisely because it is an important carbon - free source of power . "
" Fossil fuel - based electricity is projected to account for more than 40 % of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 , " said Deutch .
" In the U.S. 90 % of the carbon emissions from electricity generation come from coal - fired generation , even though this accounts for only 52 % of the electricity produced .
Taking nuclear power off the table as a viable alternative will prevent the global community from achieving long - term gains in the control of carbon dioxide emissions . "
But the prospects for nuclear energy as an option are limited , the report finds , by four unresolved problems : high relative costs ; perceived adverse safety , environmental , and health effects ; potential security risks stemming from proliferation ; and unresolved challenges in long - term management of nuclear wastes .
The study examines a growth scenario where the present deployment of 360 GWe of nuclear capacity worldwide is expanded to 1000 GWe in mid-century , keeping nuclear 's share of the electricity market about constant .
Deployment in the U.S. would expand from about 100 GWe today to 300 GWe in mid-century .
This scenario is not a prediction , but rather a study case in which nuclear power would make a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emissions .
" There is no question that the up - front costs associated with making nuclear power competitive , are higher than those associated with fossil fuels , " said Dr. Moniz .
" But as our study shows , there are many ways to mitigate these costs and , over time , the societal and environmental price of carbon emissions could dramatically improve the competitiveness of nuclear power "
The study offers a number of recommendations for making the nuclear energy option viable , including :
Placing increased emphasis on the once - through fuel cycle as best meeting the criteria of low costs and proliferation resistance ;
Offering a limited production tax - credit to ' first movers ' - private sector investors who successfully build new nuclear plants .
This tax credit is extendable to other carbon - free electricity technologies and is not paid unless the plant operates ;
Having government more fully develop the capabilities to analyze life - cycle health and safety impacts of fuel cycle facilities ;
Advancing a U.S. Department of Energy balanced long - term waste management R&D program .
Urging DOE to establish a Nuclear System Modeling project that would collect the engineering data and perform the analysis necessary to evaluate alternative reactor concepts and fuel cycles using the criteria of cost , safety , waste , and proliferation resistance .
Expensive development projects should be delayed pending the outcome of this multi-year effort .
Giving countries that forego proliferation - risky enrichment and reprocessing activities a preferred position to receive nuclear fuel and waste management services from nations that operate the entire fuel cycle .
The authors of the study emphasized that nuclear power is not the only non-carbon option and stated that they believe it should be pursued as a long term option along with other options such as the use of renewable energy sources , increased efficiency , and carbon sequestration ..
The members of the study team are : John Deutch ( co- chair ) , Ernest Moniz ( co-chair ) , S. Ansolabehere , Michael Driscoll , Paul Gray , John Holdren ( Harvard ) , Paul Joskow , Richard Lester , and Neil Todreas .
Members of the Advisory Committee included : former U.S. Congressman Phil Sharp ( chair ) , former White House Chiefs of Staff John Podesta and John Sununu , John Ahearne , Tom Cochran , Linn Draper , Ted Greenwood , John MacWilliams , Jessica Mathews , Zack Pate , and Mason Willrich .

NBA referees manipulated Game 6 of a 2002 playoff series to favor the Lakers and bring about a seventh game against the Sacramento Kings , disgraced former referee Tim Donaghy has alleged .
Describing two former referee peers as “ company men , ” Donaghy claims in a letter filed by his lawyer that “ it was in the NBA ’s interest to add another game to the series . ”
Without naming the teams involved , the letter to U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon in Brooklyn describes a playoff series in 2002 that went seven games .
The Lakers trailed Sacramento in the Western Conference finals , three games to two , before winning Games 6 and 7 — the only series that year that lasted seven games .
In Game 6 , Sacramento ’s Vlade Divac and Scot Pollard fouled out trying to guard Los Angeles ’ Shaquille O’Neal , and the Lakers shot 40 free throws — 15 more than the Kings — including 27 in the final quarter .

I bought groceries at Trader Joe ’s the other day .
As anyone who has ever shopped there knows , Trader Joe ’s is full of incredibly attractive , cheap food , which , if you manage to make it through all the plastic packaging it comes in , you can actually eat .
Unfortunately , by the time I started cooking I had more or less lost my appetite , since every time I discarded one of those packages I felt like I dropped another circle in hell .
So I pretty much love Daniel Burd right now .
The 16 - year - old from Waterloo , Ontario , as part of a science fair project , figured out a way to break down the polymers in plastic bags — compounds that can last for over 1,000 years — in about three months .
Essentially , Burd hypothesized that since the bags eventually do degrade , it must be possible to isolate and augment the degrading agents .
Turns out that it ’s not only possible , it ’s kind of easy .
Burd combined ground polyethylene plastic bags , sodium chloride , dirt from a landfill ( which theoretically contains the microorganisms that ultimately degrade the plastic ) and a yeast mixture in shakers for four weeks at a consistent temperature of about 86 degrees .
At the end of the month , he took a sample of that mixture and combined it with a new one , with the goal of increasing the overall concentration of microbes .
After one more repetition , he put fresh plastic bags in his solution for six weeks .
In the end , the plastic degraded nearly 20 % .
A little more filtering to figure out exactly which microbes were the most effective , and he upped the degradation rate to 32 % .
He concludes , “ The process of polyethylene degradation developed in this project can be used on an industrial scale for biodegradation of plastic bags .
As a result , this would save the lives of millions of wildlife species and save space in landfills . ”
So , will this really work ?
Has a teenager really found a way to rid us of one of our most persistent environmental problems ?
Who knows , but judges at the Canada - Wide Science Fair apparently agree that it ’s worth pursuing .
They sent Burd home with $ 30,000 in awards and scholarships .
You can read his final report ( all six pages of it ) here ( .pdf ) .

Back in November of last year — on the first of the month , in fact — I bought Radiohead ’s new album , then explained why I was happy with the purchase in an SOB entry titled In Rainbows — definitely worth the money .
Later , I wrote an article for the IT Security Weblog at TechRepublic provocatively titled Radiohead knows more than Microsoft about security .
In it , I opined at some length about the stupidity of pursuing a business model predicated upon artificial scarcity when technology has essentially automated away all the costs involved in generating plenty .
In summary , Microsoft has been increasingly in bed with DRM pushers like the RIA and MPAA , going so far as embedding media anti-copying measures in its operating systems .
Aside from being an insulting assault on Microsoft ’s own customer base , an attempt to circumvent rights protected by the doctrine of fair use , and directly interfering with the ability of many users to actually make any use at all of some digital media , this behavior is also an exercise in futility .
Nine Inch Nails had pretty quickly followed the Radiohead example .
Check out the TechCrunch article , Nine Inch Nails Help Seal Record Industry ’s Coffin , as well as the NIN website , for more details .
That TechCrunch article , by the way , basically just highlights the way NIN gave the RIAA the finger .
I enjoyed reading it .
Whereas I had never really been a huge fan of Radiohead , but liked some of their music well enough and decided to give
In Rainbows a chance , my relationship with NIN over the years was somewhat the opposite .
Back in the early ’90s , I loved Nine Inch Nails .
I still think Broken is one of the most emotionally intense albums I ’ve ever encountered ( that ’s a good thing , by the way ) , and the very rough - edged nature of the performances on Pretty Hate Machine really lent something to its cachet .
Unfortunately , Broken was ( in my opinion ) the zenith of NIN ’s quality arc .
Everything since has been downhill .
Judging simply by my own personal standards of quality , The Downward Spiral ( almost as good as Pretty Hate Machine , at least in some respects ) was the last thing I ’ve heard from NIN that was worth the time .
Do n’t get me started on the club - kid “ oooee - oooee ” so - called “ music ” of The Fragile .
I did n’t sign on for borderline Deep House crap when I started listening to NIN back in the day .
As a result of this declining enjoyment of NIN ’s music , I never bothered to give the new stuff ( free of RIAA puppetry ) a listen .
As I sit here typing this , however , it occurs to me that I should .
I really should give NIN another chance , if only because :
I can get it for free , and decide later whether it ’s worth it to me to give NIN any more of my money .
It ’s available in FLAC format ( as well as WAV ) .
I love FLAC .
I really should be doing something to support bands that crawl out of the primordial ooze of the traditional record industry and into the new millennium with a business model adjusted somewhat toward , y’know , ethical dealings and reason .
So — I do n’t really have the highest hopes for the music itself , but my mind is open .
If it turns out to be good enough to make it worthwhile for me , I ’ll probably even buy the physical media version of it ( details for the CD release this July promised by NIN ) .
Okay , so in the middle of typing that last sentence , I entered my email address in the form at the download Website for the album the slip , so I ’m already on my way to finding out whether I ’ll like it .
Amusingly , comments to articles about both events — the Radiohead and NIN Internet releases of new material , and the bands ’ parting of the ways with standard RIAA label practices — often bring up the Metallica vs. Napster fiasco .
Back in 2000 , Lars Ulrich ( mediocre Metallica drummer ) “ personally delivered a 60,000 - page printout of the Napster users who were sharing Metallica songs ” as the first volley in a war on file sharing networks .
Many Metallica fans never forgave the band , and many potential future Metallica fans were imbued with hatred for those who set in motion the death of Napster such that they never would become fans .
It was , in fact , Metallica ’s actions that made me more than only peripherally aware that Napster existed .
Thanks to the publicity this generated , I quickly learned enough about the circumstances to understand that Metallica and the RIAA were attacking a technology as a response to their own failure to adjust their business model to changing times , blaming the advancement of information technologies for their own shortcomings as though such advancement was a crime and the record industry had some kind of unalienable right to an eternally static business model .
Some of you who have at least rudimentary arithmetic skills and have been paying particular attention to my vitriolic ramblings over the last couple years may have noticed , by the end of that last paragraph , that the Napster fiasco occurred about three years before the eye - opening discussion I had with a friend that caused me to reevaluate all my opinions about copyright law .
Before 2003 , I was a supporter of copyright law , and believed all that claptrap about artists “ owning their work ” , having never really thought past the the “ ideas as property ” propaganda to which I ’ve been subjected for most of my life until I met Ratha ( the above - linked friend ) .
In other words , I still supported copyright , and supported Metallica ’s “ right ” to defend its revenue stream when the Napster deal blew up , but found the way it was doing so reprehensible and short - sighted at best .
In any case , I liked Metallica back in the day — way back in the day .
The black album was the last thing they ’ve done that I really liked , though — and some of that is really kind of insipid , as I realized when I eventually started paying attention to some of the lyrics .
I was in the Army — stationed in Italy , to be more specific — when Load came out , and I was surprised to discover that Metallica had a new album .
Being overseas in the military can have some stunting effects on one ’s cultural relevancy .
This alone is probably worth a brief story , but to get to the point : I bought it , listened to it , and realized immediately it was commercialized , soulless crap .
I can forgive “ commercialized ” and “ soulless ” sometimes , but “ crap ” is not so easy to overlook .
I stopped paying attention to Metallica , reacted badly to a couple new songs from ReLoad on the radio when it came out ( worse than Load , if that ’s possible ) , and just generally decided something good had died .
I did n’t feel like I had lost much when Metallica ’s diva BS and ridiculous grandstanding over the Napster matter sealed the band ’s coffin in my opinion , because I stopped caring about Metallica when the last vestige of talent in the band ’s music died off .
Here ’s where things go a little sideways .
. . .
In Metallica Repents , Sort Of , Wired reports on Metallica ’s attempt to curry favor with its more Internet - savvy fans and maybe win back some ex-fans by offering some free material online as well .
Of course , Metallica is n’t doing the kind of new business model experimentation that Radiohead and NIN did by any stretch of the imagination — this is basically just a stupid publicity stunt , giving away some “ tantalizing ” ( if you like Metallica ’s new material ) tastes of what ’s coming out on a new album before it ’s officially released in traditional record industry style .
In Wired ’s follow - up article , Fans Rip Metallica a New One , it is pointed out that to many this nigh - fraudulent marketing ploy was “ too little , too late ” to many former Metallica fans .
Not only was this nothing near the kind of stand - out approach of Radiohead and NIN ( to say nothing of the Charlatans ’ similar move ) , but it ’s just business as usual ( freebie samplings are n’t exactly new marketing technique ) with the word “ Internet ” thrown in .
My favorite comment in response to the article , by Stephan Miller :
God , Metallica , have a plane crash already .
I guess suing fans for exactly the behavior Metallica encouraged in the ’ 80s , the fan behavior that made the band a huge sensation in the first place , left a mark that wo n’t come out .
Metallica is n’t the only band being stupid these days , of course .
Prince , who might actually still be capable of producing quality music these days , has also kinda stepped on his own penis , in a manner of speaking .
At Coachella , Prince performed a live cover of Radiohead ’s Creep to tremendous applause .
Fans recorded it and uploaded the video to YouTube .
Can you guess where this tale is going ?
Prince ’s label , NPG Records , sent takedown a takedown notice to YouTube claiming copyright violation .
YouTube ( a Google subsidiary these days , if you were n’t aware ) complied .
Radiohead ’s Thom Yorke “ laughed when his bandmate , guitarist Ed O’Brien , said the blocking had prevented him from seeing Prince ’s version of their song . ”
More from the article , Radiohead to Prince : Unblock ‘ Creep ’ cover videos :

He ’s blocked it ? ” asked Yorke , who figured it was their song to block or not .
“ Surely we should block it .
Hang on a moment . ”
Yorke added : “ Well , tell him to unblock it .
It ’s our … song . ”
I can only imagine those ellipsis points stand in for something like “ fucking ” .
Here ’s my edited “ artist ’s rendition ” version of how that must have gone :
“ Really ?
He ’s blocked it ? ” asked Yorke , who figured it was their song to block or not .
“ Surely we should block it .
Hang on a moment . ”
Yorke added : “ Well , tell him to unblock it .
It ’s our fucking song . ”
Here ’s a little more from the article :
The dispute was an interesting twist in debates over digital ownership , held between two major acts with differing views on music and the Internet .
Radiohead famously released their most recent album , “ In Rainbows , ” as a digital download with optional pricing .
They also have a channel on YouTube .
When Prince performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio , Calif. , on April 26 , he prohibited the standard arrangement of allowing photographers to shoot near the stage during the first three songs of his set .
Instead , he had a camera crew filming his performance .
Just go read the article .
It ’s interesting , and goes into more depth on this particular incident .
When the article was originally written , the most popular YouTube video related to Prince ’s performance of Creep was a scathing review of the live cover , Prince ’s business model , and probably his mother — my eyes glazed over toward the end of the video , frankly , but it was entertaining for a while .
That video was taken down , too , but is now available at dailymotion.com instead .
We ’re seeing a split forming right down the middle of industries that face major changes in the present and future with the popularization and advancement of digital media technologies .
On one hand are those who are changing with the times , or at least not more than a couple steps behind the times , and on the other are those who want to freeze the world in amber so they can guarantee revenue streams without having to do anything , y’know , original or good .
I can wait to see the mass extinction of the dinosaurs when reality catches up with them .
ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) - Controversial Turkish Islamic author Adnan Oktar was sentenced to three years in prison on Friday for creating an illegal organization for personal gain , state - run Anatolian news agency said .
A spokeswoman for his Science Research Foundation ( BAV ) confirmed to Reuters that Oktar had been sentenced but said the judge was influenced by political and religious pressure groups .
Oktar had been tried with 17 other defendants in an Istanbul court .
The verdict and sentence came after a previous trial that began in 2000 after Oktar , along with 50 members of his foundation , was arrested in 1999 .
In that court case , Oktar had been charged with using threats for personal benefit and creating an organization with the intent to commit a crime .
The charges were dropped but another court picked them up resulting in the latest case .
Oktar planned to appeal the sentence , a BAV spokeswoman said .
No further details were immediately available .
Oktar , born in 1956 , is the driving force behind a richly funded movement based in Turkey that champions creationism , the belief that God literally created the world in six days as told in the Bible and the Koran .
Istanbul - based Oktar , who writes under the pen name Harun Yahya , has created waves in the past few years by sending out thousands of unsolicited texts advocating Islamic creationism to schools in several European countries .
TENSIONS HIGH
The court decision comes at a time when political tensions in officially secular but predominantly Muslim Turkey are high as the ruling AK Party faces a court case that seeks its closure for alleged Islamist activities , a claim the party denies .
Oktar ’s teachings echo those of Christian fundamentalists in the United States .
He has publicly denounced Darwinism and Freemasonry in high - profile attacks .
Charles Darwin came up with the widely adopted evolutionary theory of natural selection in the 19th century .
Oktar ’s publishing house has published dozens of books that have been distributed in more than 150 countries and been translated into more than 50 languages .
He has a wide following in the Muslim world .
But Turkish commentators say the group ’s books , numbering more than 200 , are probably written by a pool of writers , a charge the author denies .
With March 20 marking the fifth anniversary of the United States - led invasion of Iraq , it 's time to take stock of what has happened .
In our new book The Three Trillion Dollar War , Harvard 's Linda Bilmes and I conservatively estimate the economic cost of the war to the U.S. to be $ 3 trillion , and the costs to the rest of the world to be another $ 3 trillion – far higher than the Bush administration 's estimates before the war .
The Bush team not only misled the world about the war 's possible costs , but has also sought to obscure the costs as the war has gone on .
This is not surprising .
After all , the Bush administration lied about everything else , from Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction to his supposed link with Al Qaeda .
Indeed , only after the U.S. - led invasion did Iraq become a breeding ground for terrorists .
The Bush administration said the war would cost $ 50 billion .
The U.S. now spends that amount in Iraq every three months .
To put that number in context :
For one - sixth of the cost of the war , the U.S. could put its social security system on a sound footing for more than a half - century , without cutting benefits or raising contributions .
Moreover , the Bush administration cut taxes for the rich as it went to war , despite running a budget deficit .
As a result , it has had to use deficit spending – much of it financed from abroad – to pay for the war .
This is the first war in American history that has not demanded some sacrifice from citizens through higher taxes ; instead , the entire cost is being passed onto future generations .
Unless things change , the U.S. national debt – which was $ 5.7 trillion when Bush became president – will be $ 2 trillion higher because of the war ( in addition to the $ 800 billion increase under Bush before the war ) .
Was this incompetence or dishonesty ?
Almost surely both .
Cash accounting meant that the Bush administration focused on today 's costs , not future costs , including disability and health care for returning veterans .
Only years after the war began did the administration order the specially armoured vehicles that would have saved the lives of many killed by roadside bombs .
Not wanting to reintroduce a draft , and finding it difficult to recruit for an unpopular war , troops have been forced into two , three or four stress - filled deployments .
The administration has tried to keep the war 's costs from the American public .
Veterans groups have used the Freedom of Information Act to discover the total number of injured – 15 times the number of fatalities .
Already , 52,000 returning veterans have been diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
The U.S. government will need to provide disability compensation to an estimated 40 per cent of the 1.65 million troops that have already been deployed .
And , of course , the bleeding will continue as long as the war continues , with the health - care and disability bill amounting to more than $ 600 billion ( in present - value terms ) .
Ideology and profiteering have also played a role in driving up the war 's costs .
America has relied on private contractors , which have not come cheap .

A Blackwater Security guard can cost more than $ 1,000 per day , not including disability and life insurance , which is paid for by the government .
When unemployment rates in Iraq soared to 60 per cent , hiring Iraqis would have made sense ; but the contractors preferred to import cheap labour from Nepal , the Philippines and other countries .
The war has had only two winners : oil companies and defence contractors .
The stock price of Halliburton , Vice - President Dick Cheney 's old company , has soared .
But even as the government turned increasingly to contractors , it reduced its oversight .
The largest cost of this mismanaged war has been borne by Iraq .
Half of Iraq 's doctors have been killed or have left the country , unemployment stands at 25 per cent and , five years after the war 's start , Baghdad still has less than eight hours of electricity a day .
Out of Iraq 's total population of around 28 million , 4 million are displaced and 2 million have fled the country .
The thousands of violent deaths have inured most Westerners to what is going on : A bomb blast that kills 25 hardly seems newsworthy anymore .
But statistical studies of death rates before and after the invasion tell some of the grim reality .
They suggest additional deaths from a low of around 450,000 in the first 40 months of the war ( 150,000 of them violent deaths ) to 600,000 .
With so many people in Iraq suffering so much in so many ways , it may seem callous to discuss the economic costs .
And it may seem particularly self - absorbed to focus on the economic costs to America , which embarked on this war in violation of international law .
But the economic costs are enormous , and they go well beyond budgetary outlays .
Americans like to say that there is no such thing as a free lunch .
Nor is there such a thing as a free war .
The U.S. – and the world – will be paying the price for decades to come .

It 's official : Thanks to overwhelming grassroots action , and the heroic efforts of Senators Dodd and Feingold , the Senate 's vote on whether to grant phone companies immunity from the law for assisting in the President 's illegal wiretapping program has been delayed until after July 4th Recess !
This is an unexpected reprieve for civil liberties and the rule of law .
As recently as last night , the mainstream press was reporting that the immunity bill would see swift and uncontested approval .
Senate Leaders emphasized that passing an immunity bill this week was one of their highest priorities .
And yet , in the end , the bill simply was n't as uncontested and noncontroversial as the pundits and politicans thought it was .
Longtime followers of the immunity issue may be reminded of similar events last December .
Then , as now , it was widely expected that the Senate would rubber - stamp an immunity bill with no meaningful debate .
And then , as now , overwhelming grassroots pressure unexpectedly derailed the bill .
That set the stage for a critical victory in March , when the house stood strong against immunity .
Similarly , today 's unexpected delay gives us time to shift the political dynamic in a more reasonable direction .
The best hope lies in the amendments that will be introduced before the final vote on the bill .
One , championed by Senators Dodd and Feingold , would strip immunity provisions entirely .
Another , from New Mexico Senator Bingaman , would delay implementation of the immunity provisions until after Congress had the benefit of the Inspectors General report on the President 's surveillance program that is required by the bill .
EFF would like to extend its sincere thanks to everyone who 's taken up this cause as their own .
Whether you 've contacted your Congressperson , blogged or written your thoughts on the issue , or just talked it over with friends , your action has made a difference today .
In the meantime , contact Senators Dodd , Feingold and Bingaman to send them your thanks and encouragement for their efforts .
They have done all Americans proud this week , and their efforts and support will be critical in the coming weeks .
Then , if you have n't already , contact your own Senators and tell them where you stand .

Three Canadian soldiers kicked Paul Croutch , a sleeping homeless man , " like a football , " then assaulted a woman who tried to intervene , warning her that " bums " are n't welcome in Toronto 's Moss Park , a prosecutor says .
" `Tell all your friends the park is ours .
We own it , ' " Pte.
Brian Deganis told Valerie Valen as he and two fellow reservists dragged and hit her , assistant Crown attorney Hank Goody alleged yesterday , outlining evidence he expects to present .
Deganis thrust his military dog tags into her face , " saying that they gave them the right to do whatever they wanted to her and all derelict homeless bums , " Goody told a jury as he opened the Crown 's case .
Deganis , 24 , Jeffery Hall , 24 , and Mountaz Ibrahim , 25 , have pleaded not guilty to second - degree murder in Croutch 's death , and to assault causing bodily harm to Valen .
They were trained combat soldiers , reserve members of the Queen 's Own Rifles of Canada , an airborne infantry unit based in the Moss Park Armoury .
On Aug. 31 , 2005 , Croutch , 59 , was asleep on a bench between a set of tennis courts and a baseball diamond .
" Moss Park was Paul Croutch 's bedroom and the bench his bed , " Goody said .
Croutch was not in good health and suffered from diseases of the heart and lungs .
He had hardening of the arteries , high blood pressure and emphysema , Goody said , as well as swelling of the legs , which made walking difficult .
That night , he had wrapped himself in garbage bags to protect himself from the elements .
" Unfortunately , they offered no protection from the fate that was to befall him , " Goody said .
Shortly after 4 a.m. , the three accused allegedly punched and kicked him in the head , mid-section and back , Goody said .
" Mr. Croutch was kicked , as the Crown expects you will hear it described , like a football – so hard that his body was being lifted off the ground , until it finally came to rest several feet behind the bench .
" Paul Croutch never saw it coming , " Goody said , nor did he offer any resistance , or move of his own volition during the beating .
Immediately before the attack , Goody said , the three accused men had come from the armoury where Deganis was allegedly heard by a senior officer to say that he hated bums and homeless people and wanted to take them on .
One or more of the accused were under the influence of alcohol , Goody said .
Valen was passing through the park , walking from Shuter St. to visit friends at Fred Victor Centre , a shelter on Queen St. E. , when she heard someone " calling out about a homeless bum , " Goody said .
Valen said she saw the soldiers beating Croutch and yelled out to them , asking what they were doing .
Although it was not true , Valen told them she had a cellphone and would call police .
The three approached her and she began to retreat toward Queen St .
She was told to start running , only to have her legs kicked out from under her .
When she fell , she was allegedly beaten about the body and dragged through the park while being called a " bum " or " whore , " Goody said .

Update 6 : : Back to the Future for Data Storage .
We are in the middle of a renaissance in data storage with the application of many new ideas and techniques ; there 's huge potential for breaking out of thinking about data storage in just one way .
Update 5 : Building Scalable Web Applications with Google App Engine by Brett Slatkin .
Update 4 : Why Google App Engine is broken and what Google must do to fix it by Aral Balkan .
We do n't care that it can scale .
We care that it does scale .
And that it scales when you need it the most .
Issues : 1MB limit on data structures ; 1 MB limit on data structures ; the short - term high CPU quota ; quotas in general ; Admin ?
What 's that ?
Update 3 : BigTable Blues .
Catherine Devlin could n't port an application to GAE because it can't do basic filtering and can't search 5,000 records without timing out : " Querying from 5000 records - too much for the mighty BigTable , apparently . "
Followup : not the future database .
" 90 % of the work of this project has been trying to figure out workarounds and kludges for its bizzare limitations . "
Update 2 : Having doubts about AppEngine .
Excellent and surprisingly civil debate on if GAE is a viable delivery platform for real applications .
Concerns swirl over poor performance , lack of a roadmap , perpetual beta status , poor support , and a quota system as torture chamber model of scalability .
GAE is obviously part of Google 's grand plan ( browser , gears , android , etc ) to emasculate Microsoft , so the future looks bright , but is GAE a good choice now ?
Update :
Here are a few experience reports of developers using GAE .
Diwaker Gupta likes how easy it is to get started on the good documentation .
Does n't like all the limits and poor performance .
James here and here also likes the ease of use but finds the data model takes some getting used to and is concerned the API limits wo n't scale for a real site .
He does n't like how external connections are handled and wants a database where the schema is easier to manage .
These posts mirror some of my own concerns .
GAE is scalable for Google , but it may not be scalable for my application .
It 's been a few days now since GAE ( Google App Engine ) was released and we had our First Look .
It 's high time for a retrospective .
Too soon ?
Hey , this is Internet time baby .
So how is GAE doing ?
I did get an invite so hopefully I 'll have a more experience grounded take a little later .
I do n't know Python and being the more methodical type it may take me a while .
To perform our retrospective we 'll take a look at the three sources of information available to us : actual applications in the AppGallery , blogspew , and developer issues in the forum .
The result : a cautious thumbs up .
The biggest issue so far seems to be the change in mindset needed by developers to use GAE .
BigTable is not MySQL .
The runtime environment is not a VM .
A service based approach is not the same as using libraries .
A scalable architecture is not the same as one based on optimizing speed .
A different approach is needed , but as of yet Google does n't give you all the tools you need to fully embrace the red pill vision .
I think this quote by Brandon Smith in a thread on how to best implement sessions in GAE nicely sums up the new perspective :
Consider the lack of your daddy 's sessions a feature .
It 's what will make your app scale on Google 's infrastructure .
In other words : when in Rome .
But how do we know what the Romans do when the Romans do what they do ?
Brett Morgan expands our cultural education in a thread on slow GAE databases performance when he talks about why MySQL thinking wo n't work on BigTable :
It might look almost look like a sql db when you squint , but it 's
optimized for a totally different goal .
If you think that each
different entity you retrieve could be retrieving a different disk
block from a different machine in the cluster , then suddenly things
start to make sense . avg ( ) over a column in a sql server makes sense ,
because the disk accesses are pulling blocks in a row from the same
disk ( hopefully ) , or even better , all from the same ram on the one
computer .
With DataStore , which is built on top of BigTable , which is
built on top of GFS , there ain't no such promise .
Each entity in
DataStore is quite possibly a different file in gfs .
So if you build things such that web requests are only ever pulling a
single entity from DataStore - by always precomputing everything -
then your app will fly on all the read requests .
In fact , if that
single entity gets hot - is highly utilized across the cluster - then
it will be replicated across the cluster .
Yes , this means that everything that we think we know about building
web applications is suddenly wrong .
But this is actually a good thing .
Having been on the wrong side of trying to scale up web app code , I
can honestly say it is better to push the requirements of scaling into
the face of us developers so that we do the right thing from the
beginning .
It 's easier to solve the issues at the start , than try and
retrofit hacks at the end of the development cycle .
A truly excellent explanation of the differences between MySQL thinking and GAE thinking .
Now , if you can't use MySQL's avg feature , how can an average be calculated using BigTable ?
Brett advises :
Instead of calculating the results at query time , calculate them when
you are adding the records .
This means that displaying the results is
just a lookup , and that the calculation costs are amortized over each
record addition .
Clearly this is more work for the programmer and at first blush does n't seem worth the effort , especially when you are used to the convenience of MySQL .
That 's why in the same thread Barry Hunter insightfully comments that GAE may not be for everyone :
This might be a very naive observation , but I perhaps wonder then if
GAE is the tool for you .
As I see it the App Engine is for applications that are meant to
scale , scale and really scale .
Sounds like an application with a few
hundred hits daily could easily run on traditional hosting platforms .
It 's a completely different mindset .
...
Again maybe I am missing something , but the DataStore is n't designed to
be super fast at the small scale , but rather handle large amounts of
data , and be distributed ( and because its distributed it can appear
very fast at large scale ) .
So you break down your database access into very simple processes .
Assume your database access is VERY slow , and rethink how you do
things .
( Of course the piece in the puzzle ' we ' are missing is
MapReduce ! - the ' processing ' part of the BigTable mindset )
Before developers can take full advantage of GAE these types of lessons need to be extracted and popularized with the same ferocity the multi-tier RDBMS framework has been marketed .
It will be a long difficult transition .
Interestingly , many lessons from AWS are not transferable to GAE .
AWS has a VM model whereas GAE has an application centric model .
They are inverses of each other .
In AWS you have a bag of lowish level components out of which you architect your application .
You can write all the fine low level implementations bits you desire .
A service layer is then put in front of everything to hide the components .
In GAE you have a high level application component and you build out your application using services .
You can't build any low level components in GAE .
In AWS the goal is to drive load to the CPU because CPU and bandwidth are plentiful .
In GAE you get very limitted CPU , certainly none to burn on useless activities like summing up an average over a whole slice of data returned from SimpleDB .
And in GAE the amount of data returnable from the database is small so your architecture needs to be very smart about how data is stored and accessed .
Very different approaches that lead to very different applications .
Applications
The number of applications has exploded .
I am always amazed at how enthusiastic and productive people can be when they are actually interested in what they are doing .
It happens so rarely .
True , most applications are n't even up to Facebook standards yet , but it 's early days .
What 's impressive is how fast they were created and deployed .
That speaks volumes about the efficacy of the application centric development model .
Will it be as effective delivering " real " apps ?
That 's a question I 'm not sure about .
So far application performance is acceptable .
Certainly nothing spectacular .
What can you do about it ?
Nada .
I like the sketch application because people immediately and quite predictably drew lewd depictions of various body parts .
I also like this early incarnation of a forum app .
A forum is one of the ideas I thought might work well on AppEngine because the scalable storage problem is solved .
I do wonder how the performance will be with a fine tuned caching layer ?
Vorby is a movie quote site showing a more realistic level of complexity .
It has tabs , long lists of text , some graphical elements , some more complex screens , and ratings .
It shows you can make applications you would n't mind people using .
An option I 'd like to see in the App Gallery is a view source link .
Developers could indicate when adding an application if others can view their application source .
Then when browsing the gallery we could all learn by looking at real working code .
This is how html spread so quickly .
Anyone could view the source for any page , copy paste , and you 're on your way !
With an application centric model the view source viral spread approach would also work .
Blogspew
As expected there 's lots of blog activity on GAE :
As to all those people complaining their favorite language is n't available , take a chill pill , Urubatan asks us When will programmers learn that a language is just a tool ?.
I mostly agree with this take , but I also agree with a commenter who observed that it's a lot harder for a team of developers to turn on a dime and adopt a whole new everything .
Garrick Van Buren says Free & Open Is Its Own Lock - in .
The idea being it 's worthing paying something you know works , allows you to experiment , and you are aligned with their zeitgeist .
Leaving that for " free " is n't a good deal .
evan_tech : google app engine limitations .
Do n't focus on minor problems .
The big problems are : all code runs only in response to HTTP fetches , No long connections means no " comet " ( server - push messaging ) , playing around with your data is hard as there 's no way to perform operations on your data except by uploading code to the server , Table scans are slow and you can't cache because it 's so slow you hit your CPU limit , bulk operations are hard , and no arbitrary queries .
RedMonk Clouds Rolling
In : The Google App Engine Q&A gives covers a lot of GAE territory .
List some of the cons : Python only , not database export , lock - in , and no cron . " ... all of the current offerings have limitations that throttle their usage .
Many of which are related to the lack of open standards .
Apart from the mostly standard Python implementation , App Engine is decidedly non-standard . "
Alex Bosworth pits AWS vs Google App Engine in a death match .
Alex thinks :
To be succinct , based on where the Google App Engine is today , I would say AWS still has a strong lead in application hosting , and I would not currently consider writing an application for Google ’s current platform .
Cons : Lockin ,
The page - view limitation is quite low , no memcache , No long running pages , or cron jobs , Storage size limitation , One language , No requests unless they are through Google ’s API .
Pros : it ’s free , looks pretty rocking , integrates with Google accounts .
Joyent is countering by offering free infrastructure for high volume python applications .
Joyent only asks " that you provide Joyent unlimited access to your customer information and clickstream data . "
Your data has a lot of value .
Google is also very aware of that .
More in my Why Does Google Do What Google Does ? post .
Though the Joyent 's building blocks approach is very different than Google 's application centric approach .
We 'll see which matters more : the model or facilities ?
Niall Kennedy in Google App Engine for developers does a great job contrasting the complexity of your normal website setup with an application approach .
Normally you : purchase dedicated servers or virtualized slices , capacity plan , configure web server , install Python , Apache , setup MySQL in scalable fault tolerant configuration , insert caching layer , add monitoring layer , add static file serving and bulk file serving , make it all work together , spend your life keeping it working and responding to failures .
Nicely drawn contrast to upload and go .
TechCrunch 's AppEngine test application could n't handle a TechCrunch level of load , which is a little concerning .
This means usage limits are set a bit low and with no pricing model to work from it 's reasonable to be concerned about the cost .
Nobody wants a cell phone overage nightmare for their website costs .
Groovy : Google Datastore and the shift from a RDBMS .
An excellent comparison of how BigTable differs from a RDBMS .
The conclusion :
The end result of this , is that the standard way a developer writes out the table schema for a RDBMS should be dumped almost entirely when considering an app using Google Datastore .
Service Level Automation in the Datacenter : What Google App Engine is NOT .
It 's a web play only , it 's not a cloud in the sense of datacenter infrastructure IT can move to .
You can't implement : Portal Services , SOA architectures , Business Process Automation , Enterprise integration , HPC , and Server and desktop virtualization .
A lot has been made of the risk of lock - in .
I do n't really agree with this as everything is based around services , which you can port to another infrastructure .
What 's more the problem is developers will be acquiring a sort of learned helplessness .
It 's not that developers can't port to another environment , they simply wo n't know how to anymore because they will have never had to do it themselves .
Their system design and infrastructure muscles will have atrophied so much from disuse that they 'll no longer be able to walk without the aide of their Google crutches .
More in another post .
Developer Forum
The best way to figure out how a system is doing is to read the developer support forum .
What problems and successes are real developers experiencing trying to get real work done ?
The forum is a hoppin ' .
As of this writing over 1300 developers have registered and nearly 400 topics are active .
What are developers talking about ?
Please support my favorite language : PHP , Ruby , etc .
Hey , they had to start somewhere and Python is as good as anything else .
A language is just a tool you know :-)
The usual this does n't work in my environment type of questions .
Far fewer than I would expect though .
The switch away from RDBMS thinking is n't coming naturally .
A lot of questions wondering how to access BigTable like MySQL and that wo n't work .
There are no joins in GQL , so how do you do normal things like get all the comments for a blog post ?
Lots of how do use this or that API questions .
Lack of certain commonly used APIs , like XML parsers is being being encountered .
Concern there 's no database export .
You can bulk upload data , but you have to write your own program to get it out again .
People are hitting limits like the 1MB upload limit on all requests .
The 1000 database return limit is mentioned a lot .
This is very different than the AWS model which advocates moving work to your CPU so it makes sense to return large sets of data .
Google limits your CPU usage and the amount of data you can return so you have to be smart how you store and query data .
The pure service model has profound limitations for certain application types .
An issue of how to do image processing came up .
Usually a compiled class is used because using pure Python is slow .
But you can't load these types of classes in AppEngine .
And you can't parallelize the work by farming it out to other CPUs .
You are stuck .
Here 's were a .
Net type managed object model might help .
Surprisingly , fulltext search is not supported .
Sessions are another how do I it on GAE question .
People are used to frameworks handling session storage .
One user was surprised at how slow database access was with BigTable .
It takes GAE almost 3 seconds to save 50 of dummy records ( consisting of just 2 text fields ) .
A nice thread about how best to use BigTable developed .
BigTable is meant to scale and you have to do things differently than you do in a MySQL world .
Many " how do I " questions come up because of the requirement for service level interfaces .
For example , something as simple as a hostname to IP mapping can't be done because you do n't have socket level access .
Someone , somewhere must make a service out of it .
Make an external service is a common response to problems .
You must make a service external to the GAE environment to get things to work which means you have to develop in multiple environments .
This sort of sucks .
To get cron functionality do I really need to create an external service outside of GAE ?
The outcome of all this is probably an accelerated servicifaction of everything .
What were once simple library calls must now be exposed with service level interfaces .
It 's not that I think HTTP is too heavy , but as development model it is extremely painful .
You are constantly hitting road blocks instead of getting stuff done .
Christine Rosen
In one of the many letters he wrote to his son in the 1740s , Lord Chesterfield offered the following advice : “ There is time enough for everything in the course of the day , if you do but one thing at once , but there is not time enough in the year , if you will do two things at a time . ”
To Chesterfield , singular focus was not merely a practical way to structure one ’s time ; it was a mark of intelligence .
“ This steady and undissipated attention to one object , is a sure mark of a superior genius ; as hurry , bustle , and agitation , are the never - failing symptoms of a weak and frivolous mind . ”
In modern times , hurry , bustle , and agitation have become a regular way of life for many people — so much so that we have embraced a word to describe our efforts to respond to the many pressing demands on our time : multitasking .
Used for decades to describe the parallel processing abilities of computers , multitasking is now shorthand for the human attempt to do simultaneously as many things as possible , as quickly as possible , preferably marshalling the power of as many technologies as possible .
In the late 1990s and early 2000s , one sensed a kind of exuberance about the possibilities of multitasking .
Advertisements for new electronic gadgets — particularly the first generation of handheld digital devices — celebrated the notion of using technology to accomplish several things at once .
The word multitasking began appearing in the “ skills ” sections of résumés , as office workers restyled themselves as high - tech , high - performing team players .
“ We have always multitasked — inability to walk and chew gum is a time - honored cause for derision — but never so intensely or self - consciously as now , ” James Gleick wrote in his 1999 book Faster .
“ We are multitasking connoisseurs — experts in crowding , pressing , packing , and overlapping distinct activities in our all - too - finite moments . ”
An article in the New York Times Magazine in 2001 asked , “ Who can remember life before multitasking ?
These days we all do it . ”
The article offered advice on “ How to Multitask ” with suggestions about giving your brain ’s “ multitasking hot spot ” an appropriate workout .
But more recently , challenges to the ethos of multitasking have begun to emerge .
Numerous studies have shown the sometimes - fatal danger of using cell phones and other electronic devices while driving , for example , and several states have now made that particular form of multitasking illegal .
In the business world , where concerns about time - management are perennial , warnings about workplace distractions spawned by a multitasking culture are on the rise .
In 2005 , the BBC reported on a research study , funded by Hewlett - Packard and conducted by the Institute of Psychiatry at the University of London , that found , “ Workers distracted by e-mail and phone calls suffer a fall in IQ more than twice that found in marijuana smokers . ”
The psychologist who led the study called this new “ infomania ” a serious threat to workplace productivity .
One of the Harvard Business Review ’s “ Breakthrough Ideas ” for 2007 was Linda Stone ’s notion of “ continuous partial attention , ” which might be understood as a subspecies of multitasking : using mobile computing power and the Internet , we are “ constantly scanning for opportunities and staying on top of contacts , events , and activities in an effort to miss nothing . ”
Dr. Edward Hallowell , a Massachusetts - based psychiatrist who specializes in the treatment of attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and has written a book with the self - explanatory title CrazyBusy , has been offering therapies to combat extreme multitasking for years ; in his book he calls multitasking a “ mythical activity in which people believe they can perform two or more tasks simultaneously . ”
In a 2005 article , he described a new condition , “ Attention Deficit Trait , ” which he claims is rampant in the business world .
ADT is “ purely a response to the hyperkinetic environment in which we live , ” writes Hallowell , and its hallmark symptoms mimic those of ADD .
“ Never in history has the human brain been asked to track so many data points , ” Hallowell argues , and this challenge “ can be controlled only by creatively engineering one ’s environment and one ’s emotional and physical health . ”
Limiting multitasking is essential .
Best - selling business advice author Timothy Ferriss also extols the virtues of “ single - tasking ” in his book , The 4 - Hour Workweek .
Multitasking might also be taking a toll on the economy .
One study by researchers at the University of California at Irvine monitored interruptions among office workers ; they found that workers took an average of twenty - five minutes to recover from interruptions such as phone calls or answering e-mail and return to their original task .
Discussing multitasking with the New York Times in 2007 , Jonathan B. Spira , an analyst at the business research firm Basex , estimated that extreme multitasking — information overload — costs the U.S. economy $ 650 billion a year in lost productivity .
Changing Our Brains
To better understand the multitasking phenomenon , neurologists and psychologists have studied the workings of the brain .
In 1999 , Jordan Grafman , chief of cognitive neuroscience at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ( part of the National Institutes of Health ) , used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scans to determine that when people engage in “ task - switching ” — that is , multitasking behavior — the flow of blood increases to a region of the frontal cortex called Brodmann area 10 .
( The flow of blood to particular regions of the brain is taken as a proxy indication of activity in those regions . )
“ This is presumably the last part of the brain to evolve , the most mysterious and exciting part , ” Grafman told the New York Times in 2001 — adding , with a touch of hyperbole , “ It ’s what makes us most human . ”
It is also what makes multitasking a poor long - term strategy for learning .
Other studies , such as those performed by psychologist René Marois of Vanderbilt University , have used fMRI to demonstrate the brain ’s response to handling multiple tasks .
Marois found evidence of a “ response selection bottleneck ” that occurs when the brain is forced to respond to several stimuli at once .
As a result , task - switching leads to time lost as the brain determines which task to perform .
Psychologist David Meyer at the University of Michigan believes that rather than a bottleneck in the brain , a process of “ adaptive executive control ” takes place , which “ schedules task processes appropriately to obey instructions about their relative priorities and serial order , ” as he described to the New Scientist .
Unlike many other researchers who study multitasking , Meyer is optimistic that , with training , the brain can learn to task - switch more effectively , and there is some evidence that certain simple tasks are amenable to such practice .
But his research has also found that multitasking contributes to the release of stress hormones and adrenaline , which can cause long - term health problems if not controlled , and contributes to the loss of short - term memory .
In one recent study , Russell Poldrack , a psychology professor at the University of California , Los Angeles , found that “ multitasking adversely affects how you learn .
Even if you learn while multitasking , that learning is less flexible and more specialized , so you cannot retrieve the information as easily . ”
His research demonstrates that people use different areas of the brain for learning and storing new information when they are distracted : brain scans of people who are distracted or multitasking show activity in the striatum , a region of the brain involved in learning new skills ; brain scans of people who are not distracted show activity in the hippocampus , a region involved in storing and recalling information .
Discussing his research on National Public Radio recently , Poldrack warned , “ We have to be aware that there is a cost to the way that our society is changing , that humans are not built to work this way .
We ’re really built to focus .
And when we sort of force ourselves to multitask , we ’re driving ourselves to perhaps be less efficient in the long run even though it sometimes feels like we ’re being more efficient . ”
If , as Poldrack concluded , “ multitasking changes the way people learn , ” what might this mean for today ’s children and teens , raised with an excess of new entertainment and educational technology , and avidly multitasking at a young age ?
Poldrack calls this the “ million - dollar question . ”
Media multitasking — that is , the simultaneous use of several different media , such as television , the Internet , video games , text messages , telephones , and e-mail — is clearly on the rise , as a 2006 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation showed : in 1999 , only 16 percent of the time people spent using any of those media was spent on multiple media at once ; by 2005 , 26 percent of media time was spent multitasking .
“ I multitask every single second I am online , ” confessed one study participant .
“ At this very moment I am watching TV , checking my e-mail every two minutes , reading a newsgroup about who shot JFK , burning some music to a CD , and writing this message . ”
The Kaiser report noted several factors that increase the likelihood of media multitasking , including “ having a computer and being able to see a television from it . ”
Also , “ sensation - seeking ” personality types are more likely to multitask , as are those living in “ a highly TV - oriented household . ”
The picture that emerges of these pubescent multitasking mavens is of a generation of great technical facility and intelligence but of extreme impatience , unsatisfied with slowness and uncomfortable with silence : “ I get bored if it ’s not all going at once , because everything has gaps — waiting for a website to come up , commercials on TV , etc. ” one participant said .
The report concludes on a very peculiar note , perhaps intended to be optimistic : “ In this media - heavy world , it is likely that brains that are more adept at media multitasking will be passed along and these changes will be naturally selected , ” the report states .
“ After all , information is power , and if one can process more information all at once , perhaps one can be more powerful . ”
This is techno - social Darwinism , nature red in pixel and claw .
Other experts are n’t so sure .
As neurologist Jordan Grafman told Time magazine : “ Kids that are instant messaging while doing homework , playing games online and watching TV , I predict , are n’t going to do well in the long run . ”
“ I think this generation of kids is guinea pigs , ” educational psychologist Jane Healy told the San Francisco Chronicle ; she worries that they might become adults who engage in “ very quick but very shallow thinking . ”
Or , as the novelist Walter Kirn suggests in a deft essay in The Atlantic , we might be headed for an “ Attention - Deficit Recession . ”
Paying Attention
When we talk about multitasking , we are really talking about attention : the art of paying attention , the ability to shift our attention , and , more broadly , to exercise judgment about what objects are worthy of our attention .
People who have achieved great things often credit for their success a finely honed skill for paying attention .
When asked about his particular genius , Isaac Newton responded that if he had made any discoveries , it was “ owing more to patient attention than to any other talent . ”
William James , the great psychologist , wrote at length about the varieties of human attention .
In The Principles of Psychology ( 1890 ) , he outlined the differences among “ sensorial attention , ” “ intellectual attention , ” “ passive attention , ” and the like , and noted the “ gray chaotic indiscriminateness ” of the minds of people who were incapable of paying attention .
James compared our stream of thought to a river , and his observations presaged the cognitive “ bottlenecks ” described later by neurologists :
“ On the whole easy simple flowing predominates in it , the drift of things is with the pull of gravity , and effortless attention is the rule , ” he wrote .
“ But at intervals an obstruction , a set - back , a log - jam occurs , stops the current , creates an eddy , and makes things temporarily move the other way . ”
To James , steady attention was thus the default condition of a mature mind , an ordinary state undone only by perturbation .
To readers a century later , that placid portrayal may seem alien — as though depicting a bygone world .
Instead , today ’s multitasking adult may find something more familiar in James ’s description of the youthful mind : an “ extreme mobility of the attention ” that “ makes the child seem to belong less to himself than to every object which happens to catch his notice . ”
For some people , James noted , this challenge is never overcome ; such people only get their work done “ in the interstices of their mind - wandering . ”
Like Chesterfield , James believed that the transition from youthful distraction to mature attention was in large part the result of personal mastery and discipline — and so was illustrative of character .
“ The faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention , over and over again , ” he wrote , “ is the very root of judgment , character , and will . ”
Today , our collective will to pay attention seems fairly weak .
We require advice books to teach us how to avoid distraction .
In the not - too - distant future we may even employ new devices to help us overcome the unintended attention deficits created by today ’s gadgets .
As one New York Times article recently suggested , “ Further research could help create clever technology , like sensors or smart software that workers could instruct with their preferences and priorities to serve as a high tech ‘ time nanny ’ to ease the modern multitasker ’s plight . ”
Perhaps we will all accept as a matter of course a computer governor — like the devices placed on engines so that people can’t drive cars beyond a certain speed .
Our technological governors might prompt us with reminders to set mental limits when we try to do too much , too quickly , all at once .
Then again , perhaps we will simply adjust and come to accept what James called “ acquired inattention . ”
E-mails pouring in , cell phones ringing , televisions blaring , podcasts streaming — all this may become background noise , like the “ din of a foundry or factory ” that James observed workers could scarcely avoid at first , but which eventually became just another part of their daily routine .
For the younger generation of multitaskers , the great electronic din is an expected part of everyday life .
And given what neuroscience and anecdotal evidence have shown us , this state of constant intentional self - distraction could well be of profound detriment to individual and cultural well - being .
When people do their work only in the “ interstices of their mind - wandering , ” with crumbs of attention rationed out among many competing tasks , their culture may gain in information , but it will surely weaken in wisdom .
Saint Augustine ( A.D. 354-430 ) in his work The Literal Meaning of Genesis ( De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim ) provided excellent advice for all Christians who are faced with the task of interpreting Scripture in the light of scientific knowledge .
This translation is by J. H. Taylor in Ancient Christian Writers , Newman Press , 1982 , volume 41 .
Usually , even a non-Christian knows something about the earth , the heavens , and the other elements of this world , about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions , about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon , the cycles of the years and the seasons , about the kinds of animals , shrubs , stones , and so forth , and this knowledge he hold to as being certain from reason and experience .
Now , it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian , presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture , talking nonsense on these topics ; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation , in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn .
The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided , but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions , and , to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil , the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men .
If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books , how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead , the hope of eternal life , and the kingdom of heaven , when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason ?
Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books .
For then , to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements , they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position , although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion . [ 1 Timothy 1.7 ]

15th , 2008 07:55 pm ActiveRecord Primitive Iterator : So You Don't Have to Select All Those Rows at Once Recently I needed to do a BFM ( Big Freakin ' Migration ) that would normalize 1.5 million rows of data into about 5 millions rows in 3 tables .
Reading and Writing ActiveRecord objects for them all was out of the question ; I needed to read bare SQL for memory and emit optimized MySQL inserts for speed .
I worked out a clean aggregation / mapping method to generate large optimized insert statements , but the select was killing me .
ActiveRecord wants to load all your objects in one go .
Not good .
Even the bare sql methods , select_all and select_rows , create an array , load the entire query , and then return the array .
Seriously not good .
Well , to make a long story short , I monkeypatched ActiveRecord 's MysqlAdapter .
I was rather pleased with myself¹ , and I promptly forgot about it because it was a grody hack that required great care from the user to keep it from leaking memory .
In short , it was the poster child for Why Not To Monkeypatch : it was equal parts awesome and donteverdothatagain .
I had abused Ruby 's flexibility in order to take the safety guards off of Rails , make a few key cuts , and then put the safety guards back on again .
But it was n't code you 'd ever want to see in production .
I patted myself on the back , scolded myself for being a naughty boy , and then forgot all about it .
But then it started bugging me .
There was a really good idea in that hack .
They say information wants to be free .
Well , this code wanted to be cleaned up and allowed out of the basement .
And then Flying Machine Studios blogged about a similar problem .
And in the comments to that , I saw that Jamis Buck had blogged about it a year ago .
So clearly there was a need for this kind of solution .
Both of their solutions involved chunking things up using SQL LIMIT statements , which can become slow with large queries -- and large queries are the whole reason we went down this rabbit hole in the first place .
My hack is pretty simple : I just made select_all and select_rows take a block argument .
If a block is given , ActiveRecord runs the query and yields each row to the block instead of accumulating an array of results to return .
An ensure block guarantees that result .
free gets called ( fixing the potential memory leak caused if you break out of the block or raise an exception ) .
I have cleaned up the code a bit .
I have fixed the memory leak .
I have made an honest patch out of the monkeypatch using alias_method_chain .
There 's a lot left to do still , but this is worky enough for my needs and I figured I 'd put it out there in case someone else wanted to take a stab at it .
Heres ' the essential bit of the code ( select_all is nearly identical ) ²:
Usage is simple and clean :
So , what 's next ?
Well , there 's still a lot to be desired here .
It needs to be cleaned up , possibly turned into a plugin .
It 's currently MySQL only even though there 's really nothing preventing it from being generalized .
It 's not really idiomatic ; what I 'd really like to see is select_all ( ) . each and select_all ( ) . map work with or without an internal fetch .
If that can be made to work cleanly , I 'd love to see this generalized into the find methods themselves in Rails .
And suddenly I have all these ambitions for this code , and I realize I 'm getting tired just thinking about it .
I wrote a hack , and it works for me .
I think there 's a good idea in it , and people might be able to run with it .
Want to ?
Take it .
Run with it .
Tell me what you did with it .
( Even if it 's print it out so you can enjoy burning such a heathen monkeypatch . )

¹ I should clarify that I think most monkeypatches are poo .
That 's right , my tweet basically says I am a god of poo .

Anybody know of a good tool to colorize syntax for web pasting ?

Speculation about Virginia Sen. Jim Webb ’s prospects as a candidate for the Democratic vice presidential nomination got a boost last week with the passage of an important GI benefits bill — a signal achievement for a freshman lawmaker that won him praise from both parties .
The artfully crafted bill allowed Democrats to tangibly support U.S. troops while still opposing the war .
The gesture toward troops straining to cope with near - constant deployments also drew no small amount of Republican support .
If President Bush signs the bill as expected , it will be one of the most significant pieces of legislation approved by Congress this year .
Just two years ago , the Democrat - turned - Republican - turned - Democrat was waging a long - shot bid for Senate against popular Republican incumbent Sen. George F. Allen — having switched parties in order to mount a campaign against the war in Iraq .
See related story : Biden against all odds .
Today , the former Marine commander in Vietnam — where he earned the Navy Cross and the Silver Star , among many other medals — is increasingly seen on the shortlist of potential running mates for Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois .
It ’s a posting he swears he does n’t want .
In an interview Friday with The Washington Times , Mr. Webb focused on his legislative priorities .
“ I hope that the way we have worked across the aisle on this legislation will be useful as we work on other issues , ” Mr. Webb said .
“ I think it ’s a good feeling when you can work together and get something like this done . ”
Favorable reviews for the bill ’s passage abound for the 62 - year - old best - selling novelist , who also added to his credentials with the recent publication of a political book , “ A Time to Fight . ”
For the former Navy secretary under President Reagan to shepherd the measure through both chambers with no prior legislative experience makes the feat even more remarkable .
“ It would n’t happen without his tenacity and willingness to push this proposal all the way to the end , ” said Jim Manley , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat .
“ It ’s very impressive . ”
Mr. Webb ’s bill provides educational benefits to Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans who served after 9/11 , similar to those given to veterans returning from World War II .
It provides full tuition , as well as money for fees , books and housing , at a public college in a veteran ’s state of residence .
The bill — which had nearly 60 co-sponsors in the Senate , 302 in the House and will cost an estimated $ 62 billion over 10 years — also allows additional payments of up to $ 1,200 for tutorial assistance .
As many as 450,000 veterans are expected to take advantage of the benefits offered by the bill .
The Senate passed the bill 92 - 6 Thursday as part of a war funding bill .
The House — following Democrats ’ concession that the benefits can be transferred to a recipient ’s spouse or children — approved it the week before with a 416 - 12 vote .
Mr. Webb initially had to spar with the White House , Pentagon and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain on aspects of the measure .
Mr. McCain , of Arizona , a fellow Vietnam veteran , initially introduced his own GI package but has since come out in support of Mr. Webb’s .
The White House , citing the addition of the transferability option , said Thursday that President Bush would not veto it .
Sen . John W. Warner , Virginia Republican , who is retiring at the end of this term , said Mr. Webb ’s achievement with the GI bill will stand as a “ hallmark . ”
“ He came to the United States Senate , and he indicated his top priority was to get a revision of the existing framework of laws governing the GI bill because he felt very strongly , based on his long and heroic service to this country in uniform , that we owe this generation everything that previous generations had received by virtue of educational benefits , ” Mr. Warner said .
Mr. Webb said speculation about a spot on Mr. Obama ’s ticket is “ totally apart ” from his GI Bill .
“ [ The bill ] is just something that needs to be done , ” Mr. Webb said .
Some who say Mr. Webb could appeal to blue - collar workers alienated by Mr. Obama and help the nominee carry Virginia , which has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964 .
Those opposed to his selection say the senator is too brash and averse to the campaign trail to be a successful sidekick .
In a June 9 piece posted on www.slate.com, Timothy Noah called Mr. Webb “ a bit of a blowhard ” with a “ volcanic temperament . ”
“ Nominating Webb is n’t worth the risk that he ’ll alienate important constituencies , embarrass Obama , or break with him outright , as John Nance Garner did with Franklin Roosevelt , ” Mr. Noah wrote .
“ He ’s trouble , and Obama ’s already had too much of that . ”
Obama spokesman Michael Rodriguez said the Illinois Democrat “ greatly respects the extraordinary service and sacrifices that Senator Webb has made for our country as a Marine , Navy secretary , and U.S. senator . ”
“ Early on , Senator Webb recognized the need to improve college opportunities for our returning service members , and he assembled a bipartisan coalition of senators to introduce and pass a 21st - century GI Bill , ” Mr. Rodriguez said .
“ Senator Obama is honored to serve with such a tireless advocate for our service members and veterans . ”
Approval of the GI Bill also represents the culmination of a campaign promise made by Mr. Webb during his Senate bid .
Mr. Webb ’s son , Jimmy Webb , is a Marine who has been deployed to Iraq multiple times , and the senator has noted that both he and Mr. McCain received their post - Vietnam educations thanks to the current GI Bill .
Aided by several of Mr. Allen ’s missteps , Mr. Webb earned a razor - thin victory in the November 2006 Senate election despite critics who cited excerpts from his writings to contend the former Navy secretary did not respect women .
His victory secured the transfer of power in Congress — one reason Democrats chose him to rebut the president ’s State of the Union address the following January .
“ Most people who come from [ outside of Congress ] chafe at the pace and the process that the Founding Fathers set up , ” said Brad Fitch , chief executive officer of Knowlegis — a company that provides power rankings for congressional members at the Web site www.congress.org.
“ Here ’s a guy who not only did n’t chafe at it , he thrived at it . ”

Tom Ridge takes up the usual discredited conservative talking point that if our troops leave Iraq , al - Qaeda and Iran will control everything there --- including all the oil fields on FOX News Sunday .
Man , there certainly are a lot of terrorists running around in Iraq now .
Did n't the administration tell us that al - Qaeda has been defeated in Iraq already ?
Oh , right --- so now it 's Iran .
Iran is running around in Iraq now ...

Wallace : ... as part of your answer , at what point does Sen McCain say we do have to turn it over to the Iraqis .
Ridge : Well I think again , it depends on the situation on the ground as the NY Times is reporting ... blah , blah , blah .. it is a central venue in this war against terror ... blah , blah .
blah .. the lind of support we provided Germany and South Korea ....( sorry , I could n't transcribe it all .
I just could n't get myself to do it . )
The old situation on the ground trick with a dash of Germany and South Korea .
How did that line work for McCain ?
There 's greater and greater control , but watch out .
It could fall apart as soon as we leave !
He really wants to say the word " never . "
Just say it Ridge .
You can do it .
So can McCain and Kristol and Bush and Cheney .
I do n't know why they just do n't get honest and say something like :
Ridge :
We never want to turn Iraq back over to the Iraqis because we want their oil , Chris .
Is that plain enough for you ?
Wallace : Certainly Gov.
Ridge , thanks for being so candid with us .
You heard it right here folks on FNS .
McCain never wants to leave Iraq .
Back after the break .
I guess terrorists reconstitute like bunnies -- or something ... The Iraqi people will not let Iran have control over their land .
Hey , Tom --- the American people are n't buying that line .
It 's so 2004 .

We ’ve all seen those gut - wrenching tire - and fire - spewing race - car crashes where the driver miraculously walks away .
Volvo wants to give people the same sense of invincibility by producing a virtually injury - proof car by 2020 that would ensure drivers and passengers survive all but the gnarliest accidents .
The Swedish automaker is leading a race to create a " matrix of systems " that use radar , sonar and other technology to prevent and mitigate crashes .
In the event of a crash , when most drivers freeze , the car would steer and brake on its own .
Cutting pre-impact speed by even 10 mph would cut the death rate in half , so self - braking systems are key to reducing traffic fatalities .
Volvo , which is owned by Ford Motor Co. , is not alone in pursuing the injury - proof car , which Sweden 's head of traffic safety calls the biggest revolution in the auto industry since the seatbelt .
" If you look into the future , we as a community will not accept that we have injuries , " Jan Ivarsson , head of the Volvo safety team , told Reuters .
" We have other things that are important in life . "
To reach the 2020 deadline – 12 years is n't that long in the auto industry – Volvo has stepped up testing at its vehicle - safety testing center in Gothenburg , Sweden , where it stages 400 accidents a year .
They 've got two 150 - meter tunnels , including the auto industry ’s only rotating
test tunnel , where engineers can replicate head - on and side - impact collisions and even dunk a car in a pond .
With all the ways they 've developed to destroy a car , Volvo's got the world ’s most advanced car and test - dummy torture chamber .
Volvo recently invited Reuters to watch an S80 test mule get its nose flattened at 35 mph by an 850 - ton steel - clad block in a carefully choreographed collision that took one - tenth of a second to transpire , but two weeks to set up and another two to dissect .
Engineers shot the smashup from almost as many angles as the Super Bowl and even put a camera in a glass - topped pit to record it from below .
Sensors on the car , the crash block and two male “ biomechanical measurement devices ”
- what the rest of us call crash test dummies - collected terabytes of data .
Volvo ’s 20 - member safety A - Team also culls info from government agencies and insurance companies , and it has a strong - stomached crash - site crew on call 24/ 7 to investigate real - life accidents to figure out what went wrong and how to keep it from happening again .
Why the obsession with safety ?
Money .
Lots of it .
Traffic accidents cause about 1.2 million fatalities and 50 million injuries a year , and Scott
McCormick , president of the Connected Vehicle Trade Association , says $ 450 billion is lost in accidents and deaths each year .
Still , it 's tough to get people to do much about it .
“ Not to be mercenary about it , but we have to look at what we spend on it , ” McCormick says .
“ And unless someone can construct a business model around it , vehicle safety wo n’t get as much attention and it wo n’t get the resources .
The issue with Volvo is everyone has a demographic for their cars .
And although all carmakers have buyers who want to be safe , it ’s how they ( Volvo ) sell what they ’re doing . ”
Volvo's long been at the forefront of vehicle safety .
It invented three - point safety belts and was the first to use crumple zones , side - impact airbags and rear - facing child seats .
In a 2006 survey of 500 consumers conducted by
Accenture , more than two - thirds of respondents ranked safety as the most important technology to include in their vehicles , 70 percent were willing to shell out extra for it .
Volvo 's long been the best at marketing safety , and a recent poll by Consumer Reports found 77 percent of respondents consider Volvo the safest car on the road .
But the competition is catching up and Volvo wants to stay ahead of Lexus , with its Pre-Collision System , and Mercedes Benz with its PRE - SAFE braking system .
With other car companies vying for Volvo ’s once - exclusive rep as the safest thing on four wheels , the Swedish company is the first to strive for an injury - proof car .
It wo n't be the last .

As many as one billion people could lose their homes by 2050 because of the devastating impact of global warming , scientists and political leaders will be warned today .
They will hear that the steady rise in temperatures across the planet could trigger mass migration on unprecedented levels .
Hundreds of millions could be forced to go on the move because of water shortages and crop failures in most of Africa , as well as in central and southern Asia and South America , the conference in London will be told .
There could also be an effect on levels of starvation and on food prices as agriculture struggles to cope with growing demand in increasingly arid conditions .

Rising sea levels could also cause havoc , with coastal communities in southern Asia , the Far East , the south Pacific islands and the Caribbean seeing their homes submerged .
North and west Africans could head towards Europe , while the southern border of the United States could come under renewed pressure from Central America .
The conference will hear a warning from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) that the developed world should start preparing for a huge movement of people caused by climate change .
The event , which is being organised by the Institute for Public Policy Research ( IPPR ) , will also be addressed by a Kenyan farmer and a United Nations worker based in Sudan .
They will give first - hand accounts of previously fertile land that has already become parched in recent years as the desert spreads .
Craig Johnstone , the UNHCR deputy high commissioner , said yesterday that humanity faced a " global - scale emergency " whose effects would accumulate over the next four decades .
He said it was impossible to forecast with confidence the numbers of people who would lose their homes through climate change .
But he pointed to assessments of between 250 million and one billion people losing their homes by 2050 .
He said : " This will be a global - scale emergency , but ... it will take place gradually and over a long period of time . "
Mr Johnstone rejected the suggestion that the industrialised West should shoulder the burden because it was to blame for much of climate change .
But he said : " It 's the obligation of the people who have the means to be helpful to help .
They have an obligation to humanity to help . "
He said the UNHCR already assisted in natural disasters such as earthquakes and the Asian tsunami of 2004 and added : " Perhaps even more challenging and more inevitable are the consequences of global changes . "
Currently the status of refugees – defined as people escaping personal persecution by the state – is controlled by the Geneva Convention of 1951 .
The agreement , however , would not cover people who become homeless , or even stateless , because of changes to global weather patterns .
Pressure is therefore growing for the international community to reach a formal consensus on ways of dealing with the issue .
Mr Johnstone said : " We 're strongly in favour of there being adequate international mechanisms to cope . "
Danny Sriskandarajah , head of migration at the IPPR , said : " The displacement of millions of people will be one of the most dramatic ways in which climate change will affect humankind . "
Hilary Benn , the Environment Secretary , said a global agreement must be reached .
" Climate change is the most serious long - term threat to development in poor countries , and if unchecked millions of people may be forced to migrate to escape the effects of drought , flooding , food shortages and rising sea levels , " he said .
Wexler : McCain 's ' calculating the value of a terrorist attack ' is ' eerie ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This When McCain 's top strategist Charlie Black was quoted as saying that a new terrorist attack would " be a big advantage " to the McCain campaign , McCain responded that " I can not imagine why he would say it .
It 's not true . "
MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann pointed out on Wednesday that several examples have now emerged of McCain himself suggesting that terrorism could be good for the GOP .
For example , in 2004 , a Connecticut paper quoted McCain as saying during a local campaign stop that thanks to the release of an alleged al Qaeda tape , " Bin Laden may have just given us a little boost . "
Olbermann asked Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) whether Senator Barack Obama is right when he suggests playing the terror card wo n't work this time around .
" He is right about the shift , " Wexler replied , " The Bush administration and Senator John McCain have lost their credibility -- but still Senator Obama has to go out and aggressively make the argument . "
" If this were just one comment by John McCain , or one comment by his chief strategist , that might be forgivable , " Wexler continued .
" But this is now the second , possibly the third instance in which the mindset of John McCain is becoming quite evident .
...
He appears to be calculating the value of a terrorist attack or an assassination to his campaign , and that 's quite eerie . "
" I do n't think we should just focus on Mr. Black , " Wexler emphasized .
" We ought to focus on Senator McCain himself , because this seems to be a joint effort . "
" Why is nobody calling McCain on any one of those remarks ? " Olbermann asked .
" When we thought it was only once , you could forgive it , " Wexler stated .
" But now when I hear you talk about what is the third instance , that 's a pattern of attempting to use fear . "
Wexler suggested that " Senator Obama needs to go out and say , ' You know what ?
These guys ' credentials on security matters are n't any good anyway .
Senator McCain , President Bush , they were wrong on the Iraq War ... taking our sights off Osama bin Laden .
... they put all their eggs in Musharraf 's basket .
... The McCain - Bush policies have not made America safer . ' "
Wexler concluded by noting that Congress also has an important role to play .
" We need to hold the Bush - McCain positions accountable and engage , in my view , in inquiry of impeachment with respect to the lies that the Bush administration foisted on the American people as they took us to war in Iraq . "

BBC News in Haiphong , Vietnam
Tran Trong
Duyet claims no torture was carried out at Hoa Lo Tran Trong Duyet - a sprightly retiree and amateur ballroom dancer - must rank as one of John McCain 's more unlikely supporters .
Four decades ago , during the Vietnam war , Mr Duyet was in charge of the notorious Hoa Lo prison - the place where Mr McCain says he was brutally beaten and tortured during five - and - a - half years as an American prisoner of war .
" McCain is my friend , " said 75 - year - old Mr Duyet as he feeds the caged birds he now keeps in his garden in this coastal city .
" If I was American , I would vote for him . "
Informal chats Navy pilot John McCain was shot down during a bombing raid over the North Vietnamese capital , Hanoi , in 1967 .
He ejected from his aircraft and parachuted into a city lake - only to be dragged out by an angry crowd , barely conscious , and with two broken arms and a broken leg .
From there he was taken to Hoa Lo prison , known to its American military inmates as the " Hanoi Hilton " .
McCain was captured after his plane was shot down in 1967 McCain has since described enduring months of solitary confinement and systematic torture which drove him to try to kill himself .
" I do n't know how he'd react if he met me again , " said Mr Duyet , flicking through old black and white photographs of himself and his American prisoners at Hoa Lo .
" But I can confirm to you that we never tortured him .
We never tortured any prisoners . "
Mr Duyet reminisces instead about how he often summoned the future US presidential candidate to his private office for informal chats .
" We used to argue about the war - about whether it was right or wrong , " he says .
" He is a very frank man - very conservative , and very loyal to his country and the American ideal .
" He had a very interesting accent and sometimes he taught me words in English and corrected my accent .
I have followed his career since he left prison . "
Rapprochement
So is Mr Duyet implying that that Senator McCain lied about his treatment at the Hanoi Hilton ?
" He did not tell the truth , " he says .
" But I can somehow sympathise with him .
He lies to American voters in order to get their support for his presidential election . "
The " Hanoi Hilton " is now a museum - containing McCain 's flight suit But Mr Duyet 's propaganda - perfect version of events is impossible to verify - and should be treated with caution in a country where the Communist authorities still keep a tight control over the media .
Relations between Vietnam and the United States have improved dramatically in recent years , following the normalisation of ties between the former enemies in 1995 .
Mr McCain played a crucial role in bringing about that initial rapprochement - a fact which helps explain Mr Duyet 's enthusiastic support for the McCain presidential campaign .
" I wish him success in the presidential election , " he says .
" Of course the Americans started the war in Vietnam and killed so many people - but now we want to leave the past behind .
" So now I consider John McCain my friend because he did much to mend relations between our two countries .
And if he becomes president he will do more to improve those ties . "

Check out our followup post that describes how we created a downloadable Windows application or an excel spreadsheet you can use to create these graphics .
One of the troubles with Tufte is the frustrating infeasability of his approach to design for real people in business .
One of his recommendations is to use Adobe Illustrator .
Adobe Illustrator is a big serious program that can do almost anything on the visual field ( other than Photoshop an image ) .
Most of my sparkline work was done in Illustrator .
Fortunately all graphic designers and graphic design students have the program and know how to use it , so find a colleague who knows about graphic design .
Raise your hand if you have a graphic design assistant at your beck and call .
I thought not .
One of the tools we use for rapid prototyping at Juice is NodeBox .
NodeBox is a Mac OS X application that lets you create 2D visuals ( static , animated or interactive ) using Python programming code and export them as a PDF or a QuickTime movie .
NodeBox is free and well - documented .
All true .
But it ’s more helpful to think of NodeBox as a free Adobe Illustrator that you can program in the world ’s easiest programming language .
Oops , here ’s the right link .
I wanted to see if we could reproduce the following graph from The Visual Display of Quantitative Information , p 158 .
WITH winter fast receding in the northern hemisphere and thoughts turning to summer holidays , reports are suggesting that there may be an unprecedented swarm of jellyfish heading for Europe .
The mauve stingers ( also known as Pelagia noctiluca ) have been breeding in the water throughout the winter , and are now ready for an assault on the beaches of Spain and the Mediterranean .
Masses of jellyfish are an increasingly common nuisance , not just in Spain , but all around the world .
Spectacular blooms have been reported in Japan , Namibia , Alaska , Venezuela , Peru and Australia .
And since 2000 , the Gulf of Mexico has been suffering from an invasion of monster Australian spotted jellyfish ( Phyllorhiza punctata ) , which are fouling fishing nets and upsetting the shrimpers .
But are these accounts of rising numbers real , or are humans just spending more time in the water ?
Lucas Brotz is a oceanography graduate - student at the University of British Columbia 's Fisheries Centre , and he agrees that the potential for interaction between man and jelly is on the rise .
More fishing means that jellyfish will more frequently clog up , and split , fishing nets .
The expansion of aquaculture means more disasters like last year 's destruction of 100,000 organically farmed salmon in Ireland — by a swarm of jellyfish .
And media reports have also primed journalists to accept that the “ deadly jellyfish menace ” is on the rise .
So is it possible to say with certainty that jellyfish are increasing ?
Mr Brotz thinks so : some well - studied ecosystems show evidence of an increase , and he is working to prove that this is a global phenomenon .
The Namibian coast , for instance , used to be “ hugely productive in fish , ” he says , “ and now it is entirely dominated by jellyfish .
Things appear to be going that way in the Middle East , South Pacific , the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean . ”
The Japanese coast has long weathered jellyfish blooms , but they tended to happen about once every 35 years .
Since 2002 , however , every year but one has seen massive blooms .
Some individual fish exceed two metres in size and weigh a couple of hundred kilograms ; both the size and number of the fish interfere with Japanese fishermen .
Many species of jellyfish spend the early part of their life as a polyp ( like an anemone or coral ) on the ocean floor , which can survive harsh conditions .
When the conditions are right , the polyps switch into jellyfish - production mode and bud off massive numbers of baby jellyfish .
Overfishing may cause blooms : some fish eat baby jellyfish , and some , like herring , compete with jellyfish for the same zooplankton food .
Take the fish away , and you get more jellyfish .
But jellyfish also eat fish eggs and baby fish , so if they start to increase in a marine ecosystem , it can create a positive feedback loop and produce more jellyfish at the expense of the fish .
The jellyfish do n't allow fish stocks to recover because they are eating all the baby fish before they get large enough to reproduce .
Other factors tipping the balance in favour of jellyfish include dumping excess nutrients from chemical fertilisers , which sucks oxygen out of the water and create what are known as “ dead zones ” , which are hostile to almost all marine life other than certain species of jellyfish .
Rising ocean temperatures are also favourable to jellyfish .
Though some species are eaten in Asia ( the jellyfish - food industry nets around $ 120 m per year ) , blooms are already causing significant economic losses to traditional fisheries .
In response to this abundance , scientists are developing a process to extract commercially valuable biomaterial from them for use in foods and medicines .
Others have suggested expanding the jellyfish - food industry .
But is this sow's ear too big to make into a silk purse ?
Jellyfish push out incredibly valuable , and diverse , marine ecosystems .
Scientists may somehow turn jellyfish into food , tyres or flip - flops , but it is hard to imagine an industry based on a product that is at least 95 % water will ever be economically superior to one based on a diverse and healthy marine ecosystem .
In 2004 , fish caught in the ocean netted $ 85 billion on first sale .
Do we want to grow an industry that has a vested interest in a very different kind of ocean to the one we have today ?
The world has to decide what kind of ocean it wants : one thriving with diverse marine life , or one swimming with a few hundred species of jellyfish .
At the moment , it looks likely that humans may have only themselves to blame for the rise in jellyfish , through decades of overfishing .
There is a certain Schadenfreude in knowing that Spain , home one of the world 's most voracious fishing fleets , is destined to suffer from blooms of jellies — which will presumably do no good at all to its tourist industry .
Such pleasure , however , is short - lived when one realises that while Spanish fleets have long benefited from overfishing , we will all ultimately suffer the consequences .
Mr Brotz calls jellyfish “ harbingers of change ” .
The solution is n't to find ways of using them but to “ stop polluting the ocean with nutrients and stop over fishing . ”
The next time you enjoy a sea-side holiday and sit to eat freshly caught fish in an ocean - front cafe , you may wish to pause and wonder whether next time it will be jellyfish fingers for tea .

CLINTON INTERVIEW CLINTON INTERVIEW
CLOSE-UP : HILLARY CLINTON CLOSE-UP : HILLARY CLINTON
In - depth : Clinton news , videos , photos , timeline , more ... Hillary Clinton on the campaign issues : Iraq | Immigration | Health care | Education | Abortion | Gay civil rights Hillary Rodham Clinton vowed Wednesday to continue her quest for the Democratic nomination , arguing she would be the stronger nominee because she appeals to a wider coalition of voters — including whites who have not supported Barack Obama in recent contests .
" I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on , " she said in an interview with USA TODAY .
As evidence , Clinton cited an Associated Press article " that found how Sen .
Obama 's support among working , hard - working Americans , white Americans , is weakening again , and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me . "
" There 's a pattern emerging here , " she said .
Clinton 's blunt remarks about race came a day after primaries in Indiana and North Carolina dealt symbolic and mathematical blows to her White House ambitions .
POLITICS BLOG : Blogosphere is buzzing The Obama campaign , looking toward locking up the nomination , stepped up pressure on superdelegates who have the decisive votes in their race .
In both states , Clinton won six of 10 white voters , according to surveys of people as they left polling places .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said that in Indiana , Obama split working - class voters with Clinton and won a higher percentage of white voters than in Ohio in March .
He said Obama will be the strongest nominee because he appeals " to Americans from every background and all walks of life .
These statements from Sen. Clinton are not true and frankly disappointing . "
Clinton rejected any idea that her emphasis on white voters could be interpreted as racially divisive .
" These are the people you have to win if you 're a Democrat in sufficient numbers to actually win the election .
Everybody knows that . "
CLINTON : Campaigning continues despite dire forecasts OBAMA : Faced with a divided party Larry Sabato , head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics , said Clinton 's comment was a " poorly worded " variation on the way analysts have been " slicing and dicing the vote in racial terms . "
However , he said her primary support does n't prove she 's more electable .
Either Democrat will get " the vast majority " of the other 's primary election votes in a general election , he said .
Clinton lost North Carolina by 14 percentage points and won Indiana by 2 points after competing full - out in both states .
She had loaned the campaign $ 6.4 million in the past month .
She said she might lend more .
" We should finish the contests we have and see where we stand after they 're over , " she said , referring to the six remaining primaries that will end June 3 .
There were signs of unrest Wednesday , even among Clinton allies .
California Sen. Dianne Feinstein wondered to The Hill , a Capitol Hill newspaper , " whether she can get the delegates that she needs . "
Former South Dakota senator George McGovern , whose 1972 presidential bid gave Clinton her first political experience , switched his support from Clinton to Obama .

Can We Play ?
– By Dr. David Elkind
Play is rapid­ly dis­ap­pear­ing from our homes , our schools , and our neigh­bor­hoods .
Over the last two decades alone , chil­dren have lost eight hours of free , unstruc­tured , and spon­ta­neous play a week .
More than 30,000 schools in the Unit­ed States have elim­i­nat­ed recess to make more time for aca­d­e­mics .
From 1997 to 2003 , chil­dren ’s time spent out­doors fell 50 per­cent , accord­ing to a study by San­dra Hof­ferth at the Uni­ver­si­ty of Mary­land .
Hof­ferth has also found that the amount of time chil­dren spend in orga­nized sports has dou­bled , and the num­ber of min­utes chil­dren devote each week to pas­sive leisure , not includ­ing watch­ing tele­vi­sion , has increased from 30 min­utes to more than three hours .
It is no sur­prise , then , that child­hood obe­si­ty is now con­sid­ered an epi­dem­ic .
But the prob­lem goes well beyond obe­si­ty .
Decades of research has shown that play is cru­cial to phys­i­cal , intel­lec­tu­al , and social - emo­tion­al devel­op­ment at all ages .
This is espe­cial­ly true of the purest form of play : the unstruc­tured , self - moti­vat­ed , imag­i­na­tive , inde­pen­dent kind , where chil­dren ini­ti­ate their own games and even invent their own rules .
In infan­cy and ear­ly child­hood , play is the activ­i­ty through which chil­dren learn to rec­og­nize col­ors and shapes , tastes and sounds ‚ the very build­ing blocks of real­i­ty .
Play also pro­vides path­ways to love and social con­nec­tion .
Ele­men­tary school chil­dren use play to learn mutu­al respect , friend­ship , coop­er­a­tion , and com­pe­ti­tion .
For ado­les­cents , play is a means of explor­ing pos­si­ble iden­ti­ties , as well as a way to blow off steam and stay fit .
Even adults have the poten­tial to unite play , love , and work , attain­ing the dynam­ic , joy­ful state that psy­chol­o­gist Mihaly Csik­szent­mi­ha­lyi calls “ flow . ”
With play on the decline , we risk los­ing these and many oth­er ben­e­fits .
For too long , we have treat­ed play as a lux­u­ry that kids , as well as adults , could do with­out .
But the time has come for us to rec­og­nize why play is worth defend­ing :
It is essen­tial to lead­ing a hap­py and healthy life .
Play and devel­op­ment
Years of research has con­firmed the val­ue of play .
In ear­ly child­hood , play helps chil­dren devel­op skills they can not get in any oth­er way .
Bab­bling , for exam­ple , is a self - ini­ti­at­ed form of play through which infants cre­ate the sounds they need to learn the lan­guage of their par­ents .
Like­wise , chil­dren teach them­selves to crawl , stand , and walk through rep­e­ti­tious prac­tice play .
At the preschool lev­el , chil­dren engage in dra­mat­ic play and learn who is a leader , who is a fol­low­er , who is out­go­ing , who is shy .
They also learn to nego­ti­ate their own con­flicts .
A 2007 report from the Amer­i­can Acad­e­my of Pedi­atrics doc­u­ments that play pro­motes not only behav­ioral devel­op­ment but brain growth as well .
The Uni­ver­si­ty of North Car­oli­na ’s Abecedar­i­an Ear­ly Child Inter­ven­tion pro­gram found that chil­dren who received an enriched , play - ori­ent­ed par­ent­ing and ear­ly child­hood pro­gram had sig­nif­i­cant­ly high­er IQ ’s at age five than did a com­pa­ra­ble group of chil­dren who were not in the pro­gram ( 105 vs. 85 points ) .
A large body of research evi­dence also sup­ports the val­ue and impor­tance of par­tic­u­lar types of play .
For exam­ple , Israeli psy­chol­o­gist Sara Smi­lan­sky ’s clas­sic stud­ies of socio­dra­mat­ic play , where two or more chil­dren par­tic­i­pate in shared make believe , demon­strate the val­ue of this play for aca­d­e­m­ic , social , and emo­tion­al learn­ing .
“ Socio­dra­mat­ic play acti­vates resources that stim­u­late social and intel­lec­tu­al growth in the child , which in turn affects the child ’s suc­cess in school , ” con­cludes Smi­lan­sky in a 1990 study that com­pared Amer­i­can and Israeli chil­dren .
“ For exam­ple , prob­lem solv­ing in most school sub­jects requires a great deal of make believe , visu­al­iz­ing how the Eski­mos live , read­ing sto­ries , imag­in­ing a sto­ry and writ­ing it down , solv­ing arith­metic prob­lems , and deter­min­ing what will come next . ”
Oth­er research illus­trates the impor­tance of phys­i­cal play for chil­dren ’s learn­ing and devel­op­ment .
Some of these stud­ies have high­light­ed the impor­tance of recess .
Psy­chol­o­gist Antho­ny Pel­le­gri­ni and his col­leagues have found that ele­men­tary school chil­dren become increas­ing­ly inat­ten­tive in class when recess is delayed .
Sim­i­lar­ly , stud­ies con­duct­ed in French and Cana­di­an ele­men­tary schools over a peri­od of four years found that reg­u­lar phys­i­cal activ­i­ty had pos­i­tive effects on aca­d­e­m­ic per­for­mance .
Spend­ing one third of the school day in phys­i­cal edu­ca­tion , art , and music improved not only phys­i­cal fit­ness , but atti­tudes toward learn­ing and test scores .
These find­ings echo those from one analy­sis of 200 stud­ies on the effects of exer­cise on cog­ni­tive func­tion­ing , which also sug­gests that phys­i­cal activ­i­ty pro­motes learn­ing .
In recent years , and most espe­cial­ly since the 2002 pas­sage of the No Child Left Behind Act , we ’ve seen edu­ca­tors , pol­i­cy mak­ers , and many par­ents embrace the idea that ear­ly aca­d­e­mics leads to greater suc­cess in life .
Yet sev­er­al stud­ies by Kathy Hirsch - Pasek and col­leagues have com­pared the per­for­mance of chil­dren attend­ing aca­d­e­m­ic preschools with those attend­ing play - ori­ent­ed preschools .
The results showed no advan­tage in read­ing and math achieve­ment for chil­dren attend­ing the aca­d­e­m­ic preschools .
But there was evi­dence that those chil­dren had high­er lev­els of test anx­i­ety , were less cre­ative , and had more neg­a­tive atti­tudes toward school than did the chil­dren attend­ing the play preschools .
So if play is that impor­tant , why is it dis­ap­pear­ing ?
The per­fect storm
The decline of chil­dren ’s free , self - ini­ti­at­ed play is the result of a per­fect storm of tech­no­log­i­cal inno­va­tion , rapid social change , and eco­nom­ic glob­al­iza­tion .
Tech­no­log­i­cal inno­va­tions have led to the all - per­va­sive­ness of tele­vi­sion and com­put­er screens in our soci­ety in gen­er­al , and in our homes in par­tic­u­lar .
An unin­tend­ed con­se­quence of this inva­sion is that child­hood has moved indoors .
Chil­dren who might once have enjoyed a pick - up game of base­ball in an emp­ty lot now watch the game on TV , sit­ting on their couch .
Mean­while , sin­gle and work­ing par­ents now out­num­ber the once - pre­dom­i­nant nuclear fam­i­ly , in which a stay - at - home moth­er could pro­vide the kind of loose over­sight that facil­i­tates free play .
Instead , busy work­ing par­ents out­source at least some of their for­mer respon­si­bil­i­ties to coach­es , tutors , train­ers , mar­tial arts teach­ers , and oth­er pro­fes­sion­als .
As a result , mid­dle - income chil­dren spend more of their free time in adult - led and ‑orga­nized activ­i­ties than any ear­li­er gen­er­a­tion .
( Low - income youth some­times have the oppo­site prob­lem :
Their par­ents may not have the means to put them in high - qual­i­ty pro­grams that pro­vide alter­na­tives to play­ing in unsafe neigh­bor­hoods . )
Final­ly , a glob­al econ­o­my has increased parental fears about their chil­dren ’s prospects in an increas­ing­ly high - tech mar­ket­place .
Many mid­dle - class par­ents have bought into the idea that edu­ca­tion is a race , and that the ear­li­er you start your child in aca­d­e­mics , the bet­ter .
Preschool tutor­ing in math and pro­grams such as the Kumon Sys­tem , which empha­sizes dai­ly drills in math and read­ing , are becom­ing increas­ing­ly pop­u­lar .
And all too many kinder­gartens , once ded­i­cat­ed to learn­ing through play , have become full - day aca­d­e­m­ic insti­tu­tions that require test­ing and home­work .
In such a world , play has come to be seen as a waste of pre­cious time .
A 1999 sur­vey found that near­ly a third of kinder­garten class­es did not have a recess peri­od .
As adults have increas­ing­ly thwart­ed self - ini­ti­at­ed play and games , we have lost impor­tant mark­ers of the stages in a child ’s devel­op­ment .
In the absence of such mark­ers , it is dif­fi­cult to deter­mine what is appro­pri­ate and not appro­pri­ate for chil­dren .
We run the risk of push­ing them into cer­tain activ­i­ties before they are ready , or stunt­ing the devel­op­ment of impor­tant intel­lec­tu­al , social , or emo­tion­al skills .
For exam­ple , it is only after the age of six or sev­en that chil­dren will spon­ta­neous­ly par­tic­i­pate in games with rules , because it is only at that age that they are ful­ly able to under­stand and fol­low rules .
Those kinds of devel­op­men­tal mark­ers fall by the way­side when we slot very young kids into activ­i­ties such as Lit­tle League .
When Lit­tle League was found­ed in 1939 , the adult orga­niz­ers looked to chil­dren them­selves in set­ting the start­ing age , which end­ed up being about age nine or old­er .
But the suc­cess of Lit­tle League was not lost on par­ents eager to find super­vised activ­i­ties for young chil­dren .
Before long , team soc­cer was pro­mot­ed for younger chil­dren because it was an eas­i­er and less com­plex game for the six - to nine - year - old age group .
The rapid growth of soc­cer leagues chal­lenged the pop­u­lar­i­ty of Lit­tle League .
This led to the intro­duc­tion of Tee Ball , a sim­pli­fied ver­sion of base­ball for chil­dren as young as four .
By push­ing young chil­dren into team sports for which they are not devel­op­men­tal­ly ready , we rule out forms of play that once encour­aged them to learn skills of inde­pen­dence and cre­ativ­i­ty .
Instead of learn­ing on their own in back­yards , fields , and on side­walks , chil­dren are only learn­ing to do what adults tell them to do .
More­over , one study found that many chil­dren who start play­ing soc­cer at age four are burned out on that sport by the time they reach ado­les­cence , just the age when they might tru­ly enjoy and excel at it .
Bring back play
Play is moti­vat­ed by plea­sure .
It is instinc­tive and part of the mat­u­ra­tional process .
We can­not pre­vent chil­dren from self - ini­ti­at­ed play ; they will engage in it when­ev­er they can .
The prob­lem is that we have cur­tailed the time and oppor­tu­ni­ties for such play .
Obvi­ous­ly we can­not turn the clock back and reverse the tech­no­log­i­cal , social , and eco­nom­ic changes that have helped silence chil­dren ’s play .
Tele­vi­sion , com­put­ers , new fam­i­ly mod­els , and glob­al­iza­tion are here to stay .
What is impor­tant is bal­ance .
If a child spends an hour on the com­put­er or watch­ing TV , equal time should be giv­en to play­ing with peers or engag­ing in indi­vid­ual activ­i­ties like read­ing or crafts .
It is impor­tant to involve the child in mak­ing these deci­sions and set­ting the para­me­ters for how they spend their time .
If we give chil­dren some own­er­ship of the rules , they are usu­al­ly more will­ing to fol­low them than when they are sim­ply imposed from above .
It is also impor­tant to appre­ci­ate indi­vid­ual dif­fer­ences .
You will not be able to keep some chil­dren from play­ing sports , while oth­ers pre­fer more seden­tary activ­i­ties .
Anoth­er way we can help bring play back into chil­dren ’s lives is to have schools restore recess for at least half an hour .
As research demon­strates , aca­d­e­mics are unlike­ly to suf­fer from this change ; if any­thing , they ’ll ben­e­fit .
Schools also argue that they can­not afford recess because of high insur­ance costs and par­ents ’ greater appetite for lit­i­ga­tion .
But when I speak with insur­ance offi­cers about this issue , they claim that argu­ment is overblown .
Either way , chil­dren could still be tak­en out­side , or to the gym , for cal­is­then­ics to exer­cise their bod­ies .
We must also address the more gen­er­al prob­lem of test - dri­ven cur­ric­u­la in today ’s schools .
When teach­ers are forced to teach to the test , they become less inno­v­a­tive in their teach­ing meth­ods , with less room for games and imag­i­na­tion .
More cre­ative teach­ing meth­ods build upon chil­dren ’s inter­ests and atti­tudes their play­ful dis­po­si­tion and this encour­ages them to enjoy their teach­ers , which in turn enhances their inter­est in the sub­ject mat­ter .
Though com­put­ers are one of the forces lim­it­ing play , they can be cre­ative­ly used in the ser­vice of play­ful learn­ing .
As more young teach­ers who are pro­fi­cient in tech­nol­o­gy enter the schools , we will have the first true edu­ca­tion­al reform in decades , if not cen­turies .
But you do n’t have to be a teacher to help bring back play .
Many neigh­bor­hoods bad­ly need more play­grounds .
This was also the case in the 1930s ; in response , we saw the “ play­ground move­ment , ” when local com­mu­ni­ties set up their own play­grounds .
A new play­ground move­ment is long over­due , espe­cial­ly for our inner city neigh­bor­hoods , where safe play spaces are often in short sup­ply .
A play­ground should be required of any new large - scale hous­ing devel­op­ment .
We could go fur­ther .
In Scan­di­na­vian coun­tries , there are play areas in even the best restau­rants , as well as in air­ports and train sta­tions .
These coun­tries appre­ci­ate the impor­tance of play for healthy devel­op­ment , and we could well fol­low their exam­ple .
Final­ly chil­dren do as we do , not as we say .
That gives us incen­tive to bring play back into our adult lives .
We can shut off the TVs and take our chil­dren with us on out­door adven­tures .
We should get less exer­cise in the gym and more on hik­ing trails and bas­ket­ball courts .
We can also make work more play­ful : Busi­ness­es that do this are among the most suc­cess­ful .
Seat­tle ’s Pike Fish Mar­ket is a case in point .
Work­ers throw fish to one anoth­er , engage the cus­tomers in repar­tee , and appear to have a grand time .
Some com­pa­nies , such as Google , have made play an impor­tant part of their cor­po­rate cul­ture .
Study after study has shown that when work­ers enjoy what they do and are well - reward­ed and rec­og­nized for their con­tri­bu­tions , they like and respect their employ­ers and pro­duce high­er qual­i­ty work .
For exam­ple , when the Rohm and Hass Chem­i­cal com­pa­ny in Ken­tucky reor­ga­nized its work­place into self - reg­u­lat­ing and self - reward­ing teams , one study found that work­er griev­ances and turnover declined , while plant safe­ty and pro­duc­tiv­i­ty improved .
When we adults unite play , love , and work in our lives , we set an exam­ple that our chil­dren can fol­low .
That just might be the best way to bring play back into the lives of our chil­dren‚ and build a more play­ful cul­ture .

This A CBS / New York Times poll , conducted by telephone in the first three days of May , shows a majority of voters approving of Senator Obama 's handling of his response to the lengthy media campaign , culminating in a stern denunciation of former pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright , over comments the pastor has made .
Senator Clinton is seen as the " toughest " Democratic candidate , while Sens. Clinton and Obama are about tied among those polled as their preferred nominee .
The data show that 60 % of all registered voters ( 68 % of Democratic primary voters in particular ) approve of Obama 's handling of the Wright controversy , with 52 % of all voters ( 53 % of Democratic primary voters ) calling Obama 's response " about right . "
A little less than half , 47 % , of voters also saw Obama 's public denunciation of the minister as a primarily political decision , with 34 % seeing genuine disagreement as his motivation .
56 % of registered voters say that Rev. Wright has gotten too much media coverage .
75 % of registered voters ( 78 % Dem primary voters ) say their opinion of Senator Obama has not changed after media coverage of the pastor .
Senators Obama and Clinton are both shown to have a fighting chance as the Democratic nominee against Republican opponent Sen.
John McCain , with 53 % of registered voters shown backing Clinton , and 51 % for Obama , compared to 41 % and 40 % , respectively , for McCain .
While Senator Obama is seen by a majority of those polled , 52 % , as a candidate who would unite the country , Sens. Clinton ( 70 % ) and McCain ( 71 % ) lead as the person considered " tough enough " to get things done while in office .
On the " gas tax holiday , " those polled seem to share the view of Sen. Obama , with 70 % saying the idea is being used by Sens. Clinton and McCain for political gain , rather than to help average Americans .
A majority , 49 % against 45 % , think the proposed summer hiatus on the 18.4 - cent federal gasoline tax is a bad idea .
Among Democratic voters , Senator Clinton picks up a slight lead in the candidate favored to be the nominee .
As of yesterday , 44 % back Obama , and 45 % Clinton , compared to 45 % for Obama a month ago , 42 % for Clinton .
Among primary voters , however , 50 % would support Obama , compared to 38 % for Clinton .
" Strong " support for Obama among supporters , notably , has taken a downward turn , with last week 's 69 % turning into 57 % now .
Obama is seen as the best change of beating McCain among Democratic primary voters as of now , with 47 % against Clinton 's 44 % .
This reflects a nine - point drop for Obama , and a 12 - point gain for Clinton .
Full results of the polling are available in .pdf format at CBS News .
In the face of overwhelming evidence , it ’s astounding that people such as James Kirchick , in “ Bush never lied to us about Iraq , ” continue to defend the president against accusations that he intentionally misled and outright lied to the American people in making the case for war with Iraq .
Consider first the implications of the famous Downing Street memo from July 23 , 2002 .
Briefing Tony Blair about his recent talks with Washington , Britain ’s top intelligence officer stated that U.S. “ military action was now seen as inevitable .
...
But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy . ”
A month later , in August 2002 , the administration set up the White House Iraq Group , designed solely to sell the public on the imminent threat posed by Saddam Hussein .
In essence , it was a marketing campaign to sell the war by escalating the rhetoric and misleading the public .
And lying .
And boy , did they .
Here are statements from the administration in 2002 as they beat the drums for war .
Dick Cheney said : “ There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction .
There is no doubt he is amassing them to use ... against us . ” Condoleezza Rice : “ We do know that [ Hussein ] is actively pursuing a nuclear weapon . ”
Donald Rumsfeld : " [ Hussein ’s ] regime has amassed large , clandestine stockpiles of chemical weapons . ”
These statements were designed to cultivate in Americans fear of Iraq ’s imminent threat , the keystone of Bush ’s push to war .
They were grossly and intentionally misleading , suggesting that the administration possessed incontrovertible facts on which were drawn these definitive conclusions .
In reality , the facts were known to be ambiguous at best .
Absolutely no intelligence existed at the time that would allow anyone to reach such concrete conclusions .
And Bush advisors are n’t the only ones .
His assertion on Oct. 7 , 2002 , that Iraq posed an imminent threat was beaten into the nation ’s psyche : “ Facing clear evidence of peril , we can not wait for the final proof . ”
Yet the president possessed directly opposing information from the top- secret National Intelligence Estimate , released days earlier .
Prepared by the CIA with input from 16 U.S. intelligence agencies : “ Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional CBW [ chemical and biological weapons ] against the United States . ”
The declassified summary of the NIE -- released by the administration for public and media review shortly after the full report -- was another lie in that it was grotesquely altered .
The above point was not included .
Also missing were several forceful statements from other intelligence agencies disputing the CIA ’s horribly overblown and inaccurate assessments .
Finally , in at least half a dozen instances , conclusions were altered to make Iraq ’s threat more compelling .
Language was added or omitted that changed CIA opinions to incontrovertible facts
Conclusion :
The public document was rigged to support the push for war .
The president intentionally misled the public .
The intelligence and facts were fixed around the policy .
Another example is the now infamous nuclear reference from Bush ’s 2003 State of the Union address : “ Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . ”
Not only was this refuted twice in early 2002 -- by former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV and by French intelligence -- but the CIA ’s National Intelligence Council investigated and told the White House four days before the address that “ the Niger [ Africa ] story is baseless and should be laid to rest . ”
So the administration knew the claim was false , used it anyway and when caught , issued a collective “ oops . ”
Although these speeches are vetted by Bush staffers , State , Defense , National Security and the CIA , it just slipped through .
Riiiiight .
Two weeks before the war , the president echoed statements made in January ’s State of the Union : “ I ’ve got a good evidence to believe that .
[ Saddam Hussein ] has weapons of mass destruction , ” and “ Iraqi operatives continue to hide biological and chemical agents to avoid detection by inspectors . ”
Ah yes , the mobile labs .
And your evidence was from whom , sir ?
Curveball ?
The now fully discredited Iraqi chemical engineer who defected in 1999 and claimed to have worked in the labs ?
In 2002 , German intelligence -- who debriefed Curveball -- told the CIA that the guy was “ crazy ” and “ a fabricator . ”
Yet in his push for war , Bush chose to voice the Iraqi defector ’s claims over proof offered by U.N. weapons inspectors who , with eyes and ears on the ground , represented the best possible intelligence .
From November 2002 to March 2003 , they were granted unprecedented freedom and conducted more than 700 no - notice inspections all over Iraq and found nothing .
No mobile labs , no underground storage facilities , nothing .
This should have been great news , but not for a president looking to go to war .
Indeed , U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix flat out accused Bush and Blair of lying when he stated : “ The Americans and British created facts where there were no facts at all .
...
The Americans needed [ to find ] weapons of mass destruction to justify war . ”
So Bush was creating facts to justify war .
If there remains any equivocation of Bush ’s propensity to lie , consider the Jan. 31 , 2003 , meeting between Bush and Blair .
In a summary , Blair foreign policy advisor David Manning wrote that there was tension between the two over finding some justification for the war .
In fact , Bush was so concerned about the failure of the weapons inspectors to find WMD that the president floated three possible ways to “ provoke a confrontation ” with Hussein .
So here ’s your president very publicly using self - defense to sell a war while quite privately discussing how to provoke one -- with an allegedly dangerous foe who poses an imminent threat .
Either Bush lied or he put us at grave risk .
Or both .
Space constraints do n’t allow for a refutation of all the lies the president told about Iraq ’s threat , their weapons and their link to Osama bin Laden .
However , consider this final point :
Our government spent tens of millions of dollars to try to impeach a president for lying about consensual sex between two adults .
Compare that to this abomination : George W. Bush knowingly lied to the American people in selling his case for a war that has directly led to the deaths of more than 4,000 Americans .
They are deaths brought about by his lies , deceit and deception .
It is an American atrocity of monumental proportion , followed closely by the heinous fact that no one has held him accountable .
Where is the outrage ?

The web is a world of constraints , the materials of HTML and CSS flex and give in ways that encourage particular styles .
And being able to understand and bend within that scope is what makes a design feel native .
Designers who work directly with the materials rather than through simulated environments like Photoshop are at a distinct advantage for making that happen .
If you ’re working on a Flash game or a media campaign to introduce a new watch , you can afford to disregard that advantage .
That ’s when the graphical prowess of a completely blank canvas , sky ’s - the - limit approach is exactly what you want .
You want dazzle and glitz .
Making something that ’s native to the web does n’t really matter .
But barring that niche , designing for the web is a lot less about making something dazzle and a lot more about making it work .
The design decisions that matter pertain directly to the constraints of the materials .
What form elements to use .
What font sizes .
What composition .
What flow .
Those decisions are poorly made at an arm ’s length .
I ’ve worked with many web designers in the past who only did abstractions and then handed over pictures to be chopped and implemented by “ HTML monkeys ” .
It never really gelled well .
The things that got strong attention were all the things that Photoshop did well .
Imagery , curvy lines , and the frame .
All the around stuff , never the it stuff .
That ’s why all the designers at 37signals work directly with HTML and CSS .
We simply do n’t consider designers who do n’t get their hands dirty with the materials relevant to the kind of work we do .
If you ’re a designer working with the web who still does n’t do your own implementation , I strongly recommend that you pick up the skills to do so .
And here is a scan of the customs declaration .
Three signed names on the document are ( obviously ) :
Neil Armstrong , Edwin ( Buzz ) Aldrin j.r. , and Michael Collins .
Their cargo was interestingly enough :
moon rock & moon dust samples .
What really gave me a chuckle was looking at where they departed from .
It simply says , “ MOON ” .. hehe .
A recent study from Harvard Medical School found that restrictive drug programs might cause schizophrenia patients to stop taking their meds .
Nearly 80 % of patients without antipsychotic medication will have a serious recurrence of their illness within a year .
The study focused on Medicare beneficiaries with schizophrenia in the state of Maine and a policy ( step program ) that required schizophrenia patients to use a Medicare - approved medication before they were allowed to be prescribed drugs not on the “ approved ” list .
In comparison with patients in states with no such restriction , schizophrenia patients in Maine were 29 % more likely to stop taking their meds .
This policy seems to be yet another example of bureaucratic mismanagement .
It seems obvious that the savings accrued from forcing schizophrenic patients to take medication that they feel is ineffective in controlling their symptoms ( and that they ultimately quit taking ) would be far outweighed by the cost of treating schizophrenia patients for a serious reoccurrence of their illness , likely in a hospital or psychiatric ward setting .
Perhaps we would be further ahead monetarily to cover the entire cost of prescription drugs for patients who suffer from schizophrenia , making it more likely that they take their medications regularly , and preventing costly relapses .
We could test this theory by comparing schizophrenia patients and their reoccurrence rates in the U.S. against the same population in a country such as Canada , where schizophrenia patients are covered under free health care plans .
If the null hypothesis was true , and there is no difference in the populations , my theory does n’t hold much water .
However , given the fact that 1 % of the population in the U.S. suffers from schizophrenia , which translates to approximately 3 million people , it may be worth testing the theory .
Paying for all of their prescription drugs would cost a large sum of money .
Then again , so does paying for repeated treatment for reoccurrences of their disease caused by failure to take their medications .
At the very least , there should be no restrictions on medications that may be prescribed to them by their doctors , who can be assumed to know them best , as opposed to government employees who make such decisions about health care .

You 'll be pretty hard - pressed to find anyone who thinks the $ 2 per share that JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE : JPM ) offered for Bear Stearns ( NYSE : BSC ) makes logical sense .
Bear was stuck in some seriously thick mud over the weekend , and its only other option was to prepare for its own funeral .
Alas , it took the only other route available : succumb to an all - out fire sale .
But since news of the deal on Sunday , Bear Stearns shares have n't traded anywhere near $ 2 , and in fact they briefly flirted as high as $ 8.50 during Tuesday 's rally .
What gives ?
My Foolish colleague Tom Hutchinson proposed yesterday that some of the discrepancy may be a result investors who are holding on tight for a higher bid from another bank , such as UBS ( NYSE : UBS ) or Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) .
That 's entirely possible , but with the stock trading as much as four times as high as the current offer , something still smells a little fishy .
To put it in perspective , Countrywide Financial ( NYSE : CFC ) currently trades about 20 % below its proposed buyout offer from B of A .
Here are a few other explanations this Fool thinks are more likely to blame :
Shorty got back
After Bear was the target of numerous rumors about its liquidity last week -- the same rumors that ended up bringing it down -- it 's pretty likely that a wave of hedge funds and other heavy - hitting investors began shorting Bear Stearns stock , hoping to cash in on the impending collapse .
Like clockwork , that collapse came to fruition , and those who sold shares short made out like bandits .
For a quick tutorial on the mechanics of shorting , check out this easy - to - understand guide .
I 'll wait for you to finish ... take your time ... done ?
Good .
So now you know that once short - sellers make their money , the next step is to repurchase the shares they originally sold .
With Bear falling upward of 90 % over just a few days , it 's likely that many of those short - sellers scrambled to buy back the shares this week and created an artificial demand that explains a lot of the curious price .
Bondholders ' revenge
Those who hold Bear Stearns bonds are probably making a big push to make sure the deal actually goes through .
If the deal fails and Bear goes into bankruptcy , bondholders ( and shareholders ) might as well be left holding the equivalent of toilet paper .
How does this explain the price run-up ?
Since the bonds ' future requires the deal to be completed , bondholders are probably feverishly buying shares of stock so they can get a say in the shareholder vote on the deal .
Even if they have to pay an exorbitant premium on the shares , it 's well worth the cost .
Unlike shareholders , bondholders actually have a good chance at coming out relatively healthy from all of this , from a financial standpoint .
You 'd better believe they 'll do everything possible to swing a vote in their favor .
Buying votes
There 's another party out there that 's probably buying shares to gain more voting power : JPMorgan Chase itself .
Bear 's employees hold about one - third of the company 's shares , and since their savings and future employment have pretty much gone up in smoke , they have no big incentive to make sure the deal goes through .
JPMorgan knows that , and since it 's getting Bear Stearns virtually for free , it has an enormous incentive to make sure the vote turns out in its favor .
Even if it has to pay a huge premium for the shares , the downside of a failed deal would probably cost JPMorgan -- and the entire financial sector -- a sum of money magnitudes greater down the road .
Sure , it 's entirely possible that Bear Stearns is trading at a lofty premium simply because it 's waiting for a sweetened offer , but if that were the only factor involved , you probably would n't see shares trading much above $ 3 or so .
For those of you crossing your fingers and wishing the $ 2 deal wo n't ever come true :
Do n't hold your breath .
There 's a sucker born every minute .

Having been lulled into believing that I really was in New York , I made the mistake of trying to find my own Alphabet City apartment within the game .
I walked down to Chinatown  that took only a few seconds  found what I thought was Houston Street , and made my way to where Avenue A ( and my apartment ) should have been .
But after traversing only a block or two of bodegas and backward - hatted hipsters bobbing their heads to the beats of miniature iPods , I somehow found myself at the southern entrance to Grand Central Terminal .
It was as if some unknown natural disaster had recently touched down and attacked only the portions of New York that I cared for most deeply .
My city  at least , the parts of it that I thought of as my city  no longer existed .
So I regrouped and tried to find the high - rise apartment building on East 40th Street where I grew up in the ’70s and ’ 80s .
I started at the United Nations , made my way west through a perfect simulacrum of Tudor City ( with another saxophone player performing in the park ) and within a few short steps had gone all the way to St. Patrick ’s Cathedral .
Foiled again !
It seemed a perfectly logical and human impulse , to prove to myself that I was somewhere recognizable by finding the one place in it that was most recognizable to me .
Yet there was no way that the game could satisfy this impulse : like a comic - book superhero drawn by the legendary artist Jack Kirby , whose characters ’ fists grew larger and feet grew smaller as they flew up out of their panels , the proportions of this version of Manhattan were an optical illusion .
The parts that everybody would notice were blown up larger than life ; the parts that virtually no one would care about were shrunk to nothingness .
Faced with this catastrophic revelation , I turned to a life of crime .
I hijacked cars and crashed them into traffic poles ; I raced a motorcycle through Central Park and dismounted just before the bike plunged into the lake ( my way of letting the boathouse know I wo n’t be holding my wedding reception there ) .
I jumped off the observation deck of the Empire State Building , just because I could , though I took no pleasure from the sickening scream my character let out , nor the sound of his jacket flapping in the wind , 86 stories to the ground .
At the urging of my human confederates , I even attempted one of Grand Theft Auto ’s missions  tasks I was supposed to be completing to progress through the game properly  that required me to shoot my way through a gang of drug smugglers and steal their truckload of contraband .
I did as I was instructed , but my heart just was n’t in it .
If I truly believed in Liberty City as a functioning community , how could I open fire on my fellow simulated citizens ( even if they shot at me first ) ?
How could I tread all over the social contract in a ripped - off truck full of bootleg prescription medication ?
WASHINGTON  Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey rejected on Thursday the idea of creating a national task force to combat the country ’s mortgage fraud crisis , calling the problem a localized one akin to “ white - collar street crimes . ”
Mr. Mukasey made clear that he saw the mortgage fraud problem at the root of the nation ’s housing crisis as a serious one .
But he said he was confident that the Justice Department ’s current approach  using local prosecutors ’ offices around the country to oversee separate F.B.I. investigations  was adequate .
Since he took over as attorney general last November , Mr. Mukasey has grappled with how best to deal with the law enforcement side of the growing housing crisis .
He said in March , for instance , that the Justice Department was still struggling to determine whether there was a “ larger criminal story ” behind the housing crisis .
He gave his most definitive answer on Thursday in a briefing for reporters , saying that he did not think that the kind of national task force created at the Justice Department in 2002 to investigate the collapse of Enron was “ the proper response ” to the current crisis .
It 's impossible to get a completely comprehensive look at a developer with just two interviews , but with this set of two interview sessions conducted earlier this year , Gamasutra hopes to present a more rounded look at Seattle - based Bungie , the studio behind one of the most successful franchises in history - Halo .
To begin with , Gamasutra presents the full version of a discussion with environment artist Mike Zak and community and PR director Brian Jarrard , originally excerpted in Game Developer magazine .
It touches on everything from the interplay between art and engineering to the mood at Bungie following its October 2007 emancipation from Microsoft .
This is followed by a discussion with Chris Butcher , an engineering lead at Bungie , who was responsible for implementing the innovative and robust online features in Halo 3 .
This is a pretty exciting time at Bungie , I 'd imagine .
Not only did you just ship one of the best - selling games of 2007 , but you 've claimed independence at the same time .
Mike Zak : Yes .
It 's a great time to be at Bungie .
Halo has always stood out from a lot of first - person shooters through its naturalistic environments , and even the city or urban environments have that certain something ... distinct .
If you look at any screenshot from Halo , even if the HUD were n't up , you 'd know it was from Halo .
MZ : Awesome .
Thank you for noticing .
Hey , it 's not brown .
Bungie / Microsoft's Halo : Combat Evolved
MZ : ( laughter )
That 's really important to us on the art staff .
There 's a precedent set by Halo 1 , and there 's a lot of gritty , realistic games out there that do that really well , but for us , we 're more inspired by slightly more imaginative spaces and more awe - inspiring vistas and ideas .
Personally , it 's a dream franchise to work on in environment , because I get pretty tired of bricks and rusty pipes .
Not that I do n't admire a lot of games that have really impressive bricks and rusty pipes , but you get the opportunity to let your imagination go with Halo environments , and really build spaces there .
You might want to hang out there , to not necessarily fight in , but to have a picnic or go for a hike .
Do you think that serves an important gameplay function , too ?
The way you build your environments -- how does that affect and enhance the gameplay ?
MZ : I think they give better choices .
I would n't know if those inform the gameplay as much as the tone , so it 's not in a direct way .
It depends on how you want to define gameplay , but if you want to talk about gameplay as the specific mechanics of character interaction and the fighting mechanics .
Probably the most direct way that the aesthetics and the level environments match up would be , for example , the Forerunner architecture style really lends itself to building playgrounds that are architectural and structural , but are inscrutable enough in function so that you can really go to town with things that might be a little too gamey .
For example , in a contemporary shooter where you 're going through bombed - out streets .
You can't have platforms and ramps and weird conduits the way that we can .
In some ways , the theme really supports that , but at the end of the day , we can do a lot of that with rocks and terrain and whatnot .
You can have the earth serve the same mechanical functions .
Genetically modified mosquitoes could soon be released into the wild in an attempt to combat malaria .
Scientists at Imperial College London , who created the GM insects , say they could wipe out natural mosquito populations and save thousands of lives in malaria - stricken regions .
Led by Andrea Crisanti , the team added a gene that makes the testicles of the male mosquitoes fluorescent , allowing the scientists to distinguish and easily separate them from females .
The plan is to breed , sterilise and release millions of these male insects so they mate with wild females but produce no offspring , eradicating insects in the target region within weeks .
Professor Crisanti said : " Our mosquitoes are nearly ready for testing in the wild .
This is a technology that works and could make a real difference .
The beauty is that it 's very specific .
Unlike insecticides , sterile males target only the species you want to attack . "
Mosquitoes that spread malaria have long been a target for sterile male technology , which has been used to eradicate the screwworm fly from the US , Mexico and Central America .
The International Atomic Energy Agency has been using its radiation technology to support health projects , and wants to release sterile mosquitoes to tackle malaria in northern Sudan and on Reunion island in the Indian ocean - but they and other groups have been hampered by an inability to distinguish the males , which do not bite people .
Female mosquitoes transmit malaria , even if sterile , so releasing them alongside males would make the situation worse .
Prof Crisanti said : " The really challenging problem is to identify the males .
There is no difference between the larvae and as adults they fly , so the logistics of trying to separate them when they 're adults is immense . "
To solve the problem , his team altered the DNA of the mosquito species Anopheles stephensi , the principal carrier of malaria in Asia , so that the males expressed a fluorescent green protein in their sperm .
A sorting machine based on laser light separated male from female larvae , according to whether they glowed or not .
Writing in Nature Biotechnology today , the scientists say the machine could sort 180,000 larvae in 10 hours .
The next step is to scale up the technique to provide the millions of GM insects needed to make a large - scale release effective .
The scientists also need to check the sterile males will be strong enough to compete with wild rivals when released - the strategy depends on female mosquitoes , who only mate once in their two - week lifespan , choosing sterile males .
Prof Crisanti said other mosquito species could be modified in the same way , including Anopheles gambiae , which is responsible for a large part of the 2.7 m deaths caused by malaria each year .
He is talking to international agencies about setting up a trial .
Scientists have previously considered releasing both male and female mosquitoes that have been genetically modified in a different way , making them unable to transmit malaria .
The idea is that altered insects would spread the disruptive genes through natural mosquito populations , but concerns about whether the inserted genes could transfer to other organisms have so far scuppered plans to set up large - scale breeding colonies to test it .
Prof Crisanti argued that , because the new GM mosquitoes are sterilised , releasing them into the environment does not pose significant risks :
" It wo n't transmit any genes to the environment .
This allows us to test the transgenic technology in a very safe way that overcomes the previous environmental and safety concerns . "
Releasing males only would ensure people were not bitten by GM mosquitoes , he added .
Sue Mayer of Genewatch agreed that the new GM insect did address some of the previous concerns , but she called for thorough testing of the mosquitoes before they were considered for release .
" Changing one gene can sometimes affect others , so there are still questions to ask , " she said .
There are political barriers too .
The London group 's insect is best suited to tackling malaria in impoverished urban areas of south - east Asia and India , where World Health Organisation trials of sterile male mosquitoes to fight dengue fever collapsed in the 1970s amid biowarfare accusations .
The males of the mosquito involved in the Delhi trials could be separated because their pupae were smaller , but they were never released after newspaper articles claimed the experiment might secretly be used to gather data on how to spread yellow fever .
Chris Curtis , a malaria expert with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who worked on the WHO project in India , said : " We were all set to go and there was a huge uproar .
You have to handle the public relations very carefully . "
Female mosquitoes can travel several kilometres after mating , he said , so the sterile male technique is best suited to isolated insect populations , such as in cities .
" If females that have already mated fly in from outside your release area then they carry on laying fertile eggs .
That 's fatal . "
Footnotes
Malaria
The world 's most common and deadly parasitic disease .
It is spread from person to person when female mosquitoes feed on human blood .
Infects up to 500 million people each year , and kills an estimated 2.7 million people .
Sterile male technology
Male insects can be sterilised using chemicals and radiation .
If enough sterile males can be released to breed with females , the insect population of a target region can crash within weeks .
Fluorescent green protein
Originally identified in jellyfish that live in the cold waters of the north Pacific ocean .
The protein glows green under ultraviolet light .
Large - scale release
Huge numbers of sterile males would have to be released , possibly several hundred thousand at different locations throughout a city in several waves over a month .
Yellow fever
The disease was absent from Asia but appeared on a US list of potential biowarfare agents .
When an Indian journalist discovered the common name of the insect involved was " yellow fever mosquito " the trials were halted .
Gandhi once said , describing his critics , " First they ignore you , then they laugh at you , then they fight you , then you win . "
After declaring , essentially out of nowhere , that he had a program to end the disease of aging , renegade biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey knows how the first three steps of Gandhi 's progression feel .
Now he 's focused on the fourth .
" I 've been at Gandhi stage three for maybe a couple of years , " de Grey said .
" If you 're trying to make waves , certainly in science , there 's a lot of people who are going to have insufficient vision to bother to understand what you 're trying to say . "
This weekend , his organization , The Methuselah Foundation , is sponsoring its first U.S. conference on the emerging interdisciplinary field that de Grey has helped kick start .
( Its first day , Friday , will be free and open to the public . )
The conference , Aging : The Disease - The Cure - The Implications , held at UCLA , is an indication of how far de Grey has come in mainstreaming his ideas .
Less than a decade ago , de Grey was a relatively unknown computer scientist doing his own research into aging .
As recently as three years ago a cadre of scientists wrote in the Nature - sponsored journal EMBO Reports , that his research program , known as Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence , was " so far from plausible that it commands no respect at all within the informed scientific community . "
Also in 2005 , MIT - sponsored magazine Technology Review went so far as to offer a $ 20,000 prize to anyone who could prove that de Grey 's program was " so wrong that it was unworthy of learned debate . "
( No one won . )
Now , though , some scientists are beginning to view his approach – looking at aging as a disease and bringing in more disciplines into gerontology – as worthwhile , even if they still look askance at his claims of permanent reversible aging within a lifespan .
The Methuselah Foundation now has an annual research funding budget of several million dollars , de Grey says , and it 's beginning to show lab results that he thinks will turn scientists ' heads .
What 's more , other researchers have also found some success pursuing similarly structured research programs .
For example , late last year , the Buck Institute for Age Research received $ 25 million from the National Institutes of Health to establish a home for the " new scientific discipline of geroscience . "
The new field , and its research institute , are dedicated to proactively fighting aging with researchers from a dizzying array of fields .
" There are vast areas of what we 're calling geroscience , which is the interface between aging and disease , " said Gordon Lithgow , a Buck researcher who is managing interdisciplinary geroscience research for the institute .
And de Grey seems to have earned Lithgow 's respect not necessarily by the power of his ideas , but rather his powers of persuasion in getting money for researchers to put his ideas into practice .
" We 're all out here doing the best damn experiments we can think of …
So the response to Aubrey was , go off and get a grant to do [ experiments ] , " Lithgow said .
" And to be fair , that 's what he 's done .
He 's gone out and raised money in an unconventional way and funded his research . "
In research that will first be presented on Friday at the conference , Methuselah - funded scientists will demonstrate a proof - of - concept experiment for using bacterial enzymes to fight atherosclerosis , or the hardening of the arteries .
That 's an idea that de Grey has been pushing for years .
" Back in 2002 , I published an inconspicuous review paper that suggested we might be able to use this approach , " he said .
But de Grey is n't quite an establishment figure yet .
Instead , he seems to have made the move from outsider crackpot to , well , insider crackpot .
Lithgow maintains that de Grey still makes predictions far beyond what the messy lab work of biology can support .
" Aubrey extrapolates from current hard science into , ' If we can do something about this process and that and seven or eight other ands , then there 's this great opportunity for great human life extension , ' " Lithgow said .
" And it 's at that point that a lot of scientists are dropping off . "
For now , de Grey and his foundation keep trucking along trying to pick off each of those processes one by one .
" In perhaps seven or eight years , we 'll be able to take mice already in middle age and treble their lifespan just by giving them a whole bunch of therapies that rejuvenate them , " de Grey said .
" Gerontologists all over , even my most strident critics , will say yes , Aubrey de Grey is right . "
Even as he imagines completing Gandhi 's fourth step , de Grey always keeps his eye on the ultimate prize – the day when the aging - as - disease meme reaches the tipping point necessary to funnel really big money into the field .
" The following day , Oprah Winfrey will be saying , aging is a disease and let 's fix it right now , " de Grey said .

Lambda calculus for real analysis by Paul Taylor
Andrej Bauer
,
Paul Taylor has published a revised version of his `lambda` - calculus for real analysis .
I recommend it to anyone who is interested in real analysis , be it a computer scientist , numerical analyst , or just a “ true ” analyst .
The first , second , and third time I talked to Paul I could not understand a word of what he was saying , and that ’s not just because he is a native speaker of English English .
I only began to “ get it ” when he visited me in Ljubljana .
So I think it ’s perhaps worth explaining a bit what this “ `lambda` - calculus for real analysis ” is about .
Suppose you took a course in geometry which did not start with the primitive notions “ point ” and “ line ” , or the axioms they satisfy .
Instead , the teacher would first talk briefly about rational numbers and equivalence relations , then explain that a point is an ordered pair of certain equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers , while a line is a set of points satisfying certain conditions which look like they were pulled out of thin air .
The teacher would tell you that you just had to take it on faith that this was the best way to do geometry and that eventually you would develop deep intuition about what it was all about .
He would masterfully use very complicated rulers to draw various configurations of lines and points .
But when you tried to use the same tools , you would discover that the rulers are quite difficult to use and have razor - blade sharp edges ( supposedly that allows more accurate drawings , and makes the rules useful in the kitchen , too ) .
Your drawings would always come out crooked and often smudged with blood .
Only with years of training could you understand “ circles ” , whatever that was ( you have never seen a picture ) .
Would that strike you as a strange way of teaching geometry ?
Now consider how we teach traditional topology , the science about spaces and continuous maps .
First we speak briefly about sets , then we tell the students that a space is a pair of sets , one of them being a subset of the powerset of the other , satisfying certain conditions which look like they were pulled out of thin air .
The students just have to take it on faith that it all makes sense and that eventually they will appreciate the depth of the concepts .
In addition , we teach them lots of powerful set - theoretic constructions which allow an expert to define whatever topological space or continuos map he wants ( and set theory is useful in functional analysis , too ) .
However , the students usually get their constructions wrong and define things which are not spaces and are not continuous maps .
It takes them several years to appreciate the notion of compactness .
Does this strike you as a strange way of explaining the science of continuum and continuity ?
Just like geometry is expressed directly in terms of points and lines , it should be possible to formulate topology directly in terms of spaces and continuous maps .
What would such a theory look like ?
Abstract Stone Duality ( ASD ) is Paul ’s answer to the question .
The paper `lambda` - calculus for real analysis is an application of ASD to the space of real numbers and real maps .
I cannot possibly explain all the ideas that the paper contains .
Suffice it to say that topology becomes much more logical ( pun intended ) .
For example , compact spaces are closely related to universal quantifiers `forall` and the Hausdorff property is just continuity of inequality `!=` .
And there is a nice duality at work : the dual of “ compact ” ( related to `forall` ) is “ overt ” ( related to `exists` ) , and the dual of “ Hausdorff space ” ( `! =` is continuous ) is “ discrete space ” ( `=` is continuous ) .
Paul shows how Dedekind cuts are related to definite descriptions and connectedness to modal operators .
And because the theory allows a computational interpretation it gives novel ideas on how to compute with real numbers .
This stuff is worth reading .
If you have questions , I will happily answer them , and maybe Paul will join the discussion , too .

House Judiciary Committee subpoenas Karl Rove
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich ) issued a subpoena to Karl Rove on Thursday as part of an investigation into improprieties at the Department of Justice .
According to a statement from Conyers , Rove 's lawyer Robert Luskin informed the chairman that his client would not agree to testify voluntarily before the committee .
" It is unfortunate that Mr. Rove has failed to cooperate with our requests , " Conyers said in a statement .
" Although he does not seem the least bit hesitant to discuss these very issues weekly on cable television and in the print news media , Mr. Rove and his attorney have apparently concluded that a public hearing room would not be appropriate .
Unfortunately , I have no choice today but to compel his testimony on these very important matters . "
The deadline for Rove to respond to the subpoena is July 10 .
If he appears , Rove is expected to face questions on the White House 's role in the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006 and the prosecution of former Democratic Gov. Don Siegelman of Alabama .
Democrats have pushed hard to get senior White House officials , including Rove , to testify on the prosecutor purge and other issues , only to be rebuffed or run into legal challenges from the Bush administration and Justice Department .
For instance , House Judiciary has approved criminal and civil contempt citations against former White House Counsel Harriet Miers and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten seeking information on the U.S. attorney firings .
The two officials , citing an executive privilege claim by President Bush , had refused to comply with the panel 's subpoenas .
DOJ refused to bring a criminal contempt case against Miers and Bolten , so othe Judiciary Committee filed a civil contempt lawsuit against them .
The Senate Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Rove on the U.S. attorney firings , but citing Bush 's privilege claim , he refused to appear .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) has declined to bring a criminal contempt citation to the Senate floor .
House Republicans have repeatedly dismissed the Democrats ' subpoenas as political stunts , including the Rove subpoena today .
They note that White House Counsel Fred Fielding has offered to allow Rove , Miers and other top Bush aides to be interviewed by the committee , but only behind closed doors and with no trancript of the conversation being kept .
“ Mr. Rove voluntarily offered information that was requested , but Judiciary Committee Democrats refused his offer , proving once again that they are not really interested in the facts . " said Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - Texas ) , ranking member of Judiciary , in a statement released today .
" Therefore , Committee Republicans will demand that Jill Simpson — who has made unfounded accusations against Karl Rove — be called to testify at the hearing .
In the meantime , Committee Republicans will accept Mr. Rove 's offer of voluntary information , choosing responsible oversight over partisan games . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House approved a bipartisan plan Friday to overhaul the nation 's wiretapping laws .
President Bush urges Congress to act quickly on the domestic surveillance legislation Friday .
The House vote was 293- 129 , with 188 Republicans and 105 Democrats voting for it .
One Republican voted against the measure , which now moves to the Senate .
House and Senate leaders announced a bipartisan plan to overhaul the wiretapping laws Thursday .
The deal breaks a four - month impasse between the Bush administration and Congress over whether to protect telecommunication companies that took part in a program that critics say was illegal .
Before the vote , President Bush said Friday that the bill " will help our intelligence professionals learn our enemies ' plans for new attacks . "
Bush said the legislation will " allow our intelligence professionals to quickly and effectively monitor the plans of terrorists abroad while protecting the liberties of Americans here at home . "
" The enemy who attacked us on September 11 is determined to strike this country again , " the president said on the Oval Office patio .
" It 's vital that our intelligence community has the ability to learn who the terrorists are talking to , what they 're saying and what they are planning . "
Do n't Miss Deal clears way for wiretap overhaul
In a news conference after the vote , leaders from both parties defended the compromise bill .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , a Maryland Democrat , and Minority Whip Roy Blunt , a Missouri Republican , emphasized that there is no immunity protection for anyone in the government .
Hoyer said the bill , opposed by a majority of his Democratic colleagues , was the best possible deal : " Our alternative was essentially between this compromise bill and the protections we built in , or the Senate bill , which gave immunity outright .
" We can't really change what has happened , but going forward , we would protect and have court oversight of any program that a future administration might undertake , " he said .
Blunt argued , " The retroactive protection for communication companies that cooperated with the government when asked to , I believe , is fully there , but the courts get to decide that .
He added , " In my opinion , they will be dismissed because of the evidence standard here . "
Both Hoyer and Blunt emphasized the importance of the " exclusivity " provision inserted into the bill that designates the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act program as the sole authority for electronic surveillance .
" This is the law for monitoring communications in all cases , " Blunt said .
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller , D - West Virginia , said the bill would prevent administration officials from conducting any new warrantless surveillance .
But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , remains opposed to retroactive immunity , his office said .
Sen .
Russ Feingold , D - Wisconsin , one of the harshest critics of the warrantless wiretapping program , called the proposal " a capitulation . "
Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Michigan , the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee , said the intelligence community depends on " the backing of patriotic private companies . "
" Those businesses that cooperate are putting their shareholders and employees at stake , and they deserve our support , not multibillion - dollar lawsuits , " Hoekstra said .
Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Mike McConnell , director of national intelligence , sent a letter to House leaders Thursday saying they support the bill .
The letter said the amendments " would provide the intelligence community with the tools it needs to collect the foreign intelligence necessary to secure our nation while protecting the civil liberties of Americans . "
They also cited the protections for phone companies who assisted the government .
A temporary law granting immunity to telephone and Internet providers who took part in the program expired in February , when leading Democrats opposed making those protections retroactive .
In 2005 , Bush acknowledged that he ordered the National Security Agency to intercept communications between U.S. residents and people overseas suspected of having ties to terrorism .
The administration insists that the program was authorized when Congress approved military action against al Qaeda after the terrorist network 's 2001 attacks .
But Democrats and some Republicans in Congress said the move violated a 1978 law that required intelligence agencies to get court approval before spying on Americans .
The revelations led to several lawsuits against phone companies that cooperated with the program .
The administration has refused to share records of the program with federal courts , invoking a " state secrets " privilege .
Under the new proposal , the courts would have access to all documents and would be able to hear claims from the plaintiffs in those cases .
But judges would be asked to determine whether the companies received written certification that the surveillance was authorized by the president and that it was lawful , a proposal the American Civil Liberties Union says guarantees the cases will be dismissed .
" The telecom companies simply have to produce a piece of paper we already know exists , resulting in immediate dismissal , " said Caroline Fredrickson , the head of the ACLU 's Washington legislative office .
She said the bill " does nothing to keep Americans safe and is a constitutional farce . "
For future wiretaps , the new measure would require a special court set up under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act to approve any effort to spy on Americans .
Authorities could act for up to seven days before seeking a warrant -- more than twice the three - day emergency period under the current law .
The new plan calls for a review of surveillance programs by the inspectors general of U.S. intelligence agencies within a year .
And the law would expire in 2012 , giving the next administration the opportunity to review the program .

The Pentagon Peddlers
When he was mayor of Philadelphia , Frank Rizzo was charged with nepotism in the hiring of the city fire commissioner , to which he responded : “ Whaddaya mean nepotism ?
He ’s my brother ! ”
Likewise , the Pentagon seems confused on the concept of ethical dealings - not over the hiring of relatives , but in the buying of supplies .
The Army and Air Force Exchange Service , which runs 1,400 stores on U.S. military bases around the world , hauling in some $ 7 billion a year in sales , has been getting much of the apparel in these stores from a notorious sweatshop in Nicaragua .
This violates policy , regulations , common decency … and our nation ’s moral principles .
The Chentex factory , owned by a Taiwanese textile conglomerate , employs 1,800 workers who sew 35,000 pairs of jeans a day .
The jeans retail in the Exchange stores for about $ 30 a pair ; workers are paid only 20 cents for each pair , an abysmal sub- poverty wage even in impoverished Nicaragua .
Chentex workers are not allowed to go to the bathroom without being monitored .
They work up to 70 hours a week ( including forced overtime ) , and it ’s not unusual for them to be screamed at and hit by factory managers .
Not surprisingly , many have attempted to form a union , demanding an 8 - cent increase on each pair of jeans - an increase that would have no impact on consumer price and would not pinch corporate profits .
Yet , when more than 150 of them went on strike for this modicum of fairness , Chentex fired them .
The Pentagon is one of this sweatshop ’s largest customers , meaning our tax dollars keep it in business .
Representative Cynthia McKinney of Georgia is working to stop the Pentagon from coddling sweatshop labor by requiring any supplier to pay workers fairly and treat them decently .

What ’s on a Package ?
Time for another trip into the Far , Far , Far -Out Frontiers of Free Enterprise , with Consumer Reports magazine as our guide .
Let ’s start with an innovation on the old Made - in - the - USA label .
Tisonic Inc. makes a radio cassette player for automobiles , and the package proudly bears a rendering of our U.S. flag .
But , wait … the stars on this flag are blue on a field of white .
Not only are the colors reversed , but the print beneath the flag says “ Made For U.S.A . ” - not made in our country .
Clever .
“ Worrisome ” is the word that might occur to you if you bought the Super Signal Booster to juice up your radio reception .
The front of the package brags that the Booster uses “ Secret Military Technology ! ” and has been a “ Secret device for the military for YEARS ! ”
The back of the package confesses : “ Made in China . ” Worrisome .
As for logic - defying labels , how about “ Chicken Noodle Vegetarian ” soup ?
Then there ’s the Krylon spray paint promo that says you can turn an old end table into a like - new treasure in only “ 30 minutes . ”
Go for it - the copy explains that all you have to do is remove all hardware , strip and scrape off the old paint , sand the table , wipe it clean and prime it , sand it again , mask areas you do n’t want painted , apply one coat of paint , wait , then apply a second coat .
I do n’t know … sounds like maybe a 35 - or 40 - minute job to me .
I also appreciate the label on Food Lion ’s apple cider vinegar , which brags : “ Made from REAL APPLES ! ”
Well , that ’s better than making apple cider vinegar from squirrel heads .
Pain - On - the - Job
Ever had back pain ?
How about tendonitis , carpal tunnel syndrome , or some other chronic ailment that stabs you like an ice pick and can cripple you ?
A hundred million American workers perform repetitive functions that cause these injuries .
Six hundred thousand a year have to miss work because of heavy lifting , assembly - line repetition , constant typing , and other tasks .
Day - by - day , year - by - year , these tasks tear at their backs , wrists , elbows , muscles , and tendons , leading to chronic , debilitating pain .
Late last year though , the Labor Department finally took action .
After studying the matter for 10 years , OSHA issued standards to protect working families from some of these job - related injuries .
The new rules range from merely providing information so employees can know about these injuries to requiring companies to provide better - designed tools and workstations .
But , oh , the squealing from corporate executives and their puppets in Congress !
“ We ca n’t bear the cost , ” they wailed - never mind that many firms here and abroad already do this , and industry would actually save some $ 9 billion a year because of reduced worker ’s comp costs and increased productivity .
Stephen Bokat of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce even asserted that the problem does n’t exist : “ We do n’t think there is any scientific basis to say how many repetitions are too many , how much weight is too much , ” he sniffed .
Really , Tiger ?
How much heavy lifting do you do , not counting your tongue ?
Workplace injuries are a cost of doing business .
Instead of making workers pay with pain and medical bills , let ’s do all we can to stop hurting people on the job .

Swear is a game I wrote a long time ago ( the original version ran on the Amiga ! ) .
The game itself is the classic worm game , played in non-euclidean space - that is to say , it is played on the surface of various three - dimensional shapes .
It 's a pretty simplistic game , and it's old enough to use no hardware acceleration of any kind , so performance may vary .
It 's multi-platform , using the Allegro library .
I 've built it for Windows and Mac OS X .
The Mac OS X version does n't run all that smoothly , though , and I recommend using MacSwear instead .
Theoretically , it should compile on Linux machines too , if they have the Allegro library installed , and you run make os=unix .
However , this is largely untested .
Realistically speaking , I probably wo n't do much development on this from here on out .
If you want to report bugs , go ahead , but there 's no guarantee that I 'll do anything about them .
If you want to take the source and run with it , go right ahead .
MilkSnake is an updated version of this same basic game for Mac OS X , but with much improved graphics , and with music and sounds !
Nissim Nasser had served six years in an Israeli jail for espionage An Israeli citizen convicted of spying for Hezbollah in 2002 , Nissim Nasser , has been deported to Lebanon .
And amid rumours the release might be part of a prisoner swap , Lebanese group Hezbollah returned remains of Israeli soldiers killed in the 2006 war .
Mr Nasser was born in Lebanon to a Jewish mother and a Shia Muslim father .
He left the country in 1982 and became an Israeli citizen .
Israel revoked his citizenship when his six - year sentence ended a month ago .
Mr Nasser was driven to the border crossing near Lebanon 's southern town of Naqoura in an unmarked white jeep and handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) .
Hezbollah party Hezbollah officials had prepared a celebratory party for his return , with a stage erected near the border and loudspeakers blaring patriotic music across a main square .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement A more extensive prisoner swap between the two sides could involve two Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah in 2006 - an act which prompted the 33 - day war between Israel and the Shia militant group - and a number of Lebanese citizens held by Israel .
There has been no comment from Hezbollah on those rumours , and Israel has denied that this deportation is part of any wider deal .
But as Mr Nasser was released , Hezbollah said it had handed over the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed during the 2006 war to the ICRC , in order that they could be returned to Israel .
The ICRC confirmed it had received a box of human remains from Hezbollah which it had turned it over to Israel .
The exchange was a clear signal that negotiations had been going on behind the scenes , possibly facilitated by German mediators , says the BBC's Mike Sergeant in Beirut .
Born in 1968 , Mr Nasser left Lebanon during the Israeli invasion of 1982 and joined his mother 's family in Israel , where he settled near Tel Aviv .

Lebanon ’s factions appear to have halted a nascent civil war -- at least temporarily -- with an agreement struck Wednesday in Qatar between the Western - backed government of Fouad Siniora and the Syrian - backed Shiite Muslim militia Hezbollah .
But the peace deal cannot fairly be called a compromise .
Hezbollah won
That ’s the result of its stunning military victory earlier this month after the Lebanese army remained neutral as Hezbollah forces seized West Beirut and critical roads leading to Damascus .
Siniora ’s government was forced to make serious military concessions to Hezbollah and to enter into talks brokered by Qatar , which has close ties to Syria .
Depending on one ’s ideology , the deal reflects a necessary acceptance of political and military reality , or it is a sickening defeat for the secular , democratic movement that began March 14 , 2005 , and ultimately kicked the Syrians out of Lebanon .
Either way , it ’s a blow to the U.S. , which has hailed the Cedar Revolution as a triumph of democracy and sent significant military aid to Lebanon in the hopes of preventing a Syrian comeback .
Now it sees Hezbollah , a terrorist group that is in some ways more frightening than Al Qaeda , triumphing in Lebanon less than a year after Hamas took over Gaza .
In some ways , this outcome was inevitable .
The Shiites had long been punching below their weight in Lebanese politics because of the inability of their spiritual leader , Sheik Hassan Nasrallah , to translate his immense popularity and military strength into political power .
Now he has .
The deal gives Hezbollah veto power in the Cabinet in exchange for a pledge not to use its weapons to settle political disputes .
Needless to say , it does not require Hezbollah to disarm , as a U.N. resolution toothlessly demanded .
However , by turning his guns on his own countrymen , something he said he would never do , Nasrallah has squandered much of the credibility he had earned among many Lebanese as the nation ’s premier resistance fighter against Israel .
And therein lies hope that Nasrallah ’s command of the Lebanese Shiites could one day be challenged .
Hezbollah would have had far more power in Lebanon by now if it had begun building its stake in the government years ago .
Instead , it boycotted the Cabinet , held the parliament hostage , prevented the election of a new president and killed scores of people to demonstrate its military power .
Now that it has gained the political leverage it longed for , will it use its clout to help unite and rebuild Lebanon ?

Damascus and Tehran are likely to call the important shots , while Washington is left to ponder the meaning of yet another rout of one of its best Middle East allies by a popular but violent Islamist movement .

Nothing Indiana Jones can't handle
If you 've been thrilled ( despite suspension of disbelief ) by indestructible Indiana Jones hurtling down three spectacular CG waterfalls in a row , you might have wondered if our planet has REAL places with similarly enormous waterfalls in a jungle setting .
Well , here is a place with a full 800 meter vertical drop - this should appear lethal even to Indiana Jones screenwriters .
Angel Falls , Venezuela ( also called Salto Angel ) is the Earth 's highest uninterrupted waterfall .
It is 979 metres ( 3,230 feet ) tall - think of it as 2.5 times as tall as the Empire State Building and full 15 times higher than Niagara Falls !
( image credit : Nyaminyami )
Located in the Canaima National Park , in southeastern Venezuela , the falls start from the nameless creek that meanders through the series of highly - fractured crevices and gorges on top of a " Tepuy " , or table - top mountain .
The water then bursts into the void and plunges uninterrupted 2,421 feet to the river and more cascades below .
You can actually kayak to the base of the falls ( imagine how wet you 'll be there - though the waterfall is of such a great height that most water is turned into mist before it reaches the ground ) .

In a season of highest water , the single waterfall splits into three streams - sometimes even more , which together become a giant veil of water .
How to get to the Angel Falls ?
Not so easy .
You would need to hook up with a flight from Caracas or Ciudad Bolivar to get to the Canaima camp , from where you 'd start your trip along the river to the base of the falls .
This page lists the complete directions .
The travel guide even says that on cloudy days you can not see the falls ( must be a real let - downer after all this trouble to get there ! )
This is the most accessible viewpoint to photograph the falls :
The view from the top is fantastic enough to inspire a multitude of " Lost World " legends ( including the famous Conan Doyle book ) , not to mention the table - top mountain itself - a wonder - world of vegetation and species found nowhere else on Earth .

Stranded with wife and a gardener , looking for gold
Angel Falls were named after Jimmy Angel , a larger - than - life character , an experienced bush pilot and gold prospector , who accidentally discovered it in 1933 .
Ironically , he also ended up stranded on top of this waterfall - on the enormous and isolated mesa mountain Auyan - tepui ( which means " Devil Mountain " ) .
He and his wife Marie ( and their gardener ) were on reconnaissance flight to look for gold - but damaged the plane at the landing and had to find the way down the mountain on foot .
It took them eleven days - but they survived the ordeal ( proving that cooperating - not arguing - with your wife can be beneficial in extreme circumstances )
The full story of Jimmy Angel adventures on top and around Auyan - tepui can be found on this excellent page - would make for a great adventure movie script .

Three months before the 1976 midair explosion of a Cuban plane off the coast of Barbados , CIA covert operative Luis Posada Carriles cabled his U.S. minders from Venezuela to report that the plot was in motion and asked for Washington ’s “ assistance . ”
Recently declassified CIA communications confirm that a U.S. agent got back to Posada within a few days .
Other internal communications obtained by the National Security Archive research project put Posada in regular contact with Washington handlers from the time of his arrival here just before the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion through the late 1990s , when he allegedly masterminded a series of Havana hotel bombings in an effort to crush Cuba ’s budding tourism business .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Saturday May 12 , 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 2 inches ; 85 words Type of Material : Correction
Freed suspect :
In an article in Thursday ’s Section A about suspected terrorist Luis Posada Carriles , the National Security Archive ’s Cuba Documentation Project was described as an effort to disclose past CIA operations .
The project seeks to make information public from a broad array of domestic and foreign government records .
Also , the article referred to a June 1998 interview he gave to “ author and freelance journalist ” Ann Louise Bardach , but failed to mention that Bardach ’s interview was granted to and published by the New York Times .
The 79 - year - old anticommunist , who turned up two years ago in Miami , has never been charged by U.S. justice officials with participating in a violent act , not even the hotel bombings purportedly financed by fellow Cuban exiles in New Jersey and about which Posada has boasted .
On Tuesday , the sole prosecution brought by Washington against the Cuban - born Posada , an immigration fraud charge , was quashed by a federal judge in Texas , leaving a man branded by the U.S. Justice Department as “ a dangerous criminal and an admitted mastermind of terrorist plots ” free to roam a country he entered illegally and from which another court has ordered him deported .

Angry denunciations from Cuba and Venezuela of the “ impunity ” accorded Posada reached a high point Wednesday after word spread that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone in El Paso had quashed the immigration case , denouncing the U.S. government for manipulating evidence and mistranslating testimony from its longtime collaborator .
“ In addition to engaging in fraud , deceit and trickery , this Court finds the Government ’s tactics in this case are so grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice .
As a result , this Court is left with no choice but to dismiss the indictment , ” Cardone wrote in her scathing 38 - page opinion .
As international condemnation mounts against the United States ’ failure to prosecute an admitted terrorist , congressional leaders were demanding to know Wednesday from U.S. Atty .
Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales why he has n’t declared Posada a security threat and jailed him under the Patriot Act .
“ Mr. Posada ’s release from prison calls into question our commitment to combating terrorism and raises concerns about a double standard in our treatment of terrorists , ” Rep. William D. Delahunt ( D - Mass . ) wrote the attorney general .

In an interview Wednesday , Delahunt said he planned to launch an investigation into Posada ’s longtime relationship with the U.S. government and the Bush administration ’s failure to brand Posada a terrorist .
A former prosecutor , Delahunt called Judge Cardone ’s action almost unprecedented in its excoriation of the government ’s handling of the case .
“ It is incumbent on us to conduct a thorough and exhaustive investigation in a professional manner , in a way that reassures the world that we ’re not hypocrites and that nefarious , unsavory machinations do not happen behind closed doors , ” Delahunt said of the Posada case , which he described as a baffling evasion of justice .
He also wants a probe into how evidence against Posada in the hotel bombings now sought by a New Jersey grand jury got destroyed at the FBI ’s Miami office in 2003 , after the government ’s only active case against Posada was dropped .
Posada at the time was serving a sentence in Panama for plotting to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro in 2000 , a term that would be cut short less than a year later as a favor to the Bush administration fighting for Cuban exile votes in its 2004 reelection battle .
Unease over CIA ties cited
Advertisement
National Security Archive project director Peter Kornbluh attributes the U.S. government ’s failure to win a conviction against Posada to Washington ’s apparent complicity in some of Posada ’s alleged criminal acts .
Prosecutors ’ efforts to banish any mention of his CIA service from the immigration case were “ a reflection of real concern about details of past operations that might get thrown into the trial , ” said Kornbluh , who oversees the George Washington University - based project aimed at disclosing past CIA operations .
Internal CIA cables and reports Kornbluh has unearthed suggest a pattern of contacts between Posada and U.S. government officials dating back to his arrival in Miami less than two years after Castro ’s 1959 revolutionary triumph .
FBI agents struggling to put a case together for the New Jersey grand jury have reportedly visited Havana in recent weeks in an unusual act of collaboration with Castro ’s security forces , who have preserved forensics in the case .
News reports of the Havana trip spurred angry outbursts from South Florida ’s three Cuban American congressional representatives .
The three Republicans blasted the Bush administration for “ asking a state sponsor of terrorism for ‘ evidence ’ regarding terrorism . ”
Those advocating prosecution of Posada point to admissions he made about supervising the hotel bombings , in a June 1998 interview with author and freelance journalist Ann Louise Bardach in Aruba .
One Italian tourist died in a 1997 bombing that Posada took responsibility for in the interview .

Bardach ’s notes and tapes from that three - day visit with the exile have been subpoenaed by the New Jersey grand jury investigating reported links and money transfers between Cuban exiles in Union City , N.J. , and Posada when he operated under a CIA - era code name from a front company in Guatemala .
Bardach has been fighting the subpoena , claiming journalistic privilege , and the government has so far refrained from pressing the issue .
The grand jury has approached Bardach for evidence against Posada because the FBI documentation of money transfers and other incriminating materials were destroyed in the 2003 Miami bureau incident that Delahunt wants investigated .
FBI spokeswoman Judy Orihuela said the supporting materials on any closed case are routinely cleared out of the bureau ’s evidence locker to make room for active cases .
With the U.S. government unable or unwilling to raise a case against Posada , pressure is mounting within congressional and human rights circles for the Justice Department to satisfy Venezuela ’s extradition request to try Posada for the Oct.
6,1976 , Cubana Airlines bombing that took 73 lives .

“ After learning that Mr. Luis Posada Carriles , a known terrorist , was released from U.S. custody and allowed to reside in the U.S. as a free man , I have become very concerned about our ability to protect our nation , ” U.S. Rep. Jose E. Serrano ( D - N.Y. ) wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff on Wednesday .
Extradition sought
The Caracas government asked for the extradition of Posada soon after he arrived in Florida in March 2005 on a shrimp boat owned by wealthy Cuban American developer Santiago Alvarez , now serving time for weapons violations related to another failed plot against Castro .
Posada roamed about Miami for two months before federal agents arrested him in May 2005 for illegally entering the country .
An immigration court ordered him deported four months later , but none of the countries contacted by Washington would take him .
Calls to the Cuban Interests Section and the Venezuela Information Office in Washington were not returned , but Cuban and Venezuelan media have denounced the freeing of Posada as evidence that Washington condones terrorism against innocent citizens of states it considers hostile .

With the immigration case dropped , Posada will be relieved of its accompanying house arrest and gag orders that have kept the ailing operative out of the public eye and confined to a small apartment in southwest Miami owned by his long - estranged wife .
Nieves Posada and the couple ’s two adult children had put up $ 350,000 in bonds pending trial .
Posada and his attorney were reportedly en route back to Miami from El Paso , where they had been preparing for the trial that was to have started Friday .
Amid scandals that have plagued the U.S. Justice Department , the Posada case has drawn little national attention beyond the exile community in Miami .
But pressure is mounting , both domestically and abroad , to expose Posada for a lifetime of alleged transgressions , even if some were committed on behalf of or with the full knowledge of U.S. officials .
Nearly a decade after the plane bombing , after Posada had escaped a Venezuelan jail pending retrial , a fellow CIA operative ferried him from his Caribbean hide - out to El Salvador .
There he earned as much as $ 10,000 a month from the U.S. government for organizing safe houses and flying weapons to anticommunist guerrillas in Nicaragua in what came to be known as the Iran - Contra affair .

Posada ’s CIA weapons and explosives training was put to use repeatedly in the exile ’s fight against Washington ’s enemies , including at least half a dozen alleged plots to assassinate Castro .

Taking daily recommended dosages of ibuprofen and acetaminophen caused a substantially greater increase over placebo in the amount of quadriceps muscle mass and muscle strength gained during three months of regular weight lifting , in a study by physiologists at the Human Performance Laboratory , Ball State University .
Dr. Chad Carroll , a postdoctoral fellow working with Dr. Todd Trappe , reported study results at Experimental Biology 2008 in San Diego on April 6 .
His presentation was part of the scientific program of the American Physiological Society ( APS ) .
Thirty - six men and women , between 60 and 78 years of age ( average age 65 ) , were randomly assigned to daily dosages of either ibuprofen ( such as that in Advil ) , acetaminophen ( such as that in Tylenol ) , or a placebo .
The dosages were identical to those recommended by the manufacturers and were selected to most closely mimic what chronic users of these medicines were likely to be taking .
Neither the volunteers nor the scientists knew who was receiving which treatment until the end of the study .
All subjects participated in three months of weight training , 15 - 20 minute sessions conducted in the Human Performance Laboratory three times per week .
The researchers knew from their own and other studies that training at this intensity and for this time period would significantly increase muscle mass and strength .
They expected the placebo group to show such increases , as its members did , but they were surprised to find that the groups using either ibuprofen or acetaminophen did even better .
An earlier study from the laboratory , measuring muscle metabolism ( or more precisely , muscle protein synthesis , the mechanism through which new protein is added to muscle ) , had looked at changes over a 24 hour period .
This “ acute ” study found that both ibuprofen and acetaminophen had a negative impact , by blocking a specific enzyme cyclooxygenase , commonly referred to as COX .
But that study looked at only one day .
Over three months , says Dr. Trappe , the chronic consumption of ibuprofen or acetaminophen during resistance training appears to have induced intramuscular changes that enhance the metabolic response to resistance exercise , allowing the body to add substantially more new protein to muscle .
The amount of change was measured in quadricep muscles using Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , the gold standard for determining muscle mass .
The researchers now are conducting assays of muscle biopsies taken before and after the three - month period of resistance training , in order to understand the metabolic mechanism of the positive effects of ibuprofen and acetaminophen .
One of the foci of Ball State ’s Human Performance Laboratory is the adaptation of the elderly to exercise .
Another is the loss of muscle mass that takes place when astronauts are exposed to long - term weightlessness .
This work has implications for both groups , says Dr. Trappe .

This article is an update to my previous post on 11/18 where I said I ’ll post the source code in a couple says .
Sorry that it took a little longer than a couple days . 🙂
Introduction
The last port of Quake II to managed C++ .NET was done by a company called Vertigo Software in 2003 .
Just like Id Software ‘s original release in 2001 , Vertigo made their source code available under the GNU General Public License ( otherwise known as the “ GPL ” ) .
Back then , before .NET 2005 , managed C++ had a very different syntax .
When creating objects there was no way to tell whether that object was a managed type or native type .
When dereferencing pointers there was no indication on whether the object was managed or native .
Many keywords specific to .NET were prefaced with a double underscore ( “ __ ” ) .
An array of managed types could be declared without being initialized .
There were many , many other differences in the old syntax compared to what we have today .
With the advent of .
NET 2005 Microsoft changed pretty much every aspect of managed C++ from the keywords themselves to how destructors and finalizers work ( destructors and finalizers basically have reversed rolls in .NET 2005 – not knowing this fact would cause most ports to crash ) .
Microsoft ’s reasoning for changing nearly everything was to make it more “ logical ” and conform more closely with other .NET languages .
I ’m not sure I agree with the “ logical ” part ( like why I ca n’t declare a normal array of managed types inside a managed class or managed struct ) but it does “ feel ” more like programming in C# without sacrificing the control of C ++.
For more details see Microsoft ’s conversion guide here .
Microsoft will be removing old syntax support in the next version of Visual Studio ( v10.0 ) .
Part of the reason I did this port was to keep the managed C++ version alive .
Now let ’s get into the details !
Download links :
Download source code only [ 1.5 MB ] ( you ’ll have to install your own pak file and Quake config file ) .
Requirements : DirectX SDK ( download here ) .
Must have before compiling !
See “ Requirements ” section for details .
Important note : if you compile the source code in “ Release Managed ” mode , for some strange reason it wo n’t run when started from Visual Studio , but will work fine when started from the command line or Windows explorer .
However , “ Debug Managed ” mode works in both cases .
The other configurations such as “ Release Native ” and “ Debug Native ” also worked .
Even though I pre-compiled just the managed builds in the third download above , if you want to get a zip file containing pre-compiled versions of all the build configurations ( managed and native ) send me an email via the Contact page of my blog ( https://gregs-blog.com/contact).
I ’ll send you a link of where you can download it ( note : that download is about 240 MB ) .
Projects
The Quake II source is organized into six project files :
game.vcproj ctf.vcproj quake2.vcproj radar.vcproj ref_gl.vcproj ref_soft.vcproj
All the projects are contained in the “ quake2_VC9 _Port.sln ” solution located in the source ’s root directory .
Here is a brief description of each project :
The “ game ” project contains the nuts and bolts of Quake II .
It compiles into a dll ( gamex86.dll ) which the quake2.exe calls in order to do game logic .
If this dll is changed , then how the game plays is also changed .
This is how the “ capture the flag ” version of Quake works – the gamex 86.dll is replaced with the dll from ctf.vcproj .
The “ ctf ” project contains the game logic used in the “ capture the flag ” version of Quake in multiplayer mode and outputs the corresponding gamex 86.dll .
The “ quake2 ” project creates the quake2.exe file .
It contains the game logic that is common and does n’t need to be changed by gamex 86.dll .
It does stuff like sound management , video blitting ( but not actual rendering or OpenGL ) , file management , etc .
The “ radar ” project was added by Vertigo Software and is not in the original Quake II game .
It is an add - on that allows the player to bring up a HUD ( or separate window ) showing where objects and enemies are located in the world map relative to the player ’s current position .
This project produces a dll called “ radar.dll ” .
The “ ref_gl ” project contains all the OpenGL code used in the game .
It produces the “ ref_gl.dll ” file .
The “ ref_soft ” project contains all the software - rendering code used in the game .
It is only called when running in software rendering mode or if your video card does n’t support OpenGL ( not likely these days ) .
This project outputs “ ref_soft.dll . ”
Requirements
In order for the source to compile you will need the DirectX SDK installed on your computer .
Quake II uses DirectX for sound and keyboard / mouse / joystick input .
You can download the DirectX SDK here .
I personally used the June 2007 release , but it should work with much earlier versions .
After the DirectX SDK installs , check for this environment variable : DXSDK_DIR .
It should have been set automatically by the DirectX installation , but if it is not there , set it manually to the root directory in which the SDK was installed ( on my computer it was : “ C: \Program Files \DirectX SDK ( June 2007 ) \ ” ) .
If you have downloaded the source - only zip file , then you will need to copy the following files into the source ’s root folder :
Copy any pak files from Quake ’s “ baseq2 ” directory ( if you just have the Quake II demo , there will only be pak0. pak ) .
Copy config.cfg from Quake ’s “ baseq2 ” directory .
Copy the entire “ players ” folder from Quake ’s base q2 directory .
Given the default folder names of the zip file , your source tree should now contain the following :
“ < drive >: \quake2_VC9_Port\pak0.pak ” “ < drive > : \quake2_VC9_Port\config.cfg ” “ < drive >: \quake2_VC9_Port\players \* ”
These files and directories are needed for the post build events to work ( see “ Build Changes ” for more details ) .
Game Directory Structure
There are two important directories in the Quake II installation .
The first is the root folder and the second is “ < root > \baseq2 \ . ”
This applies to both the commercial game and the source code tree .
However , in the source tree , the root folder is not the source ’s root but rather the directory in which “ quake2.vcproj ” uses as its output .
For example , I have the Debug Managed build of “ quake2.vcproj ” output to “ < drive > : \quake2_VC9_Port \Debug Managed\ . ”
It is that path which is the root and thus contains : “ < drive > : \quake2_VC9_Port\Debug Managed\baseq2\ . ”
The root folder contains all the dll ’s except for gamex 86.dll .
Gamex86.dll goes under “ < root > \baseq2\ . ”
Other files under baseq2 are the following :
Configuration settings – config.cfg
Game data file (s ) – pak0.pak
Saved games ( under “ .\baseq2\save\ ” )
Network player models ( under “ .\baseq2\players \ ” )
Since I obviously cannot distribute the non-demo commercial version of the Quake II “ .pak ” file (s ) , if you bought the full version of the game and want to run those levels under this source code , you ’d copy all the “ . pak ” files from the retail game ’s baseq2 directory into the source ’s base q2 directory .
In fact , it is safe to copy all of the retail baseq2 files and overwrite any in the source tree ’s baseq2 .
There is one caveat though – your saved games will not load under this source because the source ’s version string will not match what ’s in the save - file (s ) .
But hey , you have the source code now – just find the line which does the version check and remove it ! 😉
Build Changes
The following is a list of what build options I had to add , modify , or remove from Vertigo ’s source :
Added the following post build events for “ quake2.vcproj ” : copy “ .\config.cfg ” “ .\$ ( ConfigurationName ) \baseq2\config.cfg ”
copy “ .\pak0.pak ” “ .\$ ( ConfigurationName ) \baseq2\pak0.pak ”
xcopy /E /Y /C “ .\players \*.* ” “.\$ ( ConfigurationName ) \baseq2\players \*. * ”
Working directory for “ quake2.vcproj ” needed to be : “ .\$ ( ConfigurationName ) ” Output file for “ game.vcproj ” needed to be : “..\$ ( ConfigurationName ) \baseq2\gamex86.dll ”
The “ Additional Include Directories ” needed to be “ $( DXSDK_DIR ) \ Include ” for these projects : “ ref_gl.vcproj ”
“ ref_soft.vcproj ”
“ quake2.vcproj ” The “ Wp64 ” option needed to be removed from all projects .
The “ GS ” option needed to be removed from “ quake2.vcproj . ”
The post build events are used to copy the configuration file , data file (s ) , and player models into the game ’s data directory .
The configuration file holds settings such as key bindings , video resolution , sound settings , and more .
The pak file contains the world map , texture bitmaps , object models ( for enemies , items , etc. ) , and any other data the game needs .
All the files inside “ .\players \ ” ( which are models and pcx images ) are not necessary for Quake II to run in single player mode .
In fact , in multiplayer mode I was still able to start a game server and walk around in the world .
However , I was unable to customize my player ’s skin ( an error message would appear at the bottom of the screen saying , “ no valid player models found ” ) .
When debugging , the working directory for “ quake2.vcproj ” needs to be the exe ’s output directory such that the paths are consistent with what Quake II expects .
The output for “ game.vcproj ” needs to be changed in order for “ gamex86.dll ” to be copied to the baseq2 directory ( see previous sections for details on how this dll works ) .
The Additional Include Directories need to include the DirectX SDK so that the compiler can see the DirectInput and DirectSound header files .
The “ Wp64 ” option is removed from all projects in order to get rid of a certain compiler warning complaining that this option is going obsolete in the next version of Visual Studio ( v10.0 ) .
Removing the “ GS ” option was only necessary to get rid of a warning in one of the build configurations , but since I like to be consistent I removed it from all the projects .
You may have noticed something about the first group of post build events – if “ config.cfg ” is moved to “ baseq2 ” then does n’t this mean my Quake II game settings are reset after every compile ?
You ’re right ; you actually only need this file copied the very first time the solution is compiled .
After that it only needs to be copied if the one in “ baseq2 ” has been removed .
Compiling the Source
There ’s not much to say about compiling the source .
Open the solution file ( “ quake2_VC9_Port.sln ” ) under the root directory of the zipped attachment .
Once Visual Studio has loaded the project , make sure one of the debug build configurations are selected ( I use Debug Managed ) .
It compiles like any other Visual Studio project – press “ F7 ” ( or whatever key your Build command is bound ) to start compiling .
The first time around though , I recommend doing a “ Rebuild All ” just in case .
Hopefully all six projects build successfully with zero errors and zero warnings ( if not , please go to my Contact page and send me an email ) .
If you extracted the zip file using its default directory settings , you can go to “ < drive > : \quake2_VC9 _Port\ < build name >\ ” and run Quake2.exe .
Of course , you could have originally hit “ F5 ” ( or whatever key your Debug command is bound ) instead of “ F7 ” in order to run the source in debug mode through the IDE .
Known Issues
One issue that I was unable to resolve was with the radar plugin – for some strange reason it always opens a new window for the control no matter whether you ’re in fullscreen mode or window mode .
In addition , it always starts up behind the main rendering window .
While this is not that big of a deal in windowed mode , it is really annoying when playing in fullscreen .
It ’s possible that there is no problem with the code , but rather Vista is at fault .
I do n’t know , I never tried testing it in XP .
Note : you activate the radar by typing “ radar ” in the console ( the console activates by hitting the “ ~ ” key ; press again to make it disappear ) .
The radar is only enabled in Debug Managed and Release Managed builds ; native mode does not have the radar .
Feel free to debug this yourself and , if you fix it , please send me an email ( via my Contact page ) .
Things Not Tested
I have n’t fully tested network play .
Starting a server and walking around works fine , but I do n’t know whether joining an existing server would work .
Also note : this port focused exclusively on the Win32 platform .
There were other projects in the Quake II source , such as a Linux version , that I did not touch .
I have no idea whether these projects still work .
My Comment Log
If you take a look at the source code you ’ll probably notice a lot of lines have comments that begin with this string : “*** GREGS_VC9 _PORT_MOD ***. ”
A line beginning with this comment indicates that it was changed from Vertigo ’s source in order to make the port work .
Every one of these lines also contains a description of what was changed and , if applicable , why it was needed .
You may be wondering why I did this .
Well , the main reason was curiosity – I wanted to know how many lines I ’d eventually end up changing .
This special comment allows me to easily determine that simply by doing a solution - scope search .
The second and equally important reason is simple , it serves as a really good reference for future projects that I port .
A Note About The “ Safe ” CRT Functions
By default , if you call regular C language CRT functions in a managed C++ project , the compiler will continually spit out warning # 4996 .
This is a really annoying warning that basically suggests you use the corresponding “ safe ” version of whatever CRT function you ’re calling .
The safe version typically has the same name as the regular CRT call except it is suffixed with “ _s ” ( i.e. “ sprintf ” would become “ sprintf_s ” , fopen would become “ fopen_s ” , and so on ) .
When you call the safe functions you ’re linking against a special version of the CRT which tries to eliminate buffer overruns .
Unfortunately , I found out that these functions have bugs !
Sometimes there would be runtime errors saying “ string not NULL terminated ” or “ string too short for operation ” – neither of which were true .
I ’d originally planned to port all the CRT functions to their safe counterparts instead of disabling the warning , but after discovering these qwerks and banging my head against the wall not finding a solution , I gave up on that idea .
Some of the safe calls were left in ( the one ’s that worked before I discovered this problem ) but only a very small number .
Therefore , you will see the “ # pragma warning ( disable:4996 ) ” preprocessor directive on top of a lot of files .
Performance : Native C++ Versus .NET
On modern computer hardware and the commodity - priced video cards out there , it ’s difficult to come up with speed comparisons between .NET versus native C++ when running Quake II .
What I mean is this – pretty much all computers with a decent 3D video card run the game at its maximum frame rate anyway regardless of whether native or managed mode is used .
However , I did see a difference in performance when I turned on just software rendering and used a high resolution .
The speed differences were n’t that much – the .NET version was about 9 % slower ( 94 FPS in native versus 85 FPS in managed ) .
However , non graphics related things , such as initializing the game and loading maps between levels were noticeably slower in the .NET version .
I would wait about seven to ten seconds for the game to load in a managed build versus about two seconds in native mode .
The same amount of slowdown was noticeable when switching between levels .
A Screenshot
For those who want to see a screenshot :
Conclusion
All in all , this port turned out to be much more work than I expected .
My original thinking was that I ’d fix a few dozen or so compile errors and be done in a few hours .
Not so !
I probably fixed about 2,000 to 2,500 errors ( do n’t know because the maximum that ’s displayed is 100 to 200 before the compiler ca n’t recover ) and had to weed out over 4,000 warnings .
Next I ’m going to port Quake III Arena , but not right away ; I must rest first … .

She has recovered " remarkably well " and should continue to improve , said Dr. Kenneth Mack , a Mayo Clinic neurologist .
Rabies , a viral disease spread by the bite of an infected animal , attacks the nervous system and is usually fatal once symptoms develop .
The other five people known to have survived it after symptoms appeared either were vaccinated in advance or received vaccine soon afterward .
All but one ended up with persistent movement difficulties .
But Giese was not hospitalized until a month after she was bitten by a bat that had flown into her church .
She had picked it up to take it outside .
In a desperate attempt to save her , Wisconsin doctors intentionally put her in a coma and gave her a slew of antiviral drugs and other medications to prevent a cascade of events that causes nerve cells to die .
She spent two months in intensive care before returning home on New Year 's Day , 2005 .
Then the hard part started .
A tutor helped Giese finish her sophomore year of high school so she could rejoin her classmates in the fall .
Physical therapy helped her overcome speech problems , weakness in her left hand and foot , and abnormal movements in her arms and hands .
She can drive a car , scored above - average on a national college achievement test , and has normal cognition , doctors report in the journal .
She still has slight difficulty enunciating words , awkwardness using her left hand and trouble lifting her left foot so that she looks a bit uncoordinated when she runs .
The biggest thing she misses is sports .
She used to be a high school athlete , playing basketball , softball and volleyball .
When she returned to school her junior year , she worked as a manager for the volleyball team .
But unhappy with not being able to play , she quit in her senior year .
" I 'm pretty at peace .
It still bothers me and will probably always bother me .
But I 'm starting to kind of let it go and go on with life , " she said .
Giese said she tends to be more emotional now and her body overheats easier , but she recovered so well that she finished in the top half of her high school class and received college scholarships .
Preparing for her first day of class on Tuesday , she was all energy and enthusiasm , calling friends on her cellphone , reassuring her mom that she would be OK , and stopping to pick up a free energy drink handed out on campus .
More than any fears over lingering side effects , Giese said she has the most anxiety over having to endure a three - hour biology lecture .
One of the few reminders of what she went through is a blue bracelet she wears on her right arm .
A friend made the bracelet for her as a fund raiser .
On one side is her name and on the other is written " Miracles Happen . "
She plans to snowboard this winter , and rarely hears from the doctors who came up with her storied treatment .
Since Giese 's case , it has been tried on 10 people worldwide with no success , although most of the others did not receive all of the drugs Giese did or had irreversible complications or other problems , said Dr. Rodney Willoughby Jr. of the Medical College of Wisconsin .
He is the infectious disease specialist who devised the approach .
As more patients are given the so - called " Wisconsin protocol , " Willoughby is hopeful it will work on others .
Giese said she feels sad that no one else treated with it has survived .
Her mother said the family 's faith helped them through their ordeal .
" We 're blessed that she 's a special person , " Ann Giese said .
" God had a plan for her . "
Giese 's immediate plan is to study zoology , of all things , and eventually work as an animal conservationist .
She has 12 pets — a dog , a rabbit and 10 pheasants .
Instead of developing a fear of animals since being bitten by the bat , the incident appears to have only solidified her passion and love for them .
She 's so unafraid of animals , after giving a speech about her case at the Milwaukee zoo on Sunday she was allowed to hold and pet the non-rabid bats on display .
" It 's the first time I 've actually touched a bat where it was n't hanging onto my finger by its fang , " Giese said .
" She 's crazy , " laughed her mother .
" I have always loved animals , " Giese said .
" Sometimes I love them more than people , which is kind of a bad thing to say , but I do . "
And if she ever encounters a bat again in the wild ?
" I 'd pick it up .
I would so pick it up . "

Giese is a medical marvel who has been studied and chronicled for nearly three years as a one - of - a - kind case :
She survived rabies without vaccination .

N. C. Jefferson - Jackson Speech : This is My Patriotism , These are My Values
At the North Carolina State Democratic Party ’s Jefferson - Jackson dinner in Raleigh ( NC ) on Friday evening , the immense room exploded with energy when Barack Obama walked onto the stage after Hillary Clinton , who had received what observers have described as a far more tepid reception .
“ This election is not about rich versus poor , or young versus old or black versus white , ” he said , as supporters waved thousands of blue Obama campaign signs .
“ It ’s about the past versus the future , and in four days , you can choose to turn the page . ”
“ My story is not possible except in the United States of America .
I would not be here were it not for the fact that somebody , somewhere stood up for me .
And because one person stood up , a few more stood up , and then a thousand stood up , and then a million stood up .
That ’s why Hillary Clinton can run for President .
That ’s why I can run for President … because somebody stood up .
And the question now is : Will the Democratic Party stand up for the next generation ?
That ’s my Patriotism .
Those are my Values .
Those are your Values .
That ’s what we ’re fighting for in this election . ”
N. C. Jefferson Jackson Dinner , May 2 , 2008
Barack Obama : This is My Patriotism , These are My Values
Time Magazine ’s Mark Halperin reported late Saturday that Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks is endorsing Barack Obama for President .
The acclaimed actor and activist , who previously had given money to both the Obama and Clinton presidential campaigns , posted a compelling video on his MySpace page explaining his choice .
The video is presented for you below :

Monday , 05 May , 2008 Science
The mission of Cassini spacecraft continues as it monitors the powerful electrical storm on Saturn , where the lightning is 10,000 times more powerful than the lightning on Earth .
The storm that generates the powerful lightning has been observed by the NASA scientists that work on Cassini - Huygens mission .
It is worth mentioning that the observed lightning is the longest persistently observed electrical storm examined by the spacecraft .
The electrical storms on Saturn look just like the ones observed on Earth .
The only difference is their size .
The diameters of the Saturn 's electrical storms reach several thousands of kilometers .
In addition the radio signals that the lightning generates are more powerful than the ones on Earth by thousands of times .
The storm on Saturn generates flashes of lighting that produce radio waves .
These waves are called Saturn electrostatic discharges .
For the first time these electrostatic discharges have been identified on November 27 , 2007 .
A week later the imaging cameras of the spacecraft for the first time were able to identify both the position and appearance of the electrical storm .
" The electrostatic radio outbursts have waxed and waned in intensity for five months now .
We saw similar storms in 2004 and 2006 that each lasted for nearly a month , but this storm is longer - lived by far .
And it appeared after nearly two years during which we did not detect any electrical storm activity from Saturn , " said Georg Fischer , who works as an associate with the radio and plasma wave science team at the University of Iowa , Iowa City .
The newly observed storm on Saturn is found in the southern hemisphere of the planet , which is a region dubbed by the mission scientists " Storm Alley . "
This is the place where the previous electrical discharges were spotted by Cassini .
" In order to see the storm , the imaging cameras have to be looking at the right place at the right time , and whenever our cameras see the storm , the radio outbursts are there , " mentioned Ulyana Dyudina , who works as an associate of the Cassini imaging team at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , California .
The radio plasma wave tool , used by the spacecraft , identifies the storm each time it rotates into the view .
Scientists found that this happens every 10 hours and 40 minutes , which is Saturn 's approximate length of the day .
It 's interesting to note that the storm emits a radio pulse every few seconds .
The radio pulse lasts for approximately tenth of a second .
The Cassini spacecraft is able to identify these radio waves even when the Saturn 's electrical storm is over the horizon .
Scientists hope that the storm on Saturn will give them information on the processes powering the planet 's lightning activity .
During the change of the seasons , scientists will continuously monitor the area of the Storm Alley .
It is worth mentioning that the Cassini - Huygens mission represents a team project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
JPL ( Jet Propulsion Laboratory ) , which is a division of Caltech , administers the Cassini mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington , D.C.
As center for robotic exploration of the solar system , JLC was the one to develop and assemble Cassini orbiter as well as the spacecraft 's two onboard cameras .
The images of the storm can be viewed at : http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov and http://www.nasa.gov/cassini and http://ciclops.org .

Too much of a good thing could be harmful to the environment .
For years , scientists have known about silver ’s ability to kill harmful bacteria and , recently , have used this knowledge to create consumer products containing silver nanoparticles .
Now , a University of Missouri researcher has found that silver nanoparticles also may destroy benign bacteria that are used to remove ammonia from wastewater treatment systems .
The study was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation .
Several products containing silver nanoparticles already are on the market , including socks containing silver nanoparticles designed to inhibit odor - causing bacteria and high - tech , energy - efficient washing machines that disinfect clothes by generating the tiny particles .
The positive effects of that technology may be overshadowed by the potential negative environmental impact .
“ Because of the increasing use of silver nanoparticles in consumer products , the risk that this material will be released into sewage lines , wastewater treatment facilities , and , eventually , to rivers , streams and lakes is of concern , ” said Zhiqiang Hu , assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering in MU ’s College of Engineering .
“ We found that silver nanoparticles are extremely toxic .
The nanoparticles destroy the benign species of bacteria that are used for wastewater treatment .
It basically halts the reproduction activity of the good bacteria . ”
Hu said silver nanoparticles generate more unique chemicals , known as highly reactive oxygen species , than do larger forms of silver .
These oxygen species chemicals likely inhibit bacterial growth .
For example , the use of wastewater treatment “ sludge ” as land - application fertilizer is a common practice , according to Hu .
If high levels of silver nanoparticles are present in the sludge , soil used to grow food crops may be harmed .
Hu is launching a second study to determine the levels at which the presence of silver nanoparticles become toxic .
He will determine how silver nanoparticles affect wastewater treatment processes by introducing nanomaterial into wastewater and sludge .
He will then measure microbial growth to determine the nanosilver levels that harm wastewater treatment and sludge digestion .
The Water Environment Research Foundation recently awarded Hu $ 150,000 to determine when silver nanoparticles start to impair wastewater treatment .
Hu said nanoparticles in wastewater can be better managed and regulated .
Work on the follow - up research should be completed by 2010 .
Filed Under Life Understanding Today's Pirates Posted May 5 , 2008 Send Do modern Pirates wear makeup and dress like Keith Richards ?
Modern pirates do not wear makeup .
They are often former fishermen who have taken up arms to exact revenge on foreign fishing fleets who have poached their livelihood .
Their attire is much more like that of Johnny Depp  not in Pirates of the Caribbean , but the Johnny Depp of 21 Jump Street .
What weapons do modern pirates use ?
Pirates traditionally relied on muskets , swords , and cannons .
Modern pirates use RPG ( rocket - propelled grenade launchers ) , which are exactly like cannons , if you imagine a cannon that you could hold on your shoulder , and that could create explosive shrapnel .
Cannons are much better remembrances of pirate battles than RPG's , since they are too heavy to steal .
Do modern pirates have parrots on their shoulders ?
Modern pirates have no room on their shoulders , since that is where they wear their grenade launchers .
Modern pirates depend on their parrots to operate their onboard GPS units , since parrots have an exceptional understanding of geography and technology .
While off - duty , the parrots keep to themselves in tiny , luxurious bunks .
Do modern pirates have funny pirate names like Captain Hook ?
Pirates today mostly are of Somali origin , so their names are often of African origin , such as Abdi Haji Gobdon and Aden Hashi Ayro .
These names are translated into English as Little Billy Barnacle and Captain Bluebeard .
Will a movie be made about Somali pirates ?
The typical process for Disney movies is as follows : Disney creates an amusement park ride Amusement park ride is wildly popular Amusement park ride sells toys , tee - shirts and spawns a breakfast cereal Screenwriters write an inspirational rough draft about the heartbreaking story behind the breakfast cereal based on the amusement park ride .
Pile of money delivered to Johnny Depp assures a smash hit movie .
Disney 's exceptional roller coaster , Pirates of the Somali Coast , was slated to be released at Disney Addis Ababa this year .
The ability to create a script will be assessed once the ride 's popularity is established .
What should you do if you encounter modern pirates ?
Offer them a part in the new Disney movie on modern day pirates .

Hillary Clinton has seen her opponent maintain his lead Hillary Clinton will withdraw from the race to become the Democratic candidate for the US presidency , and back her rival Barack Obama , her campaign says .
On Tuesday , Mr Obama gained enough delegates to win the nomination , after the final votes of the primary season .
Mrs Clinton has not publicly admitted losing , but at an event on Saturday she will do so " and express her support for Senator Obama " , aides say .
Mr Obama has already announced a team to help select his running mate .
Reports that Mrs Clinton was ready to concede came after she made a conference call to senior Democrats in Congress .
At a Democratic Party event in Washington , Mrs Clinton will also " express her support ... for party unity " , her communications director Howard Wolfson said .
Earlier , it had been announced that the event would be held on Friday , but Mr Wolfson said it had been delayed a day " to accommodate more of Senator Clinton 's supporters who want to attend " .
The BBC's Jane O'Brien in Washington says that as Mr Obama was claiming victory , Hillary Clinton stunned even her own supporters with a speech that offered no indication that she was giving up .
There is speculation that the delay in conceding was an attempt to position herself as a possible vice - president , our correspondent adds .
Clinton ' open ' DELEGATE COUNT
Winner : Needs 2,118 delegates Super- delegates : Obama , 389 ; Clinton , 282 Total delegates : Obama , 2,154 ; Clinton , 1,919 South Dakota and Montana : Obama , 25 ; Clinton , 13 Source : AP at 0230 GMT on 5 June
Obama has a mountain to climb Clinton the ' insider ' swept aside Obama v McCain : World views Mr Obama 's three - member panel to look for a presidential running mate comprises Caroline Kennedy , daughter of President John Kennedy , former deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Jim Johnson .
Mr Johnson performed the same selection task for John Kerry in 2004 .
" Senator Obama is pleased to have three talented and dedicated individuals managing this rigorous process , " said Bill Burton , a spokesman for the Illinois senator .
" He will work closely with them in the coming weeks but ultimately this will be his decision and his alone . "
Earlier , Mr Obama had paid tribute to Mrs Clinton and hinted that she would play a role in any future Obama administration .
The Bill issue is not just the Library and the opacity of the funding ( the donors list is secret ) and the potential for special prosecutors to be beating the doors down looking for him - it is the simple fact of his presence
North America editor , Justin Webb
Webb 's America :
It 's the Bill , stupid Mrs Clinton has said she would be " open " to the idea of being Mr Obama 's vice - presidential running - mate .
Referring to a brief conversation he had held with his defeated rival , the Illinois senator said : " I 'm very confident of how we 're going to be able to bring the party together . "
The Republican party 's candidate , John McCain has challenged Mr Obama to take part in debates in 10 town hall meetings before August 's Democratic convention , and the Obama team is said to be considering the invitation .
The final primaries of the season were held on Tuesday - with Mr Obama winning Montana and Mrs Clinton winning South Dakota .
A candidate needs 2,118 delegates to secure the nomination and Mr Obama now has the support of 2,154 delegates .
Mrs Clinton has 1,919 .

What are these ?
On This Week this morning George Stephanopoulos asked Karl Rove if he denied contacting the Justice Department prosecuting former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman .
He responded with a textbook non-denial denial .
Here ’s the video …
( ed.note : Special thanks to TPM Reader GB for the catch . )
There ’s never been any doubt in my mind that Siegelman was the victim of selective prosecution .
Even the government ’s theory of the main case against him amounted to something that is standard in contemporary American politics and actually much less worse than lots of other stuff that no one thinks twice about .
Cracking the nut of White House involvement has always been more difficult ; but the evidence for it is substantial .
If Siegelman ’s and Alabama GOP lawyer Jill Simpson ’s stories are true , that would make this case the centerpiece example of the corruption of the DOJ revealed by the US Attorney firing scandal .
In fact , it would make most of what we know now seem minor by comparison .
The world 's biggest airport is now finished and ready for the 2008 Beijing Olympics .
The $ 3.5 billion gigantic dragon terminal , which is the centerpiece of the 501 - square - mile complex capable of allowing 50 million passengers per year , looks even more impressive in the amazing , almost unreal photos .

The new Terminal 3 has been designed to be energy efficient , allowing for natural lightning — whenever it is possible and the city smog allows , I guess — and packing all the facilities into a single structure , rather than fragmenting them in separate buildings , the building is 17 % bigger than London Heathrow T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 and the new T5 put together .

With a total of five floors — two underground — the dragon terminal is divided into three parts : the 3C is the domestic hall , and the main passenger terminal , 3D is the Olympics hall , used for charter flights during the celebrations , and 3E is the international hall .

Biden : Bush 's comments were ' bullshit '
Sen. Joe Biden ( D - Del. ) , piling on to Democratic complaints about President Bush ’s speech in Israel today :
“ This is bullshit , this is malarkey .
This is outrageous , for the president of the United States to go to a foreign country , to sit in the Knesset ... and make this kind of ridiculous statement . ”
Speaking before the Knesset , Bush said that “ some people ” believe the United States “ should negotiate with terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along . "
" We have heard this foolish delusion before , " Bush said .
" As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : ' Lord , if I could only have talked to Hitler , all this might have been avoided . '
We have an obligation to call this what it is — the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . "
Democrats have interpreted the comments as an attack on Sen. Barack Obama , and Biden , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said that the president was out of line .
See Also
“ He is the guy who has weakened us , ” he said .
“ He has increased the number of terrorists in the world .
It is his policies that have produced this vulnerability that the U.S. has .
It ’s his [ own ] intelligence community [ that ] has pointed this out , not me . ”
Biden noted that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have both suggested that the United States ought to find a way to talk more with its enemies .
" If he thinks this is appeasement , is he going to come back and fire his own cabinet ? ” Biden asked .
“ Is he going to fire Condi Rice ? ”
In a separate statement , Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) said that Bush " is still playing the disgusting and dangerous political game Karl Rove perfected , which is insulting to every American and disrespectful to our ally Israel .
George Bush should be making Israel secure , not slandering Barack Obama from the Knesset . "
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) also weighed in .
“ Not surprisingly , the engineer of the worst foreign policy in our nation ’s history has fired yet another reckless and reprehensible round , " said Reid .
" For the President to make this statement before the government of our closest ally as it celebrates a remarkable milestone demeans this historic moment with partisan politics . "
The White House insists that Bush was n’t referring specifically to Obama , an argument that Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill . ) called " baloney . "
" There is no escaping what the president is doing , " said Durbin , who supports Obama .
" It is an attack on Sen . Obama ’s position that we should not be avoiding even those we disagree with when it comes to negotiations and diplomacy . "
Durbin called Bush 's remarks " unfair and really unfortunate . "
UPDATE : In a conference call with reporters later in the afternoon , Biden said his initial word choice was " not very eloquent " and said he should have just stuck with the word " malarkey . "
Biden said he " reacted viscerally " when asked about Bush 's speech after stepping off an elevator .
However , Biden again did not mince words when discussing Bush 's remarks , accusing the president of engaging in " long - distance swiftboating " with his speech in Israel .
Biden also cited numerous examples of the Bush Administration reaching out to unfriendly regimes in Libya , North Korea and Iran , arguing that Bush 's insinuation that the Democrats were soft on terrorism was " truly delusional ... and truly disgraceful . "

I love this place !
I LOVE BESSI !
Seriously , she is the best !
I ’ve been coming here for a while and no matter what I want – balayage , silver hair , updo , whatever – she does an AMAZING job !
She clearly loves hair and knows how to handle it with care .
The salon itself is amazing – they are super polite and always make sure you ’re comfy with a drink of choice and treats .
I really ca n’t recommend this place enough .
It ’s always a lovely experience
TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - When 17 - year old Yuna Hua bought a new notebook computer for school , she chose a smaller , lighter and cheaper one to replace her bulky and expensive laptop .
A model poses with the new version of Asustek 's low cost notebook " Eee PC " during the 2008 Computex exhibition in Taipei June 4 , 2008 .

Like many consumers , Hua reckons she does n’t need a $ 1,500 laptop for her everyday needs .
“ It ’s a lot less expensive and much easier to use and carry , ” said Hua , a high school senior , who uses her notebook mostly for homework , surfing the Internet and games .
For around a quarter of the price of a regular notebook , PC makers such as Acer Inc 2353 .
TW and Asustek Computer 2357 .
TW displayed simpler laptops -- called Netbooks , or low - cost PCs -- at this year 's Computex trade fair in Taiwan , hoping to open up a new market and bolster the fortunes of PC makers as an economic slowdown curbs spending .
Market leaders Hewlett - Packard HPQ.N and Dell DELL.O are expected to follow suit with similar ultra-portable models in the second half of the year , analysts said .
“ You can easily double the market size of notebooks with this device , ” Acer President Gianfranco Lanci told Reuters .
Some analysts say these low - cost computers , which range from 7 - 10 inches and weigh about 1 kilo , could end up replacing regular notebook PCs , but they agree these new PCs have also opened up the computer market to more first - time buyers .
“ There is now a huge population out there in emerging markets that can afford these laptops .
They may be cannibalizing some of the current notebook market , but it ’s also expanding the market very , very quickly , ” said JP Morgan analyst Alvin Kwock .
Kwock added that global shipments for low - cost models should hit 10 - 15 million units this year , and selling prices would range between $ 300 - $ 500 .

But other analysts were not as optimistic .
“ We think it ’s just unrealistic .
The notion of targeting these products to emerging markets is false , since most people there wo n’t be able to afford it , and the people who can would rather buy a traditional laptop , ” said Bob O’Donnell , vice president , clients and displays , at data company IDC Corp .
Acer 's Lanci told Reuters he expected shipments of low - cost PCs to reach 40 - 45 million units in 2009 , while chip giant Intel INTC .
O said it would not be surprised to see sales top 50 million units in 2011 .
Asustek Computer aims to sell 5 million of its Eee PCs this year , and 10 million in 2009 , while Acer predicts sales of 15 - 20 million of its Aspire One laptops next year .
IDC said growth is still strong in traditional notebooks , and only expects 3.5 million low - cost PCs will be shipped this year , rising to 9 million in 2012 .
“ We ’re being extremely conservative on this market .
I can see these products being attractive to students and women who want to be able to fit a PC in their handbag , but so far there ’s just been an industry over - hype , ” said IDC ’s O’Donnell .
SECONDARY PCS
Buyers at Computex expressed interest in the new PCs as they crowded around the displays of small pink , white and blue Netbooks .
“ I ’d definitely buy it as a second PC , since it ’s easy to carry around and the screens are much bigger than a Blackberry or PDA -- its just easier to see , ” said Florence Koh from Singapore .
Most of the new low - cost laptops , running on Linux or Windows XP operating systems , will be in stores this summer , and some analysts say they could resurrect a flagging PC market .
“ They have set these products at a fair price range , and I can see many people finding it attractive , ” said Jonathan Dee , General Manager of NetEssentials from Philippines , as he strolled down the aisles of the computer show .
According to IDC , notebook shipments , including low - cost PCs , are expected to hit 145 million units this year , up 34.5 percent from last year as consumer demand remained strong in Europe and Latin America despite a slowdown in the U.S. market .
Growth for 2009 is seen slowing to 24.9 percent , hitting 181.5 million units , said IDC .
Amazon Book Map
Aaron Swartz , who runs theinfo.org , contacted me back in January '08 with an interesting data set .
He had built a list of 735,323 books by crawling Amazon .
Of course a gigantic list is pretty boring , but Aaron had also captured similarity data between books .
In particular , he had amassed a whopping 10,316,775 connections ( edges ) between books Amazon believed were related .
This allowed me to throw the data into my old wikiviz engine to spatially layout a huge mosaic of books ( I let it run for a 140 hours ) .
Items that were noted as being similar had attractive forces , bringing them together , often into large groups .
Unsurprisingly , when we color coded by Amazon book category , there was an obvious coalescence .
The way various high - level categorizations mix and meet also seems fairly logical .
I produced a few versions of what I am dubbing the Amazon Book Map .
The first visualization is a huge mosaic of book covers , tinted by their respective category colors .
I can't produce this in one go at full resolution because the memory requires are enormous .
The second version uses color - coded dots .
The layout ( clustering - wise ) is decent , but not great .
I do n't think my algorithm works all that well for highly - unstructured graphs .
For those that are curious , I 've included a small graph of how the layout converged .

FCC May Re-Auction D- Block Later
This Year Discussion about the rules is on the May agenda FCC Chief Kevin Martin has announced that the FCC ’s May agenda includes discussion of what to do with the D - Block spectrum which failed to sell at the 700 MHz auction earlier this year .
The discussion will review all of the rules associated with auctioning the public safety spectrum including whether it is necessary to lower the reserve price in order for a sale to take place .
It will also take a close look at allegations regarding pre-auction meetings that Cyren Call ( which is the Public Safety Spectrum Trust ’s advisor ) reportedly engaged in , a matter that is also being reviewed by Congress .
This discussion is the first step towards re-auctioning the D - block spectrum , a move which may happen later this year .

if a public safety use for this spectrum is critical , why in the hell does n't the government just GIVE the spectrum to the public safety community ?
Sometimes our government is so stupid it boggles the mind .
that 's what I do n't get .
The FCC made twice as much off the auction as they expected , $ 20B ; the reserve price of the D block was only $ 1.3B or something like that .if a public safety use for this spectrum is critical , why in the hell does n't the government just GIVE the spectrum to the public safety community ?

A much more important question : when will be Martin and his predecessor investigated and tried ?
your comment ..
A new file - sharing service called Rhever is using an interesting tactic to get customers .
It appears to be trying to scare users away from BitTorrent and LimeWire , and onto its service .
Their promo videos are entertaining , I admit that , but are you scared enough dump torrents and try it ?
I do n't think I am .
I mean , come on .
Who needs BitTorrent when the Rhever network has over 20 Million files , 300 TB’s of downloadable content , with another 2 TB ’s of information added daily ?
Also , Rhever has some great ( Mac vs. PC inspired ) promo videos ( we ’ll see them below ) poking fun at LimeWire , KaZaA and ( gasp ) even Bram Cohen !
And it gets even better .
No more slow downloads , viruses , or adware / spyware required to find the files you are looking for .
The Rhever application has a built in easy - to - use search engine to find what you are looking for and does not require you to troll websites looking for . torrent files .
Unfortunately for Rhever , there is no Internet ‘ buzz ’ around their brand , people just are n’t taking about it , which is a bit strange for such a seemingly great product .
If you do a search , 95 % of the stuff you ’ll find are press releases – and they only appear to be designed to worry people onto their new service .
They play an awful lot on the closure of TorrentSpy in their attempts to generate fear , uncertainty , doubt – and new business for them .
The ‘ launch ‘ press release lays off most of the scare tactics but is still littered with strange and misleading statements .
Rhever spam is posted on dozens of forums , like this one and there are also some ‘ interesting ’ articles and blog posts around ( tagged ‘ Rhever ’ ) proclaiming the end of BitTorrent sites .
Even Digg does n’t escape Rhever spam submitted by the company itself .
Also ,
Rhever use the most contentious music industry statistics to ‘ prove ’ that other P2P networks are dangerous , and refer to the IFPI as “ respected industry analysts . ”
If the fear does n’t work , maybe the comedy angle will get them some subscribers ?
Rhever has produced a series of ( admittedly quite funny ) promotional animations showing the benefits of using Rhever over existing file sharing networks .
Take a look at the ‘ Rhever vs LimeWire ’ video below which says that Rhever has done the impossible – and completely eradicated viruses from its network .
In its own words :
Each of its [ Rhever ’s ] 60,000 servers are run by an administrative team that monitors the servers for any rogue files – viruses , fake uploads and other negative features that are removed instantly
LimeWire vs Rhever
BitTorrent vs Rhever .
In this video you will find the secret of the Rhever network ..
So it seems Rhever is selling access to good old Usenet and advises its subscribers to use NZB files to get their material , recommending its own ( currently non-operational ) site to get them – NZB .
net .
Considering that Rhever ’s strategy is to worry people about the legality of their chosen method of sharing files so much that they sign up , they ’re quite cavalier about their own legal position .
NZB sites in the US do n’t have a great lifespan and offering a full package with Usenet seems very brave .
Finally , here is the KaZaA vs Rhever video :
Rhever is keen to play on the adware bundled with KaZaA , and that proves interesting when armed with WHOIS .
Rhever.com and NZB .net are both owned by a company called JMH Media .
JMH Media are the current owners of the MySpaceBar.com domain , which was previously connected to the Scam .
MySpaceBar malware .
Unsurprisingly , McAfee does n’t like it at all .
I ’m not exactly inspired with confidence to try this Rhever but hey , nothing ventured , nothing gained !
Time to sign up .
Unfortunately , no matter what I put in I get errors , a point not lost on the solitary poster on the Rhever forums :
No mention of prices anywhere .
No contract information .
No proper terms or conditions .
No company information .
No privacy statement .
No contact information .
No postal address .
There is however , a link to the Rhever client , named ‘ setup.exe ’…..
Maybe Rhever ’s fear - marketing has got to me ?
Far from being scared into leaving BitTorrent , all this uncertainty means that i’m too scared to even install ‘ setup.exe ’ due to what might be inside it – an instinct I acquired in my days as a LimeWire / KaZaA user .
I think something just backfired .
Well then , another couple of hours wasted looking for The Holy Grail , only to realize that much like the French soldiers in the movie of the same name , I already have one .
What we really need now is a talented animator to make a proper ‘ BitTorrent versus Rhever ’ video … .
The Democratic National Committee is bracing itself for protests outside its Rules and Bylaws Committee meeting on Saturday in Washington , where the fates of the Florida and Michigan primaries could finally be decided .
Supporters of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton are organizing to march and then gather on the street outside the panel ’s meeting , scheduled for Saturday morning at a hotel in Northwest Washington .
“ They ’re coming up on buses , they ’re taking the train , they ’re Metro-ing , they ’re coming up with friends , ” said Allida Black , a professor at George Washington University and an event organizer .
“ We ’re trying to flood it . ”
The Rules and Bylaws Committee is expected to address the primary votes from Michigan and Florida , which moved up their primaries in violation of national party rules .
The Clinton campaign has pinned its hopes on the Michigan and Florida votes being added to the totals , giving her a much - needed boost in the final days of the primary campaign .
Besides their goal of pressuring the committee into counting the votes from Florida and Michigan , Mrs. Clinton ’s supporters are hoping that an en masse gathering will demonstrate widespread support for her candidacy — and perhaps persuade a superdelegate or two .
Ms. Black is behind the newly formed political action committee , WomenCount , which has been running full - page ads in newspapers for the last two weeks in support of Mrs. Clinton .
She said the rally will be staged on a grassy area outside the Marriot – Wardman Park Hotel in the Woodley Park neighborhood in Washington , and that the group has been granted permission to assemble several blocks to the north near the National Zoo for a 10 - minute march to the hotel .
Jehmu Greene , a former president of Rock the Vote , will address the crowd at the rally .
Public tickets to observe the meeting have already been snapped up , said Stacie Paxton , a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee .
On Tuesday morning , the Democratic National Committee opened online pre-registration for public seating , and the several hundred tickets disappeared within minutes .
“ There ’s been overwhelming public interest , ” Ms. Paxton said .
( C - Span is also expected to broadcast the meeting . )
The members of the public who managed to reserve seats will be able to listen to the proceedings , but not participate .
The committee will begin the meeting at 9:30 a.m. , listen to oral arguments , and then debate amongst themselves after a lunch break .
On its Web site , the Democratic National Committee has advised the public that “ in order to maintain the decorum of the meeting , banners , posters , signs , handouts , and noisemakers of any kind are strictly prohibited . ”
If they cannot come to a decision this weekend , the committee refers all outstanding business to the party ’s credentials committee .

Recently unsealed court records shed more light on the federal government 's attempts to secure the online book purchase records of 24,000 Amazon.com customers .
In 2006 , federal prosecutors investigating Robert D'Angelo , a Madison , WI official accused of fraud and tax evasion , subpoenaed online book retailer Amazon.com for transaction records on anyone who had purchased books from him through Amazon Marketplace since 1999 .
Prosecutors said they were hoping to find witnesses to testify against D'Angelo .
Amazon agreed to tell prosecutors what books D'Angelo had sold , but refused to turn over information on the buyers , citing its customers '
First Amendment rights to privacy .
The government came back with a request for only 120 customers , but Amazon still refused .
The case went before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Crocker , who ruled in June to strike down the subpoena on First Amendment grounds .
"
The subpoena is troubling because it permits the government to peek into the reading habits of specific individuals without their knowledge or permission , " Crocker wrote in his ruling .
" It is an unsettling and un-American scenario to envision federal agents nosing through the reading lists of law - abiding citizens while hunting for evidence against somebody else .
" Crocker also expressed concerns that allowing the government to pry into people 's reading habits could function as intimidation , thereby depriving them of their right to read what they wish .
"
The chilling effect on expressive e-commerce would frost keyboards across America , " he wrote .
Under Crocker 's urging , prosecutors reached a compromise with Amazon in which the company would send letters to the 24,000 customers sought in the initial subpoena , inviting them to contact prosecutors if they wished to testify .
Crocker also criticized prosecutors for seeking to force Amazon 's hand rather than seeking a compromise on their own .
"
If the government had been more diligent in looking for workarounds instead of baring its teeth when Amazon balked , it 's probable that this entire First Amendment showdown could have been avoided , " he said .

A little more than two weeks ago Republican presidential candidate John McCain took a hands off approach to government aid for homeowners who have been caught up in the mortgage crisis .
Today , McCain completely reversed his position .
On March 25 McCain said , “ I will not play election year politics with the housing crisis .
I will evaluate everything in terms of whether it might be harmful or helpful to our effort to deal with the crisis we face now .
I have always been committed to the principle that it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly , whether they are big banks or small borrowers .
Government assistance to the banking system should be based solely on preventing systemic risk that would endanger the entire financial system and the economy . ”
Today at a small business roundtable in Brooklyn , NY , McCain said , “ I ’ve made my principles in this area clear :
Tax breaks for builders , funds to purchase homes in foreclosure , and tax credits that are not targeted to where the need is greatest do not constitute the federal help that is warranted .
In some case , lenders and borrowers alike were caught up in the speculative frenzy that has harmed the housing market .
And it is not the responsibility of the American public to spare them from the consequences of their own bad judgment .
The goal should be to help homeowners who are struggling , and only about $ 5 billion of the bill addresses their concerns in any way .
I believe we can do better . ”
In two weeks John McCain shifted from the belief that the government should not provide bailouts to anyone to now saying that more money should be spent to help struggling homeowners .
It is well known that McCain does n’t know much about the economy , but he seems caught between his maverick image and courting the base of the Republican Party .
When one takes a step back and examines the McCain campaign , it is clear that the only thing he has been consistent with is his support for the Iraq war .
McCain has made contradictory comments about issues like torture and immigration throughout his campaign .
Advertisements
Policy does n’t seem to be McCain ’s strong suit .
For that matter neither do vision or consistency .
The Republican Party nominated McCain because he was the best of a bad lot .
He won the nomination with his position on Iraq .
The problem is that the more one listens to John McCain it seems that the Straight Talk Express has been replaced with the Double Talk Unlimited .
The hypothetical matchup polls may show McCain close to the Democrats now , but that is because he is not being campaigned against .
By the time the general election campaign ends , it will be clear that the last thing America needs is another stubborn fan of military action that has no domestic agenda at all .

I enjoyed seeing this image in an article in The Register .
The picture is a screen shot from Google Books viewing a page from a 1855 issue of The Gentleman ’s Magazine .
The latex - clad fingers belong to one of the people whose job it is to scan the books for Google ’s book project .
Information technologies often hide the processes that bring us the information we interact with .
Revealing errors give a picture of what these processes look like or involve .
In an extremely literal way , this error shows us just such a picture .
We can learn quite a lot from this image .
For example , since the fingers are not pressed against glass , we might conclude that Google is not using a traditional flatbed scanner .
Instead , it is likely that they are using a system similar to the one that the the Internet Archive has built that is designed specifically for scanning books .
But perhaps the most important thing that this error reveals is something we know , but often take for granted — the human involved in the process .
The decision on where to automate a process , and where leave it up to a human , is sometimes a very complicated one .
Human involvement in a process can prevent and catch many types of errors but can cause new ones .
Both choices introduce risks and benefits .
For example , an automated bank transaction system may allow human to catch obvious errors and to detect suspicious use that a computer without “ common sense ” might miss .
On the other hand , a human banker might commit fraud to try to enrich themselves with others money — something a machine would never do .
In our interaction with technological systems , we rarely reflect on the fact , and the ways , that the presence of humans in these areas is important to determining the behavior , quality , reliability , and the nature and degree of trust that we have in a technology .
In our interactions with complex processes through simple and abstract user interfaces , it is often only through errors — distinctly human errors , if not usually quite as clearly human as this one — that information workers ’ important presence is revealed .
Edited Excerpts from : " Do you own your Land ? "
WAR N Vol. 1 Issue 1a July 4 , 1997 p. 10 order info )
The foundation of this nation was real property ownership .
That ’s why the settlers came here .
To insure private ownership of land , the nation ’s founding fathers made it unlawful for government to own land except for the ten square miles of Washington D.C. , and such as may be needed for erection of Forts , Magazines , Arsenals , dockyards , and other needful buildings .
( The Constitution )
.
When an American fulfills the requirements to obtain a “ Land Grant ” the grant is assigned by , and made patent under , the hand and seal of the President of the United States of America , in accord with an Act of Congress .
Fictitious entities , like trusts , corporations , etc. cannot obtain land patents except by express act of Congress .
An example of Congress granting land through patents to fictitious entities is the railroad grants made to compensate the railroad companies for building railroads across America .
The Land Patent is the only form of perfect title to land available in the United States .
Wilcox v. Jackson , 38 US 498 ; 10 L.Ed. 264
In America today people think they own their land , but unless they have the Land Patent on the land they may not own it .
Most people today obtain " Real Estate " by contract and then on fulfillment of the contract they transfer control of land by " Warranty Deed " .
However , a " Warranty Deed " is merely a " color of title " ; and , color of title can mean : “ that which in appearance is title , but which in reality is no title ” .
Howth v. Farrar , C.C.A. Tex. ; 94 F.2d 654 , 658 ; McCoy v. Lowrie , 42 Wash .
2d 24 , Black 's Law Sixth Ed .
It is important to note that when in contest a Warranty Deed cannot stand against a Land Patent .
A grant of land , made Patent , is a public law standing on the books of the State and is notice to every subsequent purchaser under any conflicting sale made afterward .
Wineman v. Gastrell , 53 FED 697 , 2 US App. 581
The Land Patent is permanent and cannot be changed by the government after its issuance .
" Where the United States has parted with title by a patent legally issued and upon surveys made by itself and approved by the proper department , the title so granted cannot be impaired by any subsequent survey made by the government for its own purposes . "
Cage v. Danks , 13 La. Ann
128
.
In the history of this county no Land Patent has ever lost an appellate review in the courts .
As a matter of fact in Summa Corp .
v California , 466 US 198 the Supreme Court ruled forever that the Land Patent would always win over any other form of title .
In that case the land in question was tidewater land and California 's claim was based on California 's constitutional right to all tidewater lands .
The patent stood supreme even against California 's Constitution .
.
Land cannot be taken for debt or taxes , but Real Estate can be .
What is Land ?
By definition : “ ‘ Land ’ is not restricted to the earth 's surface , but extends below and above the surface .
Nor is it confined to solids , but may encompass within its bounds such things as gases and liquids .
A definition of ‘ land ’ along the lines of ‘ a mass of physical matter occupying a space ’ also is not sufficient , for an owner of land may remove part or all of that physical matter , as by digging it up and carrying away the soil , but would nevertheless retain as part of his ‘ land ’ the space that remains .
Ultimately ‘ land ’ is simply an area of three dimensional space , its position being defined by natural or imaginary points located by reference to the earth 's surface .
‘ Land ’ is not the fixed contents of that space , although , as we shall see , the owner of that space may well own those fixed contents .
Land is immovable , as distinct from chattels , which are moveable ; it is also , in its legal significance , indestructible .
The contents of the space may be physically severed , destroyed or consumed , but the space itself , and so the ‘ land ’ , remains immutable . ”
Peter Butt , Land Law 9 ( 2nd ed. 1988 ) Reprinted in Black 's Law Dictionary , Seventh Edition
What is Real Estate ?
It ’s a document that lays over the land in color of title ; though it is not the Land itself , it may include with it the right to real property that sits upon the Land .
Banks and corporations like Real Estate because they can own it without an Act of Congress .
They and others can use the fiction of title to it to seize property under the color of law .
They 've taken their colors of title into the courts for so long that the people ( under three generations of deception and ignorance ) simply allow them to go ahead .
Generally , people seem to have forgotten about land patents .
For that cause when you go into a court today with a real land title case ( a Land Patent case ) chances are the judge and any attorneys involved wo n't know what a Land Patent is .
The first court you run into that understands the power of a Land Patent may be a U.S. Circuit court of Appeals , and in the history of this nation there has never been an appellate case where a properly set Land Patent has ever lost its title to the Land .
If you ever have the occasion to have to defend your deeded right to your land in court and someone else presents their proof of right to that land secured by the land patent , you 'll lose your land unless you have similar proof .
If you have n't secured your right to your land by its land patent , you may be abandoning your right to your land and any prior owner with lawful right to the land patent could secure it to themselves and evict you off from the land you thought was yours , and you 'll have to leave .
So contact us and get your land patent secured .
It 's important .
Now , let 's suppose you have your Land Patent properly secured and for some reason you have to defend your right to the land .
What do you do ?
If you understand the patent and how it works you 'll defend it successfully .
So again , here 's how it works :
The Land came to the nation by treaty or war prize .
The government only had limited ability to own land , as before mentioned , and all of the remainder of the land was held in the sole disposition of the United States until it was granted under act of Congress by the hand and seal of the President to some person .
Then in that same act the President makes the Grant Patent .
Which means that the Land came to the nation by treaty and the patent assigns a specific part of that treaty to you and your heirs and assigns forever .
So , your land comes to you from the treaty through your Land Patent .
This is critical , the Land Patent secures the treaty to you .
The court is bound by the supremacy clause of the Constitution to uphold the treaty making your Patent a statutory limitation throughout the land .
Wineman v. Gastrell , 53 FED 697 , 2 US App. 581 .
If you ever have to defend your right to the Patent here 's how .
Get a full abstract on your land .
The Abstract will show the assignment on the land and patent from the patent to you .
Each record of the Abstract is a matter of public record , well established over time .
If your right to the land was well secured ( with a properly secured Warranty Deed ) and you have properly accepted and secured the Land Patent to that Land ( Team Law 's documentation has worked over 60 years ) , you 'll win , if you 're prepared .

Energy forecasters underestimate the importance of " surprises " in their forecasts , and this has led many of the major energy forecast studies of the last 50 years to overestimate the amount of energy they predicted the U.S. would be using by the year 2000 .
A new article by Ashok Gadgil and Jon Koomey , of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , and Paul Craig , Professor Emeritus of Engineering at the University of California at Davis , published in the 2002 Annual Review of Energy and the Environment , assesses the success of many of the major long - term energy forecasts published in the United States dating back to the 1960s .
" Our basic conclusion , " says Koomey , a scientist in the Environmental Energy Technologies Division and leader of Berkeley Lab's End -Use Energy Forecasting Group , " is that forecasters in the 1950 to 1980 period underestimated the importance of unmodeled surprises .
One of the most important examples is that they failed to foresee the ability of the United States economy to respond to the oil embargoes of the 1970s by increasing its energy efficiency .
Not only were most forecasts of that period systematically high , but forecasters systematically underestimated uncertainties . "
The authors of the article write that " Energy forecasters working in the aftermath of 1970s oil shocks expended enormous effort in projecting future energy trends . "
For example , forecasts of energy use in the year 2000 , compiled in a 1979 review by the U.S. Department of Energy , Energy Demands 1972 to 2000 , varied enormously .
Actual U.S. energy use in 2000 , which is superimposed on the graph , was at the very lowest end of the forecasts .
" Energy use turned out to be lower than was considered plausible by almost every forecaster , " says Craig .
" Forecasters did n't anticipate the ability of the economy to limit the growth of energy use . "
Forecasts conducted after the first shocks in 1973 did not predict the ability of the economy , ranging from energy - intensive industries and small businesses to homeowners , to respond to higher prices by adopting more energy - efficient technologies and practices .
Types of forecasts , their strengths and weaknesses
The researchers categorize the major long - term forecasting methodologies into six categories : trend projections ; econometric projections ; end - use analysis ; combined approaches ; systems dynamics , and scenario analysis .
They discuss the hidden assumptions of each approach , examining case studies of particular forecasts .
For example , trend projection was the method used in the last official government forecast before the oil embargo of 1973 , the Department of the Interior 's United States Energy Through the Year 2000 , published in 1972 .
It assumed that energy use would grow as it had for the past two decades , at a constant yearly rate of 3.6 percent per year -- an exponential growth rate .
The study forecast total primary energy use of 201 exajoules ( EJ ) in the year 2000 ( an exajoule is a million trillion joules ) .
Actual energy use in 2000 was 105 EJ , so the study overestimated energy growth by almost a factor of two .
A weakness of trend projection forecasts " is that they discourage searches for underlying driving forces , " says Gadgil , a scientist in the Environmental Energy Technologies Division and leader of the Airflow and Transport Group .
These models do not identify the causes of the trends they extrapolate , so they can't adjust when conditions change and establish a different trend .
The authors argue that econometric projections , more sophisticated versions of trend projections , have the same weaknesses .
Of course each type of forecast has its own strengths and weaknesses .
All forecasts are wrong in some respect , but if the process of designing them teaches something about the world and how events may unfold , creating them will have been worth the effort .
Learning lessons for better energy forecasts
The authors draw a number of lessons from their analysis about how to make better long - range forecasts .
A significant one is " Do not assume fixed laws of human behavior . "
Modelers often assume that key inputs will be similar to historical values , even when they are modeling a future that is unlike anything that has ever happened before .
" This error is particularly egregious for forecasts that look many decades ahead , and can lead to colossal errors , " says Craig .
Statistically derived relationships between variables are the ones most likely to be altered by major events and policy choices .
A significant example is the situation following the oil embargo of 1973 : energy growth no longer tracked economic growth because of the adoption of energy efficient technologies and practices .
" Forecasts that assumed continuance of historic relations between economic and energy growth were grossly wrong , " says Koomey .
The authors warn against becoming obsessed with technical sophistication .
" Beware of big complicated models and the results they produce , " says Gadgil .
" Generally they involve so much work that not enough time is spent on data compilation and scenario analysis . "
" Expect the unexpected and design for uncertainty " is advice that pertains to making the forecast as robust as possible in the face of imperfect forecasts that fail to anticipate the unexpected .
" If the key variables are impossible to foresee , " the authors write , " then adopt strategies that are less dependent on forecasts . "
" Communicate effectively , " says Gadgil .
" Forecasts can be technically strong but fail to influence their target audiences , because of poor communication of the results . "
Several studies published in the 1970s were controversial at first , but their authors engaged in a vigorous public defense of their findings , and eventually these studies were widely accepted by other researchers and policymakers .
Be modest
Most of all " be modest , " the authors advise .
" We need to be humble in the face of our modest abilities to foresee the future .
. . .
Fundamental limitations on our ability to foresee consequences have important implications for the ways we use forecasts in our planning . "
For the World Columbian Exposition of 1893 , great thinkers and inventors were asked to predict the future .
They were rarely correct .
George Westinghouse , the inventor of the compressed - air train brake , wrote that trains were unlikely ever to go faster than 30 miles per hour and that there was no need to go faster .
A forecast , says Koomey , is useful because it " illuminate [s ] the consequences of choices so that the people and institutions making them can evaluate the alternative outcomes based on their own values and judgment .
Hidden assumptions and value judgments exist in every forecast , but the best forecasters make these explicit , so that users of their work are fully informed . "

The relationship between mathematics and physics is a topic that has always fascinated me , and today I noticed two interesting blog postings related to the topic .
The first was Ben Webster ’s posting inspired by a recent XKCD comic .
The discussion in the comment section is well worth reading , especially the contributions from Terry Tao .
Over at Backreaction , Sabine Hossenfelder discusses an interview with Max Tegmark from the latest issue of Discover magazine entitled Is the Universe Actually Made of Math ?.
Much of the discussion is about Tegmark ’s comments on how he dealt with the potential danger to his career caused by his unconventional publications on the “ Mathematical Universe Hypothesis ” .
This says that
Our external physical reality is a mathematical structure
I ’ve always had an extreme case of mixed feelings about this , thinking that Tegmark manages to bring together the extremely deep and the extremely dumb .
He embeds this as “ Level IV ” , the highest level , of the multiverse , and multiverse mania is one reason he has gotten attention for this and not had it dismissed as crackpotism .
The idea he is pursuing is that any mathematical structure can be thought of as a “ universe ” , and we just happen to be in some random one of these .
This seems to me to be pretty much content - free , and the attempts to fit it into more conventionally popular multiverse studies do n’t help .
At the same time , this does get at an incredibly deep problem , that of the relationship between mathematical structures and physical reality .
Some of the central mathematical structures that mathematicians have discovered have turned out to be identical to those found by physicists pursuing models of fundamental physics .
This has happened in several very striking ways over the years .
Thinking of the universe as a mathematical structure has turned out to be extremely fruitful , both for mathematics and for physics .
What is important though is that not all mathematical structures are equally important , central , or interesting , and this is the crucial point that Tegmark seems to me to be missing .
Once you learn enough mathematics , you find certain recurring themes and deep structures throughout the subject .
What fascinates me is that these often also turn out to be central in theoretical physics .
Tegmark just accepts every mathematical structure as equally important , creating a huge undifferentiated multiverse where we occupy some random anthropically acceptable point .
But the evidence is that the mathematical structure we inhabit is a very special one , sharing features of the very special structures that mathematicians have found to be at the core of modern mathematics .
Why this is remains a great mystery , one well worth pursuing from both the mathematician ’s and physicist ’s points of view .
Once bitten , twice shy .
As banks rack up billions of dollars in losses from bad loans and blundered investments , large investors are becoming skittish about pumping more money into them .
In the past several weeks , bank executives have encountered unexpected resistance from investors , who have expressed reluctance to participate in the capital - raising transactions sweeping through the industry , according to people familiar with the situation .
Already bruised by big losses and fearing that bank shares have n't yet hit bottom , some of these investors are choosing to tighten their purse strings .
" The window for capital - raising is closing , " says Brad Evans , a portfolio manager for Heartland Advisors Inc. , a money - management firm in Milwaukee that invests in small , regional banks .
" Investing in a bank right now means investing in a large portfolio of loans that are essentially a black box . "
The change in sentiment could have sweeping implications for financial institutions that are trying to shore up their balance sheets by issuing stock and other securities to their investors .
Some may be forced to lure investors with sweeter terms , further raising the costs of doing these deals .
The PC industry 's two largest graphics companies released new top - of - the - line models this week .
The new graphics processors will bring not just better videogame performance , but will also turn ordinary desktop PCs into the equivalent of supercomputers – if programmers can figure out how to take advantage of the chips ' massively parallel architectures .
" We 're talking about every man , woman and child basically having a supercomputer on their desk , " says Jon Peddie , a graphics - industry veteran and president of Jon Peddie Research .
AMD , which acquired graphics maker ATI in 2006 , released two new chips , the Radeon HD 4850 and the Radeon HD 4870 .
Nvidia , the other dominant player in the space , unveiled its new GeForce GTX 260 and GeForce GTX 280 processors .
According to both companies , the new series of chips feature performance measured in teraflops ( that 's a trillion floating point operations per second ) , billions of transistors , hundreds of cores and new architectures that , according to industry analysts , could have a staggering effect on not only Crysis frame rates , but also how and what we use our computers for .
Indeed , cheap access to such formidable computing power could mean that , over the next few years , we will see an explosion of new independent research along with profound new discoveries , analysts say .
Additionally , new consumer applications will be able to draw on the graphics processing unit ( GPU ) for even more eye - watering special effects and even occasionally useful visual information .
" We 'll start to get things like real - time mapping from Google that incorporates all manner of real world information , " says Bob O'Donnell , an analyst at IDC .
" All of this is going to bubble up more and more . "
As Peddie observes , it was only 11 years ago that the U.S. government spent approximately $ 33 million to build ASCI Red , one of the first supercomputers to achieve 1 teraflop .
The new graphics chips offer similar power to the 1997 - era supercomputer for a fraction of the cost .
" Now we can go down to Fry 's or Best Buy and buy a graphics board that has 1 teraflop of processing power for $ 600 or less , " says Peddie .
Getting that processing power to work for the average computer user , however , remains a challenge .
With the exception of a few games , most applications still are n't made to take advantage of the GPU 's power .
That 's because GPUs are made for parallel processing ( crunching lots of bits of data at the same time , then assembling the results all at once ) , whereas most current software programs are written to be executed serially ( operating on one piece of data at a time , then proceeding to the next step ) .
That is starting change , albeit slowly , thanks to new initiatives designed to spur parallel processing .
Just last week , Khronos , the industry consortium behind the OpenGL standard , announced what it calls Open Computing Language , or OpenCL .
With this new heterogeneous computing initiative , the group hopes to come up with a standardized ( and universal ) way of programming parallel computing tasks .
In many ways , it 's the Holy Grail developers have been waiting for : a hardware - agnostic standard that unleashes the power of multi-core CPUs and GPUs using a familiar language .
Apple is throwing its weight behind parallel processing too , and last week committed to using the OpenCL specification as part of its next operating system release , Snow Leopard .
Other companies , including AMD , Nvidia , ARM , Freescale , IBM , Imagination , Nokia , Motorola , Qualcomm , Samsung and Texas Instruments have joined the OpenCL working group .
If initiatives like OpenCL gain momentum , the days of researchers applying for grants and traveling across the country to use a given university or research facility 's super computer may well be at an end .
Similarly , distributed computing projects like Folding@Home and Seti@Home may see an huge boost in performance by using hundreds of thousand of computers equipped with these new powerful processors .
Of course , if curing cancer or looking for aliens is n't your thing , we can also be fairly certain that Crysis will really scream on any system equipped with these new GPUs .
European intelligence experts dismiss the Bush " war on terrorism " as deception and reveal the realpolitik behind the aggression against Afghanistan .
Berlin -
In Germany , where war plans for Afghanistan were already being discussed in July and where several of the " Arab hijackers " lived and studied , intelligence experts say the terror attacks of September 11 could not have been carried out without the support of a state secret service .
Eckehardt Werthebach , former president of Germany 's domestic intelligence service , Verfassungsschutz , told AFP that " the deathly precision " and " the magnitude of planning " behind the attacks of September 11 would have needed " years of planning . "
Such a sophisticated operation , Werthebach said , would require the " fixed frame " of a state intelligence organization , something not found in a " loose group " of terrorists like the one allegedly led by Mohammed Atta while he studied in Hamburg .
Many people would have been involved in the planning of such an operation and Werthebach pointed to the absence of leaks as further indication that the attacks were " state organized actions . "
Andreas von Bulow served on the parliamentary commission which oversees the three branches of the German secret service while a member of the Bundestag ( German parliament ) from 1969 to 1994 , and wrote a book titled Im Namen des Staates ( In the Name of the State ) on the criminal activities of secret services , including the CIA .
Von Bulow told AFP that he believes that the Israeli intelligence service , Mossad , is behind the September 11 terror attacks .
These attacks , he said , were carried out to turn public opinion against the Arabs , and boost military and security spending .
" You do n't get the higher echelons , " von Bulow said , referring to the " architectural structure " which masterminds such terror attacks .
At this level , he said , the organization doing the planning , such as Mossad , is primarily interested in affecting public opinion .
The architectural level planners use corrupt " guns for hire " such as Abu Nidal , the Palestinian terrorist who von B'low called " an instrument of Mossad , " high - ranking Stasi ( former East German secret service ) operatives , or Libyan agents who organize terror attacks using dedicated people , for example Palestinian and Arab " freedom fighters . "
The terrorists who actually commit the crimes are what von Bulow calls " the working level , " such as the 19 Arabs who allegedly hijacked the planes on September 11 .
" The working level is part of the deception , " he said .
" Ninety - five percent of the work of the intelligence agencies around the world is deception and disinformation , " von Bulow said , which is widely propagated in the mainstream media creating an accepted version of events .
" Journalists do n't even raise the simplest questions , " he said adding , " those who differ are labeled as crazy . "
Both Werthebach and von Bulow said the lack of an open and official investigation , such as congressional hearings , into the events of September 11 was incomprehensible .
AFP asked von Bulow about the Taliban 's ban on opium production : " Seventy percent of the drug trade is licensed by the intelligence agencies , " von B'low said , and they are interested in keeping the drug traffic " running through their mills . "
" The BND ( German secret service ) is steered by the CIA and the CIA is steered by Mossad , " von Bulow said .
Horst Ehmke , who coordinated the German secret services directly under German prime minister Willi Brandt in the 70s , predicted a similar terrorist attack in his novel , Torches of Heaven , published last year , in which Turkish terrorists crash hijacked planes into Berlin .
EERIE PREDICTIONS
Although Ehmke had long expected " fundamentalist attacks , " when he saw the televised images from September 11 , he said it looked like a " Hollywood production . "
" Terrorists could not have carried out such an operation with 4 hijacked planes without the support of a secret service , " Ehmke said , although he did not want to point to any particular agency .
" The most important thing in the struggle against terrorists , who are abusing religion , is the battle for the soul of the people and the nations , " Ehmke said .
" If this is n't resolved successfully , the 21st Century could be bloodier than the last . "
A former Stasi agent who had warned the German secret service of terror attacks in America between September 10 - 20 told AFP that a high ranking Stasi chief named Jurgen Rogalla , who is " an airplane terror specialist , " was probably involved in the attacks of September 11 along with Abu Nidal .
Both Nidal and Rogalla work with the Mossad , the former agent told AFP .
Nidal , was said to be in Baghdad , and is a " leading officer for some Mossad agents . "
The agent said that Nidal was " involved directly " in the events of September 11 .
September 11 was preparation for a larger attack on the United States , which is part of " an old plan , " the agent said .
Based on prior knowledge of this plan , the agent said that more attacks are imminent and that aircraft carriers may be targeted next .
Rogalla is also strongly anti-religious and attacks on cathedrals or places of religious significance before Christmas are likely .
Rogalla was responsible for " turning NATO men " to spy for the East .
One of the East 's NATO spies , Reiner Rupp , known as " Topaz , " provided Stasi and the Russians with the organization 's highest secrets until he was discovered in 1993 by the BND .
A CIA agent known as " Frank Lindsey " worked with Rogalla , according to the former Stasi agent .
TERROR INVESTIGATION BLOCKED
Under the influence of U.S. oil companies , the administration of George W. Bush blocked U.S. secret service investigations on terrorism , while it bargained with the Taliban to turn over Osama bin Laden in exchange for political recognition and economic aid , two French intelligence analysts claim .
In a recently published book , " Bin Laden , la verite interdite " ( Bin Laden , the forbidden truth ) , the authors , Jean - Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie , reveal that the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's deputy director John O'Neill resigned in July in protest due to official obstruction of his investigation of terrorism .
O'Neill had been in charge of national security in New York .
While with the FBI , O'Neill led an investigation of Osama bin Laden and had forecast the possibility of an organized attack by terrorists operating from within the country .
O'Neill had investigated the USS Cole bombing in Yemen , the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
In 1995 , FBI agents working under O'Neill captured Ramzi Yousef , a suspected lieutenant of bin Laden , who later was among those convicted for the World Trade Center bombing .
O'Neill was considered a top - notch investigator and was known for his pugnacity .
He was barred by U.S. Ambassador to Yemen Barbara Bodine from that country .
That dispute reportedly involved a struggle between the State Department , which sought to preserve relations with Yemen , and the FBI , represented by O'Neill , who wanted access to Yemeni suspects .
O'Neill , 49 , was hired as chief of security at the World Trade Center following a 25 - year career with the FBI and died on Sept. 11 , the first day of his new job .
O'Neill reportedly died after reentering the building to assist others .
Brisard said O'Neill told them that " the main obstacles to investigate Islamic terrorism were U.S. oil corporate interests and the role played by Saudi Arabia in it . "
EARLY WARNINGS
Osama bin Laden and the Taliban received threats of possible American military strikes against them two months before the terrorist assaults on New York and Washington , according to The Guardian ( UK ) .
The warnings to the Taliban originated at a four - day meeting of senior Americans , Russians , Iranians and Pakistanis at a hotel in Berlin in mid-July .
The meetings took place under the arbitration of Francesc Vendrell , personal representative of UN secretary general Kofi Annan , to discuss the situation in Afghanistan .
The three Americans at the Berlin meeting were Tom Simons , former US ambassador to Pakistan , Karl " Rick " Inderfurth , a former assistant secretary of state for south Asian affairs , and Lee Coldren , who headed the office of Pakistan , Afghan and Bangladesh affairs in the state department until 1997 .
There were other meetings arranged by Vendrell in which " representatives of the U.S. government and Russia , and the six countries that border with Afghanistan were present , " according to the French authors .
" Sometimes , representatives of the Taliban also sat around the table . "
The Berlin conference was the third meeting since November 2000 arranged by Mr. Vendrell .
As a UN meeting , its official agenda was supposedly confined to trying to find a negotiated solution to the civil war in Afghanistan , ending terrorism and heroin trafficking , and discussing humanitarian aid .
CARPET OF GOLD -- OR BOMBS
The U.S. government 's primary objective in Afghanistan was to consolidate the position of the Taliban regime in order to obtain access to the oil and gas reserves of Central Asia , the French authors wrote .
Until August , the U.S. government saw the Taliban regime " as a source of stability in Central Asia that would enable the construction of an oil pipeline across Central Asia , " from the rich oilfields in Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Kazakhstan , through Afghanistan and Pakistan , to the Indian Ocean , they said .
" The oil and gas reserves of Central Asia have been controlled by Russia .
The Bush government wanted to change all that , " the book says .
When the Taliban refused to accept U.S. conditions , " this rationale of energy security changed into a military one . "
" The Americans indicated to us that in case the Taliban does not behave and in case Pakistan also does n't help us to influence the Taliban , then the United States would be left with no option but to take an overt action against Afghanistan , " said Niaz Naik , a former foreign minister of Pakistan , who attended the meetings .
On French television , Naik said during the " 6+2 " meeting in Berlin in July , the discussions turned around " the formation of a government of national unity .
If the Taliban had accepted this coalition , they would have immediately received international economic aid . "
" And the pipe lines from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan would have come , " he added .
Naik also claimed that Tom Simons , the U.S. representative at these meetings , openly threatened the Taliban and Pakistan .
" Simons said , ' either the Taliban behave as they ought to , or Pakistan convinces them to do so , or we will use another option ' .
The words Simons used were ' a military operation ' , " Naik said .
" At one moment during the negotiations , the U.S. representatives told the Taliban , ' either you accept our offer of a carpet of gold , or we bury you under a carpet of bombs ' , " Brisard said in an interview in Paris .
According to the book , the government of Bush began to negotiate with the Taliban immediately after coming into power in February .
U.S. and Taliban diplomatic representatives met several times in Washington , Berlin and Islamabad .
As The New York Times wrote on the 50th anniversary of the G.I. bill : “ Few laws have done so much for so many . ”

“ These veterans were able to get a first - class future , ” Senator Webb told me in an interview .
“ But not only that .
For every dollar that was spent on the World War II G.I. bill , seven dollars came back in the form of tax remunerations from those who received benefits . ”
Senator Lautenberg went to Columbia on the G.I. bill , and Senator Warner to Washington and Lee University and then to law school .
The benefits have not kept pace over the decades with the real costs of attending college .
Moreover , service members have to make an out - of - pocket contribution  something over $ 100 a month during their first year of service  to qualify for the watered - down benefits .
This is not exactly first - class treatment of the nation ’s warriors .
The Bush administration opposes the new G.I. bill primarily on the grounds that it is too generous , would be difficult to administer and would adversely affect retention .
This is bogus .
The estimated $ 2.5 billion to $ 4 billion annual cost of the Webb proposal is dwarfed by the hundreds of billions being spent on the wars we ’re asking service members to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan .
What ’s important to keep in mind is that the money that goes to bolstering the education of returning veterans is an investment , in both the lives of the veterans themselves and the future of the nation .
The notion that expanding educational benefits will have a negative effect on retention seems silly .
The Webb bill would cover tuition at a rate comparable to the highest tuition at a state school in the state in which the veteran would be enrolled .
That kind of solid benefit would draw talented individuals into the military in large numbers .

In this week ’s Sierra Club Insider , it was stated that the family vacation is disappearing from American culture .
According to Treehugger , a new study by Oliver Pergams of the University of Illinois - Chicago and Patricia Zaradic of the Environmental Leadership Program found that “ the time children spend in nature — particularly the activities we looked at in this study — determines their environmental awareness as adults . ”
Citing the same study co-sponsored by the Nature Conservancy , the Grist states
Kids — and adults — these days are “ videophiliacs ” who prefer their nature through the TV screen rather than personally experienced , says a new study .
It estimates that Americans ’ participation in outdoor recreation has dropped as much as 25 percent over the past 20 years .
What ’s a green family to do ?
Beyond offsetting your typical trip to Disneyland , there are now many eco travel tours and trips for families .
Of course you do n’t have to join a tour to take a memorable eco trip with your family .
Camping and backpacking provide wonderful opportunities for families to experience nature ; however , a well - designed eco trip will allow you to meet other families and take some of the responsibility off of your shoulders .
World Family Yoga offers trips to beautiful eco-retreat locations in the rainforest and Europe .
Our family yoga retreats allow parents a rejuvenating and uplifting Anusara Yoga practice accessible to all levels of experience , while the children join together for a playful and insightful yoga session with their new friends .
Nature and cultural studies are also included for children .
The Sierra Club offers family trips for children as young as one .
“ We welcome single parents , grandparents , aunts , and uncles in addition to two - parent families . ”
They have a special trip planned for grandparents and grandkids to Tahoe National Forest in August .
Other current trips include Maui , Bryce Canyon , the Great Smoky Mountains , and the Lower Salmon River Family Raft Adventure .
Whether you take a guided eco-trip or one of your design , do n’t forget to include a visit to nature in your next family vacation .
You are sowing the seeds of environmental stewardship in your children , bonding as a family , and creating memorable experiences in nature .
I ca n’t remember specific events from my family ’s vacations to Disney Parks , but I certainly remember childhood hikes and cave explorations in the Hocking Hills !

In the late 19th century , William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer developed what would come to be known as yellow journalism .
By disregarding what had been standard journalistic methods , particularly in regards to the verifying of sources , these two publishers were able both to push their country toward war with Spain and dramatically increase the circulation of their respective newspapers .
Man has always had a healthy desire for knowledge , and it is the feeding of this hunger that ennobles journalism .
Hearst and Pulitzer were acutely aware that man has a less healthy but no less voracious desire to believe that he has knowledge , particularly knowledge of something sensational .
It is the feeding of this hunger that irreparably disgraced journalism , and a century later now threatens to do the same to science .
* * *
Scientists , like journalists , are called upon to plumb the depths of the unknown and to fairly and objectively report their findings to their own professional community as well as the general public .
Scientists , like the journalists of yesteryear , have specific methods for ensuring that the public trust placed in them is not abused .
The most fundamental of these methods is the well - known , if not so creatively named , scientific method .
The essence of the scientific method is the formulation of hypotheses ( ideas ) and the using of these hypotheses to make predictions that can be experimentally tested .
In the words of Sir Arthur Eddington in " The Philosophy of Physical Science , " " Every item of physical knowledge must therefore be an assertion of what has been or would be the result of carrying out a specified observational procedure . "
Nevertheless , over the past several decades an increasing number of scientists have shed the restraints imposed by the scientific method and begun to proclaim the truth of man-made global warming .
This is a hypothesis that remains untested , makes no predictions that can be tested in the near future , and cannot offer a numerical explanation for the limited evidence to which it clings .
No equations have been shown to explain the relationship between fossil - fuel emission and global temperature .
The only predictions that have been made are apocalyptic , so the hypothesis has to be accepted before it can be tested .
