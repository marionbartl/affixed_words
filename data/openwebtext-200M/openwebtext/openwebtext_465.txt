The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly voted Wednesday to grant retroactive amnesty to the telecoms that aided the President Bush 's five - year secret , warrantless wiretapping of Americans , and to expand the government 's authority to sift through U.S. communications , handing a key victory to the Bush administration .
The Democrats ' presumptive presidential nominee Barack Obama
( D - Illinois ) voted for the final bill , despite intense lobbying by supporters who used Obama 's own online organizing technology to try to hold him to his promise to fight any bill that included amnesty .
New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , Obama 's former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , voted against the bill .
The 68 to 29 vote puts an end to more than a year of debate over whether the government should be able to collect millions of e-mails and phone calls daily from U.S. - based communication switches without any probable cause .
It also answers whether Congress believes the nation 's telecoms and president had a duty to follow the rules set out in 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which was passed after the abuses of the 1950s and 60s .
If the FISA Amendments Act survives constitutional challenge , it dooms the dozens of anti-wiretapping lawsuits filed against the nation 's telecoms , by ordering the judge in charge of the cases to dismiss them if the telecoms can prove the government asked them to help out .
Those suits seek billions in damages for alleged massive violations of communication privacy laws , and seek to prevent companies from participating again in the future without proper court orders .
Congress 's wiretapping debate started in earnest last spring after the nation 's secret spying court struck down a version of the president 's secret surveillance program .
That led Bush and his surrogates in the Justice Department and intelligence community to push Congress to grant it powers that the administration claimed for itself , until it was forced to submit the secret wiretapping program to a court in January 2007 .
Senator Christopher Dodd , D - Connecticut , who nearly single - handedly derailed a vote on a similar bill in December , took the floor one last time Wednesday morning , imploring his fellow senators to let the courts continue without interference .
He also offered hope to immunity foes by predicting of the measure will be struck down in court .
" Opponents of retroactive immunity can take solace in knowing that it will still ultimately be the judiciary that decides whether any of this would have passed muster with the framers , " Dodd said .
" I can hardly see how it would have . "
Senator Kit Bond ( R - Missouri ) , the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee , argued that the bill has plenty of court oversight , and that the nation 's telecoms should n't be punished for coming to the aid of the country .
" It is unfair to use telecoms as the punching bag to get at the administration , " Bond said , arguing that anti-wiretapping suits should be filed against the government , not the telecoms .
Bond failed to note the significant legal hurdles to suing the government , including the need to prove standing and overcome sovereign immunity privileges .
The amnesty debate spilled over into the presidential campaign of 2008 , after McCain 's campaign temporarily appeared to grow tougher on the nation 's telecoms .
For his part , Obama sparked a grassroots rebellion among his supporters in the last two weeks for backing off a promise to vote against any bill that contained amnesty for telephone and internet companies that gave the government access to customer records and communications with valid court orders .
An amendment sponsored by Dodd to strip immunity from the bill failed by a vote of 32 to 66 , a tally nearly identical to a vote on a similar amendment in February that failed 31 to 67 .
The Senate also voted down an amendment from Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - New Mexico ) that would have paused both the lawsuits and the amnesty provisions until after a Inspectors General report to Congress revealed what exactly happened .
Senator Arlen Specter ( R - Pennsylvania ) stressed that Congress was violating the separation of powers by interfering with the courts .
" This may be a historical embarrassment , " Specter said Wednesday morning on the Senate floor .
" Everyone knows we do n't know what the program did , but here we are giving immunity to the telephone companies . "
President Bush is expected to quickly sign the bill – which was passed by the House in June .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , a San Francisco non-profit rights groups at the center of the lawsuits against the telecoms , plans to challenge the legality of the amnesty provision , arguing that Congress overstepped its authority by messing with the courts .
Despite the landslide loss , the ACLU 's Caroline Fredrickson took solace in the fact that the fight took so long , and that individuals around the country organized around an issue that many said was too esoteric .
" I think that says something , " Fredrickson said .
" Even though we lost at the end of the day , there has been a re-awakening in the American public of a feeling that while we are fighting the so - called ' War on Terror , ' we need to protect our civil liberties and the separation of powers . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama's two unannounced and very secretive meetings with his vice presidential team have Washington insiders buzzing about a potential announcement .
Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine is being mentioned as a potential running mate for Sen. Barack Obama .
Predicting whom a presidential candidate will pick as a running mate , though , is a dangerous game .
A headline in the New York Post on July 7 , 2004 , announced " Kerry 's choice , " showing a picture of Sen. John Kerry and former House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt .
However , Kerry had picked former Sen. John Edwards as his 2004 presidential running mate .
With the Democratic convention less than a month away , Obama remains mum .
" The next time I talk about my vice presidential selection , it will be to introduce the selection , " Obama told CNN 's Candy Crowley in Berlin , Germany , last week .
But Washington being Washington , political junkies just can't help themselves .
Before the 1980s , presidential candidates typically did not unveil their running mates until the convention , often on its very last day .
Democrats broke this trend in 1984 , when Walter Mondale announced his pick of Geraldine Ferraro four days before the start of the San Francisco convention .
The Democrats continued this practice through 2004 , when Kerry announced Edwards as his running mate 20 days before the convention .
Republican candidates did not start announcing their vice presidential picks ahead of their convention until 1996 .
There are odds - on favorites for Obama 's pick , as of now , including Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine , Delaware Sen. Joe Biden , Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius .
Watch CNN's Mark Preston discuss the vice president favorites »
The most buzz , however , is around Kaine , who 's been campaigning for Obama for the last year and a half .
He is also the Obama campaign 's national chairman .
Asked directly whether he 's being courted , Kaine remained coy Tuesday .
" It 's flattering to be mentioned ; my mom loves it ; she calls when she sees it .
But , you know , it is just -- that is for the campaign to decide , " he told WTOP radio .
CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said there are several advantages : " He 's young ; he 's fresh ; he 's new ; he 's an outsider . "
Watch more on Tim Kaine 's chances »
And the downside ?
Both Obama and Kaine are young and very new to the national stage , with little or no national security experience .
The two Democrats , however , are comfortable with each other .
Kaine was the first governor to endorse Obama outside Illinois , when most of the Democratic establishment was still supporting Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Demographically and geographically , Kaine is the full package .
Kaine , a Roman Catholic , once worked as a missionary in Central America .
He can speak about religious values , something Obama wants more Democrats to do .
Kaine also speaks fluent Spanish , another target group for Democrats .
Watch voters sound off on the potential vice presidential picks »
Kaine was also born in Minnesota and went to college in Missouri , two swing states in the Midwest .
Stu Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report said Kaine " makes a lot of sense " for Obama .
" Virginia is going to be one of the two or three key states for Obama , " he said .
Just as Al Gore did for President Clinton , Kaine helps re-enforce the central theme : The Democratic Party is new and different .
Biden , who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , is a good pick in terms of experience , Rothenberg said .
" He 's a grown - up ; foreign policy , national security , been around a long time , " Rothenberg added .
The Democrat 's political experience will help counter GOP arguments that Obama is inexperienced on foreign policy .
Biden is also a scrappy campaigner and would almost certainly revel in the traditional attack - dog role of the running mate .
On the downside , Biden is more apt to wander off script more than once during a general election campaign .
In addition , Delaware 's three electoral votes are safely in the Democratic column .
Picking Bayh -- originally a big Clinton supporter during the Democratic primaries -- would help unite Democrats during a lengthy , heated primary campaign .
" Evan Bayh is not the kind of person to make mistakes .
He is loyal ; he 's trustworthy ; he 's smart ; he looks terrific in a photo op , " Rothenberg said .
On the plus side , Bayh 's service on the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees would help shore up Obama 's weak spots .
Running with this centrist Democrat would counter GOP critics that Obama is a typical liberal .
Indiana 's 11 electoral votes would n't hurt , either .
However , Bayh 's support of the war in Iraq could put him at odds with his running mate , who has repeatedly brought up his opposition to the war during campaign rallies .
And then there 's Sebelius , who could either help or hurt the women 's vote .
" Kathleen Sebelius ... might evoke such a scream of anger from Hillary Clinton supporters that a Sebelius pick would n't be worth it if you 're just going for a woman , " Rothenberg said .
The popular two - term governor of Kansas could help Obama carry the state for the first time since 1964 .
Sebelius , who chose a former state GOP chairman as her running mate in 2006 , would reinforce Obama 's image as someone who transcends the normal partisan divide .
The veepstakes spotlight on Clinton , however , has diminished .
" Normally , the presidential nominee does n't want to be overshadowed by the veep or the veep 's husband , and Sen.
Clinton brings some considerable baggage and controversy , " Rothenberg said .
That controversy includes the perception that she is one of the most divisive politicians .
Obama may not want to put a polarizing figure such as Clinton on a ticket aimed at bridging the partisan divide .
On the plus side , there 's no better way to unite the Democratic Party than by putting her on the ticket .
Clinton also has the ability to win older voters , Roman Catholics and women , three groups that have remained noticeably cool to Obama .
CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux , Bill Schneider , Robert Yoon , Alan Silverleib and Ed Hornick contributed to this report .
All About Tim Kaine • Evan Bayh • Kathleen Sebelius • Joseph Biden • Hillary Clinton
Throughout the history of English literature , hundreds of writers have created fantastic worlds for their plots and characters to play out in .
This is sometimes done for reasons of satire ( under oppressive governments ) or just for outright pleasure .
This is a selection of the ten best fictional lands in English literature .
10 Dreamlands H. P. Lovecraft
The Dreamlands is a fictional location in the Dream Cycle of H. P. Lovecraft .
It is also the setting for a number of pastiches written by other authors .
The Dreamlands is a vast , alternate dimension that can be entered through dreams , similar to astral projection or lucid dreaming .
Experienced dreamers are among the most powerful inhabitants of the Dreamlands and may become its permanent residents after their physical deaths .
The Dreamlands can be entered in other ways , including physically .
This usually requires passing through very dangerous areas of both the waking world and the Dreamlands .
Consequently , real death becomes a risk .
However , the visitor does receive the prolonged lifespan of a native of the Dreamlands , so the traveler ’s time there is no longer limited to the duration of a night ’s sleep on earth .
Though the term Dreamlands typically refers to the dimension accessible by human dreamers , other inhabited planets may have their own dreamlands .
Reaching these other realms from the terrestrial Dreamlands is possible but difficult .
Time flows at a different rate in the Dreamlands — each hour on earth represents a week or more there .
Consequently , a traveller can spend months in the Dreamlands during a single night ’s sleep on earth .
Fortunately for dreamers , inhabitants of the Dreamlands are either long - lived or immortal , provided they avoid injury or disease .

9 Pellucidar Edgar Rice Burroughs
Pellucidar is a fictional Hollow Earth milieu invented by Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs for a series of action adventure stories .
In a notable crossover event between Burroughs ’ series , there is a Tarzan story in which the Ape Man finds his way into Pellucidar .
The stories initially involve the adventures of mining heir David Innes and his inventor friend Abner Perry after they use an “ iron mole ” to burrow 500 miles into the earth ’s crust .
Later protagonists include indigenous cave man Tanar and additional visitors from the surface world , most notably Tarzan .
Primitive people and prehistoric creatures , notably dinosaurs , populate Pellucidar .
The region in which Innes and Perry initially find themselves is ruled by the cities of the Mahars , intelligent flying reptiles resembling pterosaurs with dangerous psychic powers , which keep the local tribelets of Stone Age human beings in subjugation .
Innes and Perry eventually unite the tribes to overthrow the Mahars ’ domain and establish a human “ Empire of Pellucidar ” in its place .
While the Mahars are the dominant species in the Pellucidar novels , they seem confined to their handful of cities .
Before their overthrow they use the Sagoths , a race of gorilla - men who speak the same language as Tarzan ’s apes , to enforce their rule over the human tribes within the area which they rule .

8 Neverland J. M. Barrie
Neverland ( also called Never - Never - Land , Never Land and other variations ) is the fictional island and dream world featured in the play Peter Pan , or The Boy Who Would n’t Grow Up by Scottish writer J. M. Barrie , his subsequent novel Peter and Wendy , and later works by others .
While sojourning in Neverland , people may cease to age ; therefore , Neverland is often seen as a metaphor for eternal childhood ( and childishness ) , immortality , and escapism .
The 1911 novel explains that Neverlands are found in the minds of children , and although they are “ always more or less an island ” , and they have a family resemblance , they are not the same from one child to the next .
For example , John Darling ’s “ had a lagoon with flamingos flying over it ” while his little brother Michael ’s “ had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it ” .
In the world of Neverland , they say either the Crocodile ’s clock or the suns and moons tell that time .
It is mentioned in the novel Peter Pan that there are many more suns and moons there than in our world .
According to Peter Pan in Scarlet , Neverland resides in a sea known as the Sea of One Thousand Islands .
In the book , Peter explores some of this sea , passing by islands of various sizes .
The most amazing thing encountered on this adventure is Lodestone Rock : a magnetic rock that destroys the Jolly Peter and the SS Starkey along with it .

7 Shangri-La James Hilton
Shangri-La is a fictional place described in the 1933 novel Lost Horizon by British author James Hilton .
In the book , “ Shangri - La ” is a mystical , harmonious valley , gently guided from a lamasery , enclosed in the western end of the Kunlun Mountains .
Shangri- La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise but particularly a mythical Himalayan utopia — a permanently happy land , isolated from the outside world .
In the novel Lost Horizon , the people who live at Shangri - La are almost immortal , living years beyond the normal lifespan .
The word also evokes the imagery of exoticism of the Orient .
The story of Shangri - La is based on the concept of Shambhala , a mystical city in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition .
There are a number of modern Shangri - La pseudo - legends that have developed since 1933 in the wake of the novel and the film made from it .
The Nazis had an enthusiasm for Shangri - La , where they hoped to find an ancient master race , similar to the Nordic race , unspoiled by Buddhism .
They sent one expedition to Tibet , led by Ernst Schäfer in 1938 .
Shangri-la is often used in a similar context to which “ Garden of Eden ” might be used , to represent a perfect paradise that exists hidden from modern man .
It can sometimes be used as an analogy for a life - long quest or something elusive that is much sought .

6 Narnia C. S. Lewis
Narnia is a fantasy world created by C. S. Lewis as the primary location for his series of seven fantasy novels for children , The Chronicles of Narnia .
The world is so called after the country of Narnia , in which much of the action of the Chronicles takes place .
In Narnia , some animals can talk , mythical beasts abound , and magic is common .
The series tracks the story of Narnia when humans , usually children , enter the Narnian world from ‘ our world ’ , or Earth .
According to the mythology of the series , Narnia was created by the great lion , Aslan , and is filled with talking animals and mythical creatures .
C. S. Lewis may have taken the name from the Italian town of Narni , whose Latin name was in fact , Narnia .
The landscape of Lewis ’ native Northern Ireland played a large part in the creation of the Narnian landscape .
In his essay On Stories , Lewis wrote “ I have seen landscapes , notably in the Mourne Mountains and southwards which under a particular light made me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge ” .
The world of Narnia is a flat world in a geocentric universe .
Its sky is a dome that mortal creatures cannot penetrate .
Narnia ’s stars are burning humanoid beings .
Its constellations are the result of a mystical dance upon the sky , performed by the stars to announce the works and comings of Aslan , Narnia ’s creator .
The stars also arrange themselves to allow seers to foretell certain future events .

5 Utopia St Thomas More
Utopia is a name for an ideal society , taken from the title of a book written in 1516 by St Thomas More describing a fictional island in the Atlantic Ocean , possessing a seemingly perfect socio- politico - legal system .
The term has been used to describe both intentional communities that attempted to create an ideal society , and fictional societies portrayed in literature .
“ Utopia ” is sometimes used pejoratively , in reference to an unrealistic ideal that is impossible to achieve , and has spawned other concepts , most prominently dystopia .
The word comes from Greek : ?? , “ not ” , and ????? , “ place ” , indicating that More was utilizing the concept as allegory and did not consider such an ideal place to be realistically possible .
It is worth noting that the homophone Eutopia , derived from the Greek ?? , “ good ” or “ well ” , and ????? , “ place ” , signifies a double meaning that was almost certainly intended .
Despite this , most modern usage of the term “ Utopia ” incorrectly assumes the latter meaning , that of a place of perfection rather than nonexistence .

4 Gulliver ’s World Jonathan Swift
Lilliput and Blefuscu are two fictional island nations that appear in the 1726 novel Gulliver ’s Travels by Jonathan Swift .
Both are portrayed as being in the South Indian Ocean and are inhabited by tiny people who are “ not six inches high ” .
A channel separates the two eight hundred yards wide .
The tiny people of Lilliput and Blefuscu contrast with the giants of Brobdingnag whom Gulliver also met .
In the novel , Gulliver washes up on the shore of Lilliput and is ‘ captured ’ by the inhabitants while asleep .
He discovers that Lilliput and Blefuscu are permanently at war because of differences over the correct way to eat a boiled egg – from the rounded end according to the Blefuscudians , or from the sharp end according to the Lilliputians .
Additionally , Gulliver ’s Travels also includes the land of Brobdingnag ; the people of Brobdingnag are described as giants who are as tall as a church steeple and whose stride is ten yards .
All of the other animals and plants , and even natural features such as rivers and even hail , are in proportion .
The rats are the size of large dogs and the flies are the size of birds , for example .

3 The Land of Oz L. Frank Baum
Oz is , in the first book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , distinguished from Dorothy ’s native Kansas by not being civilized ; this explains why Kansas does not have witches and wizards , while Oz does .
In the third book , Ozma of Oz , Oz is described as a “ fairy country ” , new terminology that remained to explain its wonders .
Oz is roughly rectangular in shape , and divided along the diagonals into four countries : Munchkin Country ( but commonly referred to as ‘ Munchkinland ’ in adaptations ) in the East , Winkie Country ( called ‘ The Vinkus ’ in Gregory Maguire ’s Wicked and its sequel Son of a Witch ) in the West , ( sometimes West and East are reversed on maps of Oz , see West and East below ) Gillikin Country in the North , and Quadling Country in the South .
In the center of Oz , where the diagonals cross , is the fabled Emerald City , capital of the land of Oz and seat to the monarch of Oz , Princess Ozma .
Oz is completely surrounded on all four sides by a desert , which insulates the citizens of Oz from discovery and invasion .
In the first two books , this is merely a desert , with only its extent to make it dangerous to the traveler .

2 Alice ’s Worlds Lewis Carroll
Wonderland ( from Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland ) is a strange and seemingly crazy world that is entered by dropping into a rabbit hole .
Animals act as normal people .
Physical size as well as time is relative .
However , the story also partly takes place in our ‘ real ’ world , where Alice starts by sitting next to her sister , and wakes up in it .
In the story , Wonderland is a dream world .
However , thematically , Wonderland is not really another world .
It is in fact our own world , only seen through the eyes of a child .
The Looking Glass world resembles Wonderland .
Strange creatures also inhabit it and weird things keep happening .
This world can be entered by passing through the mirror above the chimney in Alice ’s house .
Therefore , everything in Wonderland is reversed ; books are in mirror writing and when you want to go to a certain place , you have to walk in the opposite direction .
The land is laid out like a huge chessboard , with little brooks to mark the edges of the squares .
The rules of chess apply when the inhabitants try to move from one square to another .
The creatures in Looking Glass world seem to be a little less crazy than the creatures in Wonderland .
In the end , Looking Glass world turns out to be a dream world as well , and can also be seen as a metaphor for our own adult world .
1 Middle - Earth J. R. R. Tolkien
Middle - earth refers to the fictional lands where most of the stories of author J. R. R. Tolkien take place .
Tolkien ’s stories chronicle the struggle to control the world ( called Arda ) and the continent of Middle - earth , between the angelic Valar , the Elves and their allies among Men ; and the demonic Melkor or Morgoth ( a Vala fallen into evil ) and his minions , mostly Orcs , Dragons and enslaved men .
Tolkien prepared several maps of Middle - earth and the regions of Middle - earth in which his stories took place .
Some were published in his lifetime , though some of the earliest maps were not published until after his death .
The main maps were those published in The Hobbit , The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion .
Tolkien said that his Middle - earth is located on our Earth , but in a fictional period in the past , estimating the end of the Third Age to about 6,000 years before his own time .
He was later to refute this notion , and state that Middle - earth was not at a physically distant time , but rather “ at a different stage of imagination ” .

Largest Cleantech Industry is …Carbon Credits at $ 63 Billion
July 30th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
[ social_buttons ]
Emerging out of thin air , it has already surpassed solar and wind as the largest cleantech industry .
Carbon credits were worth a staggering $ 63 billion in 2007 and $ 59 billion in the first half of 2008 alone .
Europe has dominating the carbon market since its creation less than five years ago .
EU ’s Emissions Trading Scheme ( EU ETS ) was responsible for 70 % of the trading in the first half of this year , totaling $ 47 billion .
This dollar amount is likely to increase as the cost of carbon credits soars and with the inclusion of aviation emissions in 2012 .
Obviously an industry of this amount of rapid growth opens many business opportunities .
Companies are needed to provide verified emissions offsets , energy efficiency audits , greenhouse gas emission audits , and to design carbon software .
This industry has gained considerable interest from venture capitalists .
Carbonetworks of Victoria , British Columbia provides software to evaluate carbon footprints and reduction options for businesses , governments , project developers , and consultants .
They are located in one of the few areas in North America with a carbon tax .
They recently announced the first close of a $ 5 million Series A round from NGEN Partners .
CarbonFlow of San Francisco is developing software to lower the time and cost of creating carbon credits .
They raised $ 2.9 million in the first round of funding from OVP Venture Partners , Meridian Energy , and Clean Pacific Ventures .
CarbonFlow partnered with Det Norske Veritas of Norway for developing and marketing their system .
The infrastructure is n’t fully in place to support such a large industry and business opportunities are plentiful .
If the U.S. and China create large - scale carbon trading systems , the sky is the limit for growth in the carbon trading industry .
Although it is great to see action being taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , carbon credits can be a way for an organization to throw money at a problem instead of taking action to reduce their own carbon footprint of their operations .
The effectiveness of carbon markets has been questioned , yet this industry does n’t seem to be going anywhere any time soon .
Both McCain and Obama support a cap and trade system for the U.S .

On Friday Treasury Secretary Paulson Said Keep Fannie and Freddie in Current Form .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson signaled that a government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac wo n't be necessary , saying they should continue as shareholder - owned companies with federal charters .
" Today our primary focus is supporting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in their current form as they carry out their important mission , " Paulson said in a statement in Washington .
Paulson 's remarks indicate he wants to reassure shareholders they wo n't be wiped out by any government efforts to ensure the stability of the firms that own or guarantee almost half the $ 12 trillion in U.S. mortgages .
Yes , No , Yes , Maybe
Early Friday it was rumored Bernanke Expands Swap - O- Rama To Include Fannie , Freddie .
Late Friday Fed Says No Talks With Fannie , Freddie About Loans .
The Federal Reserve has not had any discussions with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about access to direct loans from the central bank , Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith said .
On Sunday Reuters is repeating Bernanke tells Freddie discount window open .
Fannie and Freddie declined to comment .
Hedge Fund Model At Fannie , Freddie
Former U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow said that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have relied on leverage to fund their businesses in the same fashion as a hedge fund , and that the government should avoid taking them over .
" Congress ought to be embarrassed " for years of delays in passing legislation aimed at strengthening regulation of the two companies , Snow , now chairman of New York - based buyout fund Cerberus Capital Management LP , said in a telephone interview .
He said he suggested when in office that " the business model they were using was really the model of a hedge fund . "
The government - chartered companies , which grew to account for almost half of the $ 12 trillion in U.S. mortgages , were able to borrow at cheap rates because of an implicit federal guarantee , Snow said .
His opposition to a full government takeover echoes the signal sent today by his successor , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
" Congress ought to be embarrassed "

Operation " Rescue Fannie " Underway
US TREASURY secretary Hank Paulson is working on plans to inject up to $ 15 billion ( £ 7.5 billion ) of capital into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to stem the crisis at America ’s biggest mortgage firms .
Under the terms of the proposed move , the US government would receive a new class of shares in exchange for the capital , which would be hugely dilutive to shareholders .
The potential rescue comes as investors are braced for more bad news from the financial sector .
Citigroup is expected to reveal further writedowns of at least $ 8 billion with its second - quarter results , and Merrill Lynch is forecast to reveal writedowns of some $ 4 billion .
Both banks are expected to post sizeable losses for the second quarter , and reveal plans to sell off billions of pounds worth of assets .
The capital injection would also see both lenders granted permission to use the Federal Reserve ’s discount window - a short - term emergency funding source .
Freddie Mac has a $ 3 billion short - term funding line that comes up for renewal tomorrow .
The short - term debt is one of the hundreds of funding lines that the two agencies use .
Discount Window Pops Up Again
Freddie Mac's Next Hurdle : Raise Cash
Treasury Department officials were working the telephones yesterday to make sure that Freddie Mac , one of the nation 's two troubled mortgage giants , will be able to sell $ 3 billion of its securities tomorrow in a previously scheduled sale that has now become a crucial test of investor confidence .
should
It would be only the latest in a series of unusual interventions .
In March , the Fed extended a $ 30 billion credit line to orchestrate JP Morgan Chase 's purchase of troubled investment bank Bear Stearns .
The Fed then let other investment banks borrow directly from the Fed at favorable rates .
And Friday the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized control of California - based IndyMac Bank with plans to liquidate its assets at a cost that could wipe out more than 10 percent of the FDIC 's funds .
" Someday this capitalistic economy , or what we used to call the capitalistic system , needs to get back on track and that means failure , " said Lee Hoskins , former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland .
" You can't have risk - taking without failure . "
To What Extent Did Paulson Lie ?
" Keeping Fannie and Freddie in Current Form "
" There will be no nationalization of Fannie and Freddie "
" A government takeover will not be necessary "
Paulson Is The Great Pretender
Bill Gross Triples Bet On Mortgages
Bill Gross , whose Pimco Total Return fund ( PTTRX ) is the world 's largest bond mutual fund , has tripled his bet on mortgage debt , which now comprises about 61 percent of the fund 's assets , the Financial Times said on Friday .
The chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management
Co said his decision to raise exposure in recent months stemmed from the U.S. government 's implicit guarantee of debt issued by Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE ) , the government - sponsored mortgage financiers .
" Government policy is moving to sanctify the status of the government - sponsored agencies , " Gross said , according to the newspaper .
" It became a question of which institutions would be sheltered by the government umbrella . "
Paulson Is A Blatant Liar
For market discipline to be effective , market participants must not expect that lending from the Fed , or any other government support , is readily available , " Paulson said .
" For market discipline to effectively constrain risk , financial institutions must be allowed to fail . "
Addendum
The Mystery Voice of the Spelling Bee Jacques Bailly , the spelling bee pronouncer , is a former bee winner himself .
May 30 , 2008  --
For Jacques Bailly , the official word pronouncer at the 2008 Scripps National Spelling Bee , enunciating is n't the hardest part of his job .
He can pronounce the most difficult words without hesitation – from " appoggiatura " to " autochthonous " to " prospicience " — but Bailly says witnessing the eyes of unsuccessful spellers fill with tears is n't easy .
" Watching the spellers miss a word is so hard , " Bailly told ABCNEWS.com during a break in his pronouncing duties .
" Sometimes I feel like I 'm trying to give them something and they just are n't seeing it . "
Bailly , who won the spelling bee trophy in 1980 as an 14 - year - old after correctly spelling " elucubrate , " is permitted under bee rules to provide the definition of the word , its part of speech , its language of origin and any alternative pronunciations .
The pronouncer can even use the word in a sentence for the young – and sometimes perplexed – linguists .
But for many spellers blinded by the glare of the spotlight , these hints are for naught .
" There 's always one or two spellers who look like they know the word and then they miss it , " said Bailly , who wore a tie decorated with bumble bees for the first round of the competition Thursday .
" They just do n't listen up there . "
Bee Master Reflects on Buzz - Worthy Spellers
For Bailly , who will pronounce hundreds of words before this year 's champion is announced , it is the spellers who have some fun during their time on stage that make up for those who leave in tears .
" Some are really cute or really fun , " said Bailly , who added that he does n't pick favorites or root for one particular speller , though he does think some are more entertaining to watch than others .
One speller in the preliminary round of this year 's bee replied with an eager " howdy ! " when Bailly greeted her before asking her to spell .
Another pumped his fists in the air after he spelled his word correctly .
But Rebecca Sealfon , the 1997 bee champion , stands out in Bailly 's mind as one of the more entertaining contestants .
" She would shout every word she spelled , " said Bailly , who joked that Sealfon may have broken the microphone .
Loud or not , Sealfon eventually succeeded at spelling " euonym , " and grabbed a trophy .
And like many avid bee watchers , Bailly said that one of the most memorable bees was when 13 - year - old Akshay Buddiga fainted mid-word during the 2004 competition .
" His knees locked and his eyes got really wide , " remembered Bailly .
" And he just fell over . "
" But the best part was when he just got right back up and got the word , " said Bailly .
Buddiga spelled " alopecoid " correctly and was one of the top finishers .
Despite his extensive bee experience – he's been the head pronouncer for six years and was the associate pronouncer for 12 years before that – Bailly says he still can't predict whether a speller is going to do well or not .
" You never know if they 've developed a poker face or not , " said Bailly , who added that he has n't seen many kids " hamming it up " yet this year .
" I have my suspicions , though . "
And despite what one might assume about aggressive stage parents eager to see their spellers succeed , Bailly said he 's never had any negative experiences .
Bailly said that even though he has the word lists months in advance of the bee , he 's never been bribed by a speller or parents .
" But I do have a paper shredder at home , " he added .
And how does Bailly – who 's an associate professor of classics at the University of Vermont during the off - season — always get the words ' pronunciation right ?
" I practice , " he says .
We 'd been getting pretty used to getting an Xbox 360 Dashboard updates every other season or so , but it looks like it 's going to be a barren spring : there 's no update coming this spring , according to Xbox Live manager Marc Whitten .
In an interview with Next Generation , Whitten said that Redmond 's focusing resources on " building the proper infrastructure and scale for the service " -- which hopefully means those Live outages will soon be a thing of the past .
Whitten also said that the Live team is working on a Live DRM update that 'll allow XBLA games to be re-licensed and played offline if you swap consoles , and that underperforming XBLA titles with Metacritic scores under 65 percent will be eligible for delisting .

Violent crime in Los Angeles dropped 7.2 % during the first half of 2008 compared to the same period last year -- with the exception of homicides , which rose 4.3 % , newly released crime statistics show .
Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Police Chief William J. Bratton credited the drop in violent crime , including rape , robbery and assaults , to the city ’s aggressive campaign to hire more police officers , the crackdown on street gangs and the increase in anti-gang and youth programs .
At a news conference Wednesday morning at the Barrio Action Constituent Center in Los Angeles , Bratton blamed the increase in homicides on a rash of multiple killings earlier in the year .
However , he said he expected homicides to be down by year ’s end , nudged by the drop in overall gang - related and violent crime in the city .
The number of homicides also has declined significantly in the last few months , he said .

“ Last year we had a historic low , ” Bratton said .
“ It ’s trending in the right direction . ”
Overall , violent crime in the city has declined by nearly 50 % since 2002 , according to LAPD statistics , including a 38.9 % drop in homicides .

Whale evolution :
The blowhole March 18 , 2008 22:48 MST
The evolution of the blowhole in whales , which according to the fossil evidence moved from the tip to the vertex of the head , has caused some concerns amongst our creationist readers who wonder how such a feat could have taken place .
From Milan Klima , Development of the Cetacean Nasal Skull 1999 Springer
The fact that the cetacean nose moved , in the course of evolution , from the tip of the rostrum up to the vertex of the head , is among the most perfect of adaptations to aquatic life .
In this and many other special adaptations of their morphology and physiology , cetaceans surpass most primarily aquatic animals even though they themselves have developed from land mammals that breathe with lungs , and have only secondarily conquered the aquatic environment .
To a certain extent , cetaceans can be considered to be the most successful group of aquatic animals of all time .
Conclusive paleontological evidence shows the way in which the nasal openings were moved in the course of phylogeny ( see Kellogg 1928 ; Slijper 1962 ; Gaskin 1976 ; Oelschlager 1978 , 1987 , 1990 ; Moore 1981 ) .
That this evolutionary process is repeated in a way during ontogeny became obvious through external observations on embryos and fetuses ( Kukenthal 1893 ) .
At the earliest embryonic stages the nasal openings are still situated at the rostra tip like those of land mammals ; they are gradually shifted more and more towards the vertex of the head at the older stages .
At the same time , a long rost rum with narrow jaws develops .
Until recently , practically nothing was known about the morphogenetic processes concealed in this metamorphosis , about what cranial structures take part in it , and about the exact way in which the cetacean skull becomes transformed during embryogeny .
From Digital Library of Dolphin Development coordinated and spearheaded by the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine we find the following images :
Embryo LACM 94594 Fetus LACM 94670 Fetus LACM 94607
In most mammals , the nose opening is located near the tip of the snout .
In modern dolphins , on the other hand , it is located on the top of the head , above the eyes .
It is called the blowhole .
In development , the nose opening shifts from the tip of the snout ( arrow in left embryo ) to its position on top of the head .
Ancestral whales also have their nose opening near the tip of the snout , and the shift to the forehead is documented evolutionarily by fossils .
Edward Babinski has some good pages
Nasal Drift in Early Whales
Whales breathed with more ease when they no longer had to lift a snout above water .
The nostrils migrated upward toward the top of their head , as ancient whales spent more time immersed in the water .
Blowholes help to distinguish modern forms of whales .
While toothed whales generally have one hole , baleens are split into two .
Fig 1 . Pakicetus Fig 2 .
Rodhocetus nostrils were higher on the skull , intermediate between its ancestors and modern whales .

A modern gray whale can emerge from the water , inhale and resubmerge without stopping or tilting its snout to breathe .

Creationists have moved the goal posts to other questions which I will attempt to address as an addition to my original posting since they require graphics and comments do not allow for pictures to be included .
Countercurrent heat exchange
The fins of dolphins and whales have a circulatory system which works as a heat exchanger .
When blood moves to the outer extremities , the blood is cooled due to heat exchange with the cold environment , however , when the blood returns , it flows close to the warm incoming blood flow and exchanges heat , causing the return blood to be warmed up .
Counter current heat exchange evidence is also found for the tongue and the testes of dolphins .
In the latter case , the heat exchange is used to reduce the temperature of the testes .

As postmaster , did [ Abraham Lincoln ] really carry letters around in his hat ?
My children have a book that says he did .
It ’s right .
There was no home delivery of mail in the 1830s , so Lincoln ’s job as postmaster was a sinecure that allowed him to sit around the post office and read other people ’s newspapers before they picked them up , which helped him expand his knowledge of national affairs .
Although it was not his job to deliver the mail , he made it a point to do so ( taking the letters in his hat ) if he happened to be traveling to some distant part of Sangamon County , saving someone a long walk to town .
While Lincoln was not responsible for carrying the mail , as the postal service is today , he also did not have the modern luxury orf Sundays off .
In 1810 Congress passed a law requiring post offices to be open for mail pickup at least one hour every day , including Sundays .
For the next two decades a political controversy raged over whether the government should recognize the Christian Sabbath by prohibiting Sunday mail .
Curiously , it was evangelical Baptists who led the opposition to the Sabbatarian movement .
A massive religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening , beginning around 1800 , had catapulted the Baptists and Methodists to numerical supremacy among American Protestants , overtaking more traditional sects like the Congregationalists and Episcopalians , but the older groups still held political power .
In Connecticut , for example , Congregationalism remained the official state religion until 1818 .
Such lingering connections between traditional churches and the state made members of the newer evangelical denominations deeply suspicious of any government action involving religion , even something as apparently innocuous as banning Sunday mail .
What did Lincoln think about this ?
What was his religion ?
In his New Salem days , Lincoln did n’t leave many clues about his views on Sabbatarianism , or on religion in general .
His father had been a member of the Little Pigeon Creek Baptist church , and Lincoln must have been exposed to doctrines like predestination at an early age , but he never joined the Baptist church .
New Salem had many believers , but no churches , so Lincoln ’s failure to belong was not obvious .
We know that it was at this time in his life that Lincoln read Thomas Paine ’s Age of Reason , and probably the works of Voltaire and other Enlightenment skeptics .
By the time he moved to Springfield in 1837 , he had begun to develop his unique world view , a mixture of skepticism and providential fatalism that would continue to mature and evolve throughout his life .
Was n’t he secretly baptized when he was older ?
No , nor was he planning to convert to ( fill in the church of your choice ) on Easter Sunday , 1865 , only to be tragically murdered on the preceding Good Friday .
The answers to questions about Lincoln ’s church membership are not the ones that most people are hoping to hear .
He was never a member of the church you attend , or any church .
His religious beliefs were dynamic , complex , and powerful , but not conventional .
He was n’t a Baptist , despite being raised in a Baptist tradition .
He was n’t a Presbyterian , although he attended Presbyterian services much of his adult life .
He was not a Catholic , contrary to rumors started by the ravings of Reverend Charles Chiniquy , who published a bizarre diatribe called Fifty Years in the Church of Rome ( 1886 ) , which accused Catholics of claiming that Lincoln had been born into their Church .
According to Mrs. Lincoln , who ought to have known , he was not even a Christian .
Many stories have circulated about Lincoln being secretly baptized , or planning to be , but they are all unsubstantiated .
And yet , Abraham Lincoln was in many ways the most deeply spiritual person ever to occupy the White House .
In the same 1866 interview with William Herndon where Mary said that her husband “ was not a technical Christian , ” whatever that might mean , she also said that “ he was a religious man always ” who “ had a Kind of Poetry in his Nature . ”
Certainly no one who reads the Second Inaugural Address , Lincoln ’s profound meditation on God ’s role in earthly events and the proper response thereto , can doubt this .
For most of the 20th century , historians tended to respond with dismayed contempt to the public ’s desire for a conventionally religious Lincoln .
They argued that Lincoln ’s real faith was his almost mystical devotion to the Union , and harked back to one of Lincoln ’s earliest speeches , in which he called for Americans to make a “ civil religion ” out of “ obedience to the laws . ”
Lincoln ’s many Biblical references in his speeches and writings were treated as metaphor or rhetorical embellishment .
Not until the late 1990s , particularly after the publication of Allen Guelzo ’s Redeemer President in 1999 , did it become fashionable for historians to treat Lincoln ’s religious and philosophical views with the same serious attention they had long devoted to his politics .
If Lincoln was n’t a Christian , why are his speeches full of talk about God ?
Because he believed in God , or Providence , or some kind of supernatural power beyond this earth that controlled the fates of people and nations .
He sometimes quoted Shakespeare ’s line , “ There ’s a divinity that shapes our ends , / Rough - hew them how we will , ” which must have appealed to the former axeman in him .
As a child , he absorbed a stern Calvinism from Baptist preachers who emphasized the power of an omnipotent God , the kind of deity who notes the fall of every sparrow .
As an adult , he must have spoken of his religious beliefs to his law partner William Herndon often enough to pique Herndon ’s curiosity , but not fully enough to satisfy it , as evidenced by Herndon ’s inclusion of questions about religion in almost all of his interviews with Lincoln ’s New Salem acquaintances .
Lincoln ’s ideas , whatever they were , were not easy to grasp .
While he accepted the notion of providence , and referred to it often , he rarely spoke publicly of Jesus Christ .
In New Salem Lincoln associated with freethinkers who doubted the divinity of Jesus , and he wrote an essay mocking the idea that Jesus was the son of God.
Lincoln ’s friends , anxious to protect his budding political career , threw the manuscript into the fire .
As he matured , Lincoln learned to be more careful about expressing his views on religion .
He must have said enough , however , to develop a reputation as an infidel .
In 1846 , when he ran for Congress against a well known Methodist preacher named Peter Cartwright , he found himself on the defensive against Cartwright ’s charges that he was not a believer .
Lincoln responded with a public statement that would remain the longest explanation of his religious beliefs he would ever write .
“ I have never spoken with intentional disrespect of religion in general , or of any denomination of Christians in particular , ” Lincoln wrote , in carefully measured words that reflect the tone of more recent political denials .
Although strictly true , Lincoln left open the possibility that he had spoken with unintentional disrespect .
In the next paragraph he agreed with his readers that it would be wrong for any candidate to scoff openly at religion , and stated that he himself would not vote for such a person , because “ I still do not think any man has the right thus to insult the feelings , and injure the morals , of the community in which he may live . ”
Lincoln again managed to have it both ways : he shared his audience ’s disapproval of “ infidels , ” but only those who scoff “ openly ” and thereby insult the majority ’s feelings .
He did n’t say that he belonged to the majority , and tacitly reserved the possibility that he scoffed at religion , just not openly .
Over time , Lincoln ’s interest in religion grew .
The death of his son Eddie in 1850 gave him cause to ponder the brevity and meaning of life on earth , and of course the casualties of the Civil War forced him to confront the issue every day .
By the time he came to write the Second Inaugural Address in 1865 , with its mature theological contemplation of the inscrutability and justice of the Almighty , he had gone far beyond the easy skepticism of his youth .
This religious conversion he went through — did n’t this happen at Gettysburg ?
No , it was n’t a “ conversion ” and it did n’t happen in any one place .
There is no evidence that he ever underwent a conversion experience , but the historical record does give us glimpses of Lincoln gradually developing a more personal relationship with God .
For example , in the late summer of 1862 Lincoln was ready to issue the Emancipation Proclamation , but was waiting for the military situation to improve before doing so .
When he met with his cabinet on September 22 , a few days after Lee ’s first invasion of the North was halted at the battle of Antietam , Lincoln told his advisers that the time was right , not just in strategic terms , but as a matter of keeping a divine covenant .
He had made a promise “ to his Maker , ” he explained , that he would issue the Proclamation if the rebel army were driven out of Maryland , and now he was keeping his promise .
He acknowledged that “ It might be thought strange ” to make the decision on this basis , but “ God had decided this question in favor of the slaves . ”
Two years later , Lincoln ’s old friend Joshua Speed paid a visit to Washington .
In a lecture he gave after the war , Speed claimed that he came upon Lincoln reading the Bible , and gently mocked him for it , asking if Lincoln had recovered from his youthful skepticism .
Lincoln , according to Speed , said that he had and urged Speed to do the same .
Indicating the Bible , Lincoln told Speed that he should “ take all of this Book upon reason that you can , and the balance on faith , and you will live and die a happier man . ”
These two stories reveal Lincoln ’s greater willingness to accept some of the ideas and sources of traditional Christianity , but they fall far short of implying any kind of conversion experience .
In the former , Lincoln referred to his “ Maker , ” not to Jesus Christ personally , much as he did in all of his religious writings .
Lincoln ’s God was his Maker , the Old Testament God , the Almighty , a single all - powerful Providence , rather than the triune Christian God who offers salvation specifically through the medium of a personal relationship with His only Son .
When Lincoln recommended the Bible to Speed ( assuming the story is accurate ) , he did not say that he believed everything in it , nor that he considered belief necessary for salvation .
His endorsement instead conveys the impression that he regarded it as a sort of self - help book that might be in part beyond the bounds of reason , but ought to be taken on faith anyway in order to “ live and die a happier man . ”
The utility of Lincoln ’s Bible ends with death ; it ’s not a ticket to the afterlife .
In this , as in most of his religious and philosophical thought , Lincoln showed no evidence of undergoing a conversion to conventional Christianity .

BONUS Q & A , JUST FOR CHANGE OF SUBJECT READERS
How often did Lincoln attend church ?
Looking at " Lincoln Day by Day " for the years of Lincoln presidency , there are references to church attendance on these days :
1861 - March 10 , March 17 , April 14 , May 19 , July 21 , July 28 , August 25 , October 13 , December 22 .
1862 - November 30
1863 - January 4 , January 18 , August 6 ( a Thursday )
1864 - none
1865 - March 5
" Day by Day " is not an exhaustive reference , and does not necessarily include references to every instance of Lincoln 's attendance at services .
The list does seem to indicate that he attended irregularly , more than merely on holidays in 1861 , but less than that as the war went on ..... Gerald Prokopowicz

BELGRADE , Serbia 
Long one of the most - wanted fugitives in the world , Radovan Karadzic , the Bosnian Serb leader blamed for inciting his followers to join him in a brutal ethnic war , was en route to The Hague early Wednesday , according to the Serbian war crimes prosecutor .
A motorcade carrying Mr. Karadzic to the airport left hours after stone - hurling nationalists clashed with the police in central Belgrade at a rally to protest his arrest last week on war crimes charges , and his likely extradition to stand trial before an international war crimes tribunal in The Hague .
Mr. Karadzic was escorted by masked Serbian security officers and taken from the Belgrade war crimes court at roughly 3:45 a.m. , according to the prosecutor , Vladimir Vukcevic .
Soon after , his plane was in flight , and it landed in Rotterdam , not far from The Hague , about two hours later .
He is the highest - level politician from the former Yugoslavia to be transferred to the court since Slobodan Milosevic , the former Serbian president , who was arrested in 2001 and died in his cell there in 2006 while awaiting a verdict .
« L'allongement des droits voisins est l'ennemi de l'innovation » .
Derrière ce titre , un groupe d'experts indépendants européens a signé hier une lettre ouverte dans le Times dénonçant la directive , adoptée par la Commission Européenne prolongeant les droits des artistes - interprètes .
Le 16 juillet dernier , la Commission Européenne votait un amendement , proposé par le libéral britannique Charlie McGreevy , visant à repousser de 50 à 95 ans la durée des droits des artistes - interprètes ( chanteurs et musiciens ) et producteurs d’une œuvre , dit droits voisins .
Selon ce dernier , cela permettrait de « garantir un revenu décent » aux « parents pauvres » de l’industrie musicale .
Et selon le syndicat national de l’édition phonographique ( SNEP ) , cela aurait même comme « effet direct d’augmenter les revenus issus de l’exploitation de la musique enregistrée en Europe de 3 à 10 % » .
Des arguments peu convaincants pour les nombreux détracteurs de la proposition .
Dès mars , l’EFF ( Electronic Frontier Foundation ) lançait ainsi une pétition en ligne , intitulée Sound Copyright .
Cela n'a pas freiné McGreevy qui , épaulé les majors et organisations d’artistes - interprètes , a réitéré la semaine dernière ses propositions .
Provoquant dans la foulée , une nouvelle série de réactions .
Bien que la Commission ait estimé qu ' « une expertise externe n'est pas nécessaire » , « des expertises externes indépendantes existent » et «à l'unanimité , les centres européens de recherche sur la propriété intellectuelle se sont opposés à la proposition » expliquent les dix - sept signataires de la lettre , dont les français Pierre - Jean Benghozi , professeur au Centre de Recherche en Gestion à l'Ecole polytechnique et Christophe Geiger , directeur du Centre d’Etudes Internationales de la Propriété Industrielle ( CEIPI ) .
Citant trois études réalisées entre 2006 et 2008 , ils expliquent : « la vérité est que l'extension des droits voisins bénéficie surtout à ceux qui détiennent déjà les droits , aux détenteurs de grands catalogues , qu'il s'agisse des maisons de disque , des vieilles stars du rock ou , de plus en plus , leur succession . »
Par ailleurs , ils soulignent que si cette mesure doit servir à rémunérer les artistes - interprètes vivants , elle devrait être calé sur la vie de l'auteur , et non fixée à 95 ans .
Dans une tribune dans le Telegraph , Dave Rowntree , le batteur de Blur a également dénoncé ces mesures .
Il estime qu'elles renforcent le déséquilibre entre les consommateurs et les créateurs , déjà entamé par le système du droit d'auteur actuel .
« L'argent que vont toucher Cliff Richard et ses copains vient directement de la poche des consommateurs .
Une fois encore , l'industrie de la musique semble réussir à faire payer les gens pour quelque - chose qu'ils ont déjà . »

So Chief Judge Victor Tobin announced Friday that Chief Criminal Judge Ana Gardiner was being moved ( at her own request , of course ) out of her position to become a judge in the civil division .
This comes a month after my story on Gardiner 's improper relationships with lawyers who appear before her was published -- and a couple weeks after one of the lawyers named , veteran homicide prosecutor Howard Scheinberg , announced he was leaving the State Attorney 's Office .
So the fallout continues .
I would link the story in the Sun- Sentinel -- which claims to cover the courthouse -- on the saga , but , uh , there is n't one .
Note to the Sentinel : Just because you ignore something does n't mean it will go away .
( I do n't expect it from the rapidly contracting Miami Herald , which really does n't cover the courthouse anymore on any sustained level ) .
There was a story today in the Daily Business Review on the move , but it failed to mention the elephant in the room , proving again that that newspaper , which once was damn good , is in steady decline .
I 'd link it , but there 's no link .
JAABlog , also known as the courthouse hearth , reprinted some of it , so you can go here to see it .
For more reaction on " the blog , " as many lawyers simply call it , click here .
Here 's a line from the DBR story : " Gardiner takes over for retiring Judge Barry Goldstein in civil court . "
Now here 's where it really gets , well , hilarious .
Click here and look at the name of the defendant and then check out the judge on the case .

The military uses " Do n't ask , Don't tell " as a policy on homosexuality because " they can't handle the truth , " The Daily Show 's Jon Stewart cracked wise on Monday night
" So , with the military desperate for more troops , the House Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee waded headlong into the ' Do n't ask , Do n't tell ' debate , and if you 'd forgotten just what the argument of gays in the military sounds like ... Enjoy , " said Stewart .
Stewart 's show switched to a clip taken from a CSpan 3 broadcast , containing the testimony of Sgt. Maj .
Brian Jones , a former Army special ops soldier , stating :
" I performed long range patrols in severe cold weather conditions .
The only way to keep from freezing at night was to get as close as possible for body heat , which means skin to skin .
There can't be any arousal . "
Stewart , looking confused , dryly remarked , " If night time patrol gives you a hard - on , I think you 've got bigger problems than being gay . "
Next to testify was Elaine Donnelly with the Center for Military Readiness .
" I 'd like to talk about what would happen if you actually repealed this law , " she said .
" The result would be devestating , because the military does n't do things half - way . "
" The military would go ALL gay ! " yelled Stewart , waiving his hands .

Night Shinings

Explanation :
In the early morning hours of June 30th , ghostly clouds hovered in the east in this view of near dawn skies over western France .
The noctilucent or night - shining clouds lie near the edge of space , reflecting sunlight from about 80 kilometers above Earth 's surface .
Usually spotted above the poles in summer , they are now seen with increasing frequency farther from the poles , in this case extending to the photographer 's latitude of about 48 degrees north .
The trend could be a telltale sign of global changes in the atmosphere .
Another 400,000 kilometers away , the Moon 's sunlit crescent shines brightly , its night side illuminated by Earthshine .
Of course , as a bonus for early risers June 's old crescent Moon was followed closely across the sky by the lovely Pleiades star cluster , surrounded by cosmic dust clouds and shining from a mere 400 light - years away .
Spiegel Online published a story last week about how a group of Europeans have formed the Trans - Mediterranean Renewable Energy Corporation ( TREC ) to develop enough solar - thermal power in the Sahara to power all of Europe .
The idea is to build enough solar thermal power plants , plants that use concentrated solar energy to heat salts or boil water which then turn turbines to generate electricity , and then to transmit that energy across the Mediterranean to be used in Europe .
Europe gets all the electricity it needs and North Africa gets a massive influx of development money and energy for desalinization plants , among other things .
Source : TREC , via Spiegel Online Source : TREC , via Spiegel Online
The image at right shows why TREC believes this is a good idea .
The big red box is , to scale , the area of the Sahara that would have to be covered with solar thermal plants to electrify the entire planet currently .
The smaller box is just the current EU member states , and the red dot is Germany alone .
And solar thermal technology is arguably the most mature solar power technology there is , so the technology risk is pretty low .
After all , there have been solar thermal plants operating in the U.S. since the 1980s – they never took off because coal is so cheap .
There are really only two technical problems – storing excess energy from the day so that the plants can generate electricity all night , and electrical transmission from North Africa to Europe .
The first problem has already been solved , and the solution has been well known for some time .
If you use a salt with a very high melting temperature as the primary heat carrier instead of water , you can use large tanks of liquid salt to store that heat overnight .
The hot salt is pulled out of the tank gradually and used to boil the water that ultimately turns the steam turbines and generates electricity .
Make the tanks big enough , and this system will be able to keep up with the requirements of the European grid overnight without too much difficulty .
And Desertec , as the TREC project is named , has estimated the cost at about 350 billion euros ( ~$ 545 billion ) for the solar thermal plants , complete with salt tanks .
Transmission across the Mediterranean , however , is a little trickier .
Alternating current ( AC ) is great for short and intermediate distance electricity transmission because you can use transformers to step the voltage up , the current down , and reduce losses on the transmission lines that way .
However , really long transmission lines need direct current ( DC ) instead , since the losses in AC transmission lines go WAY up as the length of the transmission line gets really long due to limitations on the maximum line voltage and losses from the transmission line to the ground ( among others ) .
The problem with high - voltage DC transmission is that you have to convert AC to DC and then back again , and that adds cost and complexity to the power grid .
On the other hand , you can dramatically increase the voltages , and thus reduce the losses , because some of the effects that plague AC transmission ( corona discharge and capacitance ) simply do n’t occur in DC transmission .
But with all grand ideas , Desertec has the perennial non-technical problem – political will :
Too many questions remain unanswered .
Who will pay for the electricity network ?
Who would own it ?
Could the various stakeholders agree on a collective guaranteed price for solar thermal electricity fed into the grid ?
The latter issue is especially important for investors and industry .
Wolfgang Knothe , a board member of MAN Ferrostaal , an industrial services provider , says : “ We need political security to get going . ”
A lack of money is not the problem .
“ Renewable energy is in , ” says Nikolai Ulrich of HSH Nordbank .
“ It is relatively easy at the moment to get investment for renewable energy projects . ”
Desertec is still only a vision .
But visions are needed , says Knothe : “ Without Kennedy ’s dream , there would n’t have been a moon landing . ”
Then , the will to make the vision reality existed , although the technology did not .
With Desertec , it is exactly the reverse :
The technology is available — but the will is missing .

Most people love the idea of being free of the power grid .
Photovoltaic ( PV ) cells on residential or commercial roofs would be great , but even in regions where the costs of installation are low , PV electricity is still too expensive for most homeowners .
This is especially true given the many years it takes to recoup the costs of installing solar on a home and our highly mobile society .
Why would anyone choose to spend tens of thousands of dollars on aPV system that takes 20 years to recover the investment if they can reasonably expect to be out of the home in less than 10 ?
Well , a story in Mother Jones last week discusses this exact problem , and what Cicso DeVries of Berkeley , California came up with to solve the problem :
What if , he asked , the city financed residents ’ solar rooftops , then levied a 20 - year tax assessment on their properties to pay for it ?
The debt would follow the home , not the owner , and in one fell swoop , the two greatest impediments to home solar would be history .
The cost in Berkeley is expected to be more than $ 65 per month , but even so it still strikes me as a win for everyone .
And according to the article , many other cities and towns around the country are considering their own versions of the same plan .
I wonder how long it ’ll be before my hometown gets wise to this idea .
Maybe I should email them about it ….

I used to be a quasi-vegetarian – ova -lacto plus fish , with the occasional foray into Thanksgiving turkey or a hard - core pork green chili craving I gave in to .
When my mother discovered my new food preferences , she was kind enough to give me a book called Diet for a Small Planet , wherein I discovered the idea of eating grains and plants because it was more efficient than feeding livestock and then eating the meat .
The basic mathematics of this particular reality has been known since at least the 70’s – cattle take a LOT of feed to get them to maturity and sized for slaughter , and that same amount of feed could be used to feed a LOT more people than the equivalent amount of meat from the cattle can .
Now a new study reported in Science News has confirmed yet again that eating red meat is n’t good for you , albeit indirectly :
For the average U.S. consumer , getting the equivalent of one - seventh of a weekâ€™s calories from chicken , fish or vegetables instead of red meat or dairy will do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than buying all local , all the time , the researchers say .
Crunching the numbers revealed that delivery to the consumer accounts for only 1 percent of red meatâ € “ associated emissions .
But the production path to red meat and dairy products is clouded with nitrous oxide and methane emissions , mainly from fertilizer use , manure management and animal digestion .
I guess it ’s time to add “ drives global heating ” to the legion reasons why you should n’t eat red meat .
If only we knew this back in the 70 ’s …oh , we did , just not quantitatively .
Never mind ….

Last week , the New York Times reported that several German scientists are , for the first time , attempting to apply climate modeling to predict overall climate changes for a region over the next decade .
What makes this unusual is that the climate models in use today for long - term forecasts are n’t accurate enough on the scale of a decade to make significant predictions – the German model is a first attempt at changing this .
According to the NYTimes , the model successfully predicted , with rough accuracy , the climate of the 1990s when it was given the 1970s and 1980s as inputs .
But the predictions were only roughly accurate for North America and Europe – Africa ’s climate was significantly different in the models than it was in reality .
Given that most disciplines have modeling systems and equations that apply very well over some scales but not others , this is a limitation to thegerman models , but is likely not a fatal flaw , at least so long as the models are used and interpreted correctly .
Most interesting , however , is the fact that the models predict that Europe and North America will be slightly cooler over the next decade as a result of shifting oceanic currents in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans .
But lest we wrongly assume that a localized cooling trend over two continents equates to a reversal in global heating , I ’d like to quote for you Dr. Kevin Trenberth of NCAR , from the end of the NYTimes story :
“ Too many think global warming means monotonic relentless warming everywhere year after year … .
It does not happen that way . ”

Anyone who supports nuclear power has to do so with their eyes open .
And that means acknowledging that nuclear wastes are a problem , that there wo n’t be enough nuclear fuel to go around without breeder reactors and the likely non-proliferation issues they bring up , and that some countries ( the U.S. and Russia , for example ) have done really stupid things with their nuclear programs and could stand to learn many things from other countries that have good nuclear programs ( France and Japan , for example ) .
But very nuclear energy supporters know anything about mining – if they think about it at all , they figure that the carbon emissions of mining coal roughly offset the emissions of mining for uranium .
A new Australian study reported on by the BBC questions this assumption .
The problem is fundamentally one of ore quality , and it ’s fundamental to mining in general – the greater the demand for the mined material , the faster the cheaply and easily extracted sources of that material are depleted .
And when all the easily - extracted ores are gone , it takes more energy , time , and money to extract progressively lower quality ores .
The study , published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology , is claimed by “ experts ” for the BBC as “ the first such report to draw together such detailed information on the environmental costs incurred at this point in the nuclear energy chain . ”
And while the problems all relate to uranium ore extraction , much of the additional emissions occur as secondary effects – transportation of the ore by truck or train from the mine to the refinery , additional energy required to extract lower concentration uranium from the ore , and so on .
That being said , however , the BBC also quotes a representative of the Nuclear Energy Agency , Thierry Dujardin , as pointing out one very important fact – even at its worst , nuclear energy ’s carbon emissions are still lower than fossil fuels .

When playing ball with a dog , we call it " Fetch " .
When playing ball with a young child , we call it " Catch " .
Both seem to be the same activity , but saying " Catch " to a dog seems wrong , and saying " Fetch " to a young child seems mildly offensive .

GOP cyber - security expert suggests Diebold tampered with 2002 election Larisa Alexandrovna and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday July 18 , 2008
Print This Email This A leading cyber - security expert and former adviser to Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) says he has fresh evidence regarding election fraud on Diebold electronic voting machines during the 2002 Georgia gubernatorial and senatorial elections .
Stephen Spoonamore is the founder and until recently the CEO of Cybrinth LLC , an information technology policy and security firm that serves Fortune 100 companies .
At a little noticed press conference in Columbus , Ohio Thursday , he discussed his investigation of a computer patch that was applied to Diebold Election Systems voting machines in Georgia right before that state 's November 2002 election .
Spoonamore is one of the most prominent cyber - security experts in the country .
He has appeared on CNN's Lou Dobbs and ABC's World News Tonight , and has security clearances from his work with the intelligence community and other government agencies , as well as the Department of Defense , and is one of the worlds leading authorities on hacking and cyber-espionage .
In 1995 , Spoonamore received a civilian citation for his work with the Department of Defense .
He was again recognized for his contributions in 2004 by the Department of Homeland Security .
Spoonamore is also a registered Republican and until recently was advising the McCain campaign .
Spoonamore received the Diebold patch from a whistleblower close to the office of Cathy Cox , Georgias then - Secretary of State .
In discussions with RAW STORY , the whistleblower -- who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation -- said that he became suspicious of Diebold 's actions in Georgia for two reasons .
The first red flag went up when the computer patch was installed in person by Diebold CEO Bob Urosevich , who flew in from Texas and applied it in just two counties , DeKalb and Fulton , both Democratic strongholds .
The source states that Cox was not privy to these changes until after the election and that she became particularly concerned over the patch being installed in just those two counties .
The whistleblower said another flag went up when it became apparent that the patch installed by Urosevich had failed to fix a problem with the computer clock , which employees from Diebold and the Georgia Secretary of States office had been told the patch was designed specifically to address .
Some critics of electronic voting raised questions about the 2002 Georgia race even at the time .
Incumbent Democratic Sen. Max Cleland , who was five percentage points ahead of Republican challenger Saxby Chambliss in polls taken a week before the vote , lost 53 % to 46 % .
Incumbent Democratic Governor Roy Barnes , who led challenger Sonny Perdue in the polls by eleven points , lost 51 % to 46 % .
However , because the Diebold machines used throughout the state provided no paper trail , it was impossible to ask for a recount in either case .
Concerned by the electoral outcome , the whistleblower approached Spoonamore because of his qualifications and asked him to examine the Diebold patch .
McCain adviser reported patch to Justice Department The Ohio press conference was organized by Cliff Arnebeck and three other attorneys , who had filed a challenge to the results of that the 2004 presidential election in Ohio in December , 2004 .
That challenge was withdrawn , but in August 2006 Arnebeck filed a new case , King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v. Blackwell , alleging civil rights violations in the 2004 voting .
The case was stayed in 2007 .
On Thursday , Arnebeck filed a motion to remove the stay and allow fresh investigation .
Individuals close to Arnebeck 's office said Spoonamore confirmed that the patch included nothing to repair a clock problem .
Instead , he identified two parallel programs , both having the full software code and even the same audio instructions for the deaf .
Spoonamore said he could not understand the need for a second copy of the exact same program -- and without access to the machine for which the patch was designed , he could not learn more .
Instead , he said he took the evidence to the Cyber - Security Division of the Department of Justice and reported the series of events to authorities .
The Justice Department has not yet acted on his report .
Allegations surrounding Ohio in 2004
At the Ohio press conference yesterday , the former McCain adviser said Michael Connell , of the Republican Internet development firm New Media Communications , had designed a system that made possible the real - time " tuning " of election tabulators once Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell had outsourced the hosting of vote counting on the same server which hosted GOP campaign IT systems .
He said he did n't believe Connell was behind the alleged fraud , but that he should be considered a key witness .
Spoonamore also confirmed he 's working with Connell on overseas election issues and that Connell is now working as John McCain 's IT developer .
Connell has a long history with the Republican Party 's IT infrastructure .
In 2001 , for example , he set up MajorityWhip.gov for then House Majority Whip Tom DeLay .
He also helped built georgewbush.com , as well as the Ohio GOP site Spoonamore referenced .
Sources close to Spoonamore said he was very concerned that he would lose his contracts as a result of coming forward and would take a " large financial hit . "
These sources added that , despite his concerns , Spoonamore felt obligated to reveal what he knows to the public .
" He felt he had no choice as an American citizen but to come forward , and he also knows the likely consequences of him doing so , " one source said .
An audio file of the press conference is available here .

A year and a half ago , Scott Eiswert , a specialist in the Tennessee Army National Guard , returned from Iraq , only to face an escalating battle with post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
When he learned that his unit would deploy again soon , he felt he could no longer stave off the pain .
On May 16 , his wife Tracy and his three daughters discovered his body after he shot himself in the family ’s home .
Pfc. Jason Scheuerman left a note nailed to his barracks closet in Iraq .
“ Maybe finally I can get some peace , ” wrote the 20 - year - old man .
Then he stepped inside the closet and shot himself .
His parents only found out about the note after a yearlong fight to cut through military red tape and discover what happened to their son .
Scott and Jason are just two of the thousands of military personnel whose service in Iraq and Afghanistan plunged them into a place so dark that they took their own lives .
In fact , the number of suicides among veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan now likely exceeds the number of troops killed in combat .
Nearly one in five soldiers deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan–about 300,000 –report symptoms of PTSD or major depression upon returning home , but only about half seek treatment , according to a Rand Corporation study released in April .
Based on known suicide rates for similar patients , “ It ’s quite possible that the suicides and psychiatric mortality of this war could trump the combat deaths , ” according to National Institute of Mental Health director Thomas Insel , who is the government ’s top psychiatric researcher .
But even more appalling than the human toll these wars are claiming even after troops leave the battlefield is the military ’s shameless cover -up of the extent of the problem–and its effort to deny veterans the health care they deserve when they return .
The Pentagon officially reports that about 30,000 troops were seriously wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan .
But USA
Today found at least 20,000 cases of traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) not reported by the Pentagon when the newspaper conducted its own study and filed numerous requests for data under the Freedom of Information Act .
The Rand Corporation study found that 320,000 personnel may have experienced a TBI in Iraq or Afghanistan , but only 43 percent said they had ever been evaluated by a physician for the injury .
As for PTSD , the Pentagon officially acknowledges that 38,000 veterans have been diagnosed with it since 2003 –so if the Rand study of 300,000 soldiers with PTSD is accurate , that means some 260,000 have either not sought treatment , not been diagnosed or simply are n’t being counted by the military .
This is n’t surprising , given the culture of denial that pervades the military and veterans health care system .
In April , for example , an e-mail surfaced from Ira Katz , deputy chief patient care services officer for mental health at the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) , acknowledging that 1,000 veterans under VA care attempt suicide every month .
On average , 18 veterans commit suicide in the U.S. every day , and four of those are veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
“ Shh ! ” begins the e-mail from Katz .
“ Is this something we should ( carefully ) address ourselves in some sort of release before someone stumbles on it ? ”
Another troubling e-mail from a VA official came to light in May .
Norma Perez , a leading psychologist at a facility for veterans in Texas , wrote to staff members in March directing them to diagnose PTSD less frequently because PTSD patients can receive government disability payments for their condition .
“ Given that we are having more and more compensation - seeking veterans , I ’d like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out , ” wrote Perez in the message to mental - health specialists and social workers .
Instead , she continued , “ consider a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder . ”
A diagnosis of adjustment disorder is considered less severe and is n’t typically compensated like PTSD , for which veterans are eligible for disability payments of up to $ 2,527 a month , depending on the severity of their condition .
“ It is outrageous that the VA is calling on its employees to deliberately misdiagnose returning veterans in an effort to cut costs , ” said Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , which released the memo to the media .
“ Those who have risked their lives serving our country deserve far better . ”
Scott Eiswert had stopped going to the VA for PTSD treatment before his suicide , and the disregard for vets under its care was one reason why , according to Stacy Hafley , an advocate for military families who is helping the Eiswert family get back on its feet .
“ He did n’t feel like it was helping , ” said Hafley in an interview .
“ He thought they were leaning toward saying that his issues were ‘ family problems , ’ and not PTSD .
So he stopped going , which is fairly common and symptomatic of PTSD .
“ I ’ve heard it so many times , and my husband , who also suffers from PTSD , did the same thing .
So many feel that the VA is either trying to overmedicate or understate the scope of the problem , and neither of those is particularly helpful .
They get frustrated , leave and do n’t come back . ”
Hafley underscored the chief problem facing an understaffed VA : “ The VA is trying to build a million - dollar home with a penny , and it ca n’t be done , ” she said .
The VA has an annual mental health budget of $ 3.8 billion , which U.S. officials contend is a substantial amount .
But the U.S. spends this much every 11 days to keep U.S. forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In late June , Bush signed a new supplemental war spending bill , approved by Democrats and Republicans in both houses of Congress .
The bill allocates an additional $ 162 billion of spending that will last into the middle of 2009 , well into the term of Bush ’s successor .
While the bill increases spending on GI education benefits , it contains nothing for expanding the budget for military health care .
“ The recent war funding bill was passed to go clear through the spring of 2009 , which was clearly a political ploy to not have to deal with war spending right before the election , given that both candidates are sitting senators , ” explained Hafley .
“ I feel like they are playing political games with the lives of our loved ones .
We should n’t be tolerating that .
This has been going on for years .
These are n’t new problems .
These are the same problems that Vietnam vets have been facing for decades . ”
Hafley is right .
Fighting wars by skimping on compensation for the soldiers who must fight them is a tried - and - true strategy of every commander in chief .
Successive Democratic and Republican administrations stood in the way of compensation for Vietnam veterans struggling with PTSD and Agent Orange exposure .
The Clinton administration dragged its feet when tens of thousands of veterans of the 1991 Gulf War struggled to get compensation for the dizzying array of symptoms they were experiencing , such as frequent immune system disorders , birth defects , cancer , chronic fatigue , loss of muscle control , headaches , dizziness and loss of balance , memory problems , muscle and joint pain , indigestion , skin problems and shortness of breath .
Today , the military is employing a different arsenal to keep its overstretched military in the field at bargain - basement prices .
“ For the first time in history , ” according to a cover story in the June 16 issue of Time , “ a sizable and growing number of U.S. combat troops are taking daily doses of antidepressants to calm nerves strained by repeated and lengthy tours in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ The medicines are intended not only to help troops keep their cool , but also to enable the already strapped Army to preserve its most precious resource : soldiers on the front lines .
Data contained in the Army ’s fifth Mental Health Advisory Team report indicate that , according to an anonymous survey of U.S. troops taken last fall , about 12 percent of combat troops in Iraq and 17 percent of those in Afghanistan are taking prescription antidepressants or sleeping pills to help them cope . ”
Chris LeJeune , who returned home in May 2004 , began struggling with depression while on a 15 - month deployment to Iraq .
The uncertainty about the mission itself weighed heavily on his conscience and contributed to his condition .
“ When you search someone ’s house , you have it built up in your mind that these guys are terrorists , but when you go in , there ’s little bitty tiny shoes and toys on the floor–things like that started affecting me a lot more than I thought they would , ” LeJeune said .
When LeJeune sought counseling , he got a prescription for antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications , but not much else .
“ In the civilian world , when you have a problem , you go to the doctor , and you have therapy followed up by some medication , ” said LeJeune .
“ In Iraq , you see the doctor only once or twice , but you continue to get drugs constantly . ”
And that ’s if you ’re lucky enough to see a mental - health professional .
According to Time , about a third of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan say they ca n’t see a mental - health provider when they need one .
Adding to the frustration facing the loved ones of veterans seeking help is the unresponsiveness of every level of government to the crisis .
Seeking to break the logjam , two veterans ’ organization filed suit to ask a federal judge to order changes to how the VA delivers care to veterans .
The suit sought redress for the lack of mental health care services , the long delays for appointments , and the four - and - a - half year backlog of cases in which veterans are appealing for a higher disability rating than was issued by VA doctors .
But the judge refused to grant the order , saying the plaintiffs were demanding nothing short of “ a complete overhaul of the VA system . ”
Hafley can think of only one other measure that would work better than a complete overhaul .
“ Quite frankly , ” she said , “ the best thing they could do to stop the overload at the VA is end the war , bring the troops home and stop creating more troops with PTSD who are at risk of suicide or having addiction problems .
Adding more money into the VA does help the ones who are already home , but every day , new ones are being created .
“ That influx is going to continue .
Spending more money is just a temporary fix .
They are n’t stopping the bleeding .
And that ’s the problem that brought us where we are now . ”
The Rand Corporation ’s study “ Invisible Wounds of War ” compiles information on veterans suffering from PTSD , TBI and major depression .
The Rand site also has links to pamphlets with advice for individuals and families trying to cope with post - deployment stress .

If you are trying to block the emotional response , then the immobility response is triggered .
You will feel overwhelmed , frozen and out of control .
Most of the times , with this core intestinal thoughts , you feel like dead and the thoughts are terrifying .
Whenever you hurt yourself and pain occurs , which results in appearance of trauma , you are exposed to some sort of emotional , psychological and mental maltreatment [ Mental health and trauma ] .
In everyone ’s life , most of the times hard life experiences appear , and at a point of time , these can transform into trauma .
Trauma can be defined as “ sturdy negative experience that aggravate permanently and deep psyche and the organic structure damages you at some point of time .
So , healing trauma is essential for everyone .
Here are the ten steps which help in healing the condition for yourself :
1 . Try to recognize the symptoms at abnormal situations .
If you feel like you are out of control or becoming crazy , then you are suffering from post traumatic stress symptoms .
2 . Tell regarding your feelings , reactions and thoughts to the specific events with the people you trust .
Continue discussing about the event until you find that there is nothing to talk about it .
3 . Do anything that makes you to attain a feeling of safety and tranquility in your surroundings .
4 . Resume the usual routines and activities as quickly as possible .
Traumatic life leads to live your life in a state of chaos .
The harder you try to resume these activities , the better your life will feel .
Structuring the events can provide a feeling of safety so that you can sketch your way back to your stability .
5 . Healing trauma needs to take proper rest , exercise and good nutrition .
If you want to recover from the flu , do n’t forget these health tips .
Perform the same for yourself also so that you can recover from traumatic stress .
6 . Get a confirmatory action on your behalf .
7 . Try to know the emotional causes and learn to handle them innovatively .
If you have flashback to the trauma , by participating in the similar task , visiting the same place , hearing , tasting , smelling , seeing , or experiencing something that repeats you about the original trauma , then just try to recognize that you are going to face an emotional trigger .
At that situation , keep in a positive self talk .
8 . Find out the deeper meaning to the thing that happened to you .
List out the things in a journal that you have experienced from a traumatic event or record them in support group which is sympathetic to your condition .
9 . Try to seek psychotherapy for healing trauma with a specialized practitioner .
10 .
You should act with enough patience , because healing trauma takes some time .
The recovery process has its ups and downs .
Try to follow these simple tips for healing trauma effectively .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The anxiety over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , crucial to a recovery of the battered housing market and the economy as a whole , reached a fever pitch on Friday and took shares of the companies and the broader markets on a wild ride .
The wild day capped a brutal week for the shares of the two companies , as investors fled the two giants on worries they would need a bailout that would wipeout the value of their stock .
An early selloff was fanned by speculation of a looming government bailout .
The stocks recovered on assurances by a leading senator that no rescue is needed and a Reuters report that said the Federal Reserve is opening up its discount window to Fannie and Freddie .
But after the market closed , Federal Reserve spokeswoman Michelle Smith told CNN that no discussions with Fannie or Freddie about access to the discount window have taken place .
The discount window is a source of funds that traditionally was only available to commercial banks .
But after the Fed engineered the purchase of Wall Street firm Bear Stearns in March , it opened the window to investment banks as well .
Smith added that " the Fed is following the situation with Fannie and Freddie closely " and that she was " not prepared to discuss the range of options and alternatives " available to the Fed regarding Fannie and Freddie .
Immediately after the markets opened Friday , shares of Fannie ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) fell more than 47 % from their already battered closing price the day before .
But the stocks made up much of their earlier losses .
Fannie finished the day down 22 % while Freddie 's stock closed with a 3 % loss .
Friday 's selloff left both shares down just over 45 % for the week and about 75 % for so far this year .
Still , analysts say there is little doubt that the federal government would step in to rescue Fannie and Freddie should rising losses and plunging stock prices leave them without the capital they needed to continue to be the primary source of mortgage funding in the nation .
Fannie and Freddie hold or back $ 5 trillion between them , or about half the mortgage debt in the country .
They play a central role in the U.S. housing market , providing a crucial source of funding for banks and other home lenders , especially since a credit market crisis last summer left them the only major players in packaging pools of mortgage loans into securities for sale to investors .
If they were unable to do so , it would significantly raise the cost and restrict the availability of mortgage loans , causing significantly more problems for already battered housing prices and sales .
That in turn would be another significant problem for the overall U.S. economy , as well as global credit markets .
Trying to restore a sense of calm
The problems for Freddie and Fannie weighed on broader markets , causing a sell - off in U.S. stocks , especially hitting major banks , Wall Street firms and home builders .
At one point during the day the Dow fell below the 11,000 mark for the first time in nearly two years .
Fannie and Freddie both said in statements issued late Friday that they have the adequate capital they need to operate and to meet targets required by regulators .
" In fact , we have more core capital , and a higher surplus over our regulatory requirement , than at any time in this company 's history , " said Fannie 's statement .
Freddie 's statement said speculation in media reports about a government takeover of the firms through a process known as conservatorship was not accurate .
" Freddie Mac is not on the threshold of conservatorship because we are adequately capitalized , " said the statement .
" The preliminary indications of our expected financial performance for the second quarter , while reflecting the challenges that face the industry , do not point to an immediate need to raise additional capital . "
Others also tried to reassure Wall Street that Fannie and Freddie were not in immediate danger of collapse .
In fact , shares of both companies started their modest rebound shortly after 2 p.m. when Sen. Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , defended the strength of both firms .
Dodd said his discussions with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , the regulators who oversee the firms and the two companies '
CEOs convinced him they have more than adequate capital and that there was no need to even discuss failure or a bailout .
He also vowed quick passage of a long - debated housing bill to give greater oversight of the two companies .
The bill passed the Senate Friday night and is expected to be taken up by the house next week .
" There is a sort of a panic going on , " he said .
" The facts do n't warrant that reaction in my view .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were never bottom feeders in the residential mortgage markets .
People ought to feel confident about them . "
Talk about a bailout
The New York Times reported Friday that senior Bush administration officials are considering a plan to have the government take over one or both of the companies if their problems worsen .
But Paulson said Friday that the government 's primary focus is making sure that Fannie and Freddie remain " in their current form . "
On Saturday , The Wall Street Journal reported that Paulson is adamant that a rescue of either company not benefit shareholders - for fear that a bailout would inure investors to risk .
Even before the latest report on a possible rescue plan , investors fled the two stocks this week due to speculation about their future .
The drop in their shares raised questions about how difficult and expensive it will be for them to raise needed capital in the future , which fueled further losses in their stock prices .
" Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have lost investor confidence evidenced by the rapid brutal sell - off in their stocks , which could dramatically hinder their ability to raise any additional capital going forward , " wrote Richard Hofmann of research firm CreditSights in a note Friday .
Hoffmann added that the firms ' ability to function normally " remain at the core of government efforts to stabilize the mortgage markets . "
A number of scenarios were being discussed by bankers and analysts about what the government may do to deal with the crisis of confidence facing the firms .
Jaret Seiberg , a financial services analyst for the Stanford Group , a Washington research firm , said Thursday that the Federal Reserve could purchase some of Freddie 's and Fannie 's debt or mortgage - backed securities .
He also said the Treasury Department could make billions of dollars in loans to the companies or even buy the firm 's stock .
" Government officials are always planning for worst - case scenarios and our note is intended to highlight some options that may be available to policymakers , " he wrote .
" We suspect hybrid versions of these plans also are possible . "
Under current law , the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) , the regulator of Fannie and Freddie , could take control of the firms if their capital falls too far below required levels .
It is unclear how the firms would operate in that situation , known as a conservatorship .
OFHEO Director James Lockhart issued a statement late Thursday saying that his agency was closely monitoring the firms ' credit and capital positions .
But he pointed out that they had already raised $ 20 billion in capital and that they adequately capitalized , holding funds well in excess of his agency 's requirements .
Investor panic
Still , investors were worried that continued problems in the housing market would cause more than the $ 12.7 billion losses the two firms have lost between them since last July .
The decline in their stock value makes raising additional capital to cover those future losses that much more expensive and difficult .
" Our primary concern about Freddie and Fannie is that credit losses are likely to be worse than the management 's current judgment , which will further pressure the capital base , and we remain cautious until we are better able to quantify these risks , " wrote UBS analyst Eric Wasserstrom in a note Thursday .
Those concerns prompted him to raise his estimated loss for Freddie and to cut his price target for the stock , although , he retained his neutral rating on both firms , rather than urging clients to sell their holdings .
But the biggest worry Fannie and Freddie shareholders faced Friday was what would happen if the government did have to step into rescue them .
Certainly , the big selloff earlier in the day reflected some investors ' fears that shares of Fannie and Freddie could become worthless in a bailout scenario .

Two years before the invasion of Iraq , oil executives and foreign policy advisers told the Bush administration that the United States would remain " a prisoner of its energy dilemma " as long as Saddam Hussein was in power .
That April 2001 report , " Strategic Policy Challenges for the 21st Century , " was prepared by the James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy and the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations at the request of Vice President Dick Cheney .
In retrospect , it appears that the report helped focus administration thinking on why it made geopolitical sense to oust Hussein , whose country sat on the world�s second largest oil reserves .
" Iraq remains a de-stabilizing influence to the flow of oil to international markets from the Middle East , " the report said .
" Saddam Hussein has also demonstrated a willingness to threaten to use the oil weapon and to use his own export program to manipulate oil markets .
Therefore the U.S. should conduct an immediate policy review toward Iraq including military , energy , economic and political / diplomatic assessments . "
The advisory committee that helped prepare the report included Luis Giusti , a Shell Corp. non-executive director ; John Manzoni , regional president of British Petroleum ; and David O'Reilly , chief executive of ChevronTexaco .
Those companies now stand to earn tens of billions of dollars in no -bid contracts in a U.S. - brokered deal that was recently announced to drill Iraq�s untapped oil fields .
James Baker , the namesake for the public policy institute , was a prominent oil industry lawyer who also served as Secretary of State under President George H.W. Bush and was counsel to the Bush / Cheney campaign during the Florida recount in 2000 .
Ken Lay , then chairman of the energy - trading Enron Corp. , also made recommendations that were included in the Baker report .
At the time of the report , Cheney was leading an energy task force made up of powerful industry executives who assisted him in drafting a comprehensive " National Energy Policy " for President George W. Bush .
A Focus on Oil
It was believed then that Cheney�s secretive task force was focusing on ways to reduce environmental regulations and fend off the Kyoto protocol on global warming .
But Bush�s first Treasury Secretary , Paul O�Neill , later described a White House interest in invading Iraq and controlling its vast oil reserves , dating back to the first days of the Bush presidency .
In Ron Suskind�s 2004 book , The Price of Loyalty , O�Neill said an invasion of Iraq was on the agenda at the first National Security Council .
There was even a map for a post - war occupation , marking out how Iraq�s oil fields would be carved up .
O�Neill said even at that early date , the message from Bush was " find a way to do this , " according to O�Neill , a critic of the Iraq invasion who was forced out of his job in December 2002 .
The New Yorker �s Jane Mayer later made another discovery : a secret NSC document dated Feb.
3 , 2001 � only two weeks after Bush took office � instructing NSC officials to cooperate with Cheney�s task force , which was " melding " two previously unrelated areas of policy : " the review of operational policies towards rogue states " and " actions regarding the capture of new and existing oil and gas fields . "
[ The New Yorker , Feb. 16 , 2004 ]
By March 2001 , Cheney�s task force had prepared a set of documents with a map of Iraqi oilfields , pipelines , refineries and terminals , as well as two charts detailing Iraqi oil and gas projects , and a list titled " Foreign Suitors for Iraqi Oilfield Contracts , " according to information released in July 2003 under a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit filed by the conservative watchdog group , Judicial Watch .
A Commerce Department spokesman issued a brief statement when those documents were released stating that Cheney�s energy task force " evaluated regions of the world that are vital to global energy supply . "
There has long been speculation that a key reason why Cheney fought so hard to keep his task force documents secret was that they may have included information about the administration�s plans toward Iraq .
' Conspiracy Theory �
However , both before and after the invasion , much of the U.S. political press treated the notion that oil was a motive for invading Iraq in March 2003 as a laughable conspiracy theory .
Generally , business news outlets were much more frank about the real - politick importance of Iraq�s oil fields .
For instance , Ray Rodon , a former executive at Halliburton , the oil - service giant that Cheney once headed , said he was dispatched to Iraq in October 2002 to assess the country�s oil infrastructure and map out plans for operating Iraq�s oil industry , according to an April 14 , 2003 story in Fortune magazine .
" From behind the obsidian mirrors of his wraparound sunglasses , Ray Rodon surveys the vast desert landscape of southern Iraq 's Rumailah oilfield , " Fortune�s story said .
" A project manager with Halliburton 's engineering and construction division , Kellogg Brown & Root , Rodon has spent months preparing for the daunting task of repairing Iraq 's oil industry . "
" Working first at headquarters in Houston and then out of a hotel room in Kuwait City , he has studied the intricacies of the Iraqi national oil company , even reviewing the firm 's organizational charts so that Halliburton and the Army can ascertain which Iraqis are reliable technocrats and which are Saddam loyalists . "
At about the same time as Rodon�s trip to Iraq � October 2002 � Oil and Gas International , an industry publication , reported that the State Department and the Pentagon had put together pre-war planning groups that focused heavily on protecting Iraq�s oil infrastructure .
The next month , November 2002 , the Department of Defense recommended that the Army Corps of Engineers award a contract to Kellogg , Brown & Root to extinguish Iraqi oil well fires .
The contract also called for " assessing the condition of oil - related infrastructure ; cleaning up oil spills or other environmental damage at oil facilities ; engineering design and repair or reconstruction of damaged infrastructure ; assisting in making facilities operational ; distribution of petroleum products ; and assisting the Iraqis in resuming Iraqi oil company operations . "
In January 2003 , as President Bush was presenting the looming war with Iraq as necessary to protect Americans , the Wall Street Journal reported that oil industry executives met with Cheney 's staff to plan the post - war revival of Iraq 's oil industry .
" Facing a possible war with Iraq , U.S. oil companies are starting to prepare for the day when they may get a chance to work in one of the world 's most oil - rich countries , " the Journal reported on Jan. 16 , 2003 .
" Executives of U.S. oil companies are conferring with officials from the White House , the Department of Defense and the State Department to figure out how best to jump - start Iraq 's oil industry following a war , industry officials say .
" The Bush administration is eager to secure Iraq 's oil fields and rehabilitate them , industry officials say .
They say Mr. Cheney 's staff hosted an informational meeting with industry executives in October [ 2002 ] , with Exxon Mobil Corp. , ChevronTexaco Corp. , ConocoPhillips and Halliburton among the companies represented .
" Both the Bush administration and the companies say such a meeting never took place .
Since then , industry officials say , the Bush administration has sought input , formally and informally , from executives and industry experts on how best to overhaul Iraq 's oil sector . "
Guarding the Oil Ministry Despite the Bush administration�s denials about oil as a motivation for war , the Bush administration�s focus on Iraqi oil was firmly set .
On April 5 , 2003 , Reuters reported that the State Department 's " Future of Iraq " project headed by Thomas Warrick , special adviser to the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs , held its fourth meeting of the oil and energy - working group .
Documents obtained by Reuters showed that " a clear consensus among expert opinion favoring production - sharing agreements to attract the major oil companies . "
" That is likely to thrill oil companies harboring hopes of lucrative contracts to develop Iraqi oil reserves , " the news agency reported .
" Short - term rehabilitation of southern Iraqi oil fields already is under way , with oil well fires being extinguished by U.S. contractor Kellogg Brown and Root � " Long - term contracts are expected to see U.S. companies ExxonMobil , ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips compete with Anglo - Dutch Shell , Britain 's BP , TotalFinaElf of France , Russia 's LUKOIL and Chinese state companies . "
After U.S. troops captured Baghdad in April 2003 , they were ordered to protect the Oil Ministry even as looters ransacked priceless antiquities from Iraq�s national museums and stole explosives from unguarded military arsenals .
Now , the long - held dreams of U.S. dominance over the Iraqi oil spigot now seem close to fulfillment .
Last weekend ,
The New York Times reported that State and Commerce department officials have been secretly working with Iraq�s Oil Ministry in drawing up contracts between the Iraqi government and Western oil companies to develop Iraq�s oil fields .
Unacceptable Options
This outcome for U.S. and other Western oil companies now appears to have been foretold by the Baker Institute report more than seven years ago .
In April 2001 , the report laid out a series of unacceptable options , including helping Iraq under Saddam Hussein extract more oil by easing embargoes that were meant to hem Hussein in .
" The U.S. could consider reducing restrictions on oil investment inside Iraq , " the report said .
But if Hussein�s " access to oil revenues was to be increased by adjustments in oil sanctions , Saddam Hussein could be a greater security threat to U.S. allies in the region if weapons of mass destruction , sanctions , weapons regimes and the coalition against him are not strengthened . "
Iraq is a " key swing producer turning its taps on and off when it has felt such action was in its strategic interest , " the report said , adding that there even was a ' ' possibility that Saddam Hussein may remove Iraqi oil from the market for an extended period of time '' in order to drive up prices .
" Under this scenario , the United States remains a prisoner of its energy dilemma , suffering on a recurring basis from the negative consequences of sporadic energy shortages , " the report said .
" These consequences can include recession , social dislocation of the poorest Americans , and at the extremes , a need for military intervention . "
The report recommended Cheney move swiftly to integrate energy and national security policy as a means to stop '' manipulations of markets by any state " and suggested that his task force include " representation from the Department of Defense . "
" Unless the United States assumes a leadership role in the formation of new rules of the game , '' the report said , '' U.S. firms , U.S. consumers and the U.S. government [ will be left ] in a weaker position . "
Two years after the Baker report , the United States � along with Great Britain and other allies � invaded Iraq .
Now , more than five years after that , with Hussein dead and a U.S. expeditionary force still occupying Iraq , the U.S. oil industry finally appears to be in a strong position relative to Iraq�s oil riches .
However , the price that has been paid by American troops , Iraqi civilians and the U.S. taxpayers has been enormous .
Hi .
I do n't know if you 've heard of me , but I 'm the best .
I can do anything I want to , and I attract only love .
This is because I am a creature of love .
Not only that , but the more love I give away , the more I have .
Basically , I could fill a barn with vibrations of love .
If I ever heard these words tumble from a mouth , I would pop off and make a cup of tea , just so I could come back and drop it in horror .
People know it does n't make sense , that 's why meaningless , self - congratulatory rubbish like this is usually hidden away .
People who hurl upbeat but confusing imagery at themselves usually keep it restricted to a bedroom mirror .
The quotes from the first paragraph were based on genuine affirmations by Louise L Hay , author of books detailing the powers of self - actualisation and , if her Amazon reviews are anything to go by , commander of a devoted legion of empowered fragile souls .
I dislike Hay , but she 's hardly alone .
The internet responds to a Google - fuelled nudge with a gush of thinkless positivity .
Noel Edmonds even claims that his cosmic optimism saw him through a divorce .
Edmonds may find himself overruled by the newly legislated Law of Attraction .
Subsection 1 , paragraph c states that when you ask the universe for things , the universe will act like a mechanical chicken in a pier - end glass cabinet and pop out a plastic universe egg containing your dreams .
There is , of course , a catch with which the method 's failures can be blamed .
You have to behave like the kind of person who'd receive the things you 're asking for - which I can only imagine means pacing in front of your front door , tapping your watch , and saying " my universe egg should be here by now " .
The Apprentice is full of people like this - not one of them would admit to being anything other than the best and most deserving human in the world .
You'd be hard pushed to get them to say what they 're the best at , because having an area of specialisation must seem futile when you 're the best at everything in the world there is .
Failure is casually blamed on others , because that 's the only rational explanation .
Breathtaking hubris can be justified and dismissed with comments like : " Some people say I 'm arrogant .
I take that as a compliment . "
Word up , sausage .
Arrogance is a bad thing .
You can't reclaim it , like it's an insult that 's being used to oppress you .
It 's an insult that 's being used in a brave attempt to stop you acting like such a relentless dick .
Everyone has issues with their self - esteem .
Billions of people sabotage themselves with fear and inaction .
Even people who have the kind of appearance you or I would kill for can despise mirrors , because they 're a shrivelling reminder of a body that is n't what it was , or could be .
If you want to feel less like a isolated anomaly , the answer is n't to become the Cosmic Ambassador of Cuddling Yourself .
It 's to realise that we 're just the flimsy , adorable bloodsacs that sci- fi aliens are constantly saying we are .
You 're no more an infinite well of love than you are a hopeless reject .
In fact , thinking you 're the worst is basically saying you 're the best at being bad .
So snap out of it , you massive show - off .
Just have sensible opinions , instead of attempting to gouge out a hole in the universe for your made - up facts .
Do n't say " I'm beautiful " .
Say " I think I 'm nice " .
Do n't say " I 'm the best " , just work out what you 're good at .
And for God 's sake , do n't say " I 'm an infinite well of love , " say " I 'm a bit shit , yeah .
But if everyone dropped their front for just one day and admitted how terrifying life is , we 'd spend a week sobbing and apologising to strangers . "
And what a week that 'd be .
I reckon everyone 'd get laid .

This is part of a series I started in March 2008 - you may want to go back and look at older parts if you 're new to this series .
Last time we looked at an improved way of handling loops etc. using anonymous functions .
But most of that is relatively limited if there 's no way of modifying variables .
Sure , you can get away with recursion and not allow mutation or even other side effects at all .
It might satisfy some functional programming purists , but it would not satisfy me and it would also require some fairly sophisticated optimizations to get decent performance .
I like the principle of reducing side effects as much as possible , and pushing side effects up , so much so that it's one of the factors I pointed out in my post about reducing coupling through unit tests .
But I do n't like sacrificing simplicity and / or performance for the sake of a " purer " approach .
So lets introduce assignment , and at the same time add in basic arithmetic and comparisons .
Assignment
We 'll cheat and keep what we introduce into the actual compiler as minimal as possible .
That means assignments go into the compiler , and arithmetic and comparisons are confined to a new C runtime for simplicity for now .
It is temporary , I promise .
Just another shortcut .
Why do n't we give assignment the same treatment ?
Well , we could , if we introduced a transparent way of passing the address of a variable as an argument to a function , but it would still mean compiler changes , would be slower and it seems it would n't actually bring any benefits .
Another reason for not taking that route is that it opens up a can of worns :
If we allow taking the address of stack variables , it gets easy to shoot yourself in the foot by accessing it after the stack frame is dead .
We could accept that risk ( it 's not like this compiler is a bastion of safety at the moment , with mostly no typing and no error checking to speak of ) , or we can introduce " environments " and guarantee that any variable you take the address of will live on the heap and stay alive until you lose the reference ...
But that 's more complicated than I 'd like right now .
Environments is one of the approaches to keeping local variables " alive " in the heap that would let us do proper closures instead of mere lowly anonymous functions , though , so we might eventually bite the bullet .
Adding assignment to the compiler is trivial anyway .
Here 's the first try :
def compile_assign scope , left , right source = compile_eval_arg ( scope , right ) atype , aparam = get_arg ( scope , left ) raise " Expected a variable on left hand side of assignment " if atype != : arg puts " \t movl \t #{ source } , #{ PTR_SIZE * ( aparam + 2 ) } ( %ebp ) " return [ : subexpr ]
end
Notice our first error message ...
We 'll eventually need to bite the bullet and add lots more of those , as well as handling them a bit better than just letting the compiler fail with an exception message and a stack trace , but it 's a start .
What this function does is quite straightforward :
It compiles the right hand expression , then copies the result into the variable .
Can you spot the problem ?
It 's not a bug , it 's a feature !
Right ...
It only allows assignment to a local variable .
Whether that is indeed a bug or a feature is open for discussion - many languages does allow for assignment to function / method arguments as well as local ( and sometimes global ) arguments .
I promise we 'll look at this closer later , but for now it 's simply not important .
We then update # compile_exp by adding this :
return compile_assign ( scope , * exp [ 1 ..- 1 ] ) if ( exp [ 0 ] == : assign )
And test it with this ( the output needs to be linked with the arithmetic functions in the next step , or rather it at least needs : sub ) :
prog = [ : call , [ : lambda , [ :i ] , [ : do , [ : printf , " Testing sub and assign ( before ) : %ld \\ n " , :i ] , [ :assign , :i , [ : sub , :i , 1 ] ] , [ : printf , " Testing sub and assign ( after ) : %ld \\ n " , :i ] , ] ] , [ 10 ] ]
Arithmetic and comparisons
Here 's our new C runtime :
signed int add ( signed int a , signed int b ) { return a + b ; } signed int sub ( signed int a , signed int b ) { return a - b ; } signed int div ( signed int a , signed int b ) { return a / b ; } signed int mul ( signed int a , signed int b ) { return a * b ; } signed int ne ( signed int a , signed int b ) { return a != b ; } signed int eq ( signed int a , signed int b ) { return a == b ; } signed int not ( signed int a ) { return !
a ; } //
Note that our " and " wo n't shortcircuit , as the // evaluation happens before this function is called .
signed int and ( signed int a , signed int b ) { return a && b ; } signed int gt ( signed int a , signed int b ) { return a > b ; } signed int lt ( signed int a , signed int b ) { return a < b ; }
Not very exciting is it ?
I 'm not going to try to make it very exciting , but it 's worth considering what would be involved in adding compilation of it , though I wo n't complete that now .
Lets look at a single example , " lt " , and show the process , though you should be used to it by now .
gcc -S on just the " lt " function gives :
lt : pushl %ebp movl %esp , %ebp movl 8 ( %ebp ) , %eax cmpl 12 ( %ebp ) , %eax setl %al movzbl %al , %eax popl %ebp ret
( Uh - oh , what 's that setl / movzbl stuff ?
This is an optimization - cmpl compares the two operands and set a number of condition codes .
" set [ something ] " sets a value in a single byte register %al based on the condition codes - in this case " l " for less .
" movzbl " then takes that byte , extends the value up to 32 bits by filling the remaining bits with 0 and puts it into %eax - do n't worry about it )
To add this to the compiler we'd do compile_eval_arg on the left and right arguments .
After doing it to the left , we 'd need to store the result somewhere temporarily , in case we try to use %eax again .
We 'd then need to issue the cmpl / setl / movzbl instructions , and we'd be done .
The function could look something like this :
def compile_lt scope , left , right l = compile_eval_arg ( scope , left ) puts " \t movl \t # { l } , %ecx " r = compile_eval_arg ( scope , right ) puts " \t cmpl \t %ecx , %eax " puts " \t setl \t %al " puts " \t movzbl %al , %eax " return [ : subexpr ]
end
Note that this is completely untested - I have n't even checked that I got the operands to cmpl in the right order .
More importantly , this illustrates one reason for not jumping into this and spending time on doing the same thing for all of these functions right away : Notice that we needed a temporary register ?
Notice how that was wasteful , because we could have just put things into %ecx right away ?
Notice how this is a recipe for a lot of pain , because we might have even more complex situations where it is handy ( though not strictly necessary ) to have even more temporary registers ?
Register allocation is a huge subject in itself .
It boils down to figuring out the most efficient way of stuffing a large number of temporary and long lived variables into a very scarce ( on the x86 in particular ) resource , namely registers .
You want to make the most of them , because access to registers is generally far faster than memory accesses , and because many architectures have instructions that requires the use of specific registers for specific purposes .
It gets complicated fast , because while using a register when you can is good , " spilling " - that is the process of storing a variable back to memory and loading another variable it it 's place - when you have more variables in use than registers can get even more expensive than accessing things straight from memory in the first place .
Figuring out what combination of variables is most efficient to keep in registers or move in and out of registers is something that can make grown men cry , and many simple compilers just ignore this problem and pick a very simple and inefficient approach .
At least reading the wikipedia article linked to above is worthwhile if you want to know more about this , though a few searches should turn up a lot of papers .
I do n't intend to add any advanced register allocation to this compiler until it's far closer to being functionally complete .
But we will need to deal with some of it , but it 's something I 'd rather defer doing a proper implementation of until more functionality is in place for the simple reason that doing it well is a hell of a lot of work , and doing a half assed job at it will at least make things work , even though performance will suffer .
Wrapping it up
Since there 's now a separate file for the C runtime support , I 've tar'ed up the files for step8 together with a Makefile here .
If you have Ruby , make and gcc installed you should be able to just untar it and run make to get the " step8 " test binary :
$ make ruby step8 . rb > step8 .
s as - o step8 .
o step8 .
s cc - c - o runtime .
o runtime .
c cc step8 .
o runtime .
o - o step8 $ . / step8
Testing sub and assign ( before ) : 10 Testing sub and assign ( after ) : 9 $

There was a very low - turnout state Primary Election in New Mexico today .
And yet , it brought more November tea leaves ....
Computer problems affected ballot verification procedures in some counties across the state earlier Tuesday .
The Secretary of State 's office started getting calls around noon from smaller counties saying their computer connection to Santa Fe was n't working .
By 1 p.m. , no county in the state was connected to the system that allows counties to access voter registrations and also report results .
...
Cibola County also experienced some computer problems .
Election officials there said they only had one computer to verify where people should go to vote , as all other computers crashed .
Last we had checked ( and no time to re-check for the moment ) , ES&S ran the voter registration system in NM .
During the state 's Democratic Caucus last February , thousands of voters were reportedly dumped from the newly - privatized voting rolls .
If you live in New Mexico , or anywhere else , please check your voter registration status soon !
See the full article for details on today 's failures in other counties across the state .
AS HOUSE prices in America continue their rapid descent , market - watchers are having to cast back ever further for gloomy comparisons .
The latest S&P / Case - Shiller national house - price index , published this week , showed a slump of 14.1 % in the year to the first quarter , the worst since the index began 20 years ago .
Now Robert Shiller , an economist at Yale University and co-inventor of the index , has compiled a version that stretches back over a century .
This shows that the latest fall in nominal prices is already much bigger than the 10.5 % drop in 1932 , the worst point of the Depression .
And things are even worse than they look .
In the deflationary 1930s house prices declined less in real terms .
Today inflation is running at a brisk pace , so property prices have fallen by a staggering 18 % in real terms over the past year .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges of concealing more than $ 250,000 in gifts from an oil services company , and his lawyer asked for a quick trial in an effort to clear his name before the November election .
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan agreed to the request for a fast trial and scheduled jury selection to begin on September 24 .
Stevens , who has served 40 years in the Senate , appeared in court for his arraignment on seven counts of false statements by failing to disclose the extensive renovations to his house in Alaska , home furnishings and other gifts he received .
The plea of not guilty was expected .
Two days ago , after he became the first sitting U.S. senator to face criminal charges in 15 years , the Alaska senator said in a statement that he intended to prove his innocence in court .
“ We plead not guilty your honor , ” said defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan , as the 84 - year - old Stevens silently stood next to him in front of the judge .
Stevens is the longest - serving Republican senator in U.S. history .
He arrived early with his lawyers and security detail , and had to wait in the courtroom for about 45 minutes before judge began the hearing shortly after the scheduled time .
For most of the hearing , Stevens , who practiced law in Alaska in the 1950s and later served as the U.S. attorney in the state , sat impassively at a table with his two lawyers .

Stevens was already seen as one of the most vulnerable Senate Republicans heading into November ’s elections .
The indictment seems likely to damage any chance of his winning another six - year term in a race where he was already trailing his Democratic opponent in the polls .
NO PLEA BARGAIN
Justice Department lawyer Brenda Morris estimated that it would take three weeks to put on the prosecution ’s case .
Stevens was accused of making false statements on his Senate financial disclosure forms that he filed from 1999 to 2006 , leaving out the gifts from the VECO Corp , once one of Alaska ’s largest oilfield contractors .
Stevens is the highest - profile lawmaker to be charged in an Alaska political corruption investigation that began in 2004 and has resulted in seven convictions .
Sullivan said he would request that the case be moved to Alaska , but the Justice Department prosecutor vowed to oppose that .
The judge said he thought it appropriate for the case to be in Washington , D.C .

The judge allowed Stevens to remain free while he campaigns and continues his Senate work , but Stevens has agreed to surrender his passport while awaiting trial .
Stevens has received the support from some colleagues , but many have declined comment other than to say he is innocent until proven guilty .
One of the few Senate Republicans to voice support for Stevens was Kay Bailey Hutchison , a Texas Republican .
She was also the previous member of the Senate to be indicted in 1993 and later cleared .
According to the Senate Historian ’s Office , Stevens was the 11th senator in the two - century - old history of the chamber to be indicted .
Three were convicted and one pleaded guilty .
Asked by the judge whether a deal might be reached in which Stevens admits his wrongdoing and avoids a trial , prosecutor Morris replied , “ There are no plea offers available at this time . ”
Stevens was booked , which typically involves fingerprinting and photographing a criminal defendant , by U.S. marshals during a break in the hearing , court officials said .
Stevens left the courthouse , which is just across the street from the U.S. Capitol building , without speaking to reporters .
The recriminations grew increasingly bitter Wednesday , as Peter Mandelson , the European negotiator , accused Ms. Schwab of refusing to budge even when her demands were met , and then going public with her grievances too quickly .
Ms. Schwab hit back by criticizing Mr. Mandelson ’s negotiating tactics , and argued that the United States farm lobby had been largely supportive of the Doha agenda , which aimed to give smaller and poorer developing countries greater access to consumers in the United States , Europe and Japan .
During the marathon talks , Mr. Lamy sought to accommodate an array of competing interests among developed and emerging nations .
His innovation was to include China , India and Brazil in a seven - member group of countries that brokered a draft text .
But the breakdown in those discussions highlighted the limits of even that flexible approach .
For Celso Amorim , the Brazilian foreign minister and trade negotiator , the collapse was a sign that that the nature of W.T.O. negotiations had changed for good .
“ In the past , it was an E.U. - U.S. business , or , maximum , the Quad , ” Mr. Amorim said , referring to a group comprising the United States , the European Union , Canada and Japan that once shaped the direction of trade talks .
“ Now it is a more complex trading system .
You have to look at developing countries as a force . ”
Even as the United States dug in against making fresh concessions , China ’s efforts to protect its own interests has tilted the playing field in a profound new way .
Growing concerns in China about food security appear to have overridden the country ’s previous commitment to free trade , which has given it the world ’s second - largest trade surplus after Germany ’s in recent years .
Since joining the W.T.O. in November 2001 , China has been an outspoken defender of free - trade principles .
It has been especially critical of the United States , for example , for invoking so - called safeguard rules to prevent an increase of Chinese textile imports that threatened to put American manufacturers out of business .

And then you see it , the online dating holy grail : a response from a flirty - looking , smart - sounding cutie pie !
Wow , she can write whole sentences .
Even better , she is vegan / loves the Sox / has a decent rack .
You reply back .
This .
Could .
Be. It !
You try not to get too excited , though .
She could have crabs / a convicted felon ex-boyfriend / shitloads of debt she ’ll expect you to pay .
A few days later , you ’re still corresponding with Cutie Pie .
Being bold / bored / horny , you ask to meet up .
“ Sure thing ! ” she replies .
“ I love going out with guys from CL ( wink wink ) . ”
You find her comments charming / annoying / indicative of a mental disorder , but you try to keep an open mind .
You decide to meet at your favorite mall / Starbucks / bar .
With your best non-smelly tee / dress shirt /
Sox jersey and a dash of Old Spice / Brut / Ivory soap , you are looking hot .
You arrive early .
While you wait , you check out chicks / chug espresso / nurse a beer .
Finally , she arrives -- only 5 minutes / 15 minutes / 45 minutes late .
Holy shit !
She ’s 10 times prettier / fatter / taller than you expected .
Hey , it ’s all good ; you can roll with the punches .
You sit down and order a smoothie / double - shot latte / Jack on the rocks and ease into conversation .
After thirty minutes , you ’re pretty sure Cutie Pie is dumber than rocks / into BDSM / one date away from suicide .
You , of course , are your usual charming / clueless / monotone - voiced self , and being a gentleman , you wait another ten minutes / forty minutes / two seconds before making your excuses about having to leave .
Oh , shit , she has that look in her eye , the one that says , “ Hey , are we gonna continue this or what ? ”
You would rather see her in your nightmares / in hell / in your bed , drunk and naked , but of course you ca n’t say that .
Instead you say , “ I had a great time .
It was nice knowing , uh , meeting you .
Best of luck with graduating from college / going to law school / working on a farm in Bolivia .
” You head home , disappointed again : yet another night you ’re not getting laid .
Oh , well .
At least you have Scrabulous / the Daily Show / your hand and some lotion to entertain you .
Besides , you ’re optimistic .
Tomorrow , you ’re going to post a profile on Match.com / e-Harmony / CL Worcester .
Next time you ’ll definitely get tail , you just know it .*********************A huge RAVE to the thoughtful , charming , and yes , horny men who remain optimistic about dating on CL despite bad , crazy , or just awkward dates .
Speaking from personal experience , women have it tough , but you have it much , much worse .
For the record , not all CL women are bitches , bots or sloths ; you just have to look hard to find us .

In this generous season , consider the greatest gift we regularly and personally give ( even if we do not intend it as such ) : sex .
Back in 2005 , Tyler Cowen pondered Michael Vassar ’s pregnant observation : " there is an inexplicable shortage of sex . "
This remains , I think , one of the most neglected questions in social science .
We should devote far more effort to diagnosing and fixing this problem .
To inspire more precious gift - giving , let us review the health benefits of sex [ as of 2003 ] :
Saving yourself " before the big game , the big business deal , the big hoedown or the big bakeoff … there ’s no evidence it sharpens your competitive edge .
The best that modern science can say for sexual abstinence is that it ’s harmless when practiced in moderation .
In one of the most credible studies … tracked the mortality of about 1,000 middle - aged men over the course of a decade . …
Its findings , published in 1997 in the British Medical Journal , were that men who reported the highest frequency of orgasm enjoyed a death rate half that of the laggards .
…
In a 2001 follow - on … by having sex three or more times a week , men reduced their risk of heart attack or stroke by half .
Sex , if nothing else , is exercise .
A vigorous bout burns some 200 calories –about the same as running 15 minutes on a treadmill or playing a spirited game of squash . …
Sex also boosts production of testosterone , which leads to stronger bones and muscles . …
A 2002 study of 293 women … reported that sexually active participants whose male partners did not use condoms were less subject to depression than those whose partners did .
One theory of causality : Prostoglandin , a hormone found only in semen , may be absorbed in the female genital tract . …
Immediately before orgasm , levels of the hormone oxytocin surge to five times their normal level .
This in turn releases endorphins , which alleviate the pain of everything from headache to arthritis to even migraine .
In women , sex also prompts production of estrogen , which can reduce the pain of PMS .
… individuals who have sex once or twice a week show 30 % higher levels of an antibody called immunoglobulin A , which is known to boost the immune system .
…
Better teeth : Seminal plasma contains zinc , calcium and other minerals shown to retard tooth decay .
Since this is a family Web site , we will omit discussion of the mineral delivery system . …
A study recently published by the British Journal of Urology International asserts that men in their 20s can reduce by a third their chance of getting prostate cancer by ejaculating more than five times a week .
…
Erectile dysfunction … may be telling you that you have diseased blood vessels elsewhere in your body . …
" Men who exercise and have a good heart and low heart rate , and who are cardio - fit , have firmer erections .
There very definitely is a relationship . "
But is there such a thing as too much sex ?
The answer , in purely physiological terms , is this :
If you ’re female , probably not .
If you ’re male ?
You betcha . …
Regular sessions can not only firm a woman ’s tummy and buttocks but also improve her posture … [ though ] sometimes you can have a lubrication problem .
Women who abstain from sex run some risks .
In postmenopausal women , these include vaginal atrophy . …
As for men , urologist Eid says it ’s definitely possible to get too much of a good thing , now that drugs such as Viagra and Levitra have given men far more staying power than may actually be good for them .
Tyler discussed several theories of why we have too little sex .
I also ponder why we neglect this as a research topic .
It seems to me that enjoyment of sex is seen as a " silly " topic , not worthy of " serious " researchers .
So Kinsey is one of my heros .

In the House Amendments to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 3221 – Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008
See Page 11 and 12 here :
Payment Card and Third Party Network Information Reporting .
The proposal requires
information reporting on payment card and third party network transactions .
Payment settlement entities , including merchant acquiring banks and third party settlement organizations , or third party payment facilitators acting on their behalf , will be required to report the annual gross amount of reportable transactions to the IRS and to the participating payee .
Reportable transactions include any payment card transaction and any third party network transaction .
Participating payees include persons who accept a payment card as payment and third party networks who accept payment from a third party settlement organization in settlement of transactions .
A payment card means any card issued pursuant to an agreement or arrangement which provides for standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions .
Use of an account number or other indicia associated with a payment card will be treated in the same manner as a payment card .
A de minimis exception for transactions of $ 10,000 or less and 200 transactions or less applies to payments by third party settlement organizations .
The proposal applies to returns for calendar years beginning after December 31 , 2010 .
Back - up withholding provisions apply to amounts paid after December 31 , 2011 .
This proposal is estimated to raise $ 9.802 billion over ten years .
This will be very interesting …
Some commentary here :
During his quarterly financial results call , Apple 's chief financial officer Peter Oppenheimer revealed that the company will make a key " product transition " that cuts back on its profit margins to help shut out rivals .
A frequent point of discussion during the hour - long call , the mystery transition will drop Apple 's gross margins from 34.8 percent in the spring quarter to just 31.5 percent in the July - to - September window in which the update takes place , ultimately settling at about 30 percent during Apple 's fiscal 2009 .
Oppenheimer is deliberately short on details , not wanting to pre-announce the product or allude to its nature , but explains that cost will be a driving factor .
The Cupertino , Calif . - based company often introduces products to the market with new technology at a high price , according to the executive , but often seeks to drive the price lower over time .
It never wants to create a profit margin so wide that it creates an " umbrella " for rivals that lets them safely undercut Apple 's pricing and steal sales .
The new , unnamed product will continue to have " technologies and features that others can't match , " according to the CFO .
Ok , this is n’t exactly a craft … this is a 1 Up Mushroom Lamp sold by the folks at Guruguru .
Pretty cool looking and affordable too at only $ 8.50 .
They do n’t say how big it is though , which is aggravating .
I bet it would be easy to make if someone put their mind to it – any video game crafters up for it ?
UPDATE : It ’s gone from their site now .
After days of struggling with sticky Martian dirt , the Phoenix Mars Lander has unexpectedly succeeded in getting its first soil sample into an onboard laboratory for analysis , jubilant NASA scientists said on Wednesday .
The breakthrough came after the lander spent days vibrating a screen over its onboard Thermal Evolved Gas Analyzer ( TEGA ) in hopes that the clumpy soil would break loose and fall into the onboard ovens .
The scientists were caught by surprise when the trick worked on the seventh , and likely last , try .
Members of the normally staid Phoenix team , who have been forced to watch for much of the last week as their first Martian soil sample lingered maddeningly close to the ovens , celebrated by cheering and dancing around the room to K.C. and the Sunshine Band ’s 1970s disco hit ” ( Shake , Shake , Shake ) Shake Your Booty . ”
” When I announced that the ( vibrating ) process had terminated early because the oven was full of dirt , the group just went up into cheers .
I got a standing ovation and started playing some ’ Shake Shake Shake ’ music and just had a good time , ” said William Boynton of the University of Arizona in Tucson , who is overseeing the TEGA experiments .
On July 21 , 2008 , BBC Hardtalk with Steven Sackur had as guest Robert Baer , former CIA Senior Middle East Specialist .
The topic of discussion was US policy regarding Iraq and Iran .
It is not very likely that this interview and its subject matter will be aired in the United States so I am forwarding this ' front line intelligence ' so America can read what transpired .
Mr. Baer is a high level CIA person who is now " off the ranch " and telling it like it is .
Sackur : " A former CIA analyst says that the US must recognize the power of Iran . "
Baer : " We simply cannot attack Iran . "
According to Mr. Baer , despite large volumes of advice to Bush , Cheney and the Pentagon , the US has ' broken the glue ' that was holding the various Kurd , Sunni and Shiite factions together .
It will not be put back together and the US and UK cannot provide that glue .
The Iraqis want us out and right now .
As I have suspected all along , the US and UK are not the solution to anything in Iraq , they are the problem .
That glue was Saddam Hussein and the fact that he was building Iraq into a European - style nation in the Middle East to the horror of Israel and the various Arab Royal kingdoms that do not want democracy because that will mean they are ' Royally out of power ' .
Such nations as Saudi Arabia , Jordan , UAE , Bahrain , Qatar , etc were willing spectators to the total annihilation of Iraq and the slaughter of over 1 million so they did not have to have democracy delivered to them by gun point , by their own citizens or by the US ­ UK Faux Empire .
In a past email update , ' Enemies within Our Gates ' , I had this quote as to why Iraq had to be destroyed and it is from a Neocon Zionist Jew named Edward Luttwak .
Note the date of this quote and appreciate that the US and UK have totally destroyed a nation to stop it from embarrassing the other " Arab Allies " in the Gulf Region and steal its oil .
< start insert >
" If you refer back to the comment made by hardliner Pro-Israel Neocon Edward Luttwak as to why Saddam must be attacked ( in 1991 , not 2002 ) , that Saddam was a threat to the Middle East status quo and then compare to Baker 's comment regarding Germany being an enemy under " the war was actually only an economic preventive measure " the picture should become a little clearer on what I am trying to emphasize .
" Saddam is not like the Saudi Princes who spend the bulk of their lives outside of their country , and who fritter away the Kingdom 's oil profits on prostitutes and bottles of champagne in Paris .
No , Saddam is building railways !
Creating electrical networks !
Highways and other important elements of a serious State infrastructure !
After eights years of war against the Iranian regime of Khomeini , he desperately needs to demobilize his Republican Guard , which incorporates so many of this technical elite , in order to rebuild the war - devastated country .
These people are his technicians , his engineers .
If they are put to work in the way Saddam wishes , they will rapidly make Iraq the most advanced power in the region , and we cannot allow this to happen . " < end insert >
We have killed over 1 million Iraqis to steal their oil and stop them from building a vibrant nation with a real economy .
It does not get ' any lower ' than that .
It is called genocide and war crimes .
Who is ' keeping the peace ' in Iraq is not the US , it is .. surprise , IRAN .
That is why al Malaki has sided with Iran .
They are not behind the violence and the CIA and White House have known about that for a very long time .
They have been helping to keep Al Sadr from launching an all - out war to evict the trespassers : the burglar - killers US and UK .
What we are dealing with here is the arrogance of George W Bush who will not admit that his plan was stupid and he has lost .
He has lost the ( fake ) Global War on Terror , he has lost Afghanistan and he has lost and does not control Iraq .
Like the murderous thug he is , the burglar controls Iraq at gunpoint .
He lost the Grand Chessboard in three moves , idiot that he is .
Iran is a Shiite nation of over 80 million people and they have considerable influence in the Shiite world .
They have been leaning heavily on the Al Sadr factions to not rise up and take all of Iraq for themselves since the Shiite in Iraq are the definite majority .
Regarding Iran , they have no nuclear weapons program according to all reputable and reliable sources .
Consider the truth from CIA and yet another Bush lie for the photo ops .
The bigger problem with Iran is they are indeed a " Regional Superpower " that wields huge force in the Shiite part of Islam .
The Zionist Jews , the US Neocons and the UK are now about to go apoplectic because Iran is doing the exact same thing that Saddam Hussein was doing .
Building a real nation , with real infrastructure and there are some who wish to crush that just like they did Iraq .
They foam at the mouth like rabid dogs at the thought of crushing Iran and stealing its vast amounts of oil and natural gas as they did in Iraq .
They are not yet a true regional military superpower but with over 80 million people they are not a pushover .
They are definitely a rapidly growing economic superpower in that region of the world .
Enough so , that both China and Russia consider them as ' national strategic interest ' , which is the mantra the US loves to use to justify its attacks and genocide on other nations based on falsified intelligence and outright lies .
Lest anyone in the White House fails to tell you , Russia and China are both Superpowers and they are solidly behind Iran and against this planned destruction and theft of property the US , UK and Israel wish to see happen .
The US is having to come to grips with the fact that Iran is indeed a regional superpower , backed up by two WORLD Superpowers .
With tensions growing between Russia and Georgia , I still maintain that if Bush has three brain cells capable of firing at the same time , he had better cut a deal with Iran and fast .. take his oil pipeline SOUTH THROUGH IRAN since he will not get it through Georgia and he will not get the Turkmenistan ­ Afghanistan ­ Pakistan pipeline done , either in his administration or his lifetime .
He has squandered any ' good will ' with Russia , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Poor little Georgia is now feeling the heat and possible wrath of a very angry Russian Bear because they sided with the US and NATO .
" Yap , yap , way to go , Condoleezza ! " Useless Black Poodle .
I told Jeff Rense that I clearly see this coming .
Yes , Bush can cut a deal with Iran to get his butt out of the crack but , and this is a major but , that deal with be on the unyielding terms of Iran and Russia .
He has no negotiating room for any " Bush conditions " .
When the US leaned on the EU to freeze Iranian bank accounts , since they supply a large amount of oil and natural gas to Europe , Iran withdrew $ 75 billion from EU banks in seconds .
That created considerable cash liquidity problems in the EU where Iran had those funds to conduct ' normal energy trade ' .
What was the ' chess move ' Iran used to go right around that US move ?
They have signed a mega - deal with Russia to supply oil and natural gas to Europe through Russia , which absolutely has the EU by the throat when it comes to oil and natural gas supply .
No one is going to fail to pay their energy bill to Russia lest they want to have their economy put on its knees .
Another interesting fact in the Baer interview is that Iran is ruled by a Proletariat and that is who has their finger on the ' alleged nuclear trigger ' .
Their President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , does not have authority to launch any missiles , nuclear or otherwise , at anyone .
That is not how their Islamic Republic of Iran is set up to function .
He can talk all he wants , he can make any statement , but he is not the authority who can make war on any nation .
Consider that fact and consider the Bush lunacy of his EU Missile Defense Shield .
You might better understand why the bristles on the back of the Russian Bear are standing up because that Bush Lie is aimed at Russia .
If you do not know what that means , it means DO NOT PROVOKE ANY MORE !
Of course , that is a fact and it is well known to both Israel and the US , so consider the ' false rhetoric ' coming out of the US and Tel Aviv .
Iran is not a threat to anyone unless provoked .
If provoked , Russia will respond and possibly China , too .
My continuing view from over here is turning up some other interesting facts .
I have been hearing about some rubs between Azerbaijan and the US but no details .
I have many contacts in Armenia , both personal and professional .
In finding another map of this Caspian Basin area , one in German , note the pipeline from Azerbaijan into Russia of all places .
It took a while to find out what that pipeline is all about and it is yet another loss for BushCo and their dreams of dominating this area of the world and their Grand Chessboard dreams of Energy Empire that now lays in dust - and was never anything but dust , hollow rhetoric , visions of hegemony and lies .

" Subsequently , the Baku specialists discovered vast amounts of gas in one of the fields regarded by the Western partners as sparse .
Thus , the grounds for political tensions withTurkmenistan and Kazakhstan became irrelevant .
On this background , Dmitry Medvedev , Gazprom 's CEO Alexey Miller , and Tatarstan 's leader Mintimer Shaimiyev undertook a tour involving Baku , Ashkhabad , and Astana , the capital of Kazakhstan .
This trip was followed with nervous comments in Western media : it was clear that Moscow was going to present some proposals that the Caspian states would not reject .
These rumors appeared to be true .
Both in Baku and Ashkhabad , Medvedev and Miller guaranteed purchase of local oil and gas for European - level prices , i.e. for a twice larger price than before , under the conditions of transit across Russia .
Simultaneously , Stroytransgaz , Gazprom 's construction affiliate , affirmed the schedule of construction of the Caspian Coastline Pipe Route , while Russian Railroads Corp. joined the Turkmenistan - Iran railway project .
The design , elaborated in Moscow , was a scathing blow for Steven Mann , Washington 's special envoy who had spent years manipulating Caspian states against one another and Russia . " < end insert >
The US is getting a trickle of oil out through Georgia but they still do not , and probably will never , have the " cross Caspian Sea " link from Turkmenbaschi to Baku .
The " mother lode " is on the east side of the Caspian Sea , not the Azerbaijan ­ Georgia side .
Since Bush cannot read a map , I am going to do the unthinkable .
Hey , Bush , you can get from Turkmenistan to the ocean due south through Iran .
Russia and Afghanistan and Pakistan are already making it clear you lost those other two pipeline routes .
You , Bush , might not like the terms but that is the only way you are ever going to get a pipeline out of the Caspian Basin , due to your lies , your arrogance and your stupidity .
Cut the deal or go down in flames as you deserve , George W Bush .

Near - optimal Character Animation with Continuous Control
Abstract
We present a new model for real - time character animation with multidimensional , interactive control .
The underlying motion engine is data - driven , enables rapid transitions , and automatically enforces foot - skate constraints without inverse kinematics .
On top of this motion space , our algorithm learns approximately optimal controllers which use a compact basis representation to guide the system through multidimensional state - goal spaces .
These controllers enable real - time character animation that fluidly responds to changing user directives and environmental constraints .

I timidly raise my hand .
I think you 're saying a good thing here , that all women are n't necessarily beat down and powerless and should n't be constantly portrayed as such , and certainly not as selling point for women 's magazines and news segments .
I think that 's great , really great .
But that 's one small media image in a melting pot of swirling memes , one that overflows with a different sort of destructive image of women - the kind that screams SEX ! , and never HUMAN BEING !
You speak of a world of where women are college educated , empowered , confident ladies in their twenties , which quite probably exists somewhere , but I 'm personally not familiar with it .
The majority of women in the USA and the vast , vast majority elsewhere do n't live in that world , and to say that in this post - feminism earth , no woman need suffer from low self - esteem , no woman is bombarded with messages that tell her she is not good enough , no woman wants more from her life but thinks she is n't good enough to get it , that 's ignorance .
These tragedies are everywhere .
I think about the trailer park I grew up in , and I have trouble thinking of a single woman who lived there who did n't have abysmal self - esteem .
Domestic violence was the social norm - women got beat , and that 's all there was to it .
These women took care of the children .
These women did n't go to college .
These women spent their lives primping and dieting in the hopes of securing a man who would sweep them off their feet , take them somewhere far away and wonderful that they could never dream of finding on their lonesome .
And when instead of Prince Charming , they got Mr. Wife beater , Mr. Alcoholic , Mr. Emotionally and Verbally Abusive , or even Mr. Not Too Bright and Not Too Motivated , they only blamed themselves , their own failure to be good enough to do better .
I think of the inner city high school I went to , where boys and girls alike were told that college was too expensive to be worth the trouble , and they were better off enrolling in one of the trade programs the school district offered , to become a cosmetologist or a welder .
I think of all the lovely young black girls , poor , uneducated , who threw any chance of a successful future away because they deemed it impossible for girls as stupid and insignificant as them to make it big in life , who ran with the gangs because it gave them a sense of power and belonging they found nowhere else , who learned from an early age that violence was just a way of life , that to be beaten and shot at and to beat and shoot at other people was simply a part of the give and take of human existence .
I think of these girls ' eyes staring out at me from behind the cold bars of jail cells , and how they really could n't tell you how they ended up like that , only that it made sense that they did , made sense in an ugly , ugly way .
I think about the United States , and the statistics of eating disorders , of rape , of childhood physical , sexual , verbal , and emotional abuse , of abusive adult relationships , of the gulf between what men are paid and what women are paid for the same jobs , of percentages of women holding public offices and leading corporations .
I think of the world outside of the United States , in countries where law and culture have n't been enlightened by feminist movements , where the experiences of women are often utterly horrifying .
I think about veiled women in Saudi Arabia , stoned to death on vague adultery charges , I think about twelve - year - old prostitutes in Thailand , I think about rural women in Costa Rica who must be content to bear children and work their fingers to the bone on their husband 's tiny farms because there is nothing else for them in life , even in this modern world .
I think of my own mother , who grew up educated middle - class , who grew up in four different countries and spoke three languages fluently , and how she thought so little of herself and had so little to aim for in life that she gradually fell apart , ended up a heroin addict in an abusive marriage , who finally ran away with her drug dealer in a last - ditch attempt to lead a different , better life .
And I think of myself .
I think of how years of beatings , rapes , torture , and hunger at the hands of my own father left me a scared and small shell of a girl .
I think of how , as a seven - year - old , I figured that I was n't a real person , but some sort of robot built to withstand pain so that other people would n't have to .
I think of how close I came to not ever finding myself , and how lucky I am to have had a good public library , loving grandparents who adopted me at age thirteen , and several wonderful therapists , how I owe my life to these things .
I think of my recent struggle with schizophrenia , how it feeds off of my low self - esteem and in turn , generates more , of the voices in my head that tell me how horrible I am with a merciless consistency .
I think of how I 'm writing here on Everything because I 'm often too shy to say what I mean about anything in real life , and how , even here , I 'm unsure of what I 'm writing and afraid of being rejected .
How I 'm sure that everybody else 's thoughts and opinions are better and more valid than those of a little sixteen - year - old nothing of a girl like me .
Where are all the women with abysmal self - esteem ?
Look a little closer at the world .
China will create three " protest pens " in the capital 's parks to allow people to demonstrate during the Olympics , an official said yesterday .
The move follows speculation as to whether the government , which strictly limits protests , would allow public displays of dissent , especially given that the games have already been the target of campaigns on issues ranging from media freedom to Darfur and Tibet .
" This will allow people to protest without disrupting the Olympics , " said Ni Jianping , the director of the Shanghai Institute of American Studies , who had lobbied for the creation of the zones .
But Human Rights
Watch attacked the decision , arguing that the restrictions undermined the right to demonstrate under international law .
Nicholas Bequelin , a spokesman for HRW , said : " The obstacles and deterrents are so high as to negate the right to demonstrate .
" We are also concerned about the possibility that the authorities might use the existence of these zones to justify repressive measures against demonstrators outside of the zones .
" Aggressive or systematic videotaping , requirement for individual registrations and excessive controls at the entry and exit points of the protest zones would amount to deterring protesters , who have legitimate concerns in China about possible retaliation afterwards . "
Protest zones have been created at previous games , including Athens in 2004 , because the International Olympic Committee 's charter bans demonstrations or " political , religious or racial propaganda " at Olympic venues or sites .
" We have dedicated places for demonstrations at several parks , " Liu Shaowu , the director of the security department at Beijing 's Olympics organising committee , told a news conference .
" Chinese law protects the legal right of people to hold lawful demonstrations and marches . "
He stressed that under Chinese law all demonstrations must be approved by police in advance , but declined to say whether that applied to the zones , or whether approval would be granted for protests outside them .
Human rights groups have already complained of a crackdown on dissent .
Reporters Without Borders said police arrested a prominent internet dissident this week for violating his probation terms .
Du Daobin , given a suspended sentence for subversion after posting essays online in support of another dissident , was arrested this week for posting articles on overseas websites and receiving guests without permission .
The family of another dissident , Ye Guozhu , said he was due for release this weekend after serving four years for organising protests against forced eviction , but had been taken away by police .
In remarks issued via the Chinese Human Rights Defenders network , his brother , Ye Guoqiang , said : " We believe that the police took him away to silence him during the games , and that he will not be released until after the Olympics , when most foreign journalists will have left Beijing . "
Xuanwu public security bureau referred the Guardian to the Xuanwu detention centre .
The centre said that the issue was a matter for the public security bureau .

It is impossible to exaggerate the environmental problem facing humanity in the twenty - first century .
Nearly fifteen years ago one of us observed : “ We have only four decades left in which to gain control over our major environmental problems if we are to avoid irreversible ecological decline . ” 1
Today , with a quarter - century still remaining in this projected time line , it appears to have been too optimistic .
Available evidence now strongly suggests that under a regime of business as usual we could be facing an irrevocable “ tipping point ” with respect to climate change within a mere decade .
2
Other crises such as species extinction ( percentages of bird , mammal , and fish species “ vulnerable or in immediate danger of extinction ” are “ now measured in double digits ” ) ; 3 the rapid depletion of the oceans ’ bounty ; desertification ; deforestation ; air pollution ; water shortages / pollution ; soil degradation ; the imminent peaking of world oil production ( creating new geopolitical tensions ) ; and a chronic world food crisis — all point to the fact that the planet as we know it and its ecosystems are stretched to the breaking point .
The moment of truth for the earth and human civilization has arrived .
To be sure , it is unlikely that the effects of ecological degradation in our time , though enormous , will prove “ apocalyptic ” for human civilization within a single generation , even under conditions of capitalist business as usual .
Measured by normal human life spans , there is doubtless considerable time still left before the full effect of the current human degradation of the planet comes into play .
Yet , theperiod remaining in which we can avert future environmental catastrophe , before it is essentially out of our hands , is much shorter .
Indeed , the growing sense of urgency of environmentalists has to do with the prospect of various tipping points being reached as critical ecological thresholds are crossed , leading to the possibility of a drastic contraction of life on earth .
Such a tipping point , for example , would be an ice free Arctic , which could happen within two decades or less ( some scientists believe as early as 2013 ) .
Already in summer 2007 the Arctic lost in a single week an area of ice almost twice the size of Britain .
The vanishing Arctic ice cap means an enormous reduction in the earth ’s reflectivity ( albedo ) , thereby sharply increasing global warming ( a positive feedback known as the “ albedo flip ” ) .
At the same time , the rapid disintegration of the ice sheets in West Antarctica and Greenland points to rising world sea levels , threatening coastal regions and islands .
4
The state of the existing “ planetary emergency ” with respect to climate change was captured this year by James Hansen , director of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the leading U.S. climatologist :
Our home planet is dangerously near a tipping point at which human - made greenhouse gases reach a level where major climate changes can proceed mostly under their own momentum .
Warming will shift climatic zones by intensifying the hydrologic cycle , affecting freshwater availability and human health .
We will see repeated coastal tragedies associated with storms and continuously rising sea levels .
The implications are profound , and the only resolution is for humans to move to a fundamentally different energy pathway within a decade .
Otherwise , it will be too late for one - third of the world ’s animal and plant species and millions of the most vulnerable members of our own species .
5
According to environmentalist Lester Brown in his Plan B 3.0 , “ We are crossing natural thresholds that we cannot see and violating deadlines that we do not recognize .
Nature is the time keeper , but we can not see the clock … .
We are in a race between tipping points in the earth ’s natural systems and those in the world ’s political systems .
Which will tip first ? ” 6
As the clock continues to tick and little is accomplished it is obvious that the changes to be made have to be all the more sudden and massive to stave off ultimate disaster .
This raises the question of more revolutionary social change as an ecological as well as social necessity .
Yet , if revolutionary solutions are increasingly required to address the ecological problem , this is precisely what the existing social system is guaranteed not to deliver .
Today ’s environmentalism is aimed principally at those measures necessary to lessen the impact of the economy on the planet ’s ecology without challenging the economic system that in its very workings produces the immense environmental problems we now face .
What we call “ the environmental problem ” is in the end primarily a problem of political economy .
Even the boldest establishment economic attempts to address climate change fall far short of what is required to protect the earth — since the “ bottom line ” that constrains all such plans under capitalism is the necessity of continued , rapid growth in production and profits .
The Dominant Economics of Climate Change
The economic constraint on environmental action can easily be seen by looking at what is widely regarded as the most far - reaching establishment attempt to date to deal with The Economics of Climate Change in the form of a massive study issued in 2007 under that title , commissioned by the UK Treasury Office .
7
Subtitled the Stern Review after the report ’s principal author Nicholas Stern , a former chief economist of the World Bank , it is widely viewed as the most important , and most progressive mainstream treatment of the economics of global warming .
8
The Stern Review focuses on the target level of carbon dioxide equivalent ( CO2e ) concentration in the atmosphere necessary to stabilize global average temperature at no more than 3 °C ( 5.4 °F ) over pre-industrial levels .
( CO2e refers to the six Kyoto greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide [ CO2 ] , methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons , and sulfur hexafluoride — all expressed in terms of the equivalent amount of CO2 .
While CO2 concentration in the atmosphere today is 387 parts per million [ ppm ] , CO2e is around 430 ppm . )
The goal proposed by most climatologists has been to try to prevent increases in global temperature of more than 2 °C ( 3.6 °F ) above pre-industrial levels , requiring stabilization of atmospheric CO2e at 450 ppm , since beyond that all sorts of positive feedbacks and tipping points are likely to come into play , leading to an uncontrollable acceleration of climate change .
Indeed , James Hansen and other climatologists at NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have recently argued : “ If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted , paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm .
” 9
The Stern Review , however , settles instead for a global average temperature increase of no more than 3 °C ( a threshold beyond which the environmental effects would undoubtedly be absolutely calamitous ) , which it estimates can likely be achieved if CO2e in the atmosphere were stabilized at 550 ppm , roughly double pre-industrial levels .
Yet , the Stern Review acknowledges that current environmental sensitivities “ imply that there is up to a one - in - five chance that the world would experience a warming in excess of 3 °C above pre-industrial [ levels ] even if greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilised at today ’s level of 430 ppm CO2e . ”
Moreover , it goes on to admit that “ for stablisation at 550 ppm CO2e , the chance of exceeding 3 °C rises to 30 – 70 % . ”
Or as it states further on , a 550 ppm CO2e suggests “ a 50:50 chance of a temperature increase above or below 3 °C , and the Hadley Centre model predicts a 10 % chance of exceeding 5 °C [ 9 °F ] even at this level . ”
A 3 °C increase would bring the earth ’s average global temperature to a height last seen in the “ middle Pliocene around 3 million years ago . ”
Furthermore , such an increase might be enough , the Stern Review explains , to trigger a shutdown of the ocean ’s thermohaline circulation warming Western Europe , creating abrupt climate change , thereby plunging Western Europe into Siberian - like conditions .
Other research suggests that water flow in the Indus may drop by 90 percent by 2100 if global average temperatures rise by 3 °C , potentially affecting hundreds of millions of people .
Studies by climatologists indicate that at 550 ppm CO2e there is more than a 5 percent chance that global average temperature could rise in excees of 8 °C ( 14.4 °F ) .
All of this suggests that a stabilization target of 550 ppm CO2e could be disastrous for the earth as we know it as well as its people .
Why then , if the risks to the planet and civilization are so enormous , does the Stern Review emphasize attempting to keep global warming at 3 °C by stabilizing CO2e at 550 ppm ( what it describes at one point as “ the upper limit to the stabilisation range ” ) ?
To answer this it is necessary to turn to some additional facts of a more economic nature .
Here it is useful to note that an atmospheric concentration level close to 550 ppm CO2e would result by 2050 if greenhouse gas emissions simply continued at present levels without any increases in the intervening years .
However , as the Stern Review itself notes , this is unrealistic under business as usual since global greenhouse gas emissions can be expected to continue to increase on a “ rapidly rising trajectory . ”
Hence , an atmospheric CO2e level of 550 ppm under more realistic assumptions would be plausibly reached by 2035 .
This would increase the threat of 750 ppm CO2e ( or more ) and a rise in global average temperature in excess of 4.3 °C ( 7.7 °F ) within the next few decades after that .
( Indeed , IPCC scenarios include the possibility that atmospheric carbon could rise to 1,200 ppm and global average temperature by as much as 6.3 °C [ 11.3 °F ] by 2100 . )
To counter this business - as - usual scenario , the Stern Review proposes a climate stabilization regime in which greenhouse gas emissions would peak by 2015 and then drop 1 percent per year after that , so as to stabilize at a 550 ppm CO2e ( with a significant chance that the global average temperature increase would thereby be kept down to 3°C ) .
But , given the enormous dangers , why not aim at deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , a lower level of atmospheric CO2e , and a smaller increase in global average temperature ?
After all most climatologists have been calling for the stabilization of atmospheric CO2e 450 ppm or less , keeping the global temperature increase at about 2 °C above pre-industrial levels .
While Hansen and his colleagues at NASA ’s Goddard Institute have now gone even further arguing that the target should be 350 ppm CO2 .
The Stern Review is very explicit , however , that such a radical mitigation of the problem should not be attempted .
The costs to the world economy of ensuring that atmospheric CO2e stabilized at present levels or below would be prohibitive , destabilizing capitalism itself .
“ Paths requiring very rapid emissions cuts , ” we are told , “ are unlikely to be economically viable . ”
If global greenhouse gas emissions peaked in 2010 the annual emissions reduction rate necessary to stabilize atmospheric carbon at 450 ppm , the Stern Review suggests , would be 7 percent , with emissions dropping by about 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
This is viewed as economically insupportable .
Hence , the Stern Review ’ sown preferred scenario , as indicated , is a 550 ppm target that would see global greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2015 , with the emission cuts that followed at a rate of 1 percent per year .
By 2050 the reduction in the overall level of emissions ( from 2005 levels ) in this scenario would only be 25 percent .
( The report also considers , with less enthusiasm , an in - between 500 ppm target , peaking in 2010 and requiring a 3 percent annual drop in global emissions . )
Only the 550 ppm target , the Stern Review suggests , is truly economically viable because “ it is difficult to secure emission cuts faster than about 1 % per year except in instances of recession ” or as the result of a major social upheaval such as the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Indeed , the only actual example that the Stern Review is able to find of a sustained annual cut in greenhouse gas emissions of 1 percent or more , coupled with economic growth , among leading capitalist states was the United Kingdom in 1990 – 2000 .
Due to the discovery of North Sea oil and natural gas , the United Kingdom was able to switch massively from coal to gas in power generation , resulting in a 1 percent average annual drop in its greenhouse gas emissions during that decade .
France came close to such a 1 percent annual drop in 1977 –2003 , reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by .6 percent per year due to a massive switch to nuclear power .
By far the biggest drop for a major state was the 5.2 percent per year reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the Former Soviet Union in 1989 – 98 .
This however went hand in hand with a social - system breakdown and a drastic shrinking of the economy .
All of this signals that any reduction in CO2e emissions beyond around 1 percent per year would make it virtually impossible to maintain strong economic growth — the bottom line of the capitalist economy .
Consequently , in order to keep the treadmill of profit and production going the world needs to risk environmental Armageddon.10
Accumulation and the Planet
None of this should surprise us .
Capitalism since its birth , as Paul Sweezy wrote in “ Capitalism and the Environment , ” has been “ a juggernaut driven by the concentrated energy of individuals and small groups single - mindedly pursuing their own interests , checked only by their mutual competition , and controlled in the short run by the impersonal forces of the market and in the longer run , when the market fails , by devastating crises . ”
The inner logic of such a system manifests itself in the form of an incessant drive for economic expansion for the sake of class - based profits and accumulation .
Nature and human labor are exploited to the fullest to fuel this juggernaut , while the destruction wrought on each is externalized so as to not fall on the system ’s own accounts .
“ Implicit in the very concept of this system , ” Sweezy continued , “ are interlocked and enormously powerful drives to both creation and destruction .
On the plus side , the creative drive relates to what humankind can get out of nature for its own uses ; on the negative side , the destructive drive bears most heavily on nature ’s capacity to respond to the demands placed on it .
Sooner or later , of course , these two drives are contradictory and incompatible . ”
Capitalism ’s overexploitation of nature ’s resource taps and waste sinks eventually produces the negative result of undermining both , first on a merely regional , but later on a world and even planetary basis ( affecting the climate itself ) .
Seriously addressing environmental crises requires “ a reversal , not merely a slowing down , of the underlying trends of the last few centuries . ”
This , however , cannot be accomplished without economic regime change .11
With climate change now more and more an establishment concern , and attempts to avert it now increasingly institutionalized in the established order , some have pointed to the “ death of environmentalism ” as an oppositional movement in society .
12 However , if some environmentalists have moved toward capitalist - based strategies in the vain hope of saving the planet by these means , others have moved in the opposite direction : toward a critique of capitalism as inherently ecologically destructive .
A case in point is James Gustave Speth .
Speth has been called the “ ultimate insider ” within the environmental movement .
He served as chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality under President Jimmy Carter , founded the World Resources Institute , co-founded the Natural Resources Defense Council , was a senior adviser in Bill Clinton ’s transition team , and administered the United Nations Development Programme from 1993 to 1999 .
At present he is dean of the prestigious Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies .
Speth is a winner of Japan ’s Blue Planet Prize .
Recently , however , in his Bridge at the Edge of the World : Capitalism , the Environment , and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability ( 2008 ) , Speth has emerged as a devastating critic of capitalism ’s destruction of the environment .
In this radical rethinking , he has chosen to confront the full perils brought on by the present economic system , with its pursuit of growth and accumulation at any cost .
“ Capitalism as we know it today , ” he writes , “ is incapable of sustaining the environment . ”
The crucial problem from an environmental perspective , he believes , is exponential economic growth , which is the driving element of capitalism .
Little hope can be provided in this respect by so - called “ dematerialization ” ( the notion that growth can involve a decreasing impact on the environment ) , since it can be shown that the expansion of output overwhelms all increases in efficiency in throughput of materials and energy .
Hence , one can only conclude that “ right now … growth is the enemy of [ the ] environment .
Economy and environment remain in collision . ”
Here the issue of capitalism becomes unavoidable .
“ Economic growth is modern capitalism ’s principal and most prized product . ”
Speth favorably quotes Samuel Bowles and Richard Edwards ’s Understanding Capitalism , which bluntly stated : “ Capitalism is differentiated from other economic systems by its drive to accumulate , its predisposition toward change , and its built - in tendency to expand . ”
The principal environmental problem for Speth then is capitalism as the “ operating system ” of the modern economy .
“ Today ’s corporations have been called ‘ externalizing machines . ’ ”
Indeed , “ there are fundamental biases in capitalism that favor the present over the future and the private over the public . ”
Quoting the system ’s own defenders , Robert Samuleson and William Nordhaus , in the seventeenth ( 2001 ) edition of their textbook on Macroeconomics , Speth points out that capitalismis the quintessential “ Ruthless Economy , ” engaged “ in the relentless pursuit of profits . ”
Building on this critique , Speth goes on to conclude in his book that : ( 1 ) “ today ’s system of political economy , referred to here as modern capitalism , is destructive of the environment , and not in a minor way but in a way that profoundly threatens the planet ” ( 2 ) “ the affluent societies have reached or soon will reach the point where , as Keynes put it , the economic problem has been solved … there is enough to go around ” ( 3 ) “ in the more affluent societies , modern capitalism is no longer enhancing human well - being ” ( 4 ) “ the international social movement for change — which refers to itself as ‘ the irresistible rise of global anti-capitalism ’— is stronger than many imagine and will grow stronger ; there is a coalescing of forces : peace , social justice , community , ecology , feminism — a movement of movements ” ( 5 ) “ people and groups are busily planting the seeds of change through a host of alternative arrangements , and still other attractive directions for upgrading to a new operating system have been identified ” ( 6 ) “ the end of the Cold War…opens the door … for the questioning of today ’s capitalism . ”
Speth does not actually embrace socialism , which he associates , in the Cold War manner , with Soviet - type societies in their most regressive form .
Thus he argues explicitly for a “ nonsocialist ” alternative to capitalism .
Such a system would make use of markets ( but not the self - regulating market society of traditional capitalism ) and would promote a “ New Sustainability World ” or a “ Social Greens World ” ( also called “ Eco-Communalism ” ) as depicted by the Global Scenario Group .
The latter scenario has been identified with radical thinkers like William Morris ( who was inspired by both Marx and Ruskin ) .
In this sense , Speth ’s arguments are not far from that of the socialist movement of the twenty - first century , which is aimed at the core values of social justice and ecological sustainability .
The object is to create a future in which generations still to come will be able to utilize their creative abilities to the fullest , while having their basic needs met : a result made possible only through the rational reorganization by the associated producers of the human metabolism with nature .
13
Such rational reorganization of the metabolism between nature and society needs to be directed not simply at climate change but also at a whole host of other environmental problems .
Some of these are addressed in the present issue : the geopolitics of peak oil ( John Bellamy Foster ) , the production of biofuels as a liquid fuel alternative and its consequences ( Fred Magdoff ) , the economics of climate change ( Minqi Li ) , the science of climate change ( John W. Farley ) , the ocean crisis ( Brett Clark and Rebecca Clausen ) , the problem of large dams ( Rohan D’Souza ) , and the world water crisis ( Maude Barlow ) .
Other ecological crises of great importance are not , however , dealt with here : species extinction ( and loss of biological diversity in general ) , deforestation , desertification , soil degradation , acid rain , the proliferation of toxic wastes ( including in living tissues ) , market - regulated biotechnology , urban congestion , population growth , and animal rights .
No single issue captures the depth and breadth of what we call “ the environmental problem , ” which encompasses all of these ecological contradictions of our society and more .
If we are facing a “ moment of truth ” with respect to ecology today , it has to do with the entire gamut of capitalism ’s effects on natural ( and human ) reproduction .
Any attempt to solve one of these problems ( such as climate change ) without addressing the others is likely to fail , since these ecological crises , although distinct in various ways , typically share common causes .
In our view , only a unified vision that sees human production as not only social , but also rooted in a metabolic relation to nature , will provide the necessary basis to confront an ecological rift that is now as wide as the planet .
Such a unified vision is implicit in the articles included in this issue .
A more explicit treatment of the political aspects of this struggle will appear in a second special issue of Monthly Review on ecology ( meant to complement this one ) to be published this coming fall .
Why Not ?
In 1884 , William Morris , one of the great creative artists , revolutionary socialist intellectuals , and environmental thinkers of the late nineteenth century , wrote an article entitled “ Why Not ? ” for the socialist journal Commonweal .
He was especially concerned with the fact that most people , including many socialists in his time , in rebelling against the evils of capitalism , tended to picture the future in terms that were not that far removed from many of the worst , most environmentally and humanly destructive , aspects of capitalism itself .
“ Now under the present Capitalist system , ” Morris observed ,
it is difficult to see anything which might stop the growth of these horrible brick encampments ; its tendency is undoubtedly to depopulate the country and small towns for the advantage of the great commercial and manufacturing centres ; but this evil , and it is a monstrous one , will be no longer a necessary evil when we have got rid of land monopoly , manufacturing for the profit of individuals , and the stupid waste of competitive distribution .
Looking beyond the “ terror and the grinding toil ” in which most people were oppressed , Morris argued , there was a need to recognize other ends of social existence : most notably “ the pleasure of life to be looked forward to by Socialists . ”
“ Why , ” he asked ,
should one third of England be so stifled and poisoned with smoke that over the greater part of Yorkshire ( for instance ) the general idea must be that sheep are naturally black ?
And why must Yorkshire and Lancashire rivers run mere filth and dye ?
Profits will have it so : no one any longer pretends that it would not be easy to prevent such crimes against decent life : but the ‘ organizers of labour , ’ who might better be called ‘ organizers of filth , ’ know that it would n’t pay ; and as they are for the most part of the year safe in their country seats , or shooting — crofters ’ lives — in the Highlands , or yachting in the Mediterranean , they rather like the look of the smoke country for a change as something , it is to be supposed , stimulating to their imaginations concerning — well , we must not get theological .
In rejecting all of this , Morris asked , was it not possible to create a more decent , more beautiful , more fulfilling , more healthy , less hell - like way of living , in which all had a part in the “ share of earth the Common Mother ” and the sordid world of “ profit - grinding ” was at last brought to an end ?
Why Not?14

The Stern Review has been criticized by more conservative mainstream economists , including William Nordhaus , for its ethical choices , which , it is claimed , place too much emphasis on the future as opposed to present - day values by adopting a much lower discount rate on future costs and benefits as compared to other , more standard economic treatments such as that of Nordhaus .
This then gives greater urgency to today ’s environmental problem .
Nordhaus discounts the future at 6 percent a year ;
Stern by less than a quarter of that at 1.4 percent .
This means that for Stern having a trillion dollars a century from now is worth $ 247 billion today , while for Nordhaus it is only worth $ 2.5 billion .
Nordhaus calls the Stern Review a “ radical revision of the economics of climate change ” and criticizes it for imposing “ exessively large emissions reductions in the short run . ”

The sunspot number follows a cycle of somewhat variable length , averaging 11 years .
The most recent minimum was in March last year .
The new cycle , No.24 , was supposed to start soon after that , with a gradual build - up in sunspot numbers .
It did n't happen .
The first sunspot appeared in January this year and lasted only two days .
A tiny spot appeared last Monday but vanished within 24 hours .
Another little spot appeared this Monday .
Pray that there will be many more , and soon . [....]
That the rapid temperature decline in 2007 coincided with the failure of cycle No.24 to begin on schedule is not proof of a causal connection but it is cause for concern .
It is time to put aside the global warming dogma , at least to begin contingency planning about what to do if we are moving into another little ice age , similar to the one that lasted from 1100 to 1850 .
The battle between “ The Boondocks ” creator Aaron McGruder and Black Entertainment Television is about to get a lot more animated .
Two second - season episodes of the biting cartoon series that attack the black - themed network but were never aired -- possibly because of corporate pressure -- are slated for DVD release Tuesday .
The pair of shows take aim at BET ’s top executives and lampoon what it views as the cable network ’s harmful negative imagery and stereotypes that work as a “ destructive ” force within African American culture .
The episodes amplify a familiar chord struck by McGruder , who has regularly targeted BET , first in his politically and culturally charged comic strip , published in more than 300 newspapers , and subsequently in the TV adaptation on Cartoon Network ’s edgy late - night Adult Swim .
But these particular installments , which like many in the animated series feature violence , foul language and frequent use of the N - word , apparently went too far in mocking BET ’s top brass .
In “ The Hunger Strike , ” a main character refuses to eat until BET is off the air and its executives commit hara - kiri .

And in “ The Uncle Ruckus Reality Show , ” a foul - mouthed black man who hates African Americans gets a show on BET .
The hot - button series centers on two young black boys , militant Huey Freeman and his gangsta - wannabe younger brother , Riley , who live in the suburbs with their grandfather .
When BET executives learned of the shows , they complained to Turner - owned Cartoon Networks and Sony Pictures Television , which produces “ The Boondocks , ” and urged that they be blocked from broadcast , according to sources close to the program who requested anonymity for fear of network reprisal .
Initially , Cartoon Network resisted , but when legal action was threatened , the episodes , written by McGruder and co-executive producer Rodney Barnes , were yanked , according to sources .
Both McGruder and Barnes declined to comment .
Executives at Turner and Viacom - owned BET , however , deny there were any discussions about removing the programs between the two companies .
Still , Turner officials would not explain why the two installments were eventually withheld .

Both episodes are highlighted by fierce satirical attacks on two top BET executives , portrayed in thinly disguised caricatures .
Chairman and Chief Executive Debra L. Lee , who succeeded the network ’s founder , Robert Johnson , is shown as Debra Leevil , patterned after “ Dr. Evil ” in the “ Austin Powers ” films .
Leevil declares in a staff meeting : “ Our leader Bob Johnson had a dream , a dream that would accomplish what hundreds of years of slavery , Jim Crow and malt liquor could not accomplish -- the destruction of black people . ”
And BET President of Entertainment Reginald Hudlin is depicted as Wedgie Rudlin , a culturally insensitive buffoon coasting on his Ivy League education .
Hudlin , a former friend of McGruder , is ironically credited as an executive producer on the series , the end result of a professional partnership that ended bitterly over creative differences before the series premiered in 2005 .
A BET spokesperson said that the network was aware of the episodes and did not , as a network that runs its own satirical content , begrudge those who made fun of its programming .

The DVD release features stinging commentary from McGruder and Barnes about the episodes , which are uncut .
In the introduction , McGruder said he went after BET because network executives , in his view , failed to elevate the network ’s standards -- something Hudlin had pointedly promised to do when joining the network three years ago .
“ I was looking for changes and improvements , and I did n’t see any , ” McGruder said on the DVD .
“ I did n’t see them .
So I said , OK , it ’s fair game .
It ’s hard not to address it .
It really was an important part of the strip . ”
Because of legal reasons , he adds , he cannot mention the real names of the people satirized in the episodes .
Barnes added : “ You expect white television to present black people in a particular way .
The anger comes from black television portraying us in a particular way .
That brings out a different sense of frustration , and at the heart of these episodes is that frustration . ”

As gas prices increase , so will telecommuting and America ’s ability to make the most of its benefits .
Although the appeal of telecommuting is clear and the number of telecommuters is rising , people would be even more inclined to dial in from home if tax rules were n’t stacked against them .
Some telecommuters must pay income taxes in more than one state on wages they earn at home .
So here ’s one potential positive outcome of rising gas prices : people who want to telecommute will join together with their employers , who want to retain them , to agitate to change these policies .
Once legal obstacles like these are removed , the nation will realize telecommuting ’s promise .
The benefits include reductions in traffic , carbon emissions and the cost of building transportation infrastructure ; increased employment among older and disabled Americans ; and more time for leisure and work for employees who are n’t spending hours in cars and on trains .
We ’ll have exorbitant gas prices to thank .
For a nice safe NPOV ( “ Neutral Point of View ” ) discussion of the issues , see Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia .
My experience , which is n’t NPOV at all , is that Deletionists are knuckle - dragging droolers , walking vacant spaces , and as a side - effect generally , well , what ’s the word I ’m looking for ?
“ Wrong . ”
What got me involved was word that the Deletionist undead were shambling in the direction of _why ’s entry .
Oh , and by the way , apparently it ’s somehow uncool that I entered the debate because I heard about it somewhere .
This one is obvious ; _why is one of the handful of people who constitute the public face of Ruby .
Some of his published code snippets make shivers run up and down my spine .
Several of his libraries — most notably , I suppose , Hpricot — are very widely used .
He ’s written a popular online book .
I ’ve never met him but would very much like to .
Yes , he ’s eccentric .
Yes , he conceals his real name .
Yes , he would almost certainly be happier if the entry were removed .
So what ?
Wikipedia without that entry would be less accurate , less complete , and less useful .
In this particular case , the arguments from the deletionists are jargon - laden ( hint : real experts use language that the people they ’re talking to can understand ) , and either stupid or vacuous .
Which is entirely consistent with my experience .
Are the deletionists simply , as it seems , reveling in their own inadequacies ?
This came up on Twitter last night and Jeff Atwood put it well : “ The fatal flaw of deletionism is the mindset of deciding what someone else should find interesting . ”
Jeepers , what kind of impoverished soul does it take to delight in removing accurate and potentially - useful information from the permanent record based on the subjective and silly notion of “ Notability ” ?
A little thought - experiment is in order :
What harm would ensue were Wikipedia to contain an accurate if slightly boring entry on someone who was just an ordinary person and entirely fame - free ?
Well , Wikipedia ’s “ encyclopedia - ness ” might be impaired ... but I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was to serve the Net ’s users , not worry about how closely it adheres to the traditional frameworks of the reference publishing industry ?
I suggest the deletionist wankers go and cluster around an alternate online reference tome which has articles only about God , Immanuel Kant , and Britney Spears .
Notability is not in question , so they should be happy .
US Government to Intervene to Prevent US Dollar Collapse
While risk appetite has increased with equity markets having a renewed bout of misplaced exuberance , this is likely to be short lived as equity markets experience another dead cat bounce .
Barclays reports overnight that their “ sentiment - based equity risk indicator remains within extremely bearish territory , and suggests that equities may continue to sell - off aggressively . ”
Poor returns and volatility in equity markets internationally is leading to safe haven diversification into gold .
With the outlook for equities and bonds looking increasingly uncertain ( especially in the light of the onward march of inflation in the U.S. and internationally ) , gold is set to continue to outperform other major asset classes for the foreseeable future .
In his testimony yesterday , Ben Bernanke , stated that “ dollar Intervention should be done rarely ” but that it “ may be justified in disorderly times .
” The FT reported overnight that sovereign wealth funds are cutting their exposure to the dollar due to increasing concerns regarding the U.S. financial system and economy .
Central banks internationally are doing likewise and western central banks have sharply decreased their gold sales and central banks in Asia , South America and the Middle East are becoming net buyers of gold again .
Due to the real risk of a run on the dollar , the U.S. government and many others are openly talking about intervention in currency markets to support the dollar by buying dollars and it is likely that this intervention might also take the form of selling gold , the anti dollar , in order to support the dollar .
Reuters '
Mike Dolan wrote yesterday that “ Three days before the last bout of coordinated central bank intervention to calm world currency markets , the International Monetary Fund 's top economist opined : " If not now , when ? "
Many experts are now asking the same .
In 2000 , when Michael Mussa urged the world 's big central banks to calm the markets , it was the euro 's seemingly endless slide which was perceived to be destabilising the world economy .
Now , it is the plight of the U.S. dollar that is ringing alarm bells .
The greenback set record lows again on Tuesday in its alarming downward spiral as severe questions are being asked by overseas investors about the financial reliability of the world 's biggest economy and its financial obligations .
Once lost , investor confidence can take years to restore .
The risk to the dollar in that environment is stark and given few governments around the world have any interest in seeing a further devaluation of the U.S. currency , support for concerted intervention is on the rise .
The dollar 's decline has clearly exaggerated oil and food prices worldwide , complicating monetary policies from the United States to the euro zone and Britain as well as to the export - oriented economies of Asia and the Middle East .
As the world economy slows after a year of credit turmoil , dollar - exaggerated inflation has tied the hands of central banks everywhere from cutting interest rates , and dollar losses also squeeze the export - driven growth engines of emerging economies .
" The United States should consider intervening on the foreign exchanges , " said Jim O'Neill , chief global economist at Goldman Sachs in London .
" The dollar 's ongoing weakness and aggravation of the oil price is a threat to the whole world .
There 's a danger of a vicious circle developing here -- the dollar is declining across the board , oil prices are still rising and both are causing simultaneous inflation damage .
They can't just stand idly by and watch all this happen without a fight , " O'Neill added .
Goldman Sachs are not alone in warning of the possibility of dollar - supportive intervention .
" The conditions for successful dollar supportive coordinated intervention are now starting to fall into place , " economists at French bank BNP Paribas told clients on Wednesday , saying the most important factor was a growing global consensus . ”
Meanwhile , Hans Redeker , global head of foreign exchange at BNP Paribas , told " Squawk Box Europe " on Monday that an intervention to prop up the U.S. dollar is very likely if the greenback 's slide continues .
Despite verbally supporting a strong dollar , U.S. authorities had preferred a softer currency over the past years to rein in a widening trade deficit , but with inflation on the rise this is not an option anymore , Redeker said .
" We are going to see intervention in the dollar when we see the first undershoot in the dollar , " Redeker said .
" Inflation expectations are undermining the bond market and impose a risk premium on the long end of the market . "
Working Group on Financial Markets
Treasury Secretary Paulson said last month that he would never rule out currency intervention as a potential policy tool .
He did not spell out what this currency intervention would entail but it is likely that any such currency intervention would involve the Working Group on Financial Markets ( or Plunge Protection Team ) buying the dollar through proxies on Wall Street such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan in order to support the dollar .
It is quite possible that this would also involve selling gold in order to support the dollar ( as was done by the London Gold Pool in the 1960s ) as has been alleged by GATA .
Given the severity of the problems facing the U.S. financial system and economy and the clearly stated intentions of senior U.S. officials in this regard , it would be naïve to absolutely rule out official intervention in the gold markets today and in the coming months .
Artificial Government Manipulation to Fail and Shows Very Strong Fundamentals of Gold
While this could lead to short term weakness in the gold price , it would be very bullish for gold in the medium to long term as it would clearly show that the fundamentals of the dollar are very weak and conversely the fundamentals of gold are very strong .
Many investors and institutions internationally would take positions accordingly in anticipation of free market forces and real economic fundamentals resulting in markets reaching their corresponding fair value as they always do – this fair value for gold is likely to be multiples of its current price .
Today 's Data and Influences
The financial diary is dominated by events in the US today .
Key earnings reports will be monitored and the US housing market will be in focus again with starts and permits data scheduled .
Meanwhile , the Philly Fed index will give some insights into the economic activity in July .
Finally , the weekly jobless numbers will be monitored for signs of further deterioration in the economy .

They can't do that forever , because sooner or later they will run out of gold .
Hunting Rifle Accuracy :
Enough is Enough !
By Chuck Hawks
I believe it was Townsend Whelen who wrote that , " Only accurate rifles are interesting . "
As a general proposition I would tend to agree with him .
Few things are more frustrating than a firearm that cannot be made to consistently hit the target .
Accuracy is important in a hunting rifle , but not all important .
Especially on the Internet , accuracy has taken on an almost mythical status .
No one seems willing to admit to shooting groups larger than 1 minute of angle ( MOA ) .
I have read absurd discussions on shooting forums about how to shave 1/10th MOA from a hunting rifle 's performance and postings from ( obviously inexperienced ) shooters distressed because their new rifle could not produce sub - 1 " groups at 100 yards .
It is as if these shooters are living in some sort of alternative reality .
Professional gun writers contribute to this mythology by routinely reporting rifle " tests " in which every advertiser 's smokepole routinely shoots 1 " groups ( or smaller ) at 100 yards .
Ditto for every factory load , regardless of caliber or purpose .
Sure they do !
I have written it before and I will write it again : these groups are achieved on a word processor , not in the field .
At best what the writer means is that once , when the stars were momentarily aligned in the sky , he shot a 1 " group with the test rifle .
He will never admit in print that he shot nine other groups ranging in size from 2 " to 4 " with the same rifle .
However , the inexperienced and the gullible take these " test reports " to heart .
The most absurd exaggeration is accepted without question , and endlessly repeated ( and embellished ) online .
The boldest liars become authorities on marksmanship and rifle performance .
It would be depressing if it were not so absurd !
Accuracy is relative .
Realistically , there is no such thing as absolute accuracy , by which I mean a rifle capable of 0.0 MOA accuracy .
Some specialized rifles can come very close , shooting what may look like one - hole groups , but there is always some variation , caused by the fact that no rifle or bullet is truly perfect .
There is always some manufacturing tolerance , a tiny " plus or minus " factor in anything made by man that falls short of absolute perfection .
Accuracy can be defined in terms of group size at a given range , such as a 1 " three shot group at 100 yards or 100 meters , measured from center to center of the points of impact .
It can also be defined in terms of the angular dispersion of the bullets .
Angle is described in terms of degrees , minutes of arc and seconds of arc .
There are 360 degrees in a full circle , 60 minutes of arc in one degree and 60 seconds of arc in one arc - minute .
For general purposes , one minute of angle equals a 1 " group ( center to center ) at 100 yards .
What is meant by the term " practical " as applied to accuracy ?
The dictionary defines practical as : " Capable of being used or put into effect ; useful . "
So the next question must be : accuracy useful for hunting what kind of game , at what range ?
For the purposes of this little piece the answer to that question are the common species of antelope , goat , sheep and deer hunted in North America ( and similar size game worldwide ) .
These are often called medium size big game animals , or sometimes just medium game , and they range in size from the smallish pronghorn antelope and sub-species of whitetail deer weighing about 90 pounds on the hoof to sheep , mountain goats and mule deer than might average up to 200 pounds .
Even very large members of these species seldom exceed 300 pounds in live weight .
The smallest of these animals offers about an 8 " diameter heart - lung kill area and most offer at least a 10 " kill area .
So , to be conservative , let 's say that our rifle needs to be able to put its bullets ( from a cold barrel ) into about a 6 " circle at whatever range our skill and the trajectory of the cartridge we are using allows .
This leaves a little room for error on even the smallest medium game animals .
For the hunter using a 100 - 150 yard hunting rifle , such as rifles chambered for what are fundamentally pistol cartridges ( .357 Magnum , .44-40 , .44 Magnum , etc. ) or low pressure cartridges like the .38 - 55 and .45 - 70 , a 4 MOA group will suffice .
4 " groups at 100 yards do n't look very impressive at the range , but 4 MOA groups mean all bullets within a 6 " circle at 150 yards , about the maximum useful range of this class of cartridges .
A .44 Magnum rifle that will put all of its bullets into a 4 " circle at 100 yards is a deadly deer rifle , as accurate as it needs to be .
A 200 yard hunting rifle , such as a .30 - 30 , .35 Remington , or .444 Marlin needs to print 3 MOA ( 3 " ) groups at 100 yards .
This means that all of the bullets will be landing inside of a 6 " circle at 200 yards .
A North American hunter can take any deer , sheep , pronghorn , or goat with such a rifle .
In Townsend Whelen 's day , few hunting rifles would shoot better than that .
Many will today , but practically speaking it does n't matter .
3 MOA is good enough for 100 % kills out to at least 200 yards .
A 200 yard rifle that shoots 1 MOA groups is not one whit deadlier than one that shoots 3 MOA groups .
The hunter with a long range rifle capable of taking medium game at 300 yards ( such as a 6 mm Remington , .25-06 , .270 Winchester , 7 mm Remington Magnum or .300 Winchester Magnum ) , needs a rifle that averages 2 MOA groups .
Those 2 " groups at 100 yards will open to 6 " at 300 yards .
Very few hunters can take advantage of more accuracy than that in the field , so 2 MOA represents the practical limit of accuracy for most hunters .
I am sure that Col .
Whelen would have classified such a rifle as very " interesting . "
Of course , it is nice if Old Betsy will shoot even smaller groups at the rifle range , but it is simply not necessary from a practical standpoint .
For the master shot with a trajectory table developed for his specific rifle and load , a high quality rangefinder , a solid rest , and shooting an ultra-long range cartridge like the .240 to .300 Weatherby Magnums , .264 Winchester Magnum , or 7 mm Remington Ultra Mag , a 400 yard shot might be justified .
If so , that hunter needs a rifle that will reliably shoot into 1.5 MOA .
1.5 MOA means a rifle that groups within 3 " at 200 yards and 6 " at 400 yards .
This is a very interesting rifle indeed , particularly considering the muzzle blast and recoil of most ultra-long range cartridges .
Such rifles are quite scarce in the real world .
At 400 yards the merest twitch by the hunter , or a puff of wind 200 yards away , will throw the bullet clear out of the kill area .
The inherent accuracy of the rifle has become a secondary consideration compared to other variables .
Groups better than 1.5 MOA are swell to brag about online , but irrelevant in the field .
Accuracy beyond the practical limit is simply unnecessary .
No one is justified in taking shots longer than 400 yards with any hunting rifle or cartridge .
Sub -MOA rifles are nice , but irrelevant to the hunter .
Many other factors are more important to a successful hunt , the functional reliability of the rifle and load being among them .
This mitigates against hunting cartridges derived from PPC - type bench rest cartridges , for technical reasons that I do n't have time to go into here .
Examples of hunting rounds prone to unreliable feeding from bolt action rifles include the WSSM line and other " short fat " cartridges .
Examples of cartridges designed to feed reliably from bolt action rifles include the .270 Winchester , .30-06 and .375 H&H Magnum .
Compare , say , a .270 WSM to a .270 Win. and note the differences in design , then buy bolt action hunting rifles chambered for cartridges that look like the latter .
Perhaps paramount among the factors more important than accuracy beyond the practical limit is the terminal performance of the bullet .
It must penetrate into the vitals of the game to do its job and it must have expanded to destroy the maximum amount of tissue once it gets there .
An adequately accurate bullet that does a good job of killing game is far preferable to a brilliantly accurate bullet that does a marginal job when it hits the target .
Thus , while I always test a number of bullets and loads in each of my hunting rifles to find the one that gives the best accuracy , I test only bullets that are widely regarded as appropriate for the velocity and type of hunting for which they will be used .
No match or other exotic bullets need apply .
My .257 Weatherby Magnum rifle , for example , will shoot at or just under 1.5 MOA ( 1.5 " at 100 yards ) with Weatherby factory loads using the 120 grain Nosler Partition bullet .
The same rifle will shoot into 1 MOA or a little less at the same distance with Weatherby factory loads using the 100 grain Spire Point bullet .
On light game the 100 grain Spire Point is a deadly bullet , but for general purpose hunting I load up with the Nosler Partition cartridges .
The advantage of the heavier , super - deadly Partition bullet far outweighs a paltry .5 MOA difference in accuracy .
“ There is no length issue .
This is someone thinking : ‘ I 'll just remove this indefinite article because Coren is an illiterate c*** and I know best ’ , ” he wrote in an email to four of his sub-editors .
“ Well , you f****** do n't . ”

Environment correspondent , BBC News website
Recent evidence has almost sunk the film 's contention that changes in the Sun 's output are driving modern - day climate change
The Great Global Warming Swindle , a controversial Channel 4 film , broke Ofcom rules , the media regulator says .
In a long - awaited judgement , Ofcom says Channel 4 did not fulfil obligations to be impartial and to reflect a range of views on controversial issues .
The film also treated interviewees unfairly , but did not mislead audiences " so as to cause harm or offence " .
Plaintiffs say the Ofcom judgement is " inconsistent " and " lets Channel 4 off the hook on a technicality . "
Hundreds of people ... were misled and it seems
Ofcom did n't care about that
Sir John Houghton
Why I challenged Channel 4's film
The film's key contentions were that the increase in atmospheric temperatures observed since the 1970s was not primarily caused by emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels , and that the modern focus on climate change is based in politics rather than science .
It is seen in some " climate sceptic " circles as a counter to Al Gore 's movie An Inconvenient Truth , and credited with influencing public perception of climate science .
It has reportedly been sold to 21 countries and distributed on DVD .
High definition " It 's very disappointing that Ofcom has n't come up with a stronger statement about being misled , " said Sir John Houghton , a former head of the UK Met Office and chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) scientific assessment .
" I know hundreds of people , literally hundreds , who were misled by it - they saw it , it was a well - produced programme and they imagined it had some truth behind it , so they were misled and it seems Ofcom did n't care about that , " he told BBC News .
I think this is a vindication of the credibility and standing of the IPCC
Rajendra Pachauri , IPCC
Ofcom defines a misleading programme as one by which the audience is " materially misled so as to cause harm or offence " , and that Swindle does not meet this " high test " .
" The programme has been let off the hook on a highly questionable technicality , " said Bob Ward , former head of media at the Royal Society , who played a prominent role in co-ordinating objections to the film .
" The ruling noted that Channel 4 had admitted errors in the graphs and data used in the programme , yet decided that this did not cause harm or offence to the audience . "
Plaintiffs accused the programme of containing myriad factual inaccuracies , but Ofcom says it was " impractical and inappropriate for it to examine in detail all of the multifarious alleged examples ... set out in the complaints . "
The regulator also says it is only obliged to see that news programmes meet " due accuracy " .
' No balance '
The broadcaster argued that the judgement vindicated its decision to showcase the documentary .
" Ofcom 's ruling explicitly recognises Channel 4's right to show the programme and the paramount importance of broadcasters being able to challenge orthodoxies and explore controversial subject matter , " said Hamish Mykura , the station 's head of documentaries .
" This is particularly relevant to Channel 4 with its public remit and commitment to giving airtime to alternative perspectives . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
On another issue - whether contributors to the programme had been treated fairly - Ofcom mainly found against Channel 4 and the film 's producer WagTV .
Former UK chief scientific adviser Sir David King had been misquoted and had not been given a chance to put his case , the regulator said .
Ofcom also found in favour of Carl Wunsch , an oceanographer interviewed for the programme , who said he had been invited to take part in a programme that would " discuss in a balanced way the complicated elements of understanding of climate change " , but which turned out to be " an out - and - out propaganda piece , in which there is not even a gesture toward balance " .
The film alleged that the IPCC 's scientific reports were driven by politics rather than science , and Ofcom ruled the organisation had not been given adequate time to respond .
" I think this is a vindication of the credibility and standing of the IPCC and the manner in which we function , and clearly brings out the distortion in whatever Channel 4 was trying to project , " said Rajendra Pachauri , the organisation 's chairman .
Science ' settled ' Ofcom 's Broadcasting Code requires Channel 4 to show " due impartiality " on " matters of major political and industrial controversy and major matters relating to current public policy " .
Human hands are driving climate change , Ofcom acknowledges
The last segment of the programme , dealing with the politics of climate change , broke this obligation , Ofcom judged , and did not reflect a range of views , as required under the code .
But the main portion of the film , on climate science , did not breach these rules .
Ofcom 's logic is that " the link between human activity and global warming ... became settled before March 2007 " .
This being so , it says , climate science was not " controversial " at the time of broadcast , so Channel 4 did not break regulations by broadcasting something that challenged the link .
" That 's a very big inconsistency , " said Sir John Houghton .
" They said it 's completely settled , so why worry - so they can just broadcast any old rubbish . "
While some of the 265 complaints received by Ofcom were short and straightforward , one group assembled a 176 - page document alleging 137 breaches of the code .
Channel 4 will have to broadcast a summary of the Ofcom ruling , but it brings no sanctions .

Alert # 19 : June 20 , 2008 Dear Liberty Dollar Supporters GREAT NEWS :
The victims of the FBI Raid have filed a Rule 41(g ) Motion for recovery of their property from the wrongful search and seizure !
Let the fun begin !
Now , before I get into the meat of this rather extensive Alert , please do two things :
1 ) Read this whole Alert !
It includes the Motion the Tenth Anniversary my retirement things you may want to know about .
2 ) This is a very serious time for the Liberty Dollar .
We really need your support , please .
Our shopping cart had been dead since November and does not accept credit / debit cards .
Liberty Dollar 's survival is in critical condition .
Please support this effort by mailing in an order , making a contribution to the Contingency Club or just sending in a donation or all three !
Now here 's the news : I am very pleased to inform you that a representative group of twelve victims ( hereinafter Plaintiffs ) having not received a reply to their Demand Letter have filed a Rule 41( g ) Motion in Federal District Court in Coeur d'Alene , Idaho for the return of their property that was represented by either paper and / or digital warehouse receipts .
They are proud to proclaim , " We are not going to let the G - boys steal our gold and silver . "
In fact , while I have been unusually quiet for over a month , I have actually been diligently working with the plaintiff on Rule 41(g ) Motion that was filed on June 17 , 2008 .
Let the fun begin !!
Please click HERE for the Demand Letter , the Rule 41(g ) Motion and all the Exhibits .
Please note this Motion was filed on paper so it wo n't appear in Pacer so you will not be able to look up the case in Pacer .
So please note the link above to all the docs .
Now begins the long and difficult task for the return of $ 3.5 million in gold and silver that was wrongfully seized .
If you have paper or digital Liberty Dollars and have not signed up for the " Class Action Lawsuit , " shame on you !
Please click HERE and take action now .
Do not let the government steal your property !
Then write to Assistant US Attorney Thomas Ascik , as noted below .
I am proud of the thousands who have taken action .
Thank you !
And a very special thanks to our attorney Robert J. Stientjes of St. Louis and the Contingency Club for making this Motion possible .
Robert Stientjes is a dedicated , experienced and successful attorney who is well prepared to recover all the seized material .
The Contingency Club consists of Liberty Dollar supporters who are financing the Rule 41(g ) Motion and will double their money when we win !
Retaining an attorney was particularly difficult because all of Liberty Dollar 's money was confiscated , aka " economic persecution . "
And , of course , attorneys want to be paid , just as we all do .
So my situation was : 1 ) The government confiscated of all my money .
2 ) The people whose material was wrongfully seized were short on money .
3 ) And attorney 's usual contingency fee of 33 % meant everybody would lose a third of their property , just to force the government to return the other two - thirds from the wrongful seizure .
This just seemed too costly .
So I created the Contingency Club and designed a new financing plan to pay for the recovery and save everybody who have paper and digital warehouse receipts a lot of money .
The best estimated cost to recover the material was approximately 10 % .
So I offered a few people the opportunity to double their money by financing the attorney fees .
I was very pleased that a reasonable number of people responded immediately and the Contingency Club was formed .
As the individual members of the Contingency Club are not obligated to pay the attorney fees , I hope you will join the Contingency Club and help us shoulder this formable expense and DOUBLE YOUR MONEY with a contribution .
The Contingency Club works like this : I have guaranteed the attorney 's hourly rate to recover your property for only a 10 % duty on all returned material verses the usual 33 % contingency fee .
A savings of 23 % on your property !
Plus you can even recover that 10 % or more when you double your money by contributing to the Contingency Club to finance the court battle over Rule 41( g ) Motion .
Here is how you can double your money .
Contingent upon winning the case ( that looks extremely good given our extensive legal research ) and securing the return of all the material , the Contingency Club will : 1 ) Pay you two dollars for every dollar you contribute if the attorney fees are less than $ 150,000 ; 2 ) Return your original contribution plus 50 % if the attorney fees are between $ 150,000 and $ 300,000 ; 3 ) No contribution will be returned if the attorney is paid over $ 300,000 or if we lose .
Neither is very likely .
Bottom line is that you should get your property back for only a 10 % duty by weight .
Which most likely will be more than offset by a 10 % appreciation in the value of silver .
But we need your help to cover the attorney fees , please .
Minimum contribution to the Contingency Club is $ 100 .
Please make your check payable to " Burk & Reedy , " the law firm that is handling the Contingency Club bank account and mail it to the Office in Evansville .
We will forward it to Burk and Reedy and send a confirmation and acceptance of your contribution within ten days .
Please note more than one contribution may be placed , such as $ 100 per month , and this " Double Your Money " offer may be withdrawn if over subscribed .
PLEASE NOTE : Thank you if you made an earlier donation to the " Legal Defense Fund , " but that money was used on earlier legal issues and is not part of the Contingency Club .
If you want to participate in the Contingency Club , please send in your contribution to the Evansville office with the check made out to : " Burk and Reedy " please .
Thank you for all your support !
NOW : And if you have not signed up for the Class Action Lawsuit please click HERE to do so .
PLEASE do n't let the government steal your property !

OLD ORDERS Questions & Inquiries
The Office has received several calls regarding orders placed before the Raid .
And questions about how can we take new orders when we have n't even filled the earlier orders ?
First , I would like to do nothing more than fill your order .
But the material for your order was seized .
I simply do not have the material to fill your order .
The government has it and you should write to Assistant US Attorney Thomas Ascik and demand the return of your property .
Second , I cannot return your money because the government also confiscated that .
Third , all new products have been from 1 ) donations , 2 ) financed by loans to Liberty Dollar , or 3 ) were financed by pre-paid new orders .
I can well understand your frustration of placing an order and not receiving it .
We will be most happy to fill all orders or return your money when the funds and material are returned to us .
Pre -Move Up Orders : I am pleased to inform you that all orders placed before the Move Up to the $ 50 Silver Base have been filled .
Re-minting Orders : I am even more pleased to inform you that all stock for the Re-minting Orders has been placed .
Now it is just a matter of time unfortunately a lot of time .
Due to the surge in silver prices , the supply " tube " was exhausted of all existing manufactured silver .
The Mint has informed us it will be six to eight weeks until the blanks are available then minting and shipping .
We are waiting just like you and understand your concern .
We will ship all the Re-mining Orders asap .
Please be patient because it is going to take some time .
Meanwhile , talking heads like Jason Hommel , are stirring things up .
There is no actual " shortage " of silver at this time .
There is only a shortage of manufactured silver .
That is a huge difference and the topic of much misdirected communication .
NEW LIBERTY DOLLARS : Use the following Order Form .
Announcing the Tenth Anniversary !
It is a testament to your desire to have Real Money that the Liberty Dollar has survived two Move Ups from the initial $ 10 to the $ 20 and now at the $ 50 Silver Base , the US Mint warning , FBI Raid and ten years of monetary ignorance .
We feel like celebrating and hope you will join us !
T - shirts , Money Bags , sets and even Uncut Proof Sheets all are a testament to the largest effort to return America to value - one dollar at a time .
Thanks a million times for all your support !
Tenth Anniversary Orders :
With fewer orders , we have turned our efforts to celebrate the Tenth Anniversary of the Liberty Dollar in grand style .
But unfortunately our shopping cart still does not accept credit / debit cards !!!
This makes it extremely difficult to order , as you must mail in your order with a check or money order .
Then it takes us about ten minutes to enter each order all this is extremely time consuming and trying .
But that is the situation under this government
The top of the line of incredible Tenth Anniversary commemorative is the Tenth Anniversary Set of four Silver Libertys in a special Lucite holder in a special imprinted box and our very first Certificate of Authenticity !
You gotta see this item .
So click HERE !
In fact , we did something similar for the Fifth Anniversary with three Libertys and I bet you have never seen it .
I bet you have not even heard about it .
To the best of my knowledge , I do n't think one has ever traded on eBay !
They are that special and likewise the Tenth Anniversary Set will be equally special .
Please click HERE to see this truly amazing showstopper .
But wait !
This Tenth Anniversary
Set with four Silver Libertys is available in two numbered editions .
Both Editions are packaged in a custom stamped box with the certificate and hand numbered on the one ounce $ 50 Liberty .
Plus each is individually hallmarked with a new " USA " stamp in the shape of the country .
Click HERE for more detailed photos .
But that is not all .
The First 100 Edition , numbered 001 to 100 , will be marked with FDI on the package and certificate for " First Day of Issue " for an added premium .
The second edition sets , numbered 101 forward , will be marked LNE for the " Limited Numbered Edition " on the package and certificates .
Pre-anniversary prices at current LOW silver rates ( below $ 25 / oz ) are : FDI is $ 179 for Associates and $ 199 for non-Associates .
LNE is $ 159 for Associates and $ 179 for non-Associates .
Prices will change with the silver market and will definitely be raised after October 1 , our Tenth Anniversary .
And if I am arrested or Liberty Dollar is closed , the prices will be out of this world and only available on eBay .
The most unique Commemorative is without a doubt the Uncut Sheet of four $ 50 Certificates that were originally printed to commemorate the Liberty Dollar 's Fifth Anniversary in 2003 .
Did you get any of the 2003 Proof $ 50 Certificates ?
They are still hot on eBay !
But these had a small printing error so they were put away and forgotten until after the Raid .
While digging around we found this old box ... and what a treasure !
Now , the long displaced Uncut Sheets have been overprinted in wonderful two - tone engraving script to commemorate our Tenth Anniversary .
Each sheet is 100 % cotton banknote paper and has the original invisible DNA " thread , " and while you cannot see it on the printed Certificate area , by tilting the paper just so , you can see the welt of a duplicate " thread " from the impregnation of the DNA in the paper to the right that is now overprinted .
Plus each sheet was originally printed on both sides and is now individually numbered and signed by me .
This specimen measures a huge 12 - 1 / 2 inches left to right by 12 inches tall .
Please note the Certificates are not serial numbered but they are individually printed OCTOBER 1 , 1998 - 2003 .
This is truly a unique item .
We only have 500 of them so order early as I am sure all will be gone by October 1 .
Very special - pre-anniversary giveaway price of only $ 59 each .
Sorry , there is no Associate rate on this very unique item .

Hallmarked $ 50 Libertys : Also available is the $ 50 Silver Liberty with the special " USA " Hallmark .
This is a single item that has been " cherry picked " and packaged in a capsule .
Please note that each one is individually hand hallmarked , so each one is unique .
The hallmark may not be complete as each one is different due to the nature of a hand stamped hallmark .
Pre-anniversary Associate rate is $ 45 that 's under face value !
Non-associate rate is $ 65 .
All prices will increase after October 1 , regardless of silver price .
See it HERE .
Tenth Anniversary T - shirt is also available .

Spent two Twenties in past week :
Of course the new $ 50 Silver base Libertys in $ 50s , $ 20s , $ 10s and soon the $ 5s are out there and being used .
Ray Ubinger filed these Success Stories of his recent use : One for a Red Bull at a gas station in Virginia and one for a Dilly Bar at a Dairy Queen in North Carolina .
As always he did n't said anything misleading or duck any questions .
" At the Red Bull I asked , ' Do you take silver Liberty Dollars ? ' as I handed her the round .
The clerk at first said ' Sure ! ' but then on looking the round over said she did n't know so she'd check with the manager , who was 20 feet away .
I waited silently in place .
I saw the manager handle the round and heard him ask the clerk , ' How many does he want to use ? '
' Just this one , " said the clerk .
The manager then said okay .
He never talked directly to me himself .
Gave LD $ 20 , got Red Bull + US $ 17 in change .
" For the Dilly Bar I led with , ' Would you prefer government paper or actual silver ? ' as I put both an LD Twenty and an FRN Five down next to each other .
The clerk asked of the silver , ' Is it real ? '
I said yes , it 's real silver , two - fifths of an ounce , 99.9 % pure , in Brilliant Uncirculated condition .
He said he was going to buy it right out of the register after the transaction .
He asked where I got it , was it from a bank ?
I said no , it came from a currency exchange online .
' Cool , ' he said .
That was that .
Gave LD $ 20 , got Dilly Bar + US $ 18 in change . "
Editor note : Right on Ray !
It is good dedicated people like you who are lighting the way for our country to find its way back to value .
BIG
Thanks for your support and efforts !!!
Retirement and Annual National Tour :
As I have mentioned several times , I agreed to give the Liberty Dollar my time and money for ten years .
I have decided to keep to that schedule and will retire on October 1 .
Of course I remain responsible to resolve all the legality issues but I will not wait to find someone to take my place .
I must remain true to other projects that require my time .
So this year 's tenth Annual National Tour ( ANT ) will be my last tour .
And with gas and hotels at an all - time high , I am sure it will be the most expensive tour .
So this is a good time to offer me a free meal and a place to stay .
This year 's ANT will start on July 9th .
The basic route is from Miami , to Maine , San Diego , Vancouver and back to Miami with two stops in Evansville and hopefully down to Texas .
If you want me to visit , please send an email to me .
No newbies , please .
This is for seasoned supporters only as my schedule is already MAXXED Hope to see you .
It 's been a terrific TEN YEARS !
Slowest & Lowest Period :
Jonathan Kosares and Randal Strauss of Centennial Precious Metals in Denver demonstrate that buying gold during the summer doldrums has been a winning trade for each of the last seven years , averaging a gain of nearly 13 percent in about six months .
You can find the Kosares - Strauss analysis , headlined " Seasonal Price Trends Look Favorably on Summer Purchases , " at Centennial 's site : http://www.usagold.com/analysis/doldrums-2008.html
So now as we enter the summer months and the living is easy and gold and silver are usually at their lowest , I urge you to take action .
When we launched the Liberty Dollar ten years ago , the most popular question was , " Why should I pay twice the price for silver ? "
Of course very few people ever exchanged at face value .
The brave souls who stepped up to the Liberty Dollar usually paid $ 6.50 or $ 7.50 depending on quantity .
Recently that very same 1999 Liberty Type 2 went for $ 1000 on eBay !
Do n't be deceived by the likes of Lew Rockwell , Mark Skousen , Bill Bonner , et al anti-Liberty Dollar gang .
The Liberty Dollar offers the most serious solution to the hyperinflationary depression this country is rushing toward .
Please read this article and then protect yourself and those you love with gold and silver at low summer prices .
PS : Numerous people have jumped into the fray to get their silver back .
Jerry Collette is perusing the silver on Constitutional grounds .
More info on his effort can be found at : http://www.libertarianlegal.org/recover_rp_dollars.html.
Robert Clarkson , who was also raided by Agent Andy , Special FBI Agent for the Asheville NC office about two years ago , is also working to get his property back .
Robert 's site is : www.PatriotNetwork.info.
We welcome any effort that you think will work .
I personally think Robert Stientjes is on the right track .
Please support the Contingency Club and make some money so everyone can get his or her property back .
Just imagine , in the last ten years the Liberty Dollar has appreciated 500 % , from the $ 10 to the $ 50 Silver Base , while the US dollar has lost over 50 % !
Thank you for your patience and support of the Liberty Dollar that exemplifies the high ideas that our country was founded upon .
Bernard von NotHaus
Monetary Architect / Editor PS : It has been a wonderful ten years .
I cannot express my sincere thanks for all that you have done .
Thank you for reading the whole Alert .
Thanks for caring .

An Amish farmer works in the fields near Dover , Del .
Amish are prohibited from driving automobiles but not from using fuel - powered motors and engines .
Amish also feel strain of high fuel costs Inside his workshop near Dover , Del. , Bennie Troyer , an Amish man , shapes and assembles wood .
He builds about 30 to 35 custom kitchen cabinet sets a year , and each set takes about a week and a half to make .
Cabinetmaking , a trade Troyer learned from his father , Sam , who started the business in the 1960s , has become much more expensive lately .
The price of diesel fuel that powers Troyer 's tools — a traditional table saw and wide - belt sander among them — has skyrocketed the past several months .
At this time last year , Troyer says , he paid $ 2.35 a gallon for diesel .
It cost him $ 4.49 a gallon recently .
Burning 125 gallons a month , that 's an extra $ 267.50 , not counting fuel surcharges suppliers are tacking onto deliveries of things such as stains and drawer slides , Troyer says .
" Our profit margin is not going to be this year what it was last year , " he says .
The Amish , widely known for their horse - drawn buggies and a lifestyle that shuns many modern conveniences , are as susceptible to the sting of rising oil prices as anyone else .
From the diesel fuel for tools used in milking cows , building cabinets and sawing timber , to the gasoline used to power washing machines and freezers , the pinch is real .
Amish are banned from driving cars and trucks because Amish leaders worry that faster transportation could " pull the community apart . "
The prohibition , however , does not extend to fuel - powered motors and engines such as those used to run power tools and washing machines , says Donald Kraybill , a scholar on the Amish at Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown , Pa . " I do n't know that there ever was a categorical taboo on the engine , " Kraybill says .
" They used steam engines in the late 19th century . "
In addition to his own fuel costs , Troyer says , the Baltimore company that provides him with stains and finishes has tacked an additional $ 12 on each delivery .
He says he may have to raise his prices to compensate .
" If this keeps on , we 're going to have to do something different , " he says .
At his sawmill , also west of Dover , Ervin Miller burns 250 gallons to 300 gallons of diesel each week , sawing and mulching timber .
Miller , who remembers paying 95 cents for diesel only five years ago , paid $ 4.39 a gallon recently .
Loggers , who are also facing higher fuel prices , want more money , too , he says .
And adjusting prices can be difficult because the struggling lumber companies are unwilling to pay more .
" I just get what they give me , " Miller says .
" It kind of puts a jam on you . "
For David Miller , a dairy farmer nearby , diesel fuel powers his milk pump and the compressor that keeps the milk cool .
The good news is that prices for milk have also gone up : Miller is earning more than 60 % more for his milk this summer than he did a couple of years ago .
" It 's helping a lot , " David Miller says .
Still , he faces extra charges from haulers because of higher fuel prices .
He calls such prices " ridiculous . "
Harvey Yoder , who runs a nearby nursery , says the belief that the Amish are not affected by such modern factors as soaring fuel prices is a misconception .
" People think the Amish are old - time , " Yoder says , " but we do use gas . "
The water pump
Yoder uses to water the plants in his greenhouse — from petunias to ponytail grass — is gas - powered .
His 5 - gallon jug of gasoline usually lasts two weeks or so , he says .
Through the spring , it may only last one week .
" We used to get it for half the price , " Yoder says .
" It knots you . "

Pentagon Warns Against Israeli Attack on Iran Joint Chiefs Chair on Iran : " A third front ... would be extremely stressful . "
July 2 , 2008  -- Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm . Mike Mullen , who was in Israel over the weekend , issued a strong warning today about the dangers of a military attack on Iran .
At a Pentagon press conference , Mullen was asked , " How concerned are you ... that Israel may undertake a unilateral strike against Iran by the end of the year ? "
" My strong preference , here , is to handle all of this diplomatically with the other powers of governments , ours and many others , as opposed to any kind of strike occurring , " he answered .
" This is a very unstable part of the world .
And I do n't need it to be more unstable . "
Mullen refused to talk specifically about what was said in his talks with the Israelis , but he made it clear wants to avoid military confrontation .
" I 've been pretty clear before that from the United States ' perspective , the United States ' military perspective in particular , that opening up a third front right now would be extremely stressful on us , " he said .
" That does n't mean we do n't have capacity or reserve .
But that would really be very challenging and also the consequences of that sometimes are very difficult to predict . "
Mullen said there needs to be better " dialogue " on the Iranian nuclear issue .
Asked what he meant , Mullen responded , " When I talk about dialogue -- actually , I would say very broadly across the entirety of our government and their government .
" But , specifically , that would be -- need to be led , obviously , politically and diplomatically , " he said .
" And if it then resulted in military - to - military dialogue , I think that part of it certainly could add to a better understanding of each other .
" We have n't had much of a dialogue with the Iranians for a long time , " Mullen said .
" It takes two people to want to have a dialogue , not just the desire on one part . "
Mullen 's views here seem to be at odds with the Bush administration 's policy , which is that there will be no direct dialogue between the United States and Iran on the nuclear issue unless Iran agrees to suspend its nuclear program .
President Bush today said all options remain on the table against Iran but emphasized the need for a diplomatic solution .
" I have made it very clear to all parties that the first option ought to be to solve this problem diplomatically , " Bush said at the White House .
" And the best way to solve it diplomatically is for the United States to work with other nations to send a focused message , and that is , that you will be isolated and you will have economic hardship if you continue trying to enrich [ uranium , the first step toward making nuclear weapons ] . "
Iran 's foreign minister today dismissed talk of a U.S. or Israeli attack against his country , calling the prospect of another war in the Middle East " craziness . "
" In Iran we must defend our national security , our country and our revolutionary system , and we will continue to do so , " Manouchehr Mottaki said .
Mottaki said in an interview with The Associated Press that he does not believe Israel or the United States would act while the U.S. economy is suffering and the United States is bogged down in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
His comments came after Iran 's oil minister , Gholam Hossein Nozari , warned that an attack on his country would provoke a fierce response " that nobody can imagine " but would not disrupt oil supplies .
Tehran " is not going to be quiet " if attacked , Nozari said .
ABC News ' Martha Raddatz and files from the AP contributed to this report .
Lawmakers are already justifying their votes for making major changes to that proven regime by saying that the bill is a reasonable compromise that updates FISA technologically and will make it somewhat harder to spy on Americans abroad .
But none of that mitigates the bill ’s much larger damage .
It would make it much easier to spy on Americans at home , reduce the courts ’ powers and grant immunity to the companies that turned over Americans ’ private communications without a warrant .
It would allow the government to bypass the FISA court and collect large amounts of Americans ’ communications without a warrant simply by declaring that it is doing so for reasons of national security .
It cuts the vital “ foreign power ” provision from FISA , never mentions counterterrorism and defines national security so broadly that experts think the term could mean almost anything a president wants it to mean .
Supporters will argue that the new bill still requires a warrant for eavesdropping that “ targets ” an American .
That ’s a smokescreen .
There is no requirement that the government name any target .
The purpose of warrantless eavesdropping could be as vague as listening to all calls to a particular area code in any other country .
The real reason this bill exists is because Mr. Bush decided after 9/11 that he was above the law .
When The Times disclosed his warrantless eavesdropping , Mr. Bush demanded that Congress legalize it after the fact .
The White House scared Congress into doing that last year , with a one - year bill that shredded FISA ’s protections .
Democratic lawmakers promised to fix it this year .
Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy , Russ Feingold , Christopher Dodd and Jeff Bingaman plan to offer amendments to do that , but there is little chance they will pass .
The Senate should reject this bill and start over with modest legislation that makes the small needed changes and preserves Americans ’ fundamental protections .
Kurt Cobain Ashes Stolen From Courtney Love
The ashes of , legendary deceased front man for the band Nirvana , have reportedly been stolen from his widow 's home in Los Angeles .
This is not the first report of theft of Kurt 's belongings from Love .
Recently Love filled out a complaint that somebody had stolen Cobain 's social security number and embezzled a lot of money from the late singers estate and now this .
Courtney said :
I can't believe anyone would take Kurt 's ashes from me .
I find it disgusting and right now I 'm suicidal .
If I do n't get them back I do n't know what I 'll do . "
I used to take them everywhere with me just so I could feel Kurt was still with me .
Now it feels like I have lost him all over again . "
She has stated in the past that she would hide the ashes inside of a pink teddy bear shaped bag along with some of his hair .
Sounds like Love needs some security around the homestead , or needs to replace her current keepers .
Things have not been going well in her life , including her recent snafu at LAX , when she was barred from flying with her daughter .

Welcome to the The Fabulous Ruins of Detroit Tour
presented by the DetroitYES Project
The DetroitYES project began with the 1997 online publication of this " Fabulous Ruins of Detroit " tour .
It is guided pictorial tour of the contemporary ruins of late 1990 's Detroit .
And it is a sympathetic telling of the story of the precipitous decline of the great city of Detroit in the second half of the 20th Century as forces of post - industrial change and globalization laid waste to a great city .
The tour was intended to stimulate and energize discussion of these questions .
" Detroit -- What went wrong ? "
" How can we heal it ? "
" Where to do we go from here ? "
The " Classic Tour " of the Fabulous Ruins of Detroit forms the core of the DetroitYES project , an endeavor that has grown to over several thousand images and pages and has become home the most active forum for the discussion of Detroit , its problems and its promise - The Discuss Detroit Forum where nearly two million posts have been written since 1999
You are invited and encouraged to share your memories , questions and observations with the millions who now visit this site and participate its discussion forums .
Welcome and enjoy ,

Secondly , Mr. Jobs has had cancer , for crying out loud  and in the public mind , a particularly insidious kind .
Although several doctors I spoke to say that the kind of cancer he had , and the kind of operation he underwent , give him a better - than - even chance of living a long and happy life , there are no guarantees with cancer .
We all know that .
Which is all the more reason why , at a minimum , Apple should flatten the rumor that his cancer has recurred  even if it wo n’t go further than that .
“ Not being able to provide a statement effectively dismissing the question is really unsatisfactory to most investors , ” said A. M. Sacconaghi Jr. , who follows the company for Sanford C. Bernstein .
The final reason , to be blunt about it , is that Apple simply ca n’t be trusted to tell truth about its chief executive .
Under Mr. Jobs ,
Apple has created a culture of secrecy that has served it well in many ways  the speculation over which products Apple will unveil at the annual MacWorld conference has been one of the company ’s best marketing tools .
But that same culture poisons its corporate governance .
Apple tells analysts far less about its operations than most companies do .
It turns low - level decisions into state secrets .
Directors are often left out of the loop .
And it dissembles with impunity .
As , indeed , it has in this latest episode .
On Wednesday , John Markoff reported in The New York Times that Mr. Jobs had had a surgical procedure earlier this year , the details of which remain unclear .
I hear that he has had ongoing digestive difficulties , which have contributed to his weight loss  possibly a side effect of the surgery .
And in the weeks leading up to the conference , he came down with an infection , which had a lot to do with why he looked so gaunt .
It was n’t cancer , thank goodness .
But was more than a “ common bug . ”
By claiming Mr. Jobs had a bug , Apple was n’t just going dark on its shareholders .
It was deceiving them .
It would be horrible if Mr. Jobs had a recurrence of cancer .
I hope it never happens .
At 53 , he is in the prime of his life , the father of a young family .
And for the rest of us , it ’s exhilarating watching him work his magic in the marketplace .
Steve Jobs has created more value and driven more innovation than just about anybody in business .
Who does n’t want to see what he ’ll come up with next ?
He also , though , needs to treat his shareholders with at least a modicum of respect .
And telling them whether or not he is sick would be a good place to start .
On Thursday afternoon , several hours after I ’d gotten my final “ Steve ’s health is a private matter ”  and much to my amazement 
Mr. Jobs called me .
“ This is Steve Jobs , ” he began .
“ You think I ’m an arrogant [ expletive ] who thinks he ’s above the law , and I think you ’re a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong . ”
After that rather arresting opening , he went on to say that he would give me some details about his recent health problems , but only if I would agree to keep them off the record .
I tried to argue him out of it , but he said he would n’t talk if I insisted on an on - the - record conversation .
So I agreed .
Because the conversation was off the record , I cannot disclose what Mr. Jobs told me .
Suffice it to say that I did n’t hear anything that contradicted the reporting that John Markoff and I did this week .
While his health problems amounted to a good deal more than “ a common bug , ” they were n’t life - threatening and he does n’t have a recurrence of cancer .
After he hung up the phone , it occurred to me that I had just been handed , by Mr. Jobs himself , the very information he was refusing to share with the shareholders who have entrusted him with their money .
You would think he ’d want them to know before me .
But apparently not .
Undersea volcanic activity triggered a mass extinction of marine life and buried a thick mat of organic matter on the sea floor about 93 million years ago , which became a major source of oil , according to a new study .
" It certainly caused an extinction of several species in the marine environment , " said University of Alberta Earth and Atmospheric Science researcher Steven Turgeon .
" It was n't as big as what killed off the dinosaurs , but it was what we call an extreme event in the Earth 's history , something that does n't happen very often . "
U of A scientists Turgeon and Robert Creaser say the lava fountains that erupted altered the chemistry of the sea and possibly of the atmosphere .
" Of the big five mass extinctions in the Earth 's history , most of them were some kind of impact with the planet 's surface , " said Turgeon .
" This one is completely Earth - bound , it 's strictly a natural phenomenon . "
Turgeon and Creaser found specific isotope levels of the element osmium , an indicator of volcanism in seawater , in black shale - rocks containing high amounts of organic matter - drilled off the coast of South America and in the mountains of central Italy .
" Because the climate was so warm back than , the oceanic current was very sluggish and it initially buffered this magmatic pulse , but eventually it all went haywire , " said Turgeon .
" The oxygen was driven from the ocean and all the organic matter accumulated on the bottom of the sea bed , and now we have these nice , big , black shale deposits worldwide , source rocks for the petroleum we have today . "
According to their research , the eruptions preceded the mass extinction by a geological blink of the eye .
The event occurred within 23 thousand years of the extinction and the underwater volcanic eruption had two consequences : first , nutrients were released , which allowed mass feeding and growth of plants and animals .
When these organisms died , their decomposition and fall towards the sea floor caused further oxygen depletion , thereby compounding the effects of the volcanic eruption and release of clouds of carbon dioxide in to the oceans and atmosphere .
The result was a global oceanic anoxic event , where the ocean is completely depleted of oxygen .
Anoxic events - while extremely rare - occur in periods of very warm climate and a raise in carbon dioxide levels , which means that this research could not only help prove a mass - extinction theory , but also help scientists studying the effects of global warming .
An odd side - effect of the mass extinction , the result of the anoxic event caused as an indirect result of the underwater volcanic eruptions , was that temperatures and carbon dioxide levels on the Earth 's surface actually dropped .
" Organic matter that 's decaying returns components like carbon and CO 2 to the atmosphere , " said Turgeon .
" But this event locked them up at the bottom of the ocean , turning them into oil , drawing down the CO 2 levels of the ocean and the atmosphere . "
After 10,000 - 50,000 years , the carbon dioxide levels rose again .
" Business as usual , " said Turgeon , adding that this might hold a warning for organic life on the planet today , he said .
Micheal Martin said the Irish people 's decision must be respected EU foreign ministers have agreed to keep the Lisbon reform treaty alive despite its rejection by Irish voters .
The ministers said those EU members who have not yet ratified the treaty should carry on and do so .
The ministers have been meeting in Luxembourg ahead of a two - day summit in Brussels , starting on Thursday , that is expected to chart the way ahead .
The treaty cannot be implemented unless approved by all 27 EU states .
Only the Irish Republic has held a referendum .
The Lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the workings of the enlarged EU and give it a stronger voice in the world .
French and Dutch voters rejected a previous - more comprehensive - draft European constitution in 2005 .
' No quick fix ' Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin has said it is " far too early " to seek a solution to the Irish rejection of a European Union reform treaty .
Speaking in Luxembourg , Mr Martin told reporters : " The people 's decision has to be respected and we have to chart a way through ...
It is far too early for proffering any solutions or proposals .
No - one senior is talking about leaving Ireland out in the cold , but some MEPs are in favour of this ' coalition of the willing '
The BBC's Mark Mardell
Euroblog : EU crisis talks begin " There are no quick fix solutions . "
But it is now up to the Irish Taoiseach - or Prime Minister - Brian Cowen to find a way forward with the other EU leaders at their Brussels summit , says the BBC's European affairs correspondent Oana Lungescu .
Leaders want to know what went wrong , what changes could be made to accommodate the disparate concerns of Irish voters and how soon a second vote may be possible , if at all , she says .
The most likely scenario , our correspondent suggests , is a declaration assuring the Irish that the treaty will not affect their policies on abortion , taxation and neutrality .
But one minister told the BBC that there may not be any concrete proposals until the next EU summit in October , by which time it would be clear how many other countries have ratified the treaty and on what basis Ireland could vote again , adds our correspondent .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The treaty should be ditched , it is a terrible document and the existing system , even with the new members , works .
Brian , Bordeaux Most EU leaders have offered broad support for the treaty but have urged caution against immediate action to save it outright .
" It is time for a little bit of thinking and analysis , " said Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel , whose country holds the rotating EU presidency until the end of June .
" It would be risky to say we are going to bring the treaty back to life when we are facing a blockade . "
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who met Poland 's Prime Minister Donald Tusk in the Polish city of Gdansk , said : " The EU needs the Lisbon treaty to be able to act and for future enlargements , " she said .
LISBON TREATY
Creates post of an EU president , elected for two - and - a - half years , rather than current six - month rotating presidency A new high representative for foreign policy , to boost EU 's external voice - a merger of the existing two foreign policy posts Commissioners from two - thirds of member states - no longer from each state - and rotated among member states to serve five - year terms
More decision - making by qualified majority voting , reducing national vetoes , but new voting system only takes effect in 2014 Enhanced roles for European Parliament and national parliaments
Q&A : Lisbon Treaty
But the Czechs have cast doubt on whether the treaty project should be continued .
" The discussion here is whether in case of the Irish No it is even possible and legitimate to continue ratification , " Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek said after talks in Prague with French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
The Czech Republic is one of nine countries who have not ratified the treaty .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made it clear on Monday that he intended to press ahead with the ratification process , but stressed that the treaty could not come into force until all 27 members sign .
He has been under pressure to stop the treaty from going through the last stage of ratification on Wednesday .
The Lisbon treaty provides for a streamlining of the European Commission , the removal of the national veto in more policy areas , a new president of the European Council and a strengthened foreign affairs post .
It is due to come into force on 1 January 2009 .

What are these ?
" The Two United States and the Law " by Howard Freeman P. O. Box 364 Lusk , Wyo. 82225
Our forefathers , weary of the oppressive measures that King George III 's government forced upon them , in common declared their independence from England in 1776 .
They were not expected to be successful in that resistance .
The moneyed people had backed England for two major reasons .
First , our forefathers wanted a rigid , written Constitution " set in concrete . "
They were familiar with the so - called Constitution of England which consisted largely of customs , precedents , traditions , and understandings , often vague and always flexible .
They wanted the principle of English common law , that an act done by any official person or law - making body beyond his or its legal competence was simply void .
Second , the thirteen little colonies desired to base their union on substance ( gold and silver ) -- real money .
They well knew how the despotic governments of Europe were mortgaged to the hilt -- lock , stock , and barrel , the land , the people , everything -- to certain wealthy men who controlled the banks , the currency , and all credit , who lent credit but did not loan gold and silver !
The United States of America was made up of a union of what is now fifty sovereign States , a three - branch ( legislative , executive , and judicial ) Republic known as The United States of America , or as termed in this article , the Continental United States .
Its citizenry live in one of the fifty States , and its laws are based on the Constitution , which is based on Common Law .
Less than one hundred years after we became a nation , a loophole was discovered in the Constitution by cunning lawyers in league with the international bankers .
They realized that a separate nation existed , by the same name , that Congress had created in Article I , Section 8 , Clause 17 .
This " United States " is a Legislative Democracy within the Constitutional Republic , and is known as the Federal United States .
It has exclusive , unlimited rule over its citizenry , the residents of the District of Columbia , the territories and enclaves ( Guam , Midway Islands , Wake Island , Puerto Rico , etc. ) , and anyone who is a citizen by way of the 14th Amendment ( naturalized citizens ) .
Both United States have the same Congress that rules in both nations .
One " United States , " the Republic of fifty States , has the " stars and stripes " as its flag , but without any fringe on it .
The Federal United States ' flag is the stars and stripes with a yellow fringe , seen in all the courts .
The abbreviations of the States of the Continental United States are , with or without the zip codes , Ala. , Alas. , Ariz. , Ark. , Cal. , etc .
The abbreviations of the States under the jurisdiction of the Federal United States , the Legislative Democracy , are AL , AK , AZ , AR , CA , etc. ( without any periods ) .
Under the Constitution , based on Common Law , the Republic of the Continental United States provides for legal cases ( 1 ) at Law , ( 2 ) in Equity , and ( 3 ) in Admiralty : ( 1 ) Law is the collective organization of the individual right to lawful defense .
It is the will of the majority , the organization of the natural right of lawful defense .
It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces , to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do : to protect persons , liberties , and properties ; to maintain the right of each , and to cause justice to reign over us all .
Since an individual cannot lawfully use force against the person , liberty , or property of another individual , then the common force -- for the same reason -- cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person , liberty , or property of individuals or groups .
Law allows you to do anything you want to , as long as you do n't infringe upon the life , liberty or property of anyone else .
Law does not compel performance .
Today 's so - called laws ( ordinances , statutes , acts , regulations , orders , precepts , etc. ) are often erroneously perceived as law , but just because something is called a " law " does not necessarily make it a law .
[ There is a difference between " legal " and " lawful . "
Anything the government does is legal , but it may not be lawful . ]
( 2 ) Equity is the jurisdiction of compelled performance ( for any contract you are a party to ) and is based on what is fair in a particular situation .
The term " equity " denotes the spirit and habit of fairness , justness , and right dealing which would regulate the intercourse of men with men .
You have no rights other than what is specified in your contract .
Equity has no criminal aspects to it .
( 3 ) Admiralty is compelled performance plus a criminal penalty , a civil contract with a criminal penalty .
By 1938 the gradual merger procedurally between law and equity actions ( i.e. , the same court has jurisdiction over legal , equitable , and admiralty matters ) was recognized .
The nation was bankrupt and was owned by its creditors ( the international bankers ) who now owned everything -- the Congress , the Executive , the courts , all the States and their legislatures and executives , all the land , and all the people .
Everything was mortgaged in the national debt .
We had gone from being sovereigns over government to subjects under government , through the use of negotiable instruments to discharge our debts with limited liability , instead of paying our debts at common law with gold or silver coin .
The remainder of this article explains how this happened , where we are today , and what remedy we have to protect ourselves from this system .
Our Present Commercial System of " Law " and the REMEDY Provided for Our Protection
The present commercial system of " law " has replaced the old and familiar Common Law upon which our nation was founded .
The following is the legal thread which brought us from sovereigns over government to subjects under government , through the use of negotiable instruments ( Federal Reserve Notes ) to discharge our debts with limited liability instead of paying our debts at common law with gold or silver coin .
The change in our system of law from public law to private commercial law was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Erie Railroad v. Thompkins case of 1938 , after which case , in the same year , the procedures of Law were officially blended with the procedures of Equity .
Prior to 1938 , all U.S. Supreme Court decisions were based upon public law -- or that system of law that was controlled by Constitutional limitation .
Since 1938 , all U.S. Supreme Court decisions are based upon what is termed public policy .
Public policy concerns commercial transactions made under the Negotiable Instrument 's Law , which is a branch of the international Law Merchant .
This has been codified into what is now known as the Uniform Commercial Code , which system of law was made uniform throughout the fifty States through the cunning of the Congress of the United States ( which " United States " has its origin in Article I , Section 8 , Clause 17 of the Constitution , as distinguished from the " United States , " which is the Union of the fifty States ) .
In offering grants of negotiable paper ( Federal Reserve Notes ) which the Congress gave to the fifty States of the Union for education , highways , health , and other purposes , Congress bound all the States of the Union into a commercial agreement with the Federal United States ( as distinguished from the Continental United States ) .
The fifty States accepted the " benefits " offered by the Federal United States as the consideration of a commercial agreement between the Federal United States and each of the corporate States .
The corporate States were then obligated to obey the Congress of the Federal United States and also to assume their portion of the equitable debts of the Federal United States to the international banking houses , for the credit loaned .
The credit which each State received , in the form of federal grants , was predicated upon equitable paper .
This system of negotiable paper binds all corporate entities of government together in a vast system of commercial agreements and is what has altered our court system from one under the Common Law to a Legislative Article I Court , or Tribunal , system of commercial law .
Those persons brought before this court are held to the letter of every statute of government on the federal , state , county , or municipal levels unless they have exercised the REMEDY provided for them within that system of Commercial Law whereby , when forced to use a so - called " benefit " offered , or available , to them , from government , they may reserve their former right , under the Common Law guarantee of same , not to be bound by any contract , or commercial agreement , that they did not enter knowingly , voluntarily , and intentionally .
This is exactly how the corporate entities of state , county , and municipal governments got entangled with the Legislative Democracy , created by Article I , Section 8 , Clause 17 of the Constitution , and called here The Federal United States , to distinguish it from the Continental United States , whose origin was in the Union of the Sovereign States .
The same national Congress rules the Continental United States pursuant to Constitutional limits upon its authority , while it enjoys exclusive rule , with no Constitutional limitations , as it legislates for the Federal United States .
With the above information , we may ask : " How did we , the free Preamble citizenry of the Sovereign States , lose our guaranteed unalienable rights and be forced into acceptance of the equitable debt obligations of the Federal United States , and also become subject to that entity of government , and divorced from our Sovereign States in the Republic , which we call here the Continental United States ? "
We do not reside , work , or have income from any territory subject to the direct jurisdiction of the Federal United States .
These are questions that have troubled sincere , patriotic Americans for many years .
Our lack of knowledge concerning the cunning of the legal profession is the cause of that divorce , but a knowledge of the truth concerning the legal thread , which caught us in its net , will restore our former status as a free Preamble citizen of the Republic .
The answer follows :
Our national Congress works for two nations foreign to each other , and by legal cunning both are called The United States .
One is the Union of Sovereign States , under the Constitution , termed in this article the Continental United States .
The other is a Legislative Democracy which has its origin in Article I , Section 8 , Clause 17 of the Constitution , here termed the Federal United States .
Very few people , when they see some " law " passed by Congress , ask themselves , " Which nation was Congress working for when it passed this or that so - called law ? "
Or , few ask , " Does this particular law apply to the Continental citizenry of the Republic , or does this particular law apply only to residents of the District of Columbia and other named enclaves , or territories , of the Democracy called the Federal United States ? "
Since these questions are seldom asked by the uninformed citizenry of the Republic , it was an open invitation for " cunning " political leadership to seek more power and authority over the entire citizenry of the Republic through the medium of " legalese . "
Congress deliberately failed in its duty to provide a medium of exchange for the citizenry of the Republic , in harmony with its Constitutional mandate .
Instead , it created an abundance of commercial credit money for the Legislative Democracy , where it was not bound by Constitutional limitations .
Then , after having created an emergency situation , and a tremendous depression in the Republic , Congress used its emergency authority to remove the remaining substance ( gold and silver ) from the medium of exchange belonging to the Republic , and made the negotiable instrument paper of the Legislative Democracy ( Federal United States ) a legal tender for Continental United States citizenry to use in the discharge of debts .
At the same time , Congress granted the entire citizenry of the two nations the " benefit " of limited liability in the discharge of all debts by telling the citizenry that the gold and silver coins of the Republic were out of date and cumbersome .
The citizens were told that gold and silver ( substance ) was no loner needed to pay their debts , that they were now " privileged " to discharge debt with this more " convenient " currency , issued by the Federal United States .
Consequently , everyone was forced to " go modern , " and to turn in their gold as a patriotic gesture .
The entire news media complex went along with the scam and declared it to be a forward step for our democracy , no longer referring to America as a Republic .
From that time on , it was a falling light for the Republic of 1776 , and a rising light for Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal Democracy , which overcame the depression , which was caused by a created shortage of real money .
There was created an abundance of debt paper money , so - called , in the form of interest - bearing negotiable instrument paper called Federal Reserve Notes , and other forms of paperwork credit instruments .
Since all contracts since Roosevelt 's time have the colorable consideration of Federal Reserve Notes , instead of a genuine consideration of silver and gold coin , all contracts are colorable contracts , and not genuine contracts .
[ According to Black 's Law Dictionary ( 1990 ) , colorable means " That which is in appearance only , and not in reality , what it purports to be , hence counterfeit , feigned , having the appearance of truth . " ]
Consequently , a new colorable jurisdiction , called a statutory jurisdiction , had to be created to enforce the contracts .
Soon the term colorable contract was changed to the term commercial agreement to fit circumstances of the new statutory jurisdiction , which is legislative , rather than judicial , in nature .
This jurisdiction enforces commercial agreements upon implied consent , rather than full knowledge , as it is with the enforcement of contracts under the Common Law .
All of our courts today sit as legislative Tribunals , and the so- called " statutes " of legislative bodies being enforced in these Legislative Tribunals are not " statutes " passed by the legislative branch of our three - branch Republic , but as " commercial obligations " to the Federal United States for anyone in the Federal United States or in the Continental United States who has used the equitable currency of the Federal United States and who has accepted the " benefit , " or " privilege , " of discharging his debts with the limited liability " benefit " offered to him by the Federal United States ... EXCEPT those who availed themselves of the remedy within this commercial system of law , which remedy is today found in Book 1 of the Uniform Commercial Code at Section 207 .
When used in conjunction with one 's signature , a stamp stating " Without Prejudice U.C.C. 1-207 " is sufficient to indicate to the magistrate of any of our present Legislative Tribunals ( called " courts " ) that the signer of the document has reserved his Common Law right .
He is not to be bound to the statute , or commercial obligation , of any commercial agreement that he did not enter knowingly , voluntarily , and intentionally , as would be the case in any Common Law contract .
Furthermore , pursuant to U.C.C. 1-103 , the statute , being enforced as a commercial obligation of a commercial agreement , must now be construed in harmony with the old Common Law of America , where the tribunal / court must rule that the statute does not apply to the individual who is wise enough and informed enough to exercise the remedy provided in this new system of law .
He retains his former status in the Republic and fully enjoys his unalienable rights , guaranteed to him by the Constitution of the Republic , while those about him " curse the darkness " of Commercial Law government , lacking the truth needed to free themselves from a slave status under the Federal United States , even while inhabiting territory foreign to its territorial venue .
# # # ADDENDUM U.C.C. 1-207:4 Sufficiency of reservation .
Any expression indicating any intention to preserve rights is sufficient , such as " without prejudice , " " under protest , " " under reservation , " or " with reservation of all our rights . "
The Code states an " explicit " reservation must be made .
" Explicit " undoubtedly is used in place of " express " to indicate that the reservation must not only be " express " but it must also be " clear " that such a reservation was intended .
The term " explicit " as used in U.C.C. 1-207 means " that which is so clearly stated or distinctively set forth that there is no doubt as to its meaning . " ... U.C.C. 1-207:7 Effect of reservation of rights .
The making of a valid reservation of rights preserves whatever rights the person then possesses and prevents the loss of such right by application of concepts of waiver or estoppel ....
U.C.C. 1-207:9 Failure to make reservation .
When a waivable right or claim is involved , the failure to make a reservation thereof causes a loss of the right and bars its assertion at a later date ....
U.C.C. 1 -103:6 Common law .
The Code is " Complementary " to the common law which remains in force except where displaced by the Code ....
A statute should be construed in harmony with the common law unless there is a clear legislative intent to abrogate the common law .
... " The Code can not be read to preclude a common law action . "
EXAMPLE
Your Honor , my use of " Without Prejudice UCC 1 - 207 " above my signature on this document indicates that I have exercised the " Remedy " provided for me in the Uniform Commercial Code in Book 1 at Section 207 , whereby I may reserve my Common Law right not to be compelled to perform under any contract , or agreement , that I have not entered into knowingly , voluntarily , and intentionally .
And , that reservation serves notice upon all administrative agencies of government -- national , state and local -- that I do not , and will not , accept the liability associated with the " compelled " benefit of any unrevealed commercial agreement .

LELAND , Miss .  Catfish farmers across the South , unable to cope with the soaring cost of corn and soybean feed , are draining their ponds .
“ It ’s a dead business , ” said John Dillard , who pioneered the commercial farming of catfish in the late 1960s .
Last year Dillard & Company raised 11 million fish .
Next year it will raise none .
People can eat imported fish , Mr. Dillard said , just as they use imported oil .
As for his 55 employees ?
“ Those jobs are gone . ”
Corn and soybeans have nearly tripled in price in the last two years , for many reasons : harvest shortfalls , increasing demand by the Asian middle class , government mandates for corn to produce ethanol and , most recently , the flooding in the Midwest .
This is creating a bonanza for corn and soybean farmers but is wreaking havoc on consumers , who are seeing price spikes in the grocery store and in restaurants .
Hog and chicken producers as well as cattle ranchers , all of whom depend on grain for feed , are being severely squeezed .
The break - in took place at Hazel Blears Salford office on 14 June Information on a computer stolen from Communities Secretary Hazel Blears ' office had been sent in breach of data security rules , it has emerged .
The Communities and Local Government department admitted its officials had " not fully " complied with guidance on handling sensitive data .
Its top civil servant Peter Housden said " no damage had been done " as the documents were not secret .
Manchester Police are investigating the theft from Ms Blears ' Salford office .
The computer contained a combination of constituency and government information relating to defence and extremism .
I have instructed my officials that departmental procedures are now strengthened to ensure this does not happen again
Peter Housden
Communities and Local Government Mr Housden said in a statement : " It is clear that papers have been sent to Hazel Blears in a way that is not fully consistent with the departmental guidance .
" Thankfully no damage has been done since the documents sent to her were not classified as secret or top secret .
And in any event the computer was password protected .
" I have instructed my officials that departmental procedures , guidance , and the awareness and accessibility of that guidance , are now strengthened to ensure this does not happen again .
" I take full responsibility for ensuring this is done . "
Confidential document Department sources suggested that no officials were likely to lose their job over the breach , but did not rule out disciplinary action .
This is the latest in a series of security breaches that have embarrassed the government .
Last week a senior Cabinet Office official was suspended for leaving top secret documents on a train .
Another file of documents , including one restricted one , was found on another train last week as well .
The news that a government minister may have been directly responsible for the loss of data relating to extremism is extremely alarming
Dominic Grieve
Shadow home secretary After Gordon Brown was informed of the theft from Ms Blears ' office , he told cabinet ministers to ask their civil servants to remind staff of the importance of enforcing procedures on the treatment of sensitive information .
Shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve called for Parliament to be told " exactly how and why this has occurred " .
" The news that a government minister may have been directly responsible for the loss of data relating to extremism is extremely alarming , " he said .
The stolen computer is understood to have contained one confidential document relating to the housing market from March this year , as well as other restricted documents .
But the documents did not contain any information that could compromise national security .
They also contained information that shows Cabinet members disagree over the government 's proposed planning laws .
' Alarm ' Restricted government documents should not be held on a personal computer .
A government spokesman said the machine contained material from the Department for Communities and Local Government and details relating to her constituency work .
He insisted no personal details were among the departmental information .
" There was a break - in at the constituency office of Hazel Blears on the afternoon of Saturday , 14 June .
Hazel was not there at the time , " the spokesman said .
" The thief broke in through a window , triggering the building 's security alarm .
A PC was stolen .
Nothing else was taken .
" We understand the building 's security staff arrived within minutes .
" The PC was primarily used for Hazel 's constituency business and contained some details of her constituency work . "
The spokesman said " none of the departmental material included sensitive personal data about the public or would be of use to criminals " .
He added : " The PC did not contain any secret or top secret information and the contents of the PC are protected and clearly this is now subject to a routine police investigation . "

What are these ?
If you expected startling news to come out of Monday 's keynote for Apple 's World - Wide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) -- headlined , of course , by Steve Jobs - - you went away unstartled and disappointed .
This event was mostly about confirming widely reported rumors :
The high - speed iPhone 3G is indeed arriving shortly ( on July 11 ) , it 's half the price of its predecessor ( $ 199 for an 8 GB model with a two - year contract ) , and it has GPS .
Otherwise , much of the keynote was devoted to recapping stuff announced back in March regarding the iPhone 's SDK for third - party applications and its support for Microsoft 's Exchange e-mail platform .
As the day progressed , information emerged about certain things that Jobs and company had n't mentioned , such as the fact that AT&T remains the exclusive U.S. carrier and will charge $ 30 a month for all - you - can - eat data .
Gizmodo reports that the iPhone 3G must be activated in person at an Apple or AT&T store - - a major step backward from the slick at - home iTunes activation of the original version .
In short , we 're awash in answers .
But as usual , I 'm wrapping up the day of a major Apple announcement in connection with an extremely promising product still curious about a bunch of things .
Things that -- as far as I know - - remain mysteries .
Such as ...
1 . What 's with the plastic back ?
As Jobs ticked off the design achievements of the iPhone 3G at the WWDC keynote , he mentioned its " full plastic back . "
I think that this change may indeed be a virtue -- the shiny metallic backs sported by first - generation iPhones and most varieties of iPods are maddeningly effective magnets for scratches , fingerprints , and grime .
But Apple usually upgrades its products by replacing plastic with metal ; it 's hard to imagine the company going the other direction unless it had a motive unrelated to aesthetics .
Was it able to shave a millimeter or three off the required thickness by using plastic ?
( Cramming everything in was clearly a challenge .
Despite Jobs ' pollyanna-ish statement that the new iPhone is " even thinner " at the edges than its predecessor , Apple 's official depth spec for the iPhone 3G is 11.6 mm , versus 12.3 mm for the original iPhone . )
Maybe the metal would have interfered with GPS reception ?
Or did Apple simply have to go with cheaper materials when it cut the cost of the iPhone in half ?
2 . When will we get 32GB and 64GB iPhones ?
For some of us , an iPhone can't function as a first - class iPod until it has enough memory to hold every song and video in a fairly large media collection .
It 's safe to assume that Apple will boost the phone 's memory as soon as it can cram enough storage into its case and sell the resulting device at a price that a sane person might spring for .
Since the iPhone - like iPod Touch already comes in a $ 499 32 GB version , I 'd be surprised if a 32 GB iPhone is more than a few months away .
But I 'd be equally surprised if a 64GB iPhone showed up before mid-2009 or so , given the still - imposing cost for that much flash memory .
( Apple charges a $ 999 premium for a MacBook Air equipped with a 64GB solid - state drive instead of an 80 GB traditional drive . )
3 . Will we ever be able to use an iPhone as a modem ?
As I attended the WWDC keynote at San Francisco 's Moscone Center , I was online with my MacBook -- courtesy of my Windows Mobile - based AT&T
Tilt phone , which served up high - speed Internet access to the laptop via Bluetooth .
Jobs did n't mention similar functionality for the iPhone 3G ; if it 's on its way , it 's likely to cost more than the $ 30 a month that AT&T says it 'll charge for an iPhone 3G data plan .
But modem use is so handy that I 'd happily pay more for it if it becomes available in some official form .
( You can use an original iPhone as a modem , but only through scary , unauthorized techniques . )
4 . How about turn - by - turn driving directions ?
Ever find yourself watching a movie , and at the moment the villain whips out an elaborately sinister doomsday device , you say , " Hey , I would n't mind having one of those things ! "
Well , it turns out defense contractors are thinking the exact same thing .
The only difference is they have billions to spend to make it happen .

We 've been waiting for a good freaking death ray for , oh , about 70 years .
So when Boeing says , " ... directed energy weapons are relevant to today 's battlefield and are ready to be fielded , " we pay attention .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement Now , Boeing 's already doing a few interesting things with laser technology on a smaller scale ( like mounting devices to Humvees and using them to detonate bombs from a safe distance .
They can also put a bigger one in a jumbo jet and use it to destroy incoming ICBMs from hundreds of miles away .
But those are hardly death rays , right ?
They 're reassuring defensive measures designed to protect our brave men and women !
That 's where the Advanced Tactical Laser comes in .
Designed to engage ( that is , utterly destroy ) ground targets , the ATL is a weapon fitted to an aircraft like a C - 130 transport plane .
From 10,000 feet up and five miles away , this 40,000 - pound , megawatt - class , chemical laser will melt a hole through a tank .

Or should we say , tanks .
The ATL is intended to strike up to 100 targets in rapid succession .
Oh , and the beam 's silent .
And invisible .
One moment you 're having a nice cup of coffee atop your troop transport , the next you 're a smoking hole in the ground .
This space age , science fiction gadget is scheduled for live fire demonstrations later this year .
Where They Got the Idea : Independence Day .
Independence Day .
Or , quite possibly from the 1985 Val Kilmer comedy Real Genius .

1.0 Introduction
After thirteen years of the devastation of an entire country through the implementation of the criminal economic sanctions that were imposed by the United States of America and the United Nations on Iraq , the US administration decided to invade Iraq .
Gulf War I and the destruction of Iraq�s economy , education , health care system , and society through the continuous bombing and attacks of the illegal No Fly Zones , were all part of the plan to invade Iraq and take over one of the richest oil reserve countries in the Middle East region .
Pirating Iraq�s wealth is an advanced step to control and manipulate global economy .
New generations of conventional and banned weapons were used in the invasion of Iraq military operations from March 19th � April 9th of 2003 ...

( CNN ) --
It was a frigid June night at Pickstone Mine in Zimbabwe when 67 - year - old Angela Campbell -- soaking wet , her arm broken and a gun to her head -- signed a document vowing to give up the fight for her family 's farm .
Angela Campbell , 67 , was beaten and kidnapped days after Zimbabwe 's runoff election .
The kidnappers demanding her signature at gunpoint were " war veterans " from President Robert Mugabe 's heyday as a liberation hero , and they made it clear that her refusal would mean more beatings .
Though Campbell signed the document , her son - in - law said she has no intention of giving up her battle ; Campbell 's family will be in Windhoek , Namibia , on Wednesday to present arguments to a Southern African Development Community tribunal .
In pursuing the case , the Campbells and 77 fellow Zimbabwean farmers are risking theft , torture and death for what may be their only remaining chance to save the homes and farms so coveted by Mugabe and his loyalists .
Mugabe blames the West for his nation 's soaring inflation and poverty .
But analysts say Mugabe 's 2000 " resettlement " policy , in which property was snatched from white farmers and redistributed to landless blacks , is more to blame for the country 's turmoil .
Watch a report from the time of the Campbell attack »
" All I want to see is justice , " said Richard Etheredge , 72 , a white farmer who was evicted from his farm last month .
" The world cannot carry on with criminals . "
On June 15 , Etheredge , who has joined the case , and his family received word that a Zimbabwean senator planned to take over his Chegutu farm , a process known as " jambanja . "
" We 're going to murder you if we catch you , " Etheredge recalls an assailant yelling from outside his son's house two days later .
The Farmers ' Case Mike Campbell and 77 fellow Zimbabwean farmers are appealing to a tribunal for protection from the government .
The farmers are asking the tribunal :
 To appeal to Zimbabwe to strike down Amendment 17 of its constitution , which permits the acqusition of " agricultural land for resettlement and other purposes " without recourse or compensation to the landowner .
 To rule that the land resettlement policy is racially motivated and targets only white landowners .
 To push Zimbabwe 's government to establish a system for compensating landowners whose property has been commandeered via the land resettlement policies .
 To find the Zimbabwean government in contempt for violating tribunal rulings ordering Zimbabwe to refrain from directly or indirectly evicting or " interfering with the peaceful residence of " any farmers seeking relief from the tribunal .
Sources : Farmer Ben Freeth , attorneys David Drury and Matthew Walton , the Zimbabwe Constitution and the Southern African Development Community
The senator bused " criminals " to his property , Etheredge said .
Etheredge , his wife and one of his twin sons escaped , but the other twin and Etheredge 's daughter - in - law were later beaten , he said .
Looters stole his computers , farm equipment , antiques , custom gun collection and a safe with billions in Zimbabwean currency ( hundreds of thousands in U.S. dollars ) .
Etheredge said he watched the thieves abscond with his possessions in vehicles belonging to the senator .
The looters also caused about $ 1 million in damage to his property , which includes three houses and a fruit - packing plant that was once among the most sophisticated in southern Africa .
The Etheredges have been farming for 17 years and , before the attack , were producing 400,000 cartons of navel oranges and kumquats a year , he said .
" The destruction is absolutely incredible , " Etheredge said .
Mugabe 's cronies visited the adjacent Mount Carmel farm about two weeks later , just days after Mugabe won a majority of votes in a runoff denounced as a " sham " by the international community .
Watch how violence persists after the election »
Like the Etheredges , Mike and Angela Campbell were warned that Mugabe loyalists , members of his Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front , were planning to invade their farm .
The government had given the 1,200 - hectare ( 2,965 - acre ) tract to a Zanu - PF spokesman who also served as Mugabe 's biographer , according to the Campbells ' son- in - law , Ben Freeth .
Two nuns went to Mount Carmel on June 26 , the day before the runoff , wanting to buy sweet potatoes , Freeth said .
But their quest for tubers was a ruse ; they actually wanted to tell Freeth that Zanu - PF members were planning to raid the Campbell land , where the Campbells and Freeth and his wife , Laura , live .
On June 29 , Freeth received a phone call : " War veterans , " as the clans of pro-Mugabe thugs call themselves , were heading to his in - laws ' house .
Laura and her brother , Bruce , gathered their children .
Laura fled with the children through a fence on the northern boundary of Mount Carmel farm , Freeth said .
Freeth jumped in his car and sped 1½ kilometers to the Campbell house .
" These guys had already arrived , and they started shooting at me as soon as I drove through the gate , " he said .
The bullets missed , but one of the war veterans hurled a rock through the driver 's side window , smashing Freeth 's right eye shut .
" They dragged me out of the vehicle and began beating me over the head with rifle butts , " Freeth said .
The men tied up Freeth , he said , and took him to where his in - laws were lying bound on the gravel outside their home .
Angela Campbell was still conscious .
The men had caught her on her way to feed a calf .
They had beaten her and broken her upper arm in two places , Freeth said .
Mike Campbell was in bad shape , " just groaning on the ground ; in fact , he remembers nothing . "
The heavily armed men threw the three in the back of Mike Campbell 's Toyota Prado truck , and " the next nine hours were quite a nightmare , " Freeth said .
Freeth and the Campbells were driven about 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) to Pickstone Mine .
Their captors stopped at a dairy farm on the way and killed a white farmer 's dogs , Freeth said .
Night had fallen by the time they arrived at the mine to find about 60 men in Zanu - PF regalia waiting for them .
" They were pointing guns at us the whole time , telling us they were going to kill us , " Freeth said .
Freeth and the Campbells were doused with cold water and left " shivering in the dust on the ground , " Freeth said .
They received more beatings , and Freeth said one of their captors thrashed the bottom of his feet with a shambock , a whip made of hippopotamus hide .
It was during this time that their captors made Angela sign a document promising to drop the case scheduled this week before the tribunal .
Mike Campbell moved in and out of consciousness , as Ben and Angela prayed -- not for their lives , but for their captors .
Freeth said he had never understood Luke 6:28 -- " Bless those who curse you " -- until that moment , and a " supernatural " peace came over him .
Freeth told God , " If I 'm going to be with you today , then I 'm ready . "
It was almost midnight when Freeth and the Campbells -- still bound -- were tossed in the back of the Prado .
They bounced around the sport-utility vehicle as their captors drove 30 kilometers down a craggy dirt road to Kadoma , where they were dumped in the streets .
" I managed to walk toward a light and knocked on the door of a house and used the phone to phone my wife , " Freeth said .
The Campbells were released from the hospital last week .
Both remain weak and still bear considerable scrapes and bruises .
Angela has a pin in her arm .
Mike , 75 , suffered four broken ribs , a broken collarbone and a dislocated finger .
Mike is recovering just enough to sit up , and " he can walk a few paces , " Freeth said Monday , complaining that his hands were " still tingly " from being bound so tightly .
The hospital released Freeth at the weekend after neurosurgeons had to drill a 4 - centimeter ( 1½ - inch ) hole in his skull to relieve pressure from a hematoma stemming from the rock and rifle - butt blows to the head .
One thing not battered is the farmers ' resolve to remain on the land that the Campbells have owned for 34 years .
" We intend to be there on Wednesday , and we just hope for an outcome that is good for everyone , an outcome for justice , " Freeth said of the hearing , which is slated to last through Friday .
Freeth said he believes that the tribunal will carry more clout with Mugabe than do Western nations and the African and European unions .
Many of its member nations are led by Mugabe 's contemporaries , and Mugabe is aware that his status as an African hero is waning , he said .
" I think it means a lot to him whether SADC is going to isolate him or continue to support him , " Freeth said .
" Once we get to the SADC tribunal and we get a judgment and it 's basically binding in black and white , it 's going to be difficult for Mugabe to say , ' We 're abiding by our own law . '
It 's going to be very difficult for him to defend what he 's doing . "
All About Zimbabwe • Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front • Robert Mugabe
General Wes Clark has rightly pointed that John McCain has huffed and puffed his commander in chief credentials into something resembling a zeppelin and the general not back off .
A democrat willing to ride out the rabid and fact less attacks of the Right .
Clark deserves another medal in addition to more support people like Lt. General Robert G. Gard Jr. ( USA , Ret. ) , Defending Wes Clark
The controversy over my colleague General Wesley Clark ’s comments on John McCain have generated a lot of media comment , much of it negative .
I have known General Clark for many years : we served in the same Army and for the same country .
He ’s a patriot .
So to suppose that somehow Wesley Clark would denigrate John McCain ’s service to his country , while praising his bravery during the time that Senator McCain spent in an enemy prison , is absolutely ludicrous .
So let ’s check the facts .
On CBS ’s Face the Nation , General Clark said that he believed John McCain was “ untried and untested . ” Journalist Bob Schieffer asked him to explain what he meant .
How could Clark make such a claim when “ you ’re talking about somebody who was a prisoner of war ?
He was a squadron commander of the largest squadron in the Navy .
He ’s been on the Senate Armed Services Committee for many years .
How can you say that John McCain is un-untested and untried ? ”
And here ’s General Clark ’s answer : Because in the matters of national security policy making , it ’s a matter of understanding risk .
It ’s a matter of gauging your opponents , and it ’s a matter of being held accountable .
John McCain ’s never done any of that in his official positions .
I certainly honor his service as a prisoner of war .
He was a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in Armed Forces as a prisoner of war .
He has been a voice on the Senate Armed Services Committee , and he has traveled all over the world .
But he has n’t held executive responsibility .
As a retired military officer and a soldier who served his country for over thirty years , I can tell you that there ’s nothing in what Wes Clark said with which I disagree .
He has not only stated the facts , he knows something about them .
John McCain was a prisoner of war , an officer who served as a squadron commander , and has been and is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
John McCain can put his service to country up against anyone ’s .
But General Clark has served also — and with great courage : he was wounded four times in Vietnam — and like John McCain , he has met and seen the enemy .
Is what Wesley Clark said true ?
Let ’s check some other facts : John McCain made claims about progress in security by walking through the streets of Baghdad .
But as I recall , he was protected by at least a platoon of American soldiers and helicopters lying overhead .
In matters of national security , as General Clark pointed out , “ it ’s a matter of understanding risk , ” and it ’s “ gauging your opponents ; ” and it ’s also a “ matter of being held accountable . ”
So I too honor John McCain .
And , like General Clark , I acknowledge his sacrifice for his country .
But being a prisoner of the Vietnamese and serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee does not automatically qualify one for the position of Commander - in - Chief –– understanding risks , gauging your opponents and being held accountable does .
We must end this glib obeisance to sacrifice and ask deeper questions : is a man who sings “ bomb , bomb , bomb … bomb , bomb Iran ” a man who understands risks ?
Is a man who says that we must keep our troops in Iraq until we achieve an ill - defined “ victory ” really know how to gauge America ’s opponents .
If we want to hold people accountable , then let ’s stand behind my friend Wes Clark — and hold John McCain accountable for what he ’s said .
Oh , and one more thing : today President Bush signed the GI Bill — which Senator Barack Obama has unstintingly supported .
The bill will spend $ 63 billion over ten years for increased college aid for military service members and veterans who served after September 11 , 2001 .
Good judgment ?
John McCain opposed it .
The Right bust out of their bunny slippers , get spittle all over their mom ’s basement as much as they like trying to equate questioning McCain ’s character and judgment with the ironic claim that it is the same as the Swiftboaters who attacked Senator Kerry .
It will only prove once again that the Right has settled into being serial liars incapable of distinguishing between reality and their bent daydreams .
Not today , probably not tomorrow and any day in the near future will America wake up and not find yet more proof that McCain lacks the kind of character and good judgment required of the next president .
A job that will not only entail his regular duties , but cleaning up the colossal mess that Bush and surrogates like McCain are responsible for .
For you loved Bush , you love the sequel , McBush .
McCain ’s energy record is on / off
“ We must steer far clear of the errors and false assumptions that have marked the energy policies of nearly 20 Congresses and seven presidents , ” the presumptive Republican nominee told a crowd of oil executives in Houston .
Mr I demand the American people give me the presidency based on my stellar wisdom and judgment has been against and for ANWR drilling .
Mr. I served in the military and thus have superior decision making skills has been for and against off shore drilling .
Mr. embodiment of leadership has been for enforcing better mileage standards for passenger cars while also being against industry switching some of its energy needs to renewable sources .
Mr straight talk has said that ethanol is a dead end as an alternative fuel then turned around and claimed ethanol is a “ vital ” alternative .
This is the same guy that questioned Senator Obama ’s intergty just two days ago .
If pandering flip flops could run our cars McCain would be a cheap easy supplier .
Ex -Agent Says CIA Ignored Iran Facts
A former CIA operative who says he tried to warn the agency about faulty intelligence on Iraqi weapons programs now contends that CIA officials also ignored evidence that Iran had suspended work on a nuclear bomb .
The onetime undercover agent , who has been barred by the CIA from using his real name , filed a motion in federal court late Friday asking the government to declassify legal documents describing what he says was a deliberate suppression of findings on Iran that were contrary to agency views at the time .
The former operative alleged in a 2004 lawsuit that the CIA fired him after he repeatedly clashed with senior managers over his attempts to file reports that challenged the conventional wisdom about weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .
Key details of his claim have not been made public because they describe events the CIA deems secret .
The consensus view on Iran ’s nuclear program shifted dramatically last December with the release of a landmark intelligence report that concluded that Iran halted work on nuclear weapons design in 2003 .
The publication of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran undermined the CIA ’s rationale for censoring the former officer ’s lawsuit , said his attorney , Roy Krieger .
“ On five occasions he was ordered to either falsify his reporting on WMD in the Near East , or not to file his reports at all , ” Krieger said in an interview .
McCain once “ joked ” “ bomb bomb bomb , bomb bomb Iran ” .
This is the kind of issue that Clark was talking about “ it ’s a matter of understanding risk , ” and it ’s “ gauging your opponents ; ” .
McCain has always been there with his vote to support every action the administration has taken .
As we all know from the periodic reports like the National Intelligence Estimate that undermined the Bushies war mongering against Iran McCain has never expressed any objection to using manipulated intelligence – being from a family of veterans I do n’t think that McCain learned that world perspective from his service .
Its a pure political trait , one that he thinks gives him an edge as a future commander in chief .
McCain is in fact hiding his reckless foreign policy views behind his service and that is despicable .

Functional Programming Koans , in OCaml
( with answers )
[ With a bow in the direction of Danny Hillis ]
This page is in the spirit of having a little fun while pointing out some of the important concepts of Functional Programming .
I wrote most of them , but I got a couple ideas from others , who I will certainly credit if asked .
However , all blame for mistakes or inappropriateness should go to me .
So without further ado ...
FP Koans ( in OCaml )
Once the student has mastered the basics of FP , he is ready to study the FP Koans .
The study of FP Koans will help one achieve True FP Nature .
( By the way , if you do not know what a koan is Zen Buddhism , it is like a small story or statement given by a master to a student , whose subject is usually not literally about Zen , but it is such that when the student grasps the truth of it they will achieve some true understanding of Zen , perhaps even enlightenment . )
You stand before the mountain .
Learning the art of Functional Programming ( FP ) is like Zen .
In the beginning the student of FP sees his task as a large mountain .
Those who study it struggle to climb its heights .
Those who know it look back and see no mountain .
The Koan of Imperative / Declarative A student came to Xavier Leroy in his office one day , and commanded " Tell me how to achieve Knowledge of FP ! " , to which Xavier replied , " Do you want me to be a good teacher or a bad teacher ? "
The poor student replied , " I do not understand ! "
So Xavier replied , " Well , you could have me go to the trouble to tell you how to learn , or instead simply tell you what to learn . "
And the student was enlightened .
The Koan of Currying ( A koan about food , that is not about food ) A student came to Jacques Garrigue and said , " I do not understand what currying is good for . "
Jacques replied , " Tell me your favorite meal and your favorite dessert " .
The puzzled student replied that he liked okonomiyaki and kanten , but while his favorite restaurant served great okonomiyaki , their kanten always gave him a stomach ache the following morning .
So Jacques took the student to eat at a restaurant that served okonomiyaki every bit as good as the student 's favorite , then took him across town to a shop that made excellent kanten where the student happily applied the remainder of his appetite .
The student was sated , but he was not enlightened ... until the next morning when he woke up and his stomach felt fine .
The Koan of HOF A disciple who was a recent convert from another sect felt troubled by the teachings of his former master , who taught the dogma that only referentially transparent languages have Functional Nature .
So he asks his new master , Pierre Weis : " Does OCaml have Functional Nature ? " , to which wise master replied : " HOF ! "
On hearing the mystical incantation , the new convert was enlightened .
The Koan of Side Effects A student of FP came to Daniel de Rauglaudre and asked how to achieve FP Nature .
Daniel replied , " to achieve FP Nature , you must learn to program without side effects and other imperative features " .
So the student went away to learn how to program in this style .
He studied very hard so he could rid his programs of references and for - loops .
He struggled to only use let bindings and let rec loops .
One day , in order to find inspiration , he was studying the code of the Masters , and in reading the source of Camlp4 , he saw a number of uses of references and for - loops !
He rushed back to Daniel de Rauglaudre and exclaimed , " How can you tell me not to use imperative features when you use them yourself ! "
Daniel measured the student carefully in his gaze and replied , " But I already know how to program without side - effects . "
At that moment the student was enlightened .
The Koan of Lazy Evaluation Michel Mauny was giving a guest lecture to new computer science students .
After the students were seated , Michel pronounced " Today 's lecture will be about Lazy Evaluation " , he paused for a moment then concluded with , " Are there any questions ? "
The Koan of Static Type Safety A disciple of another sect invited Markus Mottl to the beach .
As he is driving his car along , he tells Markus : " Dynamic Typing makes me more productive !
I can write my program faster if I do not have to worry about the compiler complaining about types " .
Since it is a long trip , the disciple of Dynamic Typing decides to make a stop for petrol .
He enters the station to pay for the fuel and purchase a slurpee , while Markus attends to the refueling .
Markus notes that the petrol pump is in use , so he starts pumping diesel fuel into the disciple 's car .
The disciple cries out , " Hey !
What are you doing , this is a petrol car ! " .
Markus replies , " Well , I wanted to get to the beach faster " .
On the other side you look back .
There is no mountain .
You have spent months now studying OCaml and one day you wake up and realize that now your code compiles without error more often , runs without error more often , and is shorter and easier to read than you could ever have hoped !
Most of all , you realize that programming in OCaml is fun .
You have achieved FP Nature .
If you have gotten this far , you may wonder where the answers are !
Well , they are here .
But you should not read them until you have already read and understood the above koans , it just would n't be the same .

Transparency International India said that its study between November 2007 and January 2008 found that the police force was the most corrupt public service , with two out of every five of the 22,728 people randomly surveyed bribing the force for what was supposed to be free public services such as reporting crime .
One of the many challenges facing the global executive is the important task of pronouncing and spelling foreign names .
Indians in the US do face some difficulty with American names – a strong Mallu accent can change a ‘ John ’ to a ‘ Joan ’ for instance – but in general they do fine .
American first names are designed to be simple .
The ones that are n’t , are mercilessly shortened to nicknames .
I know many Tims , but no Timothys .
Americans pronouncing Indian names is an entirely different matter .
Americans have never developed the mouthparts to be able to say Jagadeesan Radhakrishnan , or Sabyasachi Mukhopadhyaya .
They may be called Radha and Tublu by friends and family .
But Radha and Tublu will not put those names on their business cards .
It is not in us Indians to shorten our names or make them easier for the Americans .
Our business cards and email display names will always carry our names in full glory and we will grant the right to use our shorter names only selectively to Americans who have earned the right to it .
There are many situations where this philosophy does not work well .
One , if you have an American boss .
Two , if you are in Sales .
If you have an American boss , he or she will decide on the first day of your employment what to call you .
You can tell him right away , that you would like to be called Radha , or you can let him decide to call you ‘ Jags ’ .
To make matters worse , Americans cannot fathom the South Indian framework of ( your name , father ’s name , village name ) in various permutations .
So it is best to go in prepared with a proposal on what you would like to be called .
The other situation , as I said , arises if you are in Sales or in any job that requires you to be in constant touch with people outside the company .
Take my example .
I have a pretty straightforward first name – Basab .
It is pronounced baa -sub .
It ’s not a very common name outside of Bengal ( my mother is Bengali ) but it has the virtue of being short .
Unlike the other examples I gave , the Americans respond to my name differently , when we are meeting for the first time .
Where they are tentative and tongue - twisted with a ‘ Sabyasachi ’ , they are confident and almost relieved about a ‘ Basab ’ .
Here , they say , is an Indian name that I will conquer with absolutely no help .
I can do this , they think , and then say out loud – “ Bu- saab , how you doin ? ”
Since I was in Sales and more often than not , the American I was meeting was a client , I never corrected anybody on the pronunciation of my name .
Some clients would figure it out , some clients would n’t .
There emerged a strong correlation between clients who were giving me more business and clients who pronounced my name correctly .
At one time , I had begun forecasting my pipeline solely based upon a simple but unorthodox heuristic – proposals to clients who could pronounce my name correctly had an 80 % chance of converting to revenue .
Others were n’t worth the paper they were printed on .
This was a pretty neat heuristic .
If this was indeed true , to improve my win rate , I just had to train my clients on how to pronounce my first name and the rest would take care of itself .
My win rates would soar and I would become the star Sales guy in the team .
Unfortunately , I was mixing up cause and effect and soon decided to move on to another brand of snake oil to improve my win rates .
All things being equal , in Sales , you can be under a major handicap if the client is unsure about how your name is pronounced .
A guy I know had the following email signature – Niraj ( knee - rudge ) Sharma .
He was a top Sales rep at Infosys .
Others have to take even stronger measures .
There was a guy I had some business dealings with in New York , whose parents , in an inspired moment nearly half a century back in India , had named him Bhuleshwar Gandhi .
In New York , when he wisely decided to change his name , he decided to not succumb to sentimental half - measures – he changed his name to Bill Grandee .
I suspect that was a turning point in his career .
Back to me .
Having muddled through my sales career in the US being called anything ( or nothing , many people chose to just point ) I am now completely inured to the pronunciation of my first name .
I suspect that many of my Indian friends here now call me Bus-aab .
It does n’t matter to me any more .
But at one time it did .
Way back when , in a moment of despair that only a sales guy short on his quota will understand , I told my wife that I wanted to change my first name .
‘ Bobby ’ I said , ‘ had a nice ring to it and was close enough to Basab ’ .
She said that she had married a Basab and was not keen on widening the field to Bobbys and such like .
I left it that .
But there is one place where I can stop being Basab and become someone else – at Starbucks .
Where I can fling off my Clark Kent persona and become Bobby man .
At Starbucks , they pride themselves in customizing your cup of caffeine to just the way you want it .
Naturally , all parties are then interested in getting that personalized cup of coffee to the right person .
Ergo , they ask for your name which they dutifully scrawl on the cup .
The Barista then concocts your cup , screws up his eyes at the name written on the cup and loudly calls it out .
A name like Basab can come out at the other end , totally unrecognizable even by its owner .
After a few disasters with Basab , I just switched to Bobby .
It ’s a win-win .
It helps the good people at Starbucks ( excellent service , by the way ) and lets me live my double life as Basab and Bobby .
So that ’s my secret name and now you know it .
I have altered the names of all the people named in this post to preserve their anonymity .
However , if they can still identify themselves , I hope they will forgive me in the name or art , or whatever .
Obama on the FISA ‘ Compromise ’ …
“ Given the grave threats that we face , our national security agencies must have the capability to gather intelligence and track down terrorists before they strike , while respecting the rule of law and the privacy and civil liberties of the American people .
There is also little doubt that the Bush Administration , with the cooperation of major telecommunications companies , has abused that authority and undermined the Constitution by intercepting the communications of innocent Americans without their knowledge or the required court orders .
“ That is why last year I opposed the so - called Protect America Act , which expanded the surveillance powers of the government without sufficient independent oversight to protect the privacy and civil liberties of innocent Americans .
I have also opposed the granting of retroactive immunity to those who were allegedly complicit in acts of illegal spying in the past .
“ After months of negotiation , the House today passed a compromise that , while far from perfect , is a marked improvement over last year ’s Protect America Act .
“ Under this compromise legislation , an important tool in the fight against terrorism will continue , but the President ’s illegal program of warrantless surveillance will be over .
It restores FISA and existing criminal wiretap statutes as the exclusive means to conduct surveillance – making it clear that the President cannot circumvent the law and disregard the civil liberties of the American people .
It also firmly re-establishes basic judicial oversight over all domestic surveillance in the future .
It does , however , grant retroactive immunity , and I will work in the Senate to remove this provision so that we can seek full accountability for past offenses .
But this compromise guarantees a thorough review by the Inspectors General of our national security agencies to determine what took place in the past , and ensures that there will be accountability going forward .
By demanding oversight and accountability , a grassroots movement of Americans has helped yield a bill that is far better than the Protect America Act .
“ It is not all that I would want .
But given the legitimate threats we face , providing effective intelligence collection tools with appropriate safeguards is too important to delay .
So I support the compromise , but do so with a firm pledge that as President , I will carefully monitor the program , review the report by the Inspectors General , and work with the Congress to take any additional steps I deem necessary to protect the lives – and the liberty – of the American people . ”

In his classic Economics in One Lesson , Henry Hazlitt applies Frederic Bastiat's " broken window " fallacy .
Many still have n't learned the lesson , apparently : this article from the Boston Globe argues that this year 's earthquakes in China will be good for Chinese economic growth and that disasters can be good for the economy more generally .
Disaster - induced institutional change might lead to higher growth over the long run , but in general the proposition flies in the face of one of economics ' simplest ideas : destroying resources makes societies poorer , not richer .
This is " The Lesson " of Hazlitt 's classic Economics in One Lesson .
I became acquainted with The Lesson in a very personal way last semester .
One day , my phone rang right before my 2:00 PM class .
It was the police calling to tell me that someone had broken into our house .
Fortunately , they did n't take anything of great importance , but they did kick down the back door and steal our TV and my wife 's laptop .
( For those of you who are curious , we were made whole by our insurance company — minus our deductible — but to the best of our knowledge the crime was never solved . )
The splinters and shards of broken glass that were all over our laundry room when I got home provided a tangible and vivid illustration of The Lesson .
We were very fortunate : in an unsolicited gesture of pure kindness , some of our friends who are good at this sort of thing came over , accompanied us to Lowe's , and helped us pick out , bring home , and install a new door .
One might argue that the robbery had a salutary effect in that we have a stronger relationship with these friends as a result , and indeed this was a silver lining to a very dark cloud .
That said , though , society is still worse off to the tune of a destroyed door and the time , energy , and money we had to invest in replacing our stuff .
What looks like increased economic growth is often redistribution in disguise .
The Globe cites a 1969 study by Douglas Dacy and Howard Kunreuther that showed how Alaskans may have been better off after the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake because of " the money that rushed into the Alaskan economy after the temblor , as well as generous government loans and grants for rebuilding . "
These were not free lunches , however , and the " generous government loans and grants " were likely better used elsewhere .
The Globe does point out that the conventional " disaster is good for the economy " accounting is incomplete , quoting George Mason University 's Donald Boudreaux 's statement that if destroying resources made us better off , " Beirut should be one of the wealthiest places in the world . "
As Henry Hazlitt put it in a quote that adorns the back of one of my favorite t- shirts ( now cheaper in nominal terms than when I bought mine about two years ago ) :
Government largesse after the 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake was good for some Alaskans , but the resources had to come from the taxpayers .
Government largesse after Hurricanes Andrew , Ivan , Dennis , Katrina , and others increased the incomes of some of the recipients of that largesse , but again , the resources had to come from taxpayers .
There is an argument that , by encouraging societies to replace decrepit infrastructure , a disaster can accelerate growth .
Yet again , the resources needed to replace that infrastructure must come from somewhere .
While we might expect to see robust postdisaster growth along the Gulf Coast and in government - sponsored Gulf Opportunity Zones ( GO Zones ) , it is scarcely clear that this would be economically efficient relative to encouraging people to move elsewhere .
As Harvard economist Edward Glaeser put it in a September 13 , 2005 Wall Street Journal article about post - Katrina recovery in New Orleans ,
We have an obligation to people , not to places … Given just how much , on a per capita basis , it would take to rebuild New Orleans to its former glory , lots of residents would be much [ better off ] with $ 10,000 and a bus ticket to Houston .
Government subsidies mean that there will be more production in the geographic space defined by the GO Zone , but this is not net new production .
It is economic activity that would have otherwise taken place elsewhere .
As a fan of innovation and progress , I am somewhat sympathetic to the idea that disasters increase productivity by hastening the switch to more efficient technologies .
If the productivity increase from implementing these new technologies were so great , however , private firms would implement them on their own initiative without government prodding .
Even if there are collective - action problems ( and , therefore , possible " market failures " ) in the implementation of new technologies , implementation through government opens the door to rent seeking and opportunism .
Moreover , the cost of technology - induced rapid growth in a disaster - stricken area might be taxation - and regulation - induced decline in the rest of the country .
Government incentives to invest in the areas laid low by Hurricane Katrina will reallocate economic resources toward the Gulf Coast .
Our personal experience illustrates one of the reasons why I remain unconvinced by the thesis that disasters increase economic growth by producing faster technological change .
We still have to forego something in order to invest resources in the new technology , and presumably private investors would implement productivity - increasing technologies without the government 's help if secure market institutions were in place .
The back door we installed after our house was robbed is much nicer than our old one .
However , the fact that we would have preferred the services rendered by the old door to the services rendered by the new door was revealed in the fact that we had not replaced the old door yet — nor did we have any immediate plans to do so .
The new door represents an improvement to our property , but to make that improvement we had to forego the services we otherwise could have enjoyed with the money we spent on the new door .
If we had n't been robbed , we would have the services provided by the old door plus the $ 400 or so we spent on the new one .
Instead , we have only the services provided by the new door , and the old door is nothing but a shattered mess in a landfill somewhere .
The Lesson is much broader in its applications , particularly to the popular ( and flawed ) trope that " war is good for the economy . "
Robert Higgs has done research showing that , contrary to popular beliefs , World War II did not actually end the Great Depression .
The increases in government spending needed to prosecute the war effort actually resulted in private disinvestment .
In another recent article , economist Frank Steindl argues that " endogenous propagation " mechanisms inherent in the market economy were responsible for recovery from the Great Depression rather than World War II .
In spite of all of this , I am prepared to believe that the long - run consequences of a disaster can be beneficial if they lead to privatization of previously government - owned property as well as institutional reforms more amenable to free markets .
As I understand it , Naomi Klein's The Shock Doctrine argues that capitalism requires disasters and " shocks " in order to usher in unpopular free - market reforms on an unwitting and unreceptive majority .
This is not a bad thing , though , particularly if Bryan Caplan 's The Myth of the Rational Voter is correct and voters are " rationally irrational . "
( Out of fairness to Ms. Klein , her book is still on my " to read " list ; however , extremely critical reviews by Tyler Cowen and Johan Norberg leave me skeptical of her central claims . )
Hazlitt once pointed out that the good ideas in economics have to be relearned every generation , and indeed it seems that a disaster cannot pass without common economic fallacies rearing their ugly heads .
The broken - window fallacy seems to reappear every time nature or terrorism causes mayhem and destruction .
The human suffering wrought by Hurricane Katrina , this year 's earthquakes in China , the tsunami that devastated parts of Asia several years ago , and the 9/11 terrorist attacks was bad enough .
Do we have to compound the misery by ignoring one of the most basic lessons economics has to teach us ?
[ The following is an exact transcript of this podcast . ]
Ten years ago , MySpace did n’t exist .
Neither did Facebook .
Just one site , called SixDegrees.com , dominated the online social networking market .
But soon a bunch of sites sprouted up : LiveJournal , Friendster , LinkedIn , MySpace , and in 2004 , Facebook .
Back then , Facebook was just for Harvard kids .
But a new study from the University of Minnesota says these days even the least privileged kids have profiles on MySpace and Facebook .
And they ’re on the internet all the time .
That finding goes against past studies that have found a ‘ digital divide ’ between rich and poor kids .

How did Scott Ritter know ?

Many people know that Scott Ritter , former Marine Corps major and former UN weapons inspector publicly disputed the Bush Administration 's claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
Few ask the question : How did Ritter know ?
When you answer that question , you 'll discover that the intention to attack and occupy Iraq on false pretenses spanned two administrations and both parties .
The official said the government of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert plans to wait until France assumes the presidency of the European Union in July .
France , he said , was expected to lead a European drive to expand sanctions on Teheran .
Over the last few weeks , the United States has raised the prospect of an Israeli air strike on Iran in 2008 .
Bush administration officials , particularly those from the Defense Department , said an Israel Air Force exercise in the Aegean Sea in June was meant to practice a massive air strike on Iran .
The exercise , conducted with Greece , was said to have included more than 100 Israeli aircraft , including F - 15s , F - 16s and KC - 130 air refueling tankers .
" The international community must not allow Iran to go nuclear , " Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said .
The U.S. intelligence community was said to have assessed that the Israeli air exercise concluded basic preparations for an attack on Iran .
The intelligence community determined that the exercise demonstrated the feasibility of a massive Israeli air strike at a range of about 1,600 kilometers .
But the Israeli official said the air force exercise did not reflect plans to attack Iran .
He said most of the exercise focused on search - and - rescue as well as mid-air refueling .
" There will not be any operation in 2008 , " the official said .
" An operation such as this must be coordinated — at least with the United States . "
Britain and France have become concerned over the prospect of an Israeli or U.S. strike on Iran .
Britain has issued an alert to its embassy in Bahrain of an imminent U.S. confrontation with Teheran .
On June 30 , U.S. Fifth Fleet commander Vice Adm. Kevin Cosgriff warned that Iran would not be allowed to block Gulf shipping .
Cosgriff , responding to Iranian threats to halt traffic in the Strait of Hormuz , said this would constitute an " act of war . "
" I cannot imagine , given the critical nature of that body of water , that the international community would not be outraged should Iran or any entity move to restrict the freedom of navigation , " Cosgriff told a news conference at Fifth Fleet headquarters in Manama .
" They are not going to be allowed to do so .
It would be an act of war .
In a tight oil market , the international community would respond vigorously to that . "
On Tuesday , the U.S. television network , ABC News , reported that Israel could strike Iran 's nuclear facilities in late 2008 .
ABC quoted a senior Pentagon official as reporting an " increasing likelihood " that Israel would attack Iran once it produced enough highly - enriched uranium to assemble a nuclear weapon .
" The Israelis are interested in such publications , " Israel Television military analyst Yoav Limor said .
" It tells the international community : ' Stop me . ' "
A senior Israeli security source said the military was not ready to destroy Iran 's nuclear weapons facilities .
The source told the Israeli daily Maariv that the military , weakened by an inadequate budget , was incapable of a sustained strike .
" Years of neglect , and cancellation of projects and budgets , have left us without strategic ability for effective attack , " the Israeli source was quoted as saying on Wednesday .
ABC quoted the Pentagon official as saying that Israel also wants to stage the operation before Iran acquires the SA - 20 , or S - 400 air and missile defense system from Russia .
The U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Iran could acquire the S - 400 Triumf over the next few months .
" The red line is not when they get to that point , but before they get to that point , " the official was quoted as saying .
" We are in the window of vulnerability . "

“ The low discipline levels that we first identified last year have now apparently become policy , ” Mr. Case said .
“ So far in 2008 , an even lower percentage of officers were disciplined . ”
Mr. Case did not provide official numbers for 2008 .
Over all , the report found a slight drop in complaints against police officers , down to 7,559 in 2007 from 7,662 in 2006 .
The board found police misconduct in 8 percent of the cases it investigated fully in 2007 , below the average of 12 percent over the last five years .
A majority of complaints , as in past years , involved abuse of authority , such as cases in which people say they were stopped and frisked without cause , followed by complaints of use of force , discourtesy and offensive language .
The report included examples of specific cases addressed in 2007 .
In one , on Nov. 2 , 2005 , a sergeant stopped two black men walking through a neighborhood in Whitestone , Queens , which is predominantly white .
It was 10:45 p.m. , and the men told the sergeant that they were looking at real estate .
The sergeant frisked them , finding nothing .
When he was interviewed by the civilian board , the sergeant said there had been an increase in burglaries in the area .
The board substantiated the complaint , as per state law , which says that innocuous behavior does not justify frisking .
The Police Department did not prosecute the case .
Ms. Schwartz said the men consented to the search .
“ If you consent to be searched , there ’s no misconduct , ” she said .
“ There was n’t an allegation that they were bullied into it . ”
She said she has used the very same case as an example of the gap in understanding between the police and the civilian board .
She said the two men in Whitestone were as young as 19 , walking down the middle of the street late at night , and that their real estate story was questionable at best .
Orchids , gorgeous and elegant , are also some of the most deceitful flowers , having evolved sometimes elaborate ruses to lure pollinators .
In a new study of the most brazen of these botanical cheats , the species that entice pollinators with false promises of sex , scientists have discovered that one group of orchids has taken the art of manipulation to shameless heights .
Sexually deceptive orchids , as biologists have long known , look and can even smell so much like a female insect that males will try to mate with the flower in a sometimes vigorous process that can result in pollination .
But scientists now report that the tongue orchids of Australia are such thoroughly convincing mimics of female wasps that males not only try to mate with them , but they actually do mate with them  to the point of ejaculation .
“ It ’s always been described as pseudocopulation , ” said Anne Gaskett , a graduate student at Macquarie University in Australia and the lead author of the study .
“ But it looked like true copulation to me . ”
Flickr users will be able to start making money out of the snaps they post online after the media - sharing site signed a deal with Getty Images , the world 's leading photo library company .
Under the terms of the partnership Getty will invite selected Flickr users to join a Flickr - branded photo group on gettyimages.com .
As part of the first commercial licensing deal made through gettyimages.com , Getty will hand - pick photos from the Flickr group and sell images on to its commercial clients , with photographers taking commission for each image .
The group is invite - only and entirely opt-in and will initially feature a few thousand images , according to Getty .
The objective is to increase Getty 's stock of regionally relevant content , said its vice - president of creative imagery , Andy Saunders .
" Flickr 's philosophy of personal sharing and immediacy has already impacted commercial photography , " Saunders added .
" The new Flickr collection will expand the definition of stock photography by making it even easier for our customers to find and license imagery that works in the full range of traditional and digital media . "
Kakul Srivastava , the Flickr general manager , said the deal is testimony to the website 's influential community of photographers .
Srivastava added that Getty gave Flickr " an unbeatable platform , licensing expertise , and a premier brand for members who want to bring their imagery to a worldwide customer base " .
Flickr , which is owned by troubled internet giant Yahoo , claims more than 54 million users each month and hosts more than 2bn photos .
The site allows users to choose whether they want their photos published under Creative Commons licences offering different and more flexible publishing rights , although unauthorised copying and reproduction of images is rife on the internet .
Getty Images has moved aggressively to acquire online and offline rivals in the 10 years since it was founded , buying high - end agency Photonica for $ 51 m ( £ 25.8 m ) in 2005 , iStockPhoto.com for $ 50 m in 2006 , and UK - based citizen media agency Scoopt in 2007 for an undisclosed amount .
The company itself was bought by private equity firm Hellman & Friedman for $ 2.4bn in February this year , at which point the investment firm 's managing director confirmed that the aim was to turn Getty Images into a global digital media operation .
Getty today told the New York Times that photographers typically earn between $ 150 - $ 240 ( £ 75 - £ 121 ) for each rights - managed image that is sold , and $ 50 ( £ 25 ) for a non-exclusive image .

he 's handing you a depleted die in the hopes of taking advantage of you .
Do n't fall for it ! "
Shamus Young , DM of the Rings " If a statistician hands you a die insisting that ' any given roll has the same odds of rolling a one or a twenty ' , it means .
Do n't fall for it ! "

" We guarantee that each number is random individually , but we do n't guarantee that more than one of them is random . "
Also known as RNGesus , if you 're feeling punny .
A statistician can tell you that properly generated random numbers will follow a discrete uniform distribution , giving you a roughly equal chance of rolling very good or very bad numbers .
They may wax eloquent about how pseudo - random numbers are generated in computers , and how dice are wonderful randomizers .
A good statistician will even disabuse you of the notion that a six sided die has an exactly 1/6 chance to land on any one side ; most dice are not built to that kind of precision .
( Casino craps table dice are .
They 're also more expensive . )
But it 's going to be close to even distribution , even with a cheap die .
A gamer , either of the tabletop or video variety , will tell you that this is all a load of dingoes ' kidneys .
The characters that gamers play live and die on good or bad rolls , and even if your dice are perfectly square and uniform , even if your game uses cryptographically strong random numbers , these numbers do not follow " distributions " or " probabilities . "
Instead , they usually produce whatever number you really did n't want .
A tabletop gamer may say that the dice are " trying to kill " them if they encounter a long series of bad rolls ( e.g. broke every weapon he was carrying ) .
Unless , of course , you know the proper way to placate the Random Number God : then the dice will smile upon you .
Usually .

The name of this trope comes from Angband 's and NetHack 's fanbases ( coined in the Angband fanbase , spread by Nethack 's ) , as a fanciful expansion of " RNG " , for " Random Number Generator " ; both games use Gameplay Randomization and are partially Luck - Based Missions , considering how many Instant Deaths there are , and the players of both games have been known to build altars to the " Random Number God " or curse his / her / its name .
Or both .
Some games try to cut out the nonsense by supplying their own Luck Manipulation Mechanic .
This never works — the Random Number God is not mocked , and it'll find a way to mess with you regardless .
In Real Life or certain other situations , a Two - Headed Coin can masquerade as a mere minion of the Random Number God up until The Reveal .

Saki proves that this trope applies to mahjong tiles as much as it does to dice .
Nodoka refuses to believe in players being " loved by the tiles " and such , but other players ' freakish abilities to defy all probability when playing ( as someone mentioned on the page , " how much can we make a statistician somewhere cry ? " ) pushes her into Flat - Earth Atheist territory .
In Quick Start !! , a 4 koma about tabletop gaming group , a resident powergamer Karasuyama Sachi is on RNG 's bad side , despite buying dice with equal distribution .
In Recovery of an MMO Junkie , Hayashi hears about a special lootbox event and declares that he wants all the rare items .
His guildmates cringe and warn him that he 's triggered the " Greed Sensor " , which responds to greedy players by ensuring that they 'll only get bad pulls .
True to form , for a while Hayashi rolls nothing but common healing potions ( though he does eventually get one of the rare items ) .
Lily , on the other hand , gets every single rare item ... because she 's the type of player willing to buy lootboxes until she gets everything she wants .
Defied by the titular character in Goblin Slayer whose tagline is " He does not let anyone roll the dice " .
Considering the whole setting is based on tabletop gaming played between ' Truth ' and ' Illusion ' , everything should be decided by chance ...
But GS is too meticulous to leave anything to chance , he always comes in prepared with multiple contingencies that could turn the table in one fell swoop .
At one point , the whole thing is illustrated by a figurine representing him kicking a bad die roll as if defying fate itself and succeeding .
Comic Books
In Knights of the Dinner Table , related to Hackmaster , a character was once beaten to a pulp for touching another gamer 's dice .
He was blinded by a cupful of soda and then was on the receiving end of a flying tackle .
No one ( except Sara ) thought that this was uncalled for , as " that 's one dice squirrel who'll think twice before touching another man 's dice ! "
The attacker in that scenario was the 5 ' 3 " pencil - necked Bob Herzog , and the man who touched his dice was the 6 ' 11 " ex-marine Nitro Ferguson , and every time the event is referenced ( the fight itself was never shown ) it is strongly implied that Nitro got hurt at least as bad as Bob did .
In the strip , they even outlined a " dice cleansing " ritual , used to banish bad luck from the character 's dice .
Many dice superstitions are explored in this strip .
Bob refers to his dice by name , keeps them segregated according to purpose and game genre .
Dave refers frequently to having his section of the table " trained " the way he likes it for dice rolling .
All of the Knights , even the sensible Sara , have dice rolling styles .
But the most infamous incident had Brian and Bob " fame - rubbing " their dice on Gary Jackson 's corpse ( a " legendary RPG creator " pastiche of Gary Gygax and Steve Jackson ) to charge them with good luck .
This backfired because Gary , being dead , was obviously out of good luck ( as Sara pointed out , someone who'd died in a plane crash could n't have been very lucky to begin with ) .
All the fame rubbed dice performed poorly in game play .
Or possibly because that corpse was n't Gary Jackson's .
Literature
Pinballs
This is such a big thing among pinball fans that they have adopted this term in recent years too as they have intermingled with fans of tabletop games and video games .
It is no longer in the same sense as it used to be , however :
Whereas older games were full of bumpers , slingshots , and other bouncy things to make the path of the ball unpredictable , more recent machines allow the player greater control of the ball and it is no longer nearly as much of an issue as it used to be .
The main issue , now , are random awards , benefits given to a player upon fulfilling certain conditions chosen randomly ( or pseudo - randomly ) from a list .
If you 're playing , say , Family Guy , and you really could use an Extra Ball , expect the game to just give you 100 points instead ( which is ludicrously small ) .
There is one that continues to persist to this day though :
The " house ball , " in which the ball , upon launching , falls into the drain without it having gone anywhere near the flippers — in other words , losing a ball with nothing the player could 've done to influence it .
Recent games where the ball must pass through bumpers after the launch , like Bram Stoker 's Dracula or The Walking Dead , are particularly vulnerable to this .
In KISS ( Stern ) , shooting the ball into Gene Simmons 's head will hold the ball on a magnet on a spinning disk hidden inside his head , then spun and spat back out at the player .
Because the ball is spinning , it will take a random and arced path back down .
The ball has fallen between the flippers and straight into the drain so often that the game was issued a patch a month after it first came out that returns the ball back to the player with no penalty if the ball goes down there the next 3 seconds ( default setting ) after Gene lets go of the ball .
The central pulsing magnet in The Addams Family causes the ball to get flung in wild and random directions whenever it 's active , which happens pretty often .
note
It is always active in " Seance , " any time a multiball is ready to begin , and continuously throughout all multiballs .
There is , however , a glitch in the code where if the player traps the ball for 15 seconds , the magnets deactivate , allowing the player to take a free shot .
Since almost all higher - level players are aware of this glitch , the magnets are simply disabled in competitive play in an effort to keep the game moving .
Tabletop Games
In the back of the Hackmaster 2nd Edition rulebook , there 's actually a list of various dice rituals that are prescribed for the game , including rubbing the dice clockwise for higher rolls and counter clockwise for lower rolls .
A number of bizarre good luck superstitions have arisen in the Warhammer 40,000 community .
Such as never calling missile launchers by their proper name ( it has the word " miss " in it ) , the idea that painted models are luckier than unpainted models note
Ork players do n't count ; their paint actually does change their units ' abilities , by the rules . , and the practice of occasionally muttering prayers to the Emperor .
Never taken seriously , but often endearing .
Do n't ever say " anything but an X . "
The more important the roll is , the higher the chance that you will get that X .
Most players have lost more games by saying " anything but an X " than by bad strategy .
note
If you need to say something , and good sportsmanship dictates you usually do , saying " 2s to squish " is usually safe - ish Also worth mentioning are the Chaos gods ' chosen numbers .
Chaos players used to get bonuses for fielding units of a certain size based on which god you were using .
Slaanesh was 6 , Nurgle 7 , Khorne 8 , Tzeentch 9 , the idea being that the Chaos god makes the characters more lucky as long as they spend time in their chosen number .
Modern versions of the game , for the sake of simplicity , have removed this rule .
The 40 K rule book advises players who are rolling large numbers of dice to take out the dice that failed and continue rolling the successful ones note each bullet is determined by 3 dice : whether it hit , how much damage , and whether the target 's armor withstood , so squads with automatic weapons can expect to roll 30 + dice up to three times each .
Players will tell you the exact opposite : NEVER reroll the successful ones immediately afterwards , because they have just used up a good roll .
A player will say , " I never seem to roll as well as I just did . "
A statistician will say , " Well , duh .
Regression to the mean .
You just had a lucky break , so the same entirely random process is very likely to produce a lower value simply because most possible values are lower . "
Both are correct .
The player will usually retort , " Whatever , " and produce another fifty dice .
40 K players always have enough dice , just never enough dakka .
Ork players are advised to use green dice for standard rolls ( " green iz best " ) , red dice for moving through terrain ( " coz da red ones go fasta " ) , and blue dice for critical rolls ( " da luckiest " ) .
Buy in bulk .
A related more - general " rule " is to never roll red dice for armor saves , because they 're for killing .
And , with Games Workshop occasionally doing promotional faction - specific dice , those are of course , far luckier if you 're playing that specific faction .
It is also recommended , as the melta is one of the most powerful anti-armor weapons a troop can carry , that it never be referred to as such , as firing a melta weapon is an exercise in comedic inaccuracy .
Simply referring to which model is firing should suffice .
And never use Meltaguns against infantry .
They might be great for blowing up tanks , but against infantry you 're guaranteed to roll a 1 .
Some Eldar players mutter prayers to Khaine , or to Cegorach if using Harlequins .
Chaos players , meanwhile , invoke the Dark Gods , and Ork players just shout " WAAAAAGH " when shooting .
Or charging .
Or at random intervals .
The Rogue Trader spin - off RPG made off with the old idea of the Chaos gods ' favored numbers by making 9s occasionally have special effects on rolls - especially those related to psychic powers .
Yes , this means that Tzeentch , the god of Sorcery and Change , is implied to be the RNG that is out to get you .
In the Wuxia RPG Weapons Of The Gods , observed good or bad luck with the dice can be utilized as a game effect , discovering that the character is under a curse or blessing which can then be either increased to add actual bonuses or used to create a balancing effect of the opposite type .
The system itself also features the River mechanic , designed to mitigate the influence of the RNG .
You can take dice results out of a role and store them for later use , so if you make an awesome roll on a trivial task , or roll two sets when you only need one , you can set some aside and break them out later when you screw up something important .
The Red Dragon Inn provides an in - depth ( and tongue - in- cheek ) tutorial on how to make the dice roll high numbers .
.
Referenced by name in Hoyle 's Rules of Dragon Poker , where players are afforded infinite mulligans if they 've angered the RNG .
Blood Bowl features a literal example of this in -universe , in the form of Nuffle , the game 's patron god .
This trope is also very much in effect for the players , since one of the keys to a successful game is rolling your dice as seldom as possible while forcing your opponent to roll dice as often as possible .
Random Encounter
Dice includes disclaimers on their packaging such as " Random Encounter Dice are not responsible for your party falling into the same trap twice " , " Random Encounter Dice are not responsible for that TPK by goblin ambush " , and " Random Encounter Dice are not responsible for you rolling a natural 1 when throwing Alchemist 's Fire " .

Real Life
A data breach will cost your business over $ 3 million .
In other words , if you ’re a small business , a data breach will promptly send you packing .
You ’re probably asking , “ Why would anyone come after a small business ? ”
Hackers love small businesses because they ’re easy to penetrate .
What measures are you taking to protect your business from known and yet - to - be - known cybersecurity threats ?
Are you just riding on luck , hoping that hackers do n’t notice your business ?
In the new age , a smart entrepreneur knows that beefing up their business ’ cybersecurity is n’t something to debate .
It has to be done .
Read on to learn how to do it .
1. Identify the Cyber Threats Your Business Faces
There are several common cyber threats .
They include malware , phishing , Denial of Service , trojans , and ransomware .
While you should generally protect your business from all kinds of cyber threats , it ’s not advisable to adopt a blanket approach .
You should start by identifying the threats that pose the biggest risk to your business .
For example , if your online business collects and stores customer data , most hackers are n’t going to focus on infecting your computers just to disrupt your operations .
They ’ll aim at your data ; to steal it and possibly hold you at ransom .
When you ’ve properly identified the cyber threats your business faces and categorized their threat level , you ’ll be in a better position to deploy the right preventative measures .
2. Have a Cybersecurity Pro on Your Team
Identifying and categorizing cyber threats is n’t a layman ’s task .
If you do n’t have any cybersecurity training , it ’s unlikely that you ’ll be able to correctly identify cyber threats .
Do n’t worry , though .
Most entrepreneurs do n’t know zilch about cybersecurity issues .
This is why you need to hire a cybersecurity pro .
This professional will audit your business ’ systems and processes , identify threats , and develop an effective cybersecurity strategy .
What if your business is running on a shoestring budget and thus unable to afford an in - house cybersecurity professional ?
Outsourcing is always a cheaper option .
However , there are thousands of outsourcing service providers , so you ’ve got to do some research in order to find a provider who suits your needs .
An ideal strategy is to focus on providers who specialize in certain industries .
If you ’re a law firm , for example , go for companies that offer IT services for law firms .
That being said , do n’t rely on IT outsourcing forever .
While outsourcing is cost - effective and gets the job done , as your business grows you ’ll need to develop an in - house IT team .
An in - house pro is best placed to identify your business ’ changing IT needs and recommend the right actions .
3. Train Your Employees
Your cybersecurity arsenal will only be effective if your employees know how to make the most of it .
You might be having the toughest firewall , but if an untrained employee mistakenly turns it off enabling hackers to gain a free route , your investment would have gone to waste .
Giving your employees adequate cybersecurity training is essential .
Most small businesses cut corners on employee training because of the high costs involved , but consider what ’s at stake .
Would you rather not invest $ 20,000 on employee training but enhance your business ’ risk of a $ 3 million data breach ?
What ’s more , employee cybersecurity training does n’t have to be expensive .
There are free online resources you can print out and ask them to read .
You can also organize in - house workshops , where a specialist can train your employees in small groups .
Employee training is n’t a one - off event .
Since cyber threats are always evolving , only regular training will help ensure your employees are well - equipped to protect your business .
4. Develop Organizational Policies That Support Cybersecurity
You can train a person as much as you want , but sometimes it ’s all about personal choice when it comes to doing what they ’re trained to do .
Case in point :
An employee who knows that accessing the organization ’s systems using an open network is not recommended , but goes ahead and does it anyway .
You cannot monitor your employees ’ actions all the time and ensure they ’re doing the right thing , but you can create policies that “ force ” them to do the right thing .
For instance , you can make it company policy for employees to change their passwords every week .
Whoever violates this policy could face some consequences , such as system restrictions .
As a business owner , you ’re within your rights to enforce such a policy .
If your business does n’t have any IT policies , now is the best time to start developing them .
Your in - house IT specialist or outsourcing partners will help you develop effective policies that will go a long way in protecting your business against cyber threats .
5. Get the Basics Right
At the end of the day , the big stuff wo n’t make much difference is you are n’t doing the small stuff .
You know , stuff like creating strong passwords on your personal and business emails , as well as on wireless networks .
You see that software update notification you ’re getting on your computer ?
It ’s not something you should be postponing for a later time .
It could be a critical security patch that needs to be installed right away .
Keep ignoring it and you ’ll find hackers camping in your systems .
Backup your data .
We ca n’t stress this enough .
Should a data breach occur , you ’ll retrieve the backups and keep your operations going .
There are plenty of data backup options , so be sure to explore them and find a good fit .
Thwart Those Cyber Security Threats
Internet technologies have made our lives easier and miserable almost in equal measure .
While embracing technology will take your business to the next level , you also expose it to dangerous cybersecurity threats .
But you have the power to ensure they remain just that , threats .
Part of what you have to do is put the tips fleshed out above to use .
The other part is to keep reading our blog for more cyber tips !
Democratic Presidential candidate , Barack Obama , kicked off his two week , swing state tour today in Raleigh , NC .
In a speech about economics , Senator Obama made clear the differences between his health care platform and the failed Bush / McCain policies that cater to the " healthy and wealthy " and have left some 47 million Americans without health insurance .
Obama pledged to make it easier for every American to get good health care , do away with exemptions for pre-existing conditions , stop drug companies from price gouging , and then said something that was greeted with great enthusiasm by the crowd :

" By the way , I 'm going to be partnering up with Elizabeth Edwards , we 're going to be figuring all this out . "
Obama is smart to enlist Elizabeth Edwards , who backed Hillary Clinton 's health care plan earlier in the primary season .
I believe that together , they will come up with a health care plan with mass appeal that is so strong it will put the issue out of McCain 's reach this fall .

I talk a lot about renewable energy and jobs .
Mostly because I grew up in the midwest , and saw first hand what a “ transition ” to a new system can do to an intrenched industry .
When the Japanese , Korean and European car companies started making better more efficient cars in the 80’s the midwest “ transitioned ” from the Bible belt , to the rust belt .
Thousands of people lost jobs as factories closed and plants moved to Mexico and overseas .
Well welcome to the new transition , carbon is out , renewable is on it ’s way in .
In the 80’s 90’s and now in the 00’s American industry has for the most part been content to let these new jobs go to others .
We stubbornly plod along thinking that we can keep doing things “ our ” way while Europe and Asia retool for the next century .
The next industry up for gutting is the coal industry .
Luckily a transition to renewable energy sources promises significant global job gains at a time when the coal industry has been hemorrhaging jobs for years , according to the latest Vital Signs Update released by the Worldwatch Institute .
The coal , oil , and natural gas industries require steadily fewer jobs as high - cost production equipment takes the place of human capital .
Why pay ten guys with pick axes to go into a mine when you can pay one with a fancy coal robot ?
Many hundreds of thousands of coal mining jobs have been shed in China , the United States , Germany , the United Kingdom , and South Africa during the last two decades , sometimes in the face of expanding production .
In the United States alone , coal industry employment has fallen by half in the last 20 years , despite a one - third increase in production .
These jobs are often lost in areas that have been in brutal poverty for years .
It seems that even when coal companies provided jobs , they provided low paying dangerous ones .
Now that they are leaving , the poverty only gets worse , and the people are left with a mined out waste land to be poor in .
Coal has rapped these communities for everything they are worth and then moved on .
â€ œRenewables are poised to tackle our energy crisis and create millions of new jobs worldwide , â€ according to Worldwatch Senior Researcher Michael Renner .
“ Meanwhile , fossil fuel jobs are increasingly becoming fossils themselves , as coal mining communities and others worry about their livelihoods . ”
Strong government support has allowed Germany , Spain , and Denmark to emerge as leaders in renewable energy developmentâ€ ” and green jobs .
The German government reports that the country was home to an estimated 259,000 direct and indirect jobs in the renewables sector in 2006 .
This figure is expected to reach 400,000â € “ 500,000 by 2020 , and 710,000 by 2030 .
In the United States , the renewables sector employed close to 200,000 people directly and 246,000 indirectly in 2006 , due mostly to leadership at the state level , rather than strong leadership at a federal level .
China is rapidly catching up in manufacturing of solar photovoltaics ( PV ) and wind turbines and is already the dominant global force in solar hot water development .
An estimated 2.3 million people worldwide currently work either directly in renewables or indirectly in supplier industries .
The solar thermal industry employs at least 624,000 people , the wind power industry 300,000 , and the solar PV industry 170,000 .
More than 1 million people work in the biomass and biofuels sector , while small - scale hydropower employs 39,000 individuals and geothermal employs 25,000 .
These figures are expected to swell substantially as private investment and government support for alternative energy sources grow .
The most optimistic analyses project that global wind power employment will increase to as much as 2.1 million in 2030 and 2.8 million in 2050 .
Similar projections estimate that worldwide solar PV production alone could create as many as 6.3 million jobs by 2030 .
â€ œGovernment officials now have yet another reason to put the full weight of their support behind renewables , â€ said Renner .
“ In addition to protecting our planet and phasing out an increasingly limited resource , policies that support renewable energy also support job creation . ”
The real question here is how many of those 9.1 million potential jobs will be in the US ?
My feeling is that because we are so far behind it would take a significant increase in government ( federal , state and local ) support as well as a shift in culture to grab a majority of these jobs .
But the demand is there , and America does has a lot going for it .
We have a well educated work force with good transportation infrastructure .
We have high tech science and one of the worlds best university system for R & D .
And we have all the money .
These jobs could be just the thing that gets us out of our troubled economic problems .
Lets hope the next industrial revolution in this country will be a green one .

( CNN ) -- Boy Scouts were transformed into heroes when a deadly tornado blew apart their remote camp in western Iowa on Wednesday night .
Clockwise from top left : Sam Thomsen , 13 ; Josh Fennen , 13 ; Aaron Eilerts , 14 ; and Ben Petrzilka , 14 . more photos »
In what Iowa Gov. Chet Culver called " a blow right to the gut " Thursday morning , the storm killed four Boy Scouts and sent dozens of others to hospitals .
The tornado at the Little Sioux Scout Ranch killed Josh Fennen , 13 , Sam Thomsen , 13 , and Ben Petrzilka , 14 , all of Omaha , Nebraska ; and Aaron Eilerts , 14 , of Eagle Grove , Iowa , who was a camp staff member , said Gene Meyer , Iowa public safety commissioner .
Forty - eight Scouts and staff members were injured .
Possible tornadoes also struck northeastern Kansas , killing at least two people , injuring many others and damaging buildings at Kansas State University .
Broken trees and tattered remnants of tents were scattered throughout the Boy Scout campground midway between Sioux City , Iowa , and Omaha , Nebraska .

Nothing was left of a bunkhouse where Scouts had sought shelter and where a collapsed chimney trapped several victims .
Watch a tour of the devastated camp »
After all 93 Scouts and staff members were accounted for , stories of heroism began to emerge .
" These young men ... literally saved lives during this time period when emergency management could not get to them , " Culver said .
They " were the real heroes . "
" They immediately started helping each other in this time of need [ and ] set up their own mini- triage unit . "
Rob Logsdon , a 15 - year - old staff member at the camp , said that although he was injured , he rescued some of his fellow Boy Scouts trapped underneath a collapsed chimney at one of the camp 's four bunkhouses .
Watch Logsdon coolly tell his story »
" I was standing up trying to pull bricks off the kids that were sitting there , and then I could n't do any more because my hip and leg were hurting so badly , " Logsdon said on CNN's " American Morning . "
He dislocated his hip , sprained his ankle and was gashed in his knee when the tornado struck the shelter .
" We were sitting there watching lightning ... and we saw [ the tornado ] come around the end of a bluff toward the entrance of the camp , " Logsdon said .
" So we flipped on the siren , and the youth staff members ran to the assigned shelters . "
The adult leader ordered everyone to get under the tables .
" All of a sudden , two seconds later , the tornado was on top of us , " Logsdon said .
" I know it picked up our adult leader 's car and threw it 50 yards , easy . "
Camper Ben Karschner said it was over quickly .

" Eight seconds , and the tornado passed .
That was like the longest eight seconds I 've ever had , " he told CNN affiliate KETV in Omaha .
Thomas
White , an 18 - year - old Eagle Scout and staff member , said he lay on the ground with several of the younger Scouts as the tornado roared through .
" The grace of God helped us for sure , " he said .

Logsdon said one of his friends was among the four killed .
" I went back to Little Sioux after I got out of the hospital , and his dad had just found out he died , " he said .
" He was my staff partner , and he was a good kid , and it 's a big loss .
He was a great kid . "
Survivors were receiving trauma and grief counseling , officials said .

" But those young Scout leaders , the adults who were there , they responded in true Boy Scout fashion , and I think we need to recognize them for what they did . "
The boys at the ranch were advanced Scouts between 13 and 18 years old and were there for a week of training , said Lloyd Roitstein , president of the Mid-America Council of Boy Scouts of America .
They had been through an emergency preparedness drill Tuesday , he said .
The storm that struck Kansas State University 's campus destroyed a wind erosion lab , damaged several engineering and science buildings and tore the roof off a fraternity house at the school in Manhattan , said Cheryl May , the university 's director of media relations .
" Our campus is kind of a mess , " she said .
The storm destroyed up to 50 homes and damaged hundreds in Manhattan , said Lt. Kurt Moldrup of the Riley County Police Department .
" We had a lot of damage but very few injuries , " he said .
A man was killed outside Soldier , Kansas , about 50 miles north of Topeka , said Sharon Watson , a spokeswoman for the state emergency management agency .
His body was found outside his mobile home , she said .
A woman was killed in Chapman , Kansas , her body found in a yard , Watson said .
" The town took a direct hit , " she said .
The storm destroyed 60 houses in Chapman , she said .
Another 30 suffered major damage , and about 30 received minor damage , she said , citing early estimates from the American Red Cross .
The storms struck as Midwestern states deal with severe flooding along the upper Mississippi River .
Heavy downpours hit the region over the weekend , with more thunderstorms predicted for Thursday morning .

SAN FRANCISCO 
The secret to finding the perfect parking spot in congested cities is usually just a matter of luck .
But drivers here will get some help from an innocuous tab of plastic that will soon be glued to the streets .
This fall , San Francisco will test 6,000 of its 24,000 metered parking spaces in the nation ’s most ambitious trial of a wireless sensor network that will announce which of the spaces are free at any moment .
Drivers will be alerted to empty parking places either by displays on street signs , or by looking at maps on screens of their smartphones .
They may even be able to pay for parking by cellphone , and add to the parking meter from their phones without returning to the car .
Solving the parking mess takes on special significance in San Francisco because two years ago a 19 - year - old , Boris Albinder , was stabbed to death during a fight over a parking space .
Bethany Lewis is a nippy defender for Farsley Vixens under - 11 football XI , but for the past six months her sharp eyes have been fixed on a mantelpiece digital monitor at her home in Leeds .
Its flickering numbers show the cost of the household 's power , minute by minute , and if it climbs up beyond a couple of pence an hour , Bethany wants to know why .
Her vigilance , matched in 63 other homes on eight streets around Britain with the word green in their name , underlies a dramatic claim that simple good housekeeping could save Britain £ 4.6 bn in domestic fuel bills .
" When I come in from school , I check the numbers , " the nine - year - old says .
" If they 've gone up , I go to the telly to see if it 's been left on , so that the video's on standby .
If it has , I 'll unplug it . "
Thousands of similar small acts have put the Lewises ' street , Green Lane in the suburb of Cookridge , into the lead in the national Green Streets competition .
Halfway through the contest , which began in January , the gently sloping double row of 1960s terraces , semis and bungalows has cut costs by 29.32 % .
Its seven rivals have n't done quite as well - Manchester is bottom with only 8.56 % .
But the Institute for Public Policy Research ( IPPR ) thinktank , which is monitoring the exercise for British Gas , calculates the £ 4.6bn - and a 20 % fall in carbon emissions - from the eight streets ' average score .
Energy use is moving rapidly up the political agenda as prices rise and put pressure on household budgets .
Only last week one of Britain 's biggest suppliers , EDF Energy , announced that it was raising gas prices by 22 % and electricity by 17 % .
Its five major rivals are expected to follow with similar increases in price .
" We need creative approaches to energy efficiency like this , if the UK is to reach its CO2 reduction targets , " says Matthew Lockwood , senior fellow in the IPPR 's climate team .
Bethany 's mother Janine , an insurance team leader , agrees - but adds that it is n't rocket science .
" We 've had a new energy - efficient boiler fitted as part of the competition , " she says , " but what 's struck us is that it 's our behaviour which really makes the difference .
Just the simplest things , like drawing the curtains later at night in the summer and keeping the lights off .
Not putting the children 's school uniform in the washing machine every day .
Not leaving things on standby . "
" And swapping our electric lawnmower for a manual one , " adds her husband Ian , a copytaker with the Press Association .
" It 's just as good and it gives me a bit of a workout . "
The Lewises have saved 27 % on power bills so far - a handsome figure but one that is dwarfed by the Neysari family at the top of the hill .
You wo n't miss their house , say Ian and Janine , because it 's got great solar panels on the roof .
Gleaming in the July sun , they have reduced the last six months ' costs by half .
" We 're heading for saving £ 500 on gas alone this year , half our previous bill , " says Rebecca Neysari , an accountant currently at home with her hands full with three - year - old Cyrus and one - year - old Kiyana .
The contest , which has equipped all 64 entrants with energy - efficient technology , has also fitted the house with a new water tank and boiler and individual room valves on all central heating radiators .
Friendly competition
Child power rules here , too .
" Cyrus is always telling me to turn things off , " says Neysari , wading through a roomful of mostly clockwork or push - and - pull toys .
Group support plays an important part too ; there 's friendly competition between the eight households , but much more in the way of swapping tips .
" We meet regularly to see how everyone 's doing , " she says , adding that the one gizmo nobody in Green Lane likes is the one - cup kettle donated by British Gas .
Halfway up the lane , immersed in her garden 's ranks of plump peapods and swelling onions , Shirley Carter denounces it with vim .
" Hated it , I 'm afraid , " she admits .
" I did n't consider it was properly boiled water , just not good enough for a proper cup of tea .
I persevered for a while but we 've gone back to the old kettle .
But I always put lids on pans now , which we did n't used to do . "
She and Neysari share Bethany 's fascination with the digital monitor , the smallest but most significant of all the extras fitted to the contestants ' houses , from Greenway Road in Cardiff to Edinburgh 's Colinton Mains Green .
" It shoots up when you 've got something power - hungry on , " Carter says .
" Off you go , to find out what it is and do something about it . "
Her list of tips includes solar - powered lights in the garden - for vegetable - watering at dusk , which was previously , expensively lit by electric lamps round the Carters ' ornamental pond - and a security floodlight over their conservatory .
Like Neysari , who now only uses her top oven for the children 's meals , Shirley is also debating the " cooking Scrooge " gambit : turning the oven off five to 10 minutes before the end of the recommended cooking period , because it maintains sufficient heat .
Halfway through the competition , the IPPR is publishing three draft recommendations .
In keeping with the Bethany / Cyrus approach , the suggested reforms are simple .
The first , says Lockwood , is extending the competition , central to the Green Streets project , by offering £ 4 m annually from the Treasury as prizes for similar inter - town energy - saving contests .
Secondly , IPPR suggests recruiting a national force of energy advisers similar to the British Gas experts who have been attached to Green Streets .
" It would be impossible to replicate this competition 's ratio of one adviser for eight households , " says Lockwood , " but if we had one for every 20 streets , that would be 10,000 advisers . "
IPPR puts the cost at £ 500 m annually , against the £ 4.6 bn saving on national energy costs , which currently total about £ 23bn .
The final reform would repeat on a national scale the £ 30,000 British Gas has given to the eight streets to pay for new equipment such as the Lewises ' boiler and the Neysaris ' solar panels .
Green mini-mortgages are suggested to fund , for example , a £ 524 package for cavity wall and loft insulation .
A three - year loan at a 7 % rate of interest would be offset by £ 395 annual savings in fuel bills , the thinktank says .
And the whole exercise is not a return to the shivering , primitive past , according to the Leeds energy adviser , Alan Pickard .
" One of the most striking things has been how cosy everyone feels because of their new insulation , " he says .
" You do n't have to suffer by saving energy . "

Under - 18s and very fair - skinned people in NSW will be banned from using solariums by January .
The NSW Government yesterday committed to introducing strict regulations , which would be enforceable by January 1 regardless of whether national guidelines were still being thrashed out .
The Australian Medical Association and NSW Greens criticised the State Government this week for not acting sooner after both Victoria and South Australia introduced regulations earlier this year and Western Australia announced last week it would soon follow .
Synopsis
This tutorial covers details where the official docs and tutorials are leaving , although at the beginner ’s level .
In the following piece , you will learn how to :
setup the Blender Export script called “ chicken “ .
create your own model using Blender .
Use this model in a scene created from scratch .
Deal with camera control issues .
Considerable refactoring is necessary to expand upon this code , which is what I ’m doing at the moment of writing this tutorial .
However , I assume that what follows will be of help to people trying to pick - up on Panda3D quickly .
What you ’ll get in the end is pretty simple : a model which moves according to a small set of keyboard controls .
In the following tutorial , we ’ll add keyboard control of the model .
Assumptions
You have read through the online docs and looked at the beginner tutorials .
Disclaimer : This tutorial is written by a newcomer to Panda3D !
Step 1 – Installing Chicken
Creating your own models can be easily done using Blender .
“ Easily ” is of course a relative term since it assumes that you can model with this software .
If you do n’t , it is worth the few hours of effort .
Blender does n’t have a native Save as… to the egg format , but luckily an export filter is available here .
A relevant post is available here .
The file that matters is the Python file ( the other are n’t essential ) .
You must put this python file into the script folder of your Blender installation .
Under Ubuntu 8.04 , this is /usr / share / blender / scripts , or ~/.blender / scripts / .
Under other OS , just look - up where Blender installed itself ( I got out of the Windows business and will never get back to it ! ) .
You know that it worked when :
Launch Blender .
Select the default cube .
Click on File \Export … , there should be a line looking like “ Chicken 1.0 ( .egg ) ” Select an output file in the egg format .
Click on “ Export ” .
The output file should have 126 lines ( about ) and begin with “ < CoordinateSystem > { Z- up } ” .
Step 2 – Making your counter
My project will create a virtual tabletop miniature environment .
The basic element is the base of the models .
For now , this will be slightly scaled box .
Create a subfolder to the project called models
In blender , select the default box and open the default properties .
Rescale in Y to 0.5 , in Z to 0.2 .
Offset in Y to - 0.5 such that ( 0,0,0 ) overlaps with the front polygon of the cube ( this will matter later ) .
Export using Chicken into a models / counter.egg
Step 3 – Imports and class definition
Although this is not required , we ’ll create a World class which will contain the bulk of the application .
Panda3D does n’t force you into an Object Oriented design , but this is a good habit to get into and by inheriting DirectObject , useful shortcuts gets exposed to our World class .
Import core and initialize :
import direct.directbase.DirectStart
from pandac .
PandaModules import *
Additional imports for DirectObject and OnScreenText :
from direct.gui.DirectGui import OnscreenText
from direct.showbase.DirectObject import DirectObject
It is now time to create a class inheriting DirectObject ( we need to do this to inherit the accept method required to bind events ) .
Here is what ’s needed to create the World class and get a working application :
class World ( DirectObject ) : pass w = World ( ) run ( )
Creating an instance of the World class actually does n’t do anything at the moment : you ’d get exactly the same result without .
It will make sense to bundle into an object in order to group event handler together , implementing serialization and game logic .
Step 4 – Add a box into this world
Let ’s be bold and add a few methods to the World class !
For readability , we ’ll load the model , setup lights and the camera in three different methods .
class World( DirectObject ) : self.LoadTerrain ( ) self.LoadLights ( ) self .
LoadCamera ()
Loading the model can be done in two lines .
The only possible difficulty is to make sure that you ’ve got the path working fine .
def LoadTerrain ( self ) : self.
counter = loader.loadModel(' models/counter ' ) self.counter.reparentTo(render ) base.setBackgroundColor(0.0,0.3,0.0 )
The .egg extension is optional .
Also feel free to set the background to any color that you want : just keep in mind that the RGB channels are expressed in the range 0.0 to 1.0 .
The object referred to by render is the top node in the scene graph .
Our counter will thus be directly subordinate to this root .
At this point , executing the code ( assuming that you provide skeleton methods for LoadLights ( ) and LoadCamera ( ) ) , will yield a blank screen .
This is because the camera is consistently returning to ( 0,0,0 ) , looking up the Y axis , thus looking at our polygon through their back faces .
Some strange operations must be done to prevent this from happening .
def LoadCamera( self ) : # Camera base.camera.setPos(4,-10,10 ) base.camera.lookAt(self.counter ) mat=Mat4(camera.getMat( ) ) mat.invertInPlace( ) base.mouseInterfaceNode.setMat(mat )
This is discussed here and I ’m not quite sure why inverting the camera ’s material fixes it ( nor why there is a mouseInterfaceNode ) , but the last 3 lines keep the default mouse navigation mode active ( good enough for the moment ) .
You know that this work if at this point : Running the script at this point would yield a completely unshaded ( bright white ) box and a green background .
Step 5 – Lights
There is not a lot to the lights in this tutorial :
def LoadLight ( self ) : ''' Create an Ambient light as well as a point light ''' plight = AmbientLight ( 'my plight ' ) plight.setColor( VBase4( 0.12 , 0.12 , 0.12 , 1 ) ) plnp = render.attachNewNode( plight ) render.setLight( plnp ) light2 = PointLight ( ' pointlight ') plnp2 = render.attachNewNode(light2 ) plnp2.setPos( 2,2,2 ) render.setLight(plnp2 )
If you comment out the PointLight , the model will be lit exclusively by the ambient light an this appear flat and dark .
Epilogue
This is it for Tutorial 1 .
Not much was done that has n’t been done in Panda3D ’s manual and official tutorials .
I struggled for a while with the camera issue ; almost gave up .
There are some real good people on the official forum who helped , but I thought that another newbie tutorial could be useful to some .
The next step is to implement the handlers to catch keyboard events .
Once you ’ve tried this once , you will realize how amazingly clean the Panda3D API is .
Having done projects in wxPython , Windows MFC , Qt , OpenGL and some other obscure library : working with Panda3D is a real treat .
Stay tuned !
For the records , here is the full code :
#!/usr/bin/python '''
First attempt at Panda3D .
cblouin at cs dal ca ''' # Import section import direct.directbase.DirectStart from pandac.PandaModules import * from direct.gui.DirectGui import OnscreenText from direct.showbase.DirectObject import DirectObject # Definitions class World( DirectObject ) : def __init__( self ) : self.LoadTerrain ( ) # Lights self .
LoadLight ( ) # Camera self.LoadCamera( ) def LoadTerrain ( self ) : self.
counter = loader.loadModel('models/counter.egg ' ) self.counter.reparentTo(render ) base.setBackgroundColor(0.0,0.3,0.0 ) def LoadLight ( self ) : ''' Create an Ambient light as well as a point light ''' plight = AmbientLight ( 'my plight ' ) plight.setColor( VBase4( 0.12 , 0.12 , 0.12 , 1 ) ) plnp = render.attachNewNode( plight ) render.setLight( plnp ) light2 = PointLight ( ' pointlight ') plnp2 = render.attachNewNode(light2 ) plnp2.setPos( 2,2,2 ) render.setLight( plnp2 ) def LoadCamera( self ) : # Camera base.camera.setPos(4,-10,10 ) base.camera.lookAt(self.counter ) mat=Mat4(camera.getMat( ) ) mat.invertInPlace ( ) base.mouseInterfaceNode.setMat(mat ) # Application code if __name__ == " __main__ " : w = World ( ) run ( )
I have come to a realisation recently that I wanted to check with you .
I ’m starting to think Reddit has overtaken Digg .
It does n’t look as nice , does n’t have the big name , nor does it have the famous Kevin Rose , but as a user and as a Social Media type , Reddit seems to have edged out Digg , and I am not the only one who thinks so .
Why is Reddit better than Digg ?
It Works – Breaking news really is breaking news on Reddit , not 2 day old news reheated .
What is the point of this sort of system when every other site on the web has 4 variations of a story before Digg even acknowledges it ?
Content Mix –
There is more variety and fewer favored domains .
Of course you still see the same old domains but not to the degree that happens over at Digg .
Yeah XKCD can be funny , but you know , it gets a bit much when it seems every single frikkin post gets to the front page .
If I wanted to subscribe I would n’t use Digg to do it !
( Slight exaggeration but you know what I mean ) Democratic –
It ’s easier for ordinary users to get a front page story , which adds to the mix ( see # 2 ) but also means it is not as elitist as Digg in terms of submitters .
See Down Votes – Reddit is far more transparent , you can see when your story is not going to make it as you can see the users voting it down .
Now this is annoying , especially when you do n’t know why you are getting down votes , but not as annoying as being left in the dark .
Digg Conspiracy – On Digg getting lots of votes does n’t always mean your story goes front page , leading to conspiracy theories at one end and disenchantment at the other .
Neither good .
Digg used to be my favorite but lately , not so much .
Now Reddit has gone open source it should only get better as the community piles on with fixes and improvements .
What is your response Mr Rose ?
What do you think ?
Has Digg lost its way or has Reddit still some way to go ?

Most adults in the U.S. will be overweight or obese by 2030 , with related health care spending projected to be as much as $ 956.9 billion , according to researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine .
Their results are published in the July 2008 online issue of Obesity .
“ National survey data show that the prevalence of overweight and obese adults in the U.S. has increased steadily over the past three decades , ” said Youfa Wang , MD , PhD , lead author of the study and associate professor with the Bloomberg School ’s Center for Human Nutrition .
“ If these trends continue , more than 86 percent of adults will be overweight or obese by 2030 with approximately 96 percent of non-Hispanic black women and 91 percent of Mexican - American men affected .
This would result in 1 of every 6 health care dollars spent in total direct health care costs paying for overweight and obesity - related costs . ”
The researchers conducted projection analyses based on data collected over the past three decades from nationally representative surveys .
Their projections illustrate the potential burden of the U.S. obesity epidemic if current trends continue .
“ Our analysis also shows that over time heavy Americans become heavier , ” says May A. Beydoun , a former postdoctoral research fellow at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
“ The health care costs attributable to obesity and overweight are expected to more than double every decade .
This would account for 15 to 17 percent of total health care costs spent , ” Wang says .
“ Due to the assumptions we made and the limitations of the available data , these figures are likely an underestimation of the true financial impact . ”
Current standards define adults with a body mass index ( BMI ) between 25 and 29.9 as overweight and adults with a BMI of 30 or higher as obese .
Both the overweight and obese are at an increased risk for developing a number of health conditions , including hypertension , type 2 diabetes , heart disease and stroke .
Researchers estimate that children and young adults may have a shorter life expectancy than their parents if the obesity epidemic is left unaddressed .
The authors warned that obesity has become a public health crisis in the U.S. Timely , dramatic and effective development and implementation of corrective programs and policies are needed to avoid the otherwise inevitable health and societal consequences implied by their projections .
If current trends continue , the researchers say that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will not meet its Healthy People 2010 initiative to increase the proportion of adults who are at a healthy weight and to reduce the proportion of adults who are obese .
No , it wo n't happen .
Even the people who are working on ways to make DNA perform calculations cannot see it happening .
Take Professor Andrew Ellington at the University of Texas at Austin , who said : " I think my general opinion about DNA computing is not ' no ' but ' Hell , no ' . "
So , how come some people believe that the future of computing lies in the molecule that provides the blueprint for how living creatures are made ?
It started in the 1990s when Leonard Adleman , of the University of Southern California , came up with a way to use DNA to solve one of computing 's most difficult and complex tasks : the travelling salesman problem .
This tries to find the most efficient way to visit a set of cities so that you pass through each one as few times as possible - ideally , only once .
Adleman worked out that the paths between cities could be coded into DNA .
If a path between two cities matched , those DNA strands would stick to each other .
Eventually , lots of strands would match up to produce a list of cities in DNA , packed into a classic double helix .
Just shaking up a test tube full of those different DNA strands did the job .
It was the ultimate parallel processor .
The idea of the DNA computer got another boost in the last month when Japanese scientists succeeded in making a type of DNA out of molecules not found in nature .
People pointed to the fact that you could pack thousands of exabytes into the volume of a drop of water with regular DNA .
Artificial DNA could , potentially , store even more .
Making all that DNA is another matter , however .
In a silicon - based computer , the transistors that do the calculations are re-usable .
You just load up another program and feed it to them .
With a DNA computer , you have to make a complete new set of DNA strands each time .
It 's a new computer every time you want to calculate something .
And making artificial DNA is not at all cheap .
It gets worse .
DNA computing only looks fast because things can happen in parallel .
But the reactions themselves are very slow , and the process only works if you can tolerate errors , said Ellington .
Not only that , it 's hard to work out what the answer was : there is no easy way to wire up DNA to the other parts of a regular computer .
That does not mean there are no ways to use DNA in calculations .
Instead of trying to recreate computers , researchers aim to use DNA in simple biological machines : in principle , they could use DNA logic to administer drugs only to specific cells .
" DNA computers can manipulate matter : chemistry is their world , " said Zack Booth Simpson , a software engineer and molecular biology researcher at the University of Texas .
But when it comes to manipulating digits , silicon is likely to keep its edge into the foreseeable future .

The House Judiciary Committee today , Friday , July 25th , will put impeachment squarely back " on the table " and restored to its prominent place in our Constitution .
Elliott Adams , President of Veterans for Peace , and a descendant of American revolutionary Sam Adams , will deliver this prepared testimony , in which , if his 5 minutes allow him to reach his conclusion , he will say :
" For us veterans , when our time came , we volunteered our very lives for this republic ; for the principle of freedom for all , for equal opportunity for all , to defend the Constitution and the principles embodied in the Declaration of Independence , and to guarantee the opportunity for life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
Now , Congressmen , it is your time , and I hear there is not enough time !
Now is your time , and I hear it will not be good for one party or the other party !
Now is your time , and I hear there is not enough political will around you !
When our founding fathers signed the Declaration of Independence they were not worried about political will , or how much time there was , or about any parties ' political future , they were just worried they were going to be hanged by the neck .
But they did what was right .
Now it is your time to standup .
Einstein said – ' The world is a dangerous place , not because of those who do evil , but because of those who look on and do nothing . ' "
Bruce Fein , Associate Deputy Attorney General , 1981 - 82 , and Chairman of the American Freedom Agenda , will deliver this prepared testimony , which begins thus :
" If President George W. Bush had knocked to enter the constitutional convention in Philadelphia in 1787 , presiding convention president George Washington would have denied him admission .
Thereby hangs an alarming tale .
The executive branch has vandalized the Constitution every bit as much [ sic ] the barbarians vandalized Rome in 410 AD .
The executive branch has destroyed the Constitution 's time - honored checks and balances and raced the nation perilously close to executive despotism .
The executive branch rejects the basic philosophical tenets of the United States .
It does not accept that America was conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that sovereignty in a republican form of government lies with the people ; that there are no vassals or serfs in the Constitution 's landscape ; that every man or woman is a king or queen but no one wears a crown ; and , that the rule of law is the nation 's civic religion .
The Founding Fathers fashioned impeachment as a remedy for attacks against the constitutional order . "
The first panel Friday morning will include Congressman Dennis Kucinich making a case for impeachment based on the articles of impeachment he has drafted against Cheney and Bush .
Also on the first panel will be Republican Congressman Walter Jones who has sought to end the funding of the occupation of Iraq , and who has expressed support for former prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi 's proposal to prosecute former President George W. Bush , once out of office , for murder .
Congressman Maurice Hinchey , a supporter of impeachment , is also on the panel .
The last witness is Congressman Brad Miller , but as the saying goes , " Three out of four ai n't bad . "
And we 've been mercifully spared Congresswoman Jane Harman , who at one point was scheduled to testify .
The second of two planned panels is even better , and includes Adams , Fein , Bugliosi , and six other witnesses .
One of them , Elizabeth Holtzman , Former Representative from New York , will speak very persuasively for impeachment .
Ross C. “ Rocky ” Anderson , Founder and President , High Roads for Human Rights , and the former Mayor of Salt Lake City , is likely to speak in support of impeachment too , while also supporting other alleged remedies .
One chronicler of Bush and Cheney crimes who in recent months has opposed impeachment is John Dean ; he had been scheduled to appear but did not make the final cut .
However , there are four witnesses on the second panel who may not help the cause of impeachment .
Frederick A. O. Schwarz , Jr. , Senior Counsel , Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law , is a supporter of restoring the rule of law , but whether he 'll advocate restoration of the rule of the Constitution we shall see .
The other three almost certainly will not .
They are : Bob Barr , Former Representative from Georgia , 2008 Libertarian Nominee for President ; Stephen Presser , Raoul Berger Professor of Legal History , Northwestern University School of Law ; and Jeremy A. Rabkin , Professor of Law , George Mason University School of Law .
The big unknown is which members of the House Judiciary Committee , which has 40 members , will show up for a Friday hearing .
A number of Republicans have already left town , and some of the most pro-impeachment Democrats have committed to being present .
Watch Robert Wexler , Tammy Baldwin , and Sheila Jackson - Lee for the most likely statements in support of beginning a true impeachment hearing .
Some of the witnesses in the past couple of days had expressed frustration with congressional rules forbidding accusations against the president , rules deriving from prohibitions on speaking ill of the king of England .
But witnesses have been able to work around those rules by referring to " the executive branch " and other similar locutions rather than " the president " or " the vice president . "
While Chairman John Conyers almost certainly has every intention of preventing the commencement of a real impeachment hearing , he and his staff appear to have opened this one up significantly to the obvious and overdocumented case for impeachment .
Our hope lies in the likelihood that Conyers ' calculation is wrong when he supposes that Democrats will benefit from publicizing the case for impeachment and not suffer for failing to pursue it .
If the public makes clear its demand for action , not just talk , the door that is cracking open may be very difficult to shut .
" Stop the preaching and start impeaching " is a cheer that may be heard at a gathering of impeachment activists outside the Rayburn Building immediately following the hearing .
The day before the hearing , some of those impeachment advocates gathered at the National Press Club , including myself , Ray McGovern , Bruce Fein , Cindy Sheehan , Cynthia Papermaster , and Crystal Kim .
Videos of what they had to say , and their questions and answers with the media , are posted at http://youtube.com/afterdowningstreet
Nudist war on the German - Polish border !
The Usedom beach on the German - Polish border has become the unlikely place for a fresh battle between the countries - a nudist war !
On the one side white bottoms burn in the sun .
On the other side conservative swimming trunk - wearers turn up their noses at the naked beachgoers .
Now a heated argument has broken out between the exhibitionist Germans and the prudish Poles .
For the last fifty years sun-loving Germans have been preserving their naturist traditions from Ahlbeck ( Mecklenburg - Vorpommern ) to Swinemünde .
But following the Schengen agreement in December 2007 the fence separating the German and Polish parts of the beach was removed .
Now German nudists are battling the Poles for their freedom to prance around naked in the sun .
" It 's ridiculous " said Swinemündes minister Edward Zajac .
And Anja ( 28 ) from Poland , who clearly think the German nudists are real swines , said : " It 's horrible .
We would never bathe naked - we are Catholic . "
But the happy - go - naked Germans are not amused .
Elke Bernholz ( 44 ) said : " It 's a nudist beach .
It 's terrible , that the Poles come over dressed and stare . "
Ines Müller ( 46 ) is also shocked by the Polish behaviour : " You feel like an ape in a zoo .
The Poles come with their binoculars , stare and swear . "
The priest in Swinemünde , who called the nudists ' sinners ' , did however call for calm .
Kazimierz Sajadeusz ( 68 ) said : " From a Catholic point of view the nudists are sinners .
But in Germany the people are brought up freer .
I understand , that they go bathing naked .
My fellow people are sometimes a little bit sensitive . "
Authorities are hoping to stop the war by putting up signs in both languages to divide the beach into a nudist area and a clothed bathing area again .
Whether the two sides will accept a ceasefire , remains to be seen .

FCC proposes free Internet ... as long as it's censored Reuters
Published : Thursday May 29 , 2008
|
Print This Email This By Peter Kaplan WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. communications regulators are considering auctioning a piece of the airwaves to buyers willing to provide free broadband Internet service without pornography .
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin is proposing to auction an unused piece of 25 megahertz wireless spectrum , with the condition that the winning bidder offer free Internet access and filter out obscene content on part of those airwaves , a spokesman for the FCC said on Thursday .
" We 're hoping there will be increased interest in the proposal ; and because this will provide wireless broadband services to more Americans , it is certainly something we want to see , " said FCC spokesman Rob Kenny .
Under Martin 's proposal , the winner would be allowed to use the rest of the airwaves for commercial services .
The plan would address criticism from some consumer advocates , who say the government has not done enough to get broadband service into more households .
It also could win praise from anti-obscenity watchdog groups .
" I think there are a number of features of the plan that would be attractive to various constituencies , " said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Blair Levin .
But the plan got a lukewarm response from existing wireless carriers .
The industry 's chief trade group , called CTIA , said auction provisions such as the free - service requirement were too rigid .
" CTIA supports flexible auction rules that allow any and all entities to participate , " the group said in a statement .
The winning bidder also would have to build out the system to serve 50 percent of the U.S. population within four years and 95 percent within 10 years .
Further details of the plan have yet to be worked out , but Martin 's plan is expected to come up at the FCC 's next meeting on June 12 .
Martin 's proposal is similar to a plan put forth previously by a start - up company called M2Z .
Under that plan , which was not approved by the FCC , M2Z would have been given the spectrum at no up - front cost .
It would have provided free service , generating revenue partly through advertising .
The 25 MHz spectrum at issue is not viewed as highly attractive to wireless carriers , unlike the 700 MHz spectrum auctioned by the FCC earlier this year .
There has been little previous interest in it , aside from the M2Z proposal .

The number of Mexican - born immigrants who became U.S. citizens swelled by nearly 50 % last year amid a massive campaign by Spanish - language media and immigrant advocacy groups to help eligible residents apply for citizenship , according to a government report released Thursday .
Despite Mexicans ’ historically low rates of naturalization , 122,000 attained citizenship in 2007 , up from 84,000 the previous year , with California and Texas posting the largest gains .
Salvadorans and Guatemalans also showed significant increases at a time when the overall number of naturalizations declined by 6 % .
At the same time , the number of citizenship applications filed doubled to 1.4 million last year , the report by the U.S. Office of Immigration Statistics found .
The surge in naturalization of Mexicans , their largest year - to - year increase this decade , came amid pitched national debate over immigration reform .
The report cited the campaign by Spanish - language media and community groups , along with a desire to apply before steep fee increases took effect , as two major reasons for the jump in naturalizations .

“ Immigrants are tired of the tone and tenor of the immigration debate , which they feel is humiliating and does not recognize their contributions , ” said Rosalind Gold of the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials ’ Educational Fund in Los Angeles .
“ That climate has fueled their desire to have their voices heard . ”
New citizens interviewed Thursday echoed those sentiments .
Erika Lorena Rivera , 30 , came to Los Angeles from Mexico at age 1 , became eligible for naturalization a decade ago but decided to take the plunge -- along with four relatives -- just last October .
Rivera , a supervisor for a Los Angeles hair accessory firm , said she was offended by what she perceived as growing anti-immigrant bias and was moved to apply for citizenship after seeing ads about it on TV .
“ I became a citizen to have full rights and vote for a president for the first time , ” said Rivera , adding that she and her family plan to vote for Democratic candidate Barack Obama .
The increase in Latinos with the power to vote could affect the political landscape in November , analysts said .
Louis DiSipio , a UC Irvine political science professor , said one of the biggest impacts could be in Florida , a key battleground state that posted 54,500 new citizens last year .
Although the ethnic Cuban population there has dominated the Latino political landscape and tended to vote Republican , he said , more of the newer immigrants are coming from South America and trending Democratic .
For the first time this decade , more Latinos were registered as Democrats than Republicans , 35 % to 33 % as of this spring , according to Gold .

Beyond November , the swelling Latino numbers nationwide will continue to recast the political landscape for local elections , DiSipio said .
He said that growing Latino naturalizations in the late 1990s , thanks to a 1986 amnesty for illegal immigrants , helped California Democrats gain an 800,000 - plus voter edge and that similar gains could occur with the newest increase .
Gold said that new Latino citizens have higher voting rates than longtime Mexican Americans and that their political allegiances are shallower .
As a result , she said , their votes are still up for grabs for those elected officials willing to work hard to reach them .
In addition , she said , the proportion of Latino voters identifying themselves as independents is growing .
Erica L. Bernal - Martinez , senior director of civic engagement for the association of Latino officials , said grass - roots organizations planned to continue their push to encourage naturalizations among the estimated 4 million to 5 million eligible Latinos .
Mexicans have historically had low rates of naturalization -- 35 % compared with 59 % for all immigrants -- but that appears to be changing as media and community organizations pour unprecedented resources and energy into their civic engagement campaigns , Bernal - Martinez and Gold said .
More than 400 community organizations across the country , along with major Spanish - language media , have joined forces in a “ Ya Es Hora ” ( It ’s Time ) campaign to help eligible voters become citizens and register to vote .
The campaign plans to hold naturalization workshops in 10 cities Saturday .

“ We think with this type of promotion and outreach , we can really rewrite this story of Latino naturalizations , ” Gold said .
However , steep fee increases last July sharply reduced the overall monthly number of new applicants from August to December .
Applications peaked at 457,000 in July , then plummeted to a monthly average of about 30,000 after the application fee increased to $ 675 from $ 400 .
The new report found that California posted the largest gains in new citizens in 2007 , from 153,000 the year before to 182,000 ; followed by Texas , from 38,000 to 53,000 ; and Illinois , from 30,000 to 39,000 .
After Mexico , the largest number of new citizens came from India , the Philippines , China , Vietnam , the Dominican Republic , South Korea and El Salvador .

The overall decrease in the number of naturalizations last year occurred after special congressional funding to process the backlog of citizenship applications ran out .
But applications continued to soar in the Latino community because of the targeted citizenship campaigns , experts said .
Jorge - Mario Cabrera , an El Salvador native and Long Beach community activist , finally naturalized last year with his mother ; he had been eligible since 1992 .
He said he had not become a citizen sooner because he was n’t sure why it would matter and he still clung to his allegiances to his native land .
That changed a few years ago when the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would have criminalized illegal immigrants and those who aided them .
Millions of immigrants and supporters poured into the streets to protest , and community organizations mobilized to urge people like Cabrera to naturalize , register to vote and make their voices heard .
Cabrera , 39 , and his 73 - year - old mother took the plunge .

“ We felt there were millions of voices left unheard every year , so we decided our two votes were needed to make a difference , ” he said .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Couch potatoes love television , but some simply have no interest in watching sports or kids shows .
So why should they pay for it ?

More U.S. TV watchers are asking the same question as cable and satellite TV bills creep higher .
The government wants to know why consumers ca n’t just pay for the channels they want and many technology and media companies are dreaming up new alternatives for delivering only the TV programs viewers want .
A fresh batch of options from Sony Corp 6758.T and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O , Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Roku , as well as Microsoft Corp 's MSFT.
O video game console Xbox 360 launched over the past few weeks promise to do away with cable all together .
The latest push into the living room aims to solve what has stymied earlier products , including the complexity of hooking up these devices , lack of content and relatively high prices , with some devices costing well past $ 500 .
About 8 million Netflix customers , accustomed to renting DVDs by mail , can now purchase a $ 99 set top box from Roku and watch some 12,000 films and shows on television for no additional fees .
Sony Bravia TV owners who buy a $ 300 device that connects to the back of TVs and to the Internet can already watch YouTube videos .
Soon , Bravia customers will be able to order from Amazon movies and shows streamed directly to TVs .
But even the experts do n't think cable will be replaced anytime soon and point to a string of high profile failures , including Walt Disney Co-backed DIS.N MovieBeam and privately held Akimbo .
“ The content deals are starting to come together , but the library is still pretty narrow , ” said Mark Kirstein of Scottsdale , Arizona - based market research firm MultiMedia Intelligence .
A general aversion to yet another gadget in the living room and the high prices are other reasons why the idea has failed to catch on .
Premium channels such as Time Warner Inc's TWX.N popular HBO are also unavailable on the Internet to non-subscribers , except through iTunes , where some programs are sold .
But that has not stopped the tech industry from buzzing again after a number of new products that address some of these issues were unveiled in quick succession .
UBIQUITY , SIMPLICITY
A new set - top box born out of a partnership between DVD rental business Netflix Inc and device maker Roku , in which Netflix owns a minority stake , is emerging as a leading candidate for consumer appeal , Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said .
“ Despite its relatively meager content , the Netflix Player by Roku is a solid winner , overcoming the barriers that hamper the rest , ” McQuivey said .
Unlike others that came before it , Roku is counting on offering services beyond Netflix , said Tim Twerdahl , vice president of consumer products at Roku .
“ Our vision is to open up the box , ” he said .
Prepare to find free , advertising - supported video services , pay - per- view services and YouTube - like user generated videos .
Netflix is also planning to let current subscribers find its movies online in as many ways as possible .
It struck a deal with Microsoft to allow subscribers to the video game console Xbox 360 ’s online service to also watch streamed Netflix movies .
Earlier , Netflix said it would offer its Internet service on an LG Electronics Inc 066570 .
KS - manufactured set - top box .
“ It ’s too early to tell who is going to prevail , ” Netflix spokesman Steve Swasey said .
Tech industry watchers say the current crop represent the first wave of products that have shown any real promise .
Importantly , many are backed by financiers with deep pockets .
But will it matter ?
Apple Inc's AAPL.O AppleTV has yet to light up the industry the way its iPod and iTunes service transformed the music business , critics point out .
Then there ’s Hollywood , which has been reluctant to offer more new releases on the Internet for fear of jeopardizing DVD sales that account for more than half its profits .
“ They ’re going to fight amongst each other for a teeny - tiny part of the market , ” McQuivey said .
“ If you have cable service and a DVD player , you already have a much better solution than any of these boxes can provide you . ”
Sony is tackling the problem in yet another way by appealing to its own movie studio to release its films ahead of the DVD release .
It plans to offer Sony Pictures ’s “ Hancock ” later this year for Bravia TV owners .
For now , “ this is a Sony initiative .
It ’s something that can be realized with other studios , ” said Sony Electronics ’s senior manager of business development Robert Jacobs .

So busy that you wish you had another hand ?
The people at Spot Industries have taken this concept quite literally with an articulated robotic human - like hand and forearm assembly appropriately named " Handy " .
The heavy industrial giant 's first foray into the consumer market was actually precipitated by a proprietary battery technology and the availability of high strength , cheap to produce and 100 % recyclable polymers that could actually bring concepts such as Handy into the reach of a much broader consumer market .
Spot Industries spokesperson So Soon Dun states " Handy could be useful for any number of domestic tasks such as washing , hammering , painting , digging , kneading , the only limit is your imagination . "
He went on to mention that " Handy has a very , very firm but soft grip and its ability to oscillate up and down at select speeds is quite satisfying . "
The first model of the Handy is being planned for initial release into the marketplace sometime in the next two years .
The Handy is very lightweight at less than 7 Kg . It can be folded down to fit in a typical briefcase .
So Soon Dun tells us that the first version will be the " tabletop model " which could easily fit on any side table , desk or workbench .
Future editions may come with freestanding legs , wheels or possibly even a harness to allow for greater user mobility and ease of use .
Handy will come with USB and midi ports and be wireless capable for use with ipods , keyboards and computers .
Handy 's fuzzy AI logic will allow it to learn its owners preferences very efficiently .
So Soon Dun reminds us that whether a robotic device builds cars or waters your plants - the job should be done right .
We concur , hands free never had it so good .

Kenny Hotz of Kenny vs. Spenny pisses people off like it ’s his job .
Well , actually , it is his job .
He ’s seen downtown scantily clad more often than not .
He ’s known to hit on much , much older women .
He ’s fed his best friend acid while he had an octopus on his head .
And yesterday he went for the biggest - hitting blow in the books , advertising his asshole ways to the masses ―with mile - high blasphemy in the sky .
Yesterday around noon , Kenny hired a plane and flew a banner across the Toronto harbour , with a simple but potent two - word message ―” JESUS SUCKS . ”
As the Post reported yesterday , Kenny pulled his signature sneaky tricks with the plane company to get his message out , using the common Spanish name Jesús as the cover .
His cover never blew , but his message surely did ( at least in the wind ) ―and it might the blow the tops off a few religious groups .
But that ’s the point , after all .
This week ’s episode from season five of a show that ’s about as addictive as five - cent candy is entitled , appropriately , “ Who Can Piss Off the Most People ? ”
Oh , and for the record , Kenny does n’t actually think Jesus sucks .
He ’s just doing his job .

On an unseasonably warm June day in Santiago , nearly 1,500 Chileans gathered behind the presidential palace to pay homage to Salvador Allende on the centennial of his birth .
The police had erected a fence - like barrier to separate the assembled politicians and dignitaries — all dressed in elegant suits and ties or stylish winter dresses with colorful shawls wrapped around their shoulders — from the public , which was composed primarily of scruffy students , aging revolutionaries , blue - collar workers , reporters , and a few stray businesspeople out on their lunch break .
Every five minutes or so , a portly man wearing a hard hat raised a bullhorn to his mouth and yelled , “ Comrade Salvador Allende ! ”
Immediately the crowd answered , “ Present ! ”
“ Now ! ” he yelled back .
“ And forever ! ” came the response .
As the politicians greeted each other and sat down in padded folding chairs , a young man in a red hooded sweatshirt rushed the barrier and screamed , “ You ’re an embarrassment to all of Chile !
Salvador Allende would never recognize any of you sons of bitches !
He ’d be over here with us , with the people !
Shame on all of you ! ”
A policeman sprinted over and whispered a few words into the young man ’s ear .
The young man nodded , stepped back from the barrier , and then raised both middle fingers above his head .
The crowd cheered and chanted , “ Viva Chile ! Viva Allende ! ”
With his tailor - made suits and thick black glasses , Salvador Allende did not look the part of a revolutionary .
Indeed , his love of high - end clothing and fine wine would seem to belie his status as a champion of the working class .
It is widely reported that at dinner parties in the Chilean presidential palace , Allende would approach nattily attired guests and say , half in jest , “ That ’s a nice jacket you ’re wearing , but it would look even better on a president , do n’t you think ? ”
By night ’s end , the guests would have dutifully contributed their jackets to Allende ’s already extensive wardrobe .
But make no mistake about it : even though he was not as earthy or tousled as his contemporaries in Cuba , Allende was every bit as dedicated to revolutionary change .
He simply disagreed with the means through which such change could come about .
Instead of adhering to then ruling leftist practice of revolutionary change through violence and terror , Allende proposed an unprecedented democratic route to socialism , one where ballots would replace arms .
It would be , in his words , “ a revolution of empanadas and red wine ” — socialism Chilean style .
This route took time to catch on with the voters : Allende lost three consecutive presidential elections as the candidate for the Socialist Party .
But by the time the 1970 presidential election rolled around , Allende had forged a strategic alliance with disparate parties on the center and the left , including the Communist Party , and this time ran as a candidate of the newly created Popular Unity coalition .
In an almost evenly divided election , Allende narrowly defeated the candidates from the Right and the Center , garnering only 36 percent of the vote .
Thus , during the heart of the Cold War era and in a polarized country , Salvador Allende came to power as a minority president determined to carry through with his experiment of mixing revolutionary socialism with a pluralistic democratic system .
It was an experiment that never came to completion .
The three years that Allende presided over Chile saw the nationalization of many large industries , agrarian reform , and the strengthening of unions and workers ’ rights ; but it also saw skyrocketing inflation , commodity scarcities , and almost weekly street demonstrations for and against the administration .
Chilean society had seemingly splintered in two , and amid threats of violence , many wondered if a civil war was imminent .
On September 11 , 1973 , with the tacit approval of several centrist and right - wing parties , not to mention the covert support of the United States , Augusto Pinochet , the Commander - in - Chief of the Army , bombarded the Chilean presidential palace .
Instead of surrendering , Allende went on the radio and declared that he was going to die for his ideals with the confidence that “ sooner or later , the great avenues will again be opened , through which free men will pass to construct a better society . ”
Shortly thereafter , he shot himself with a gun given to him as a present by Fidel Castro .
Next to the corpse were Allende ’s trademark black glasses , the frames split and the lenses shattered .
During his life , these deceptively benign glasses had masked a resolute and audacious politician ; and now , thirty - five years after his death , they have come to symbolize the hope and disappointment of Allende ’s political project .
Posted on nearly every streetlamp around Santiago were fliers showing an image of intact black glasses against a white background with the headline , “ One Hundred Years , One Thousand Dreams . ”
At the centennial ceremony , a life - size sculpture of a broken frame , its lens cracked and smudged gray with smoke , was situated next to the main stage , an uneasy reminder of death during a celebration of birth .
But it was , after all , Allende ’s martyred suicide , along with his alluring and somewhat unstable blend of idealism and pragmatism , revolution and democracy , that has rendered him a near mystical figure , one that can represent many different things to many different people , thus sparking inevitable battles over who the “ real Allende ” was , what he represented , what sort of legacy he left behind , and which political parties have remained true to his supposed ideals .
These battles , of course , may never be resolved .
Guillermo Teillier , the stern - looking and balding president of the Chilean Communist Party , was called on to give the opening speech of the centennial ceremony .
“ Friends and comrades , ” he bellowed into the microphone , “ I want to say to all of you here today that the Communist Party was and continues to be loyal to Salvador Allende ! ”
The crowd burst into applause while Teillier paused to savor the moment .
He proceeded by thanking the Allende family , and then , in an apparent reference to the Socialist Party , he asserted that “ the Communist Party would never install in Chile a system that was contrary to Salvador Allende ’s wishes .
Salvador Allende was a democrat .
But I want to emphasize that while Salvador Allende had democratic principles , he also had a socialist ideology .
And the Communist Party has forgotten neither of these two ideals ! ”
Teillier ’s speech was applauded politely by the dignitaries and cheered raucously by the public .
In contrast , when Camilo Escalona , the president of the Chilean Socialist Party , was called to the podium , the crowd greeted him with a smattering of boos and chants of “ Traitor ! ”
Two young men with dollar signs etched onto their foreheads with blue marker circulated among the audience with signs that read : “ The Socialists Of Today Are The Millionaires Of Tomorrow ” and “ The Government Has Fucked Us ! There ’s No Salvador ! ”
Escalona started his speech in a low and serious voice , but as the jeers grew he was forced to scream into the microphone .
The louder his voice became , the more the crowd taunted him with boos , whistles , and curses .
“ Allende was the greatest of all Socialists and he remains in our hearts ! ” he shrieked , his voice cracking under the strain .
“ Only yesterday , Socialists were tortured because they defended the memory of Allende !
Only yesterday , Socialists were fired from their jobs because they defended the legacy of Allende !
But today , with our proud history and with inspiration from Allende , we have reconstructed what was destroyed by the dictatorship , our great democracy ! ”
Half of the crowd yelled “ Bravo ! ” while the other half hurled profanities at Escalona , calling him everything from a mafia boss to a puppet of imperialism .
Several protesters turned their back to the stage , while others waved their hands and chanted “ Goodbye ! ”
An intense young woman with long black hair and rings on each of her fingers cupped her hands to her mouth and screamed , “ You do n’t represent the people !
We ca n’t even afford bread and you eat like a fucking king !
Have you seen the price of bread ?
Of course you have n’t !
You just have your servants go out and buy it for you , do n’t you ? ”
“ I ca n’t believe how expensive bread is , ” a nearby elderly woman said .
“ It ’s ridiculous , ” another chimed in .
“ The people have no bread and all you do is give speeches ! ” the young woman continued .
“ For shame !
I hope that you ’re disappeared some day so that you learn your lesson ! ”
Around her , the crowd fell into an uneasy silence .
Some of the older people gasped , while a few high school students let out tentative snickers .
“ No , no , no , ” said a broad - shouldered man , wagging his finger .
“ Not like that , not like that . ”
The following day , during a celebration for Salvador Allende at the headquarters for the Unitary Federation of Workers ( or CUT ) , one of the most influential labor confederations during Allende ’s presidency , a retired postal worker named Jaime told me : “ Following the coup , I was dragged from my home and taken to the National Stadium , like so many revolutionaries .
And I was tortured there .
I certainly was . ”
He paused and glanced at the other surviving revolutionaries , who were munching on fried sopaipillas and sipping steamed red wine .
“ They did n’t kill me .
I do n’t know why .
But when I was released , I could n’t work for almost twenty years .
I was n’t banned .
It ’s just . . .
Well , I ’ve been told it was post - traumatic stress syndrome .
Who knows ? ”
Many members of Allende ’s Popular Unity coalition suffered similar fates during Pinochet ’s seventeen - year dictatorship .
Roughly 3,000
Chileans were killed by state violence , many of whom were permanently “ disappeared ” — whisked away clandestinely and never to be seen again , their remains dumped in the Pacific Ocean or incinerated in clay ovens .
Thousands more were tortured or forcibly exiled .
Moreover , just as Allende had transformed Chile into a laboratory for revolutionary democracy , Pinochet set up a laboratory of his own , aided by American neoclassical economists , experimenting with radical free - market economic reforms .
He privatized many state - run industries , outlawed trade unions , and drastically reduced the social welfare role of the state .
This new neoliberal program was , in many ways , the exact opposite of Salvador Allende ’s democratic route to socialism .
In 1980 , Pinochet drafted a new Constitution that extended his presidency until 1988 , during which time he would call a plebiscite to determine whether his regime would continue in power for eight more years .
The year before the plebiscite , which permitted only a Si or No vote on Pinochet as the sole candidate , political parties from the left and center rallied together and ultimately defeated the regime at the ballot box .
With Pinochet agreeing to step down , declaring that he had sufficiently “ saved ” the nation from Marxism , many of these centrist and leftist parties , including the Socialist Party but not the Communist Party , united to form the Concertación coalition , which would win all four subsequent post - dictatorial presidential elections .
While the Concertación has promised sweeping changes , they ’ve had their hands tied by many of the undemocratic measures of Pinochet ’s Constitution .
Twenty percent of the Senate consisted of unelected , Pinochet - appointed representatives , while the judiciary was stuffed with appointees from the Pinochet administration .
And until his 1998 arrest in London for international human rights violations , Pinochet himself remained an influential political player , first as the head of the Chilean Army and then as a self - appointed “ senator for life . ”
Moreover , the binomial electoral system more or less guaranteed that the two largest coalitions — the Concertación and the right - wing Alianza — would split each district ’s two elective seats , thus thwarting the Communist Party and other leftist groups from gaining legislative representation .
This system ensured that Chile ’s reestablished democracy would be characterized by endless compromise , limited citizen participation , and closed - door negotiations between party elites .
Pinochet has been dead for over a year .
His apologists have dwindled , his legacy has been tarnished .
Allende ’s stature , however , has risen over the years , with each successive Concertación government making a point to pay homage to him .
But it is not Allende ’s legacy that defines contemporary Chile .
It is Pinochet ’s .
His 1980 Constitution , even with recent reformations , continues to neuter the Left and give undue legislative weight to the Right ; his neoliberal economic model is considered practically irreversible .
His fingerprints remain all over the country .
Allende , then , may have won the symbolic battle , his image , to many , having become synonymous with social justice and economic equality .
But it is the disgraced and disowned Pinochet who is winning the war .
On the night of Allende ’s centennial , there was a private event at the art museum in the basement of the presidential palace , where Michelle Bachelet , a Socialist and the first female president in Chile ’s history , was slated to inaugurate an exhibition dedicated to Salvador Allende .
Senators , artists , reporters , and ambassadors filed into a large auditorium that nonetheless filled quickly .
With no chairs , the crowd stood uncomfortably shoulder - to - shoulder , unable to move about the space .
The event was scheduled to begin at 7:30 , but the president did n’t arrive until 8:15 .
As she waved to the cheering crowd , a spokesperson stepped to the microphone and said , “ Ladies and gentlemen , the President will now take a private tour of the art galleries .
Please be patient . ”
Miguel , my Chilean roommate , became visibly irritated .
“ This is so typical of Bachelet , ” he muttered .
“ She means well , but she still has n’t learned to read the mood of a crowd . ”
He shook his head .
“ They could at least serve some food . ”
Bachelet ’s ascendance to the presidency brought about renewed hope for many Chileans who had become weary of the Concertación ’s elite - driven governing style .
During past elections , a significant number of Chileans under 30 have abstained from voting , expressing their frustration by simply not participating .
But Bachelet promised to be different from the average politician .
In addition to being a female in the male - dominated political sphere , she was also a separated single mother and religiously agnostic , features that cut against Chile ’s traditionally conservative social values .
Even more striking was her political past .
An active Socialist during Allende ’s administration , Bachelet was briefly imprisoned and tortured during the military dictatorship before being exiled first to Australia and then to East Germany .
Her father was not so fortunate : he died during a torture session in a Santiago prison .
It seemed , then , that if any politician could shake up the Concertación — and reconnect the Socialist Party to its grassroots base — it was Bachelet .
In her introductory speech as president , Bachelet channeled the spirit of Allende by proclaiming that her administration represented “ a step toward a new form of understanding and doing politics — a more inclusive , participatory , open and transparent politics .
A politics for and with the citizens . ”
She has , however , been unable to carry through with this promise .
In May 2006 , tens of thousands of high school students flooded the streets of Santiago to demand reformations to a Pinochet - era educational system that worked against lower - class families who could n’t afford to send their children to private schools .
Bachelet was sluggish in her response , and after several days , protesters and bystanders alike had sensed that her government was n’t sufficiently attuned to the public mood .
This sensation was reinforced months later by the botched implementation of Transantiago , a new transportation system that resulted in longer commutes , crowded buses , and widespread dissatisfaction .
Since then , the hope that greeted Bachelet ’s inauguration has been largely replaced by disillusionment .
As her popularity plunged , Bachelet dropped her calls for a more participatory form of politics , and the Concertación relaxed back into its elite - driven governing style .
The protests , meanwhile , have continued — in July 2008 , for example , a 14 - year - old student defiantly dumped a pitcher of ice water on the Minister of Education — and perhaps nowhere were they as pointed as during the centennial ceremonies for Allende .
During these ceremonies , several members of the Concertación took great pains to emphasize their coalition ’s continuity with Allende ’s administration .
“ If he were alive today , Salvador Allende would be a militant socialist and the [ Socialist ] party ’s principal figure , ” Escalona remarked .
Teillier , the Communist Party president , disagreed : “ If he were alive today , Salvador Allende would n’t find anything at all to like about contemporary Chile . ”
Numerous posters echoed Teillier ’s sentiment by listing aspects of the Concertación that Allende would supposedly reject : “ Salvador Allende Would Say No To Exclusionary Education ! ” and “ Socialist - Capitalist : What Would Allende Say ? ”
A university student held up a drawing that showed Allende rapping a downcast Bachelet over the head with a ruler .
Above all , the protesters were asserting that the Concertación has squandered the privilege of laying claim to Allende ’s legacy .
As such , these ceremonies were less about traditional struggles between pro-Allende and pro-Pinochet sectors , and more about new struggles between leftist forces in Chile .
In the twenty years since the Concertación has been in power , the Left in Latin America as a whole has undergone major changes .
Revolutionary presidents such as Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia have resurrected Allende ’s strategy of achieving socialism through democratic means .
They rode to power largely by galvanizing the impoverished masses that had become frustrated with neoliberalism ’s failure to improve their lives .
Chile , however , has resisted this trend , sticking with its more moderate centrist policies .
But perhaps these new struggles over Allende portend changes in the coming years .
With Bachelet ’s inability to amend the Concertación ’s elitist practices , many Chileans remain disenchanted with the state of their political system .
Any combination of rising inflation , an economic slowdown , unfulfilled social demands , or an electoral victory for the Right could lead to the increased mobilization of popular forces , the splintering of the Concertación , and the regeneration of leftist groups .
Already leftist groups are preparing themselves for this possibility by attempting to wrest away from the Concertación one of Chile ’s most persistently relevant and resonant symbols : that of Salvador Allende .
At the end of the centennial ceremony for Allende , two high school students strolled past the crowd still gathered outside the presidential palace .
“ What ’s going on here ? ” one of them asked , looking at the signs and images of the slain president .
“ It looks like they ’re doing something for Salvador Allende . ”
“ It ’s probably the anniversary of his death . ”
“ Again ? ”
“ I know .
They do something like this every year . ”
“ I mean , he ’s dead already , people .
Get over it ! ”
They gazed at the crowd not with curiosity or disgust , but seemingly with pity , shaking their heads at the people who had lathered up such strong emotions for an individual who had presided over their country two full generations before they ’d been born .
“ Let ’s go get something to eat , ” one of them finally said .

WASHINGTON  On May 17 , 2005 , the White House ’s political affairs office sent an e-mail message to agencies throughout the executive branch directing them to find jobs for 108 people on a list of “ priority candidates ” who had “ loyally served the president . ”
“ We simply want to place as many of our Bush loyalists as possible , ” the White House emphasized in a follow - up message , according to a little - noticed passage of a Justice Department report released Monday about politicization in the department ’s hiring of civil - service prosecutors and immigration officials .
The report , the subject of a Senate oversight hearing Wednesday , provided a window into how the administration sought to install politically like - minded officials in positions of government responsibility , and how the efforts at times crossed customary or legal limits .
Andrew Rudalevige , an associate professor of political science at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania who studies presidential power , said that while presidents of both parties over the last half - century had sought ways to impose greater political control over the federal bureaucracy , the Bush administration had gone further than any predecessor .
They may " speak " different languages , but Asian and European honeybees living in the same hive can learn to translate each others ' dances to help one another find food , a new study reveals .
Honeybees produce and store honey and build colonial hives from wax .
The nine species of honeybees found worldwide diverged , in evolutionary terms , about 30 million to 50 million years ago and developed different dance " languages " that they use to tell each other where a tasty flower or choice nesting site is .
" The scouts perform the so - called bee dances inside the nest , " said study leader Shaowu Zhang of The Australian National University .
" The coordinates of distant locations are encoded in the waggle phase of this ballet , with the direction and distance to the food source indicated by the orientation and duration of the dance . "
The duration of the " waggle dances " differs from species to species , even if bees are trying to communicate the same distance information .
" It 's these differences which we can think of as distinct languages , " Zhang said .
Zhang and his team mixed two species of honeybees , Asian ( Apis cerana cerana ) and European ( Apis mellifera ligustica ) , together in a hive , and once they had adjusted to each other , the scientists trained one species to fly to a feeder set at varying distances from the hive .
When European honeybees were trained to find the feeder , Asian honeybees were able to decipher the dances of their European cousins and interpret where the feeder was .
The same was true when the experiment was reversed .
" They can understand and communicate [ with ] each other , " Zhang said .
Whether bilingual bees occur in nature though is uncertain , because " the different species of honeybees do not live together in nature , " Zhang told LiveScience .
" We established an artificially mixed colony for our experiments . "
The team 's findings are detailed online in the journal PLoS ONE .
The study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Vision Science .

Channel 4 misrepresented some of the world 's leading climate scientists in a controversial documentary that claimed global warming was a conspiracy and a fraud , the UK 's media regulator will rule next week .
In a long - awaited judgment following a 15 - month inquiry , Ofcom is expected to censure the network over its treatment of some scientists in the programme , The Great Global Warming Swindle , which sparked outcry from environmentalists .
Complaints about privacy and fairness from the government 's former chief scientist , Sir David King , and the Nobel peace prize - winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will be upheld on almost all counts , the Guardian has learned .
But it is understood that Channel 4 will still claim victory because the ultimate verdict on a separate complaint about accuracy , which contained 131 specific points and ran to 270 pages , will find that it did not breach the regulator 's broadcasting code and did not materially mislead viewers .
The detail of the ruling is expected to criticise Channel 4 over some aspects of the controversial programme , made by the director Martin Durkin , but executives will argue that the key test of whether or not it was right to broadcast the programme has been passed .
One source said both sides would be able to claim victory after a bitter dispute that has raged in newspapers and online since the programme , billed as " a definitive response " to Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth , was first broadcast in March last year .
The programme was criticised by scientists , who claimed it fundamentally misrepresented the evidence about global warming , that it rehashed discredited old arguments and manipulated data and charts to make its case .
The IPCC , King and other scientists including Dr Carl Wunsch , a climate expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , complained to the regulator over the way they were represented .
Ofcom is expected to find in favour of King 's complaint and three out of five of the IPCC's .
One is expected to be thrown out and the fifth will be partially upheld .
In its judgment on King 's complaint , Ofcom will say : " Channel 4 unfairly attributed to the former chief scientist , David King , comments he had not made and criticised him for them and also failed to provide him an opportunity to reply " .
In the programme , the concluding voiceover from the climate change sceptic Fred Singer claimed " the chief scientist of the UK " was " telling people that by the end of the century , the only habitable place on Earth will be the Antarctic and humanity may survive thanks to some breeding couples who moved to the Antarctic ... it would be hilarious if it were n't so sad " .
King has never made such a statement and it is believed Singer confused his views with those of the contrarian scientist James Lovelock .
King did once say that " the last time the Earth had this much C02 , the only place habitable was the Antarctic " .
Addressing the IPCC 's complaint over 21 pages , Ofcom will rule that the programme " made significant allegations ... questioning its credibility and failed to offer it timely and appropriate opportunity to respond " .
But Channel 4 has argued that the organisation had refused to cooperate with the programme - makers .
After the broadcast , Wunsch said the programme was " masquerading as a science documentary when it should be regarded as a political polemic " and was " as close to pure propaganda as anything since world war two " .
He claimed he had been duped into appearing and his comments had been misleadingly edited .
The Ofcom ruling is expected to find that Wunsch was misled about the tone and content of the programme , but that his views were accurately represented within it .
Durkin , who had previously made other controversial documentaries , including Against Nature and the Rise and Fall of GM , vigorously defended the broadcast .
" The death of this theory will be painful and ugly .
But it will die .
Because it is wrong , wrong , wrong , " he wrote .
Channel 4 justified the broadcast by saying it was a useful contribution to a timely debate , arguing that it had a tradition for iconoclastic programming and had also aired programmes supporting the case for man-made climate change .
The producers claimed that after it was broadcast , Channel 4 received a record number of phone calls that were six to one in favour of the arguments made .
The film was subsequently sold to 21 other countries .
A global DVD release went ahead despite protests from scientists .
A Channel 4 spokesman said : " We would n't comment on any Ofcom ruling in advance of its publication . "
Ofcom declined to comment .
http://georgewashington2.blogspot.com/2008/05/strauss-and-neocon-lust-for-terror.html
Leo Strauss is the father of the NeoConservative movement , including many leaders of the current administration .
Indeed , some of the main neocon players were students of Strauss at the University of Chicago , where he taught for many years .
Strauss , born in Germany , was an admirer of Nazi philosophers and of Machiavelli .
Strauss believed that a stable political order required an external threat and that if an external threat did not exist , one should be manufactured .
Specifically , Strauss thought that :
( quote is by one of Strauss ' main biographers ) .
Indeed , Stauss used the analogy of Gulliver 's Travels to show what a Neocon - run society would look like :
" When Lilliput [ the town ] was on fire , Gulliver urinated over the city , including the palace .
In so doing , he saved all of Lilliput from catastrophe , but the Lilliputians were outraged and appalled by such a show of disrespect . "
Moreover , Strauss said :
" Only a great fool would call the new political science diabolic . . .
Nevertheless one may say of it that it fiddles while Rome burns .
It is excused by two facts : it does not know that it fiddles , and it does not know that Rome burns . "
So Strauss seems to have advocated governments letting terrorizing catastrophes happen on one 's own soil to one 's own people -- of " pissing " on one 's own people , to use his Gulliver 's travel analogy .
And he advocates that government 's should pretend that they did not know about such acts of mayhem : to intentionally " not know " that Rome is burning .
He advocates messing with one 's own people in order to save them from some " catastrophe " ( perhaps to justify military efforts to monopolize middle eastern oil to keep it away from an increasingly - powerful China ? ) .
Fast Forward a Couple of Decades
Fast forward to the 1990's . . .
Jimmy Carter 's National Security Advisor seemed to hint at this approach when he wrote in 1997 :
" as America becomes an increasingly multi-cultural society , it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues , except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat . " ( p. 211 )
Similarly , the Project For A New American Century , a think tank lobbying group with Cheney , Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz , Feith and the other leading Neocons in its ranks , lamented that its rapacious military agenda would not be realized " absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event -- like a new Pearl Harbor . "
Do n't believe that these quotes represent anything nefarious yet ?
Fast forward to today . . .
Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said the American people lack " the maturity to recognize the seriousness of the threats . "
What 's to be done ?
According to Rumsfeld , " The correction for that , I suppose , is [ another ] attack . "
Newt Gingrich recently said :
" the better they 've done at making sure there is n't an attack , the easier it is to say , ' Well , there never was going to be an attack anyway . '
And it 's almost like they should every once in a while have allowed an attack to get through just to remind us . "
The head of the Arkansas Republican party said :
" At the end of the day , I believe fully the president is doing the right thing , and I think all we need is some attacks on American soil like we had on [ Sept. 11 , 2001 ] " so people appreciate Bush .
Philadelphia Daily News columnist Stu Bykofsky openly called for " another 9/11 " that " would help America " restore a " community of outrage and national resolve " .
Lt. -Col .
Doug Delaney , chair of the war studies program at the Royal Military College in Kingston , Ontario , told the Toronto Star that " The key to bolstering Western resolve is another terrorist attack like 9/11 or the London transit bombings of two years ago . "
And an allegedly - leaked GOP memo touts a new terror attack as a way to reverse the party 's decline .
It 's All Hot Air , Is n't It ?
But is n't this all talk ?
They would n't really allow terror to happen . . . or aid and abet such attacks .
Would they ?
Well , President Carter recently impliedly acknowledged the risk of staged provocation in order to start a war against Iran .
A former National Security Adviser told the Senate that a terrorist act might be carried out in the U.S. and falsely blamed on Iran to justify war against that nation .
Former Senator Gary Hart warned Americans that the White House might create a " Gulf of Tonkin " or " remember the Maine " type incident to justify war against Iran ( starting at 7:15 minutes )
Current U.S. Congressman Ron Paul stated , the government " is determined to have martial law " , and that the government is hoping to get the people " fearful enough that they will accept the man on the white horse "
Daniel Ellsberg , the famous Pentagon Papers whistleblower , said " if there is another terror attack , " I believe the president will get what he wants " , which will include a dictatorship .
A retired 27 - year CIA analyst who prepared and presented Presidential Daily Briefs and served as a high - level analyst for several presidents , stated that if there was another major attack in the U.S. , it would lead to martial law .
He went on to say :
" We have to be careful , if somebody does this kind of provocation , big violent explosions of some kind , we have to not take the word of the masters there in Washington that this was some terrorist event because it could well be a provocation allowing them , or seemingly to allow them to get what they want . "
The former CIA analyst would not put it past the government to " play fast and loose " with terror alerts and warnings and even events themselves in order to rally people behind the flag
The former assistant secretary of treasury in the Reagan administration , called the " Father of Reaganomics " , who is a former editor and columnist for the Wall Street Journal , Business Week , and Scripps Howard News Service , and , said :
" Ask yourself : Would a government that has lied us into two wars and is working to lie us into an attack on Iran shrink from staging " terrorist " attacks in order to remove opposition to its agenda ? "
He goes on to say :
If the Bush administration wants to continue its wars in the Middle East and to entrench the " unitary executive " at home , it will have to conduct some false flag operations that will both frighten and anger the American people and make them accept Bush 's declaration of " national emergency " and the return of the draft .
Alternatively , the administration could simply allow any real terrorist plot to proceed without hindrance .
A series of staged or permitted attacks would be spun by the captive media as a vindication of the neoconsevatives '
Islamophobic policy , the intention of which is to destroy all Middle Eastern governments that are not American puppet states .
Success would give the US control over oil , but the main purpose is to eliminate any resistance to Israel 's complete absorption of Palestine into Greater Israel .
Think about it .
If another 9/11 - type " security failure " were not in the works , why would Homeland Security czar Chertoff go to the trouble of convincing the Chicago Tribune that Americans have become complacent about terrorist threats and that he has " a gut feeling " that America will soon be hit hard ?
A member of the British Parliament stated that " there is a very real danger " that the American government will stage a false flag terror attack in order to justify war against Iran and to gain complete control domestically
And the former UN Weapons Inspector , an American , who stated before the Iraq war started that there were no weapons of mass destruction is now saying that he would not rule out staged government terror by the U.S. government .
Does that sound like the Neocons ' expressions of yearning for terror are just so much talk ?
Or does it sound like the disciples of Leo Strauss are willing to " manufacture threats " and " fiddle while Rome burns " ?
And if the it is the latter , and the same people made the expressions of yearning before 9/11 , the anthrax attacks and the London bombings , what does that imply about the cause of those events ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain wants the U.S. military to be much larger than current expansion plans envision , an adviser to the Arizona senator said this week .
The Bush administration has begun expanding the U.S. Army and Marine Corps to create a combined strength of around 750,000 active duty troops -- a process backed by McCain ’s Democratic rival , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois .
But McCain believes an Army and Marine Corps with a combined strength of up to 900,000 troops is necessary , said Randy Scheunemann , an adviser to the candidate on foreign policy and national security .
“ Sen . McCain feels the proposed increases are not sufficient .
They need to be more , to fully address the challenges we face in the 21st century , ” Scheunemann told Reuters in a telephone interview .
The U.S. Army and Marines have been severely strained by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Many troops have served multiple tours in the war zones and currently spend only 12 months at home before they deploy again for another year .
As a member of the U.S. Senate ’s armed services committee , McCain has built a reputation for scrutinizing the costs of big weapons programs and he has pledged to pursue that approach in the White House if he wins November ’s election .
McCain led an investigation in 2003 that killed a $ 23.5 billion Air Force plan to lease and buy Boeing Co refueling planes .
The probe sent two former Boeing executives to jail and led to the resignation of Boeing ’s chief executive and two Air Force officials .
Scheunemann said McCain wanted exhaustive reforms “ in the way the Pentagon buys its weapons systems to make sure that we get the best weapons for the men and women in uniform and also get the best value for the taxpayer . ”
But he said McCain did not expect to cut overall defense spending

IRAQ DISPUTE
“ There may be cost savings but in terms of the top line ( he ’s ) not anticipating reductions , ” Scheunemann said in the interview , conducted on Tuesday .
President George W. Bush has submitted a budget of more than $ 500 billion for the Pentagon for the next fiscal year , which begins in October .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan cost some $ 160 billion a year on top of that .
Iraq is the source of one of the biggest disputes between Obama and McCain , who backs the current course of leaving troop cuts generally in the hands of military commanders .
Obama has said he wants all U.S. combat brigades out of Iraq 16 months after he takes office -- although his advisers have indicated some flexibility , saying he will seek the advice of his commanders and leave a “ residual force ” in place .
The United States has around 145,000 troops in Iraq and some 32,000 in Afghanistan , according to the Pentagon .
Obama has pledged to send two more combat brigades -- between 6,000 and 10,000 soldiers -- to fight rising insurgent violence in Afghanistan .
Democrats say Bush has neglected the war in Afghanistan to focus on Iraq while McCain backs Bush ’s view that Iraq is the central front in America ’s fight against Islamist militants .
Nevertheless , Scheunemann said McCain also favored devoting more resources to Afghanistan .
But he suggested the United States and NATO needed to address broader difficulties there .
“ There are problems in our unity of effort , in our command structures , in the coordination between the civilian and military side as well as some shortcomings on the Afghan government side , particularly corruption and rule of law , ” he said .
Expecting to be treated with prejudice may be part of a self - fulfilling prophecy , according to new research led by a University of Toronto psychologist
TORONTO , ON . - Expecting to be treated with prejudice may be part of a self - fulfilling prophecy , according to new research led by a University of Toronto psychologist .
The groundbreaking study was done using a series of computer - animated male and female faces expressing a range of looks , from rejection to acceptance .
Researchers created a slide show where the expressions on the animated faces morphed from looks of rejection to looks of acceptance , and study participants were asked to identify the point at which the expressions changed .
" Those female participants who told us men stereotyped them and treated them with prejudice saw rejection and contempt on the animated men's faces more readily and for a longer period of time than they did on the women 's faces , " says lead author Dr. Michael Inzlicht , assistant professor of psychology at U of T .
" This shows that a person 's level of sensitivity to being stereotyped - their expectation that a person will behave prejudicially towards them - may distort their perception of reality . "
On average , female participants who identified themselves as stigma - conscious saw expressions of contempt for a half - second longer on the men's animated faces than they did on the women 's faces - even though both sets of animated faces expressed looks of contempt for the same amount of time .
Inzlicht warns against blaming the victim , though .
" These prejudice expectations come from actual experiences of prejudice so it 's very possible that the women who are vigilant for rejection are in fact more likely to objectively experience prejudice in everyday life . "
Inzlicht said this joint study with University of Washington and University of California researchers is crucial for improving communications between diverse populations .
" We 've always known that stereotyping by dominant groups can negatively impact communications between groups , " Inzlicht said .
" This study shows it 's also important to consider how the expectations and perceptions of marginalized groups can impact relations .
Both sides play a crucial role . "

The last date you take your cheating girlfriend on .
THE Mississippi River pushed relentlessly past dozens of levees this month .
Towns were submerged , their buildings tiny islands in murky water .
Ducks paddled on ponds that had once been farmland .
Some flooding was inevitable , given the force of the swollen Mississippi .
But a poorly managed flood - defence system did not help .
For the past few years it has been hard to ignore America 's crumbling infrastructure , from the devastating breach of New Orleans 's levees after Hurricane Katrina to the collapse of a big bridge in Minneapolis last summer .
In 2005 the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that $ 1.6 trillion was needed over five years to bring just the existing infrastructure into good repair .
This does not account for future needs .
By 2020 freight volumes are projected to be 70 % greater than in 1998 .
By 2050 America 's population is expected to reach 420 m , 50 % more than in 2000 .
Much of this growth will take place in metropolitan areas , where the infrastructure is already run down .
If America does not act , says Robert Yaro of the Regional Plan Association ( RPA ) , a body that plans for the New York - New Jersey - Connecticut region , it will have the infrastructure of a third - world country within a few decades .
Economic growth will be constricted , and the quality of life will be diminished .
It is not surprising that the floods have put infrastructure in the spotlight , but this time it might remain there .
Droughts have shown the need for better long - term planning .
Thanks to the soaring oil price , a surge in demand for buses and trains has exposed ageing transport systems in big cities and meagre investment in small ones .
And the Highway Trust Fund , which provides most of the federal money for transport projects , will be at least $ 4 billion in debt next year .
The private sector is hungry to invest .
In May Morgan Stanley raised $ 4 billion for its new infrastructure fund , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts ( KKR ) , a private - equity firm , launched a global infrastructure practice , and Pennsylvania announced that Citigroup and Abertis , a Spanish toll - road operator , had won an auction to lease the state 's turnpike .
Momentum for change exists .
Will politicians respond ?
America has a grand tradition of national planning , from Thomas Jefferson 's vision for roads and canals in 1808 , which influenced policy for the next century ( and led to America 's first transcontinental railway ) to Dwight Eisenhower 's Federal Highway - Aid Act of 1956 , which created the interstate system .
Such plans stand in stark contrast to the federal government 's strategy today .
America invests a mere 2.4 % of GDP in infrastructure , compared with 5 % in Europe and 9 % in China , and the distribution of that money is misguided .
The more roads and drivers a state has , the more federal money it receives , explains Judith Rodin of the Rockefeller Foundation , which funds infrastructure research .
This discourages states from trying to cut traffic .
And because the petrol tax pays for transport projects , if America drives less , there is less money for infrastructure .
Even worse is the influence of the pork - barrel .
Only around 20 states use cost - benefit analyses to evaluate transport projects ; of these , just six do so regularly .
Alaska's “ bridge to nowhere ” is an infamous result of this sort of planning .
But it is not exceptional .
Two months after the bridge collapsed in Minneapolis , the Senate approved a transport and housing bill that included money for a stadium in Montana and a museum in Las Vegas .
The result is disarray .
America 's ageing water infrastructure is sorely underfunded : the Environmental Protection Agency forecasts an $ 11 billion annual gap in meeting costs over the next 20 years .
One heavy storm can cause ageing urban sewerage systems to overflow .
Last summer an 83 - year - old pipe in Manhattan burst , sending a geyser of steam and debris into the air .
Competition for water itself has become vicious .
Georgia and Tennessee are in an all - out brawl over it .
America 's transport network is similarly dysfunctional , says a recent Urban Land Institute report .
Important gateways , such as the ports in Los Angeles and New York , are choked .
Flight delays cost at least $ 15 billion each year in lost productivity .
Commutes are more dismal than ever .
Congestion on roads costs $ 78 billion annually in the form of 4.2 billion lost hours and 2.9 billion gallons of wasted petrol , according to the Texas Transportation Institute .
Although a growing number of Americans are travelling by train , the railways are old .
America 's only “ high - speed ” train runs between Boston and Washington , DC , on an inadequate track .
How can all this be fixed ?
In January a national commission on transport policy recommended that the government should invest at least $ 225 billion each year for the next 50 years .
The country is spending less than 40 % of that amount today .
Yet more important than spending lots of money is spending it in better ways .
The Brookings Institution , a think - tank , recommends that America focus on metropolitan areas , or “ metros ” , the top 100 of which account for 65 % of population and 75 % of economic output .
“ America 2050 ” , led by the RPA and a committee of scholars and civic leaders , has a similar scheme for “ megaregions ” , or networks of metros .
The federal government should do what it can to ensure that these areas , first of all , have the infrastructure they need to thrive .
This means , among other things , an enhanced federal role in projects that cross state borders , including not only the interstates but intermodal freight and high - speed rail .
A better system for evaluating a project 's benefit — within a broader strategy for economic development , for example — would help the public get more for its money .
Metros would be given more incentives to reduce congestion and sprawl .
Barack Obama , the Democratic presidential nominee , has echoed many of these ideas .
John McCain , the Republican one , derides the “ bridge to nowhere ” ; his website even has a video game , “ Pork Invaders ” .
But so far he has no strategy .
Mr Obama 's plans include creating an infrastructure bank to help finance transport projects , supporting high - speed rail and investing in subways and buses .
Most controversial will be the question of how to pay for all this .
Mr Obama 's infrastructure bank would aim to attract private capital .
But the private sector 's role remains contentious .
Both the Senate and the House have passed bills to raise money for passenger rail , but the White House wants private operators to be more involved .
Pennsylvania 's effort to lease its turnpike , which follows similar deals in Chicago and Indiana , must still be approved by a sceptical state legislature .
User fees , says Mary Peters , the secretary of transport , are a way to reduce congestion while raising revenue for other projects .
Introducing road pricing in just the biggest 98 metropolitan areas would generate some $ 120 billion a year , according to a study by Brookings .
But it will be hard .
New York 's legislature has quashed a plan for congestion pricing , though the federal government had promised $ 354m .
There is reason to hope .
Beyond the campaign trail , many politicians have made infrastructure a big issue .
Mr Obama 's infrastructure bank is a variation on a scheme that Chris Dodd , a Democrat , and Chuck Hagel , a Republican , introduced in the Senate last year .
( The bill , is still pending . )
In the House , Earl Blumenauer has proposed a commission to guide infrastructure investment .
Ed Rendell , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Bloomberg , the political juggernauts in Pennsylvania , California and New York City respectively , have launched a coalition to make infrastructure a national priority .
The benefits of investment would be felt in many ways .
Terence O'Sullivan , president of the Labourers ' union , says 47,500 jobs will be created for every $ 1 billion the government spends on infrastructure .
“ Make no little plans ” , said Daniel Burnham , one of America 's great urban architects .
“ They have no magic to stir men 's blood . ”
It 's time to think big again .

Beijing has rejected claims that the human rights situation in China has deteriorated in the run-up to its hosting of the Olympic Games .
China 's foreign ministry said a report by Amnesty International showed the group had " tinted glasses " .
The report accused China of reneging on its promises of greater freedom , with activists jailed , journalists detained and more people sent to labour camps .
But Beijing said people who understood China would not agree with Amnesty .
Foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said : " I hope that Amnesty International can take off the tinted glasses they have been wearing for years and see China in a fair and objective way , and do something more constructive . "
He insisted that there should be no interference in China 's affairs .
Send us your comments China 's voices of dissent James Reynolds ' China The China Society for Human Rights Studies , which has links to the government , also dismissed the Amnesty report .
Spokeswoman Xiong Lei told the BBC : " We do feel that we have problems , but we are solving them and the human rights situation is getting better and better . "
When it was awarded the Games , China pledged to uphold the values of human dignity associated with the Olympian tradition .
It promised an improvement in human rights , media freedom and better provision in health and education .
But Amnesty 's report , entitled The Olympics Countdown : Broken Promises , says the opposite has occurred .
It says Chinese activists have been locked up , people have been made homeless , journalists have been detained , websites blocked , and that the use of labour camps and prison beatings has increased .
" We 've seen a deterioration in human rights because of the Olympics , " said Roseann Rife , a deputy programme director for Amnesty International .
' Silenced '
" Specifically we 've seen crackdowns on domestic human rights activists , media censorship and increased use of re-education through labour as a means to clean up Beijing and surrounding areas . "
The report names individual activists including Hu Jia , Yang Chunlin and Ye Guozhu as among those who had effectively been silenced by the government in the run-up to the Games .
BBC China editor Shirong
Chen says ordinary people in China are increasingly aware of their rights and are prepared to defend them .

LA CROSSE — La Crosse County prosecutors are investigating a teenager who told police she starved her newborn daughter by refusing to breast - feed her .
The 19 - year - old is being held on tentative charges of first - degree intentional homicide and hiding a corpse .
District attorney Tim Gruenke said Monday the woman gave birth last August but stopped feeding the girl after two days , knowing the infant would die .
He says she put the girl ’s body in a cooler and then put it out with the garbage this spring .
The child ’s remains have n’t been recovered .
The woman is being held in the La Crosse County Jail on a $ 50,000 cash bond .
Today Amtrak has 632 usable rail cars , and dozens more are worn out or damaged but could be reconditioned and put into service at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars each .
And it needs to buy new rail cars soon .
Its Amfleet cars , the ones recognizable to riders as the old Metroliners , are more than 30 years old .
And the Acela trains , which have been operating about eight years , have about a million miles on them .
Writing specifications for bids , picking a vendor and waiting for delivery takes years , even if the money is in hand .

An 82 - year - old woman in Southampton , UK was told she could n't take photos of an empty wading pool because she might be a paedophile .
Because , you know , anything that children touch regularly becomes part of their souls , and if a paedophile looks at those objects , it 's just like sexually assaulting a child .
Makes me glad , as a father , to live here in the UK , where the clear - eyed , sensible view of paedophilia is doing so much to ensure the safety of my daughter from assaults by strangers ( an occurrence that is so rare as to be practically nonexistent ) while doing practically nothing to protect her from the people who are statistically most likely to assault her — her family , her friends ' parents , her teachers , and other people known to her , who account for the overwhelming majority of assaults on children .

McCain campaign accuses Obama of playing race card Associated Press
Published : Thursday July 31 , 2008
Print This Email This John McCain 's campaign accused Barack Obama on Thursday of playing racial politics a day after the Democratic candidate predicted Republicans would try to scare voters by pointing out " he does n't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills . "
Obama " played the race card , and he played it from the bottom of the deck , " McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said in a statement .
He called Obama 's remarks " divisive , negative , shameful and wrong . "
While Obama was meeting with victims of this summer 's flooding here , his aides were initially dismissive of the McCain broadside .
" We 're not in the habit of reacting every time they put out a statement , " spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
The first black candidate with a shot at winning the White House , Obama argued while stumping in Missouri on Wednesday that President Bush and McCain will resort to scare tactics to maintain their hold on the White House because they have little else to offer voters .
" Nobody thinks that Bush and McCain have a real answer to the challenges we face .
So what they 're going to try to do is make you scared of me , " Obama said .
" You know , he 's not patriotic enough , he 's got a funny name , ' you know , he does n't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills . ' "
Obama himself did n't make clear what distinctions he thinks McCain is likely to raise regarding the presidents on U.S. currency - white men who for the most part were much older than Obama when elected .
McCain has not raised Obama 's race as an issue in the campaign ; he has said Obama lacks experience .
On Thursday , Gibbs said the senator was not referring to race .
" What Barack Obama was talking about was that he did n't get here after spending decades in Washington , " Gibbs said .
" There is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene .
He was referring to the fact that he did n't come into the race with the history of others .
It is not about race . "
Obama often makes references to his distinctions as a candidate , such as saying there are doubts among some voters because he has " a funny name . "
At times he refers to his race as well , saying he looks different from any previous candidate but then adding that the differences are not just about race .
Addressing supporters Tuesday night at a fundraiser in Springfield , Mo. , he said , " It 's a leap , electing a 46 - year - old black guy named Barack Obama . "
During a round of appearances in Missouri , an economically challenged battleground state , Obama worked to link McCain to the unpopular Bush .
He said the Republican senator from Arizona would serve the equivalent of a third Bush term if elected .
He said the country can't afford more of the same and expects different results .
" That 's a definition of madness , but that 's what John McCain is offering .
He 's offering Bush economic policies and Karl Rove politics , " Obama said .
He pressed the theme later at a rain - soaked barbecue in Union , Mo . " They 're going to say I 'm a risky guy , " Obama said .
" What they 're going to argue is I 'm too risky .
The real risk is that we miss the moment , that we do not do what 's needed because we 're afraid . "
For its part , McCain 's campaign on Wednesday released a withering television ad comparing Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton , suggesting the Democrat is little more than a vapid but widely recognized media concoction .
" He 's the biggest celebrity in the world , but is he ready to lead ? " the voiceover asks in the ad , which mixes images of Obama on his trip to Europe last week with video of the 20 - something pop stars .
Obama 's campaign quickly responded with a commercial of its own , dismissing McCain 's complaints as " baloney " and " baseless . "
Throughout the day , Obama argued that McCain " thinks we 're on the right track " economically .
" These anxieties seem to be growing with each passing day , " Obama said .
" We can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what we 've been doing .
My opponent , John McCain , thinks we 're on the right track . "
That elicited boos from some of the 1,500 people who filled a Springfield high school gymnasium .
When an AP - Ipsos poll asked the " right track , wrong track " question this month , 77 percent said they thought the country was on the wrong track .
The same poll set Bush 's approval rating at 28 percent .
Both were records for the AP - Ipsos survey .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Most voters are aware that Barack Obama wants to raise taxes on high - income taxpayers if he 's elected president in November .
But what does the Democratic candidate mean by high - income ?
Who'd be affected and how ?
While the Obama campaign must still settle on more details about their plans , outlines are starting to emerge .
To start , Obama frequently cites $ 250,000 as the line between those who would be subject to higher taxes and those who would n't .
Indeed , under Obama 's tax plan , married couples with at least $ 250,000 in gross income are likely to see their taxes go up if Obama is elected president .
But what about single filers ?
The line for them would likely be about $ 200,000 , according to an Obama adviser .
Those groups could end up paying anywhere from several thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars more to Uncle Sam than they do now , according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center .
From income to Social Security to estates , we take a look at four areas where the high - income set and the very well off may be subject to a bigger tax bill in an Obama administration .
Income taxes
Obama would restore the top two income tax rates to their pre-2001 levels of 36 % and 39.6 % .
Currently they 're 33 % and 35 % .
Obama 's proposal would also reinstate some limitations on how much of a given deduction or personal exemption high - income taxpayers may take .
However , not everyone in the top two brackets would necessarily be affected by the rate increase .
Much depends on whether they 've been subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) in the past .
You 're supposed to calculate your tax liability under both the regular income tax code and the AMT .
If your bill under the AMT is bigger , you must pay that .
The Obama rate increase would certainly narrow the spread between the two - since the amount owed under the regular code would go up .
The question is would the amount you owe because of the increase exceed your AMT bill .
" Until the regular tax starts exceeding the [ AMT bill ] , you wo n't have an increase , " said John Battaglia , a director in the private client advisors practice of Deloitte .
" But if people are deep into AMT , it would n't matter . "
For example , if the rate increase would mean you owe $ 2,500 more under the regular code , but your AMT bill is normally $ 5,000 more than your regular bill , you would still pay the AMT .
Payroll taxes
In addition to wages up to $ 102,000 - the current cap on salary subject to the payroll tax , which funds Social Security - Obama would also tax amounts over $ 250,000 .
In other words , income between $ 102,000 and $ 250,000 would be protected .
Obama 's stated goals are to better fund the Social Security program - which faces a long - term shortfall - and to make the system more progressive .
Currently , the vast majority of Americans pay the Social Security tax on 100 % of their income because they do n't make more than the $ 102,000 wage cap .
By contrast , very highly paid taxpayers only pay Social Security tax on a portion of their income .
People who make $ 204,000 , for example , only pay the tax on 50 % of their income .
The rate at which salary is taxed for Social Security is 12.4 % ( half of which is normally paid by employees and half by their employers ) .
Obama has n't said whether the money from wages and salaries over $ 250,000 would be taxed at the same rate .
If it were , the person making $ 300,000 in gross income - $ 50,000 above the $ 250,000 watermark - would pay an additional $ 3,100 into the system annually ( 6.2 % x $ 50,000 ) .
We also do n't know whether the benefits promised to the highest income workers would go up as a result of their paying more into the system .
" Those are details that Senator Obama would want to work out on a bipartisan basis with Congress , " an Obama adviser said .
That lack of specificity concerns some tax experts .
" If Obama is hinting that those making more than $ 250,000 would pay a higher payroll tax rate ... it would fundamentally change the way Social Security operates and run the risk of making the program look less like social insurance and more like welfare , " Tax Vox blog editor Howard Gleickman wrote for the Tax Policy Center .
Investment income taxes
Long - term capital gains used to be taxed differently than dividends , which were subject to one 's top income tax rate .
Under the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts , gains and dividends are treated equally .
Currently the most one would pay is 15 % .
Both rates are scheduled to rise by 2011 - long - term gains to 20 % and dividends would once again be taxed a taxpayer 's top income tax rate for dividends .
Obama would continue to treat gains and dividends equally and would keep the current rate in place for everyone except high - income households .
He has n't specified how high he'd like to make the rate , but observers expect and Obama himself has virtually said that the new rate likely would fall between 20 % and 25 % .
Estate tax
Finally , Obama 's proposals to tax wealth are not only defined by income levels .
When it comes to family wealth , for instance , Obama favors maintaining the estate tax , which is scheduled to be repealed in 2010 for one year .
But he would limit its reach .
Obama would freeze the estate tax exemption amount at $ 3.5 million - up from its current $ 2 million level and the $ 1 million level it 's set to revert to in 2011 .
He would also keep the current top rate of 45 % , which is below the 55 % it is set to revert to in 2011 .
On the third floor of the Museum of Modern Art in Midtown Manhattan rests a tribute to Esquire ’s glory years  a collection of 92 covers from the 1960s and early 1970s that have become , in the museum ’s words , “ essential to the iconography of American culture . ”
That illustrious history hangs over the magazine ’s effort to celebrate its 75th year .
Its attempt to add to the annals of museum - worthy covers includes a nod to the digital age : an electronic cover , using admittedly rudimentary technology , that will flash “ the 21st Century Begins Now , ” when it appears on newsstands in September .
“ I hope it will be in the Smithsonian , ” said David Granger , Esquire ’s editor in chief , in a recent interview while showing prototypes of the cover  an early version has a cord sticking out that attaches to a battery pack .
If it does wind up in the Smithsonian , it will need a power source ; on its own , the magazine will run out of juice after 90 days .
Mr. Granger knows some will see the cover as a gimmick  but he says he thinks the technology behind it , which has been used for supermarket displays but never embedded in a magazine , speaks to the possibilities of print .
Dan Abrams :
Do media give McCain a free ride on foreign policy gaffes ?
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday July 17 , 2008
Print This Email This A recent ABC News / Washington Post poll showed that Americans believe by 63 % to 26 % that John MCain is more knowledgeable on world affairs than Barack Obama .
However , MSNBC's Dan Abrams believes this is just proof of " the media 's reluctance to hold John McCain accountable the same way they might Barack Obama . "
" McCain has made gaffe after gaffe when it comes to foreign affairs , " Abrams pointed out on Wednesday .
" And yet the DC media and pundits have for the most part shrugged it off . "
Abrams then ran through a sampling of some of McCain 's recent errors , including referring to " President Putin of Germany , " saying it is " common knowledge " than Iran is training al Qaeda , saying " Somalia " when he meant " Sudan , " claiming that " we have drawn down to pre-surge levels " in Iraq , and repeatedly referring to " Czechoslovakia , " a nation which no longer exists , rather than the " Czech Republic . "
Abrams turned for comment to White House correspondent April Ryan , who agreed that " this plays into what many are concerned about -- John McCain 's age -- and they kind of slough it off . "
She also suggested that " a lot of it 's because of [ Obama 's ] rock star status .
People are looking at him as this new upstart and want to hit him , more so than this man who is assumed to know better . "
Abrams noted that it is n't just about Obama .
Even during the 2000 primaries , George W. Bush was complaining , " John McCain says something about the ' ambassador to Czechoslovakia . '
Well , I know there is no Czechoslovakia , but yet it did n't make the nightly national news . "
However , GOP strategist Brad Blakeman , the president of Freedom 's Watch , insisted , " They 're innocent gaffes .
When you are as accessible as John McCain ... you 're bound to make mistakes .
...
Everybody knows he did n't mean what he said . "
" It 's fair enough in the sense that these are minor mistakes , " Abrams agreed .
" But ... if Obama had made the kind of mistake that John McCain made when Joe Lieberman had to correct him about Iran and Iraq ... and he repeatedly keeps making this mistake on Czechoslovakia ... "
" For three - quarters of his life it 's been Czechoslovakia ! "
Blakeman interrupted , perhaps inadvertently drawing attention once again to McCain 's age .
" The public is n't stupid .
They know people make mistakes ... but his overall policy is correct , and that 's what the American people understand . "
Abrams ' final response was , " If and when Barack Obama makes a similar mistake , it better be treated that way as well . "

Many expect superdelegates to fall in line for Obama by Tuesday night .
Superdelegates predict quick primary end
As the Democratic nomination marathon neared a potential finish line , key senators said the results of Tuesday ’s South Dakota and Montana primaries will have a domino effect on uncommitted superdelegates – quite possibly clinching the nomination for Barack Obama .
“ We want this locked up sooner rather than later , ” said Sen .
Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) , who has remained undeclared .
“ Let ’s have the nominee and let ’s move on .
That ’s the common thread among the uncommitted superdelegates . … I will be ready after tomorrow night . ”

With only 31 total pledged delegates at stake in the two states , Obama cannot win enough in the final two primaries to reach the 2,118 necessary to clinch the nomination .
But Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) , one of Obama ’s strongest Senate supporters , said that she had spoken to enough uncommitted superdelegates around the country Monday to determine that he will reach the threshold necessary to claim the Democratic nomination by the end of Tuesday evening .
“ I think tomorrow will be a very big day .
I ’ve spoken to 10 uncommitteds , and they ’ve said yes , they ’ll be committing [ to Obama ] , and they ’ll be committing sometime tomorrow . “
The magic number has “ been shrinking so quickly , ” McCaskill said .
Eight superdelegates announced their choices Monday — six for Obama and two for Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - N.Y . ) .
In addition , House Majority Whip James Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) confirmed that he will endorse Obama on Tuesday .
A group of 15 uncommitted Senate superdelegates met on Capitol Hill Monday to discuss how to proceed on making their endorsements .
“ It was a dialogue about how people are feeling , ” said Sen. Ken Salazar ( D - Colo . ) , who noted that no decisions were made at the meeting Monday .
“ For me , it ’s who I think can win this thing in November . ”
When asked who that was , he said : “ I could make the argument for either one of them . ”
Salazar said there will be another meeting of uncommitted superdelegates Wednesday .
Sen. Benjamin Cardin ( D - Md. ) , agreed that superdelegates must make their decisions this week , but he said it ’s not up to superdelegates to come out with a unified decision .
Rather , Obama and Clinton will have to mend the fences and move the party ahead , Cardin said .
“ I ’m going to pick the person who has the most support and has the best chance of winning , ” Cardin said .
At Monday ’s meeting , Cardin said there was no lobbying on behalf of Obama or Clinton , and there was no push for a unified statement among the remaining superdelegates .
But Cardin said he emerged from that meeting believing the superdelegates would rapidly begin making their decisions public in order to close out the nominating process .
Sherrod Brown , also uncommitted , said , “ I told both Barack and Hillary that I ’d make a decision by the end of the week . ”
At least one Senate superdelegate , Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , said he ’s not committing because he wants to get his delegation seated with full votes .
The Democratic National Committee ’s Rules and Bylaws Committee agreed Saturday to seat Michigan ’s full delegation , but each delegate — including superdelegates — will only receive a half vote .
“ I ’m sticking to it , ” he said .
Sen. Barbara Mikulski ( D - Md. ) , a Clinton superdelegate , said Monday that her colleagues should remain patient for now .
“ I think if they decided to do anything today , it would be precipitous , ” she said .
“ They should do it when the process of electing delegates is over . ”
As to Clinton superdelegates like herself : “ We are unwavering .
We will go through tomorrow night and we ’ll see where Sen. Clinton is . ”

How I feel about Scheme ’s performance .
I came across this post written earlier today , How fast is Scheme ?
Well ….
which states :
I do n’t know much about Scheme [… ] but it seems that the Scheme compilers produce quite sluggish code , at least looking through the grainy , distorted lens that is the Computer Language Benchmarks Game .
That seems to make enough sense to me .
For one - off heavily numerical tests , Scheme pretty much sucks .
Especially considering that to compile the code it often has to go through C .
He goes on to say :
SBCL comes out very much on top ; in general the Gambit programs take two or three times as long to do their job ( although I have n’t looked at memory usage ) .
But as far as Scheme compilers go , Gambit seems to be improving things .
With the right declarations , SBCL has been known to outperform straight C as well .
Its compiler is really quite something .
And ( IIRC ) it does n’t have the “ handicap ” of using C as an intermediate language .
Personally however , I tend to consider C generating Scheme compilers more practical for issues of portability and / or easier FFI than performance .
Chicken ’s a good example of braindead - easy FFI .
And I feel where Gambit really shines is when you need many , many threads .
It ’ll handle hundreds of thousands of threads in a breeze .
Termite is a good example of exploiting its threading capabilities .
RScheme does real - time GC .
SCSH has replaced every use I ’ve had for shell / perl / etc scripts .
There ’s a decent chance that any random Linux box already has Guile installed .
SISC and Kawa leverage Java ’s JIT machiery and provide trivially easy Java FFI .
Bigloo can compile to Java bytecode as well .
MzScheme runs its own JIT compiler by default where it can , and is prefered to its C output .
And there ’s a JIT option for all the C - generating Scheme ’s as well , compile with LLVM instead of GCC .
I think it ’d be especially interesting to compare MzScheme ’s JIT to MzScheme ’s C + LLVM .
And if you ’re going the Scheme ->C route for performance reasons , I ’d think Stalin to be the obvious Scheme to use , whether with GCC or LLVM depending on its expected run time ( assuming there ’s even noticeable startup overhead with LLVM , it ’s embedded VM is really quite minimal ) .
Many of them have really nice OO systems built in as well
But none of these tests run long enough to let any of the JIT options really shine .
Basically , I say throw any of the JIT options into the mix , and make the tests long enough to really let them do their magic .
I very strongly suspect the same holds for Java , having run a Freenet node for quite some time it gets noticeably snappier once the JVM has had a chance to see it run for a while , especially for recent versions of Java .
I ’d also argue that ’s exactly ( other than its relatively primitive GC ) what makes Java so incredibly horrid for client - side stuff such as applets , you ’re loading a JIT compiler and GC you ’ll hardly get a chance to even use before you ’ve closed the window .
But its JIT has been making leaps and bounds lately , as mentioned on Good Math , Bad Math :
About a year later , testing a new JIT for Java , the Java time was down to 0.7 seconds to run the code , plus about 1 second for the JVM to start up .
( The startup times for C , C++ , and Ocaml were n’t really measurable – they were smaller than the margin of error for the measurements . )
This is from the previous measurement of 1 minute and 20 seconds for Java .
As I said before , SISC , Kawa , and Bigloo will happily use the Java VM .
Straight C scored 0.8 seconds .
OCaml kicked all their asses even before compilation , but that ’s not the point here .
If you really need every last bit of performance you can get though , OCaml seems to be worth looking into .
So yeah , I ’m * very * interested in what the performance possibilities for Scheme really are , if nothing else out of shear curiosity .
Maybe I ’ll wind up running a few benchmarks of my own at some point , reiterating the tests , say , a hundred or a thousand times each … but in the end , even if this does increase their performance relative to SBCL … you do n’t need to use an obscure implementation or do JIT tricks with SBCL in the first place .
A lot of people havn’t heard of Stalin or LLVM .
A lot of people do n’t want to load one language ( Java ) to run another ( Scheme ) .
Although again , I ’d question whether MzScheme ’s performance is really so bad in the long run .
And I ’d question whether it was really worth it in the first place .
Fluxus and Impromtu are two obvious examples which come to mind , both heavy graphics / audio livecoding systems , which solve many problems the same way you would in , say , Python .
Offload much of the heavy work onto libraries .
There ’s a PDF floating on the net somewhere about MzScheme controlling an array of telescopes , and of course there ’s the US Navy ’s Metcast project .
SchemDoc , Scheme Elucidator , the LAML they ’re both based on that you can just feed any XML DTD into and get a Scheme representation of that XML language in .
SCWM and Orion window managers .
MetaModeler for dealing with many / large databases .
For web stuff there ’s TeX2 page , SISCweb , BRL , WiLiKi , the Hop framework , HtmlPrag , SXML , it goes on .
There ’s a lot of uses which do n’t demand every last bit of performance from the Scheme implementation , and I ’m just not really doing anything that does .
And if I were writing something and came across an annoying bottleneck ?
I ’d likely take the NetBSD approach .
Instead of trying to tweak things to run faster ( LLVM , Java , implementation - specific declarations , etc … ) , I ’d see if I could n’t find a fundamentally more efficient algorithm first .
Which reminds me , I still want those books .
[ update ]
On the Reddit thread where apparently most of the views for this article are coming from ( who ’d have thought so many people would be interested in some Scheme noob ’s opinions of language performance ?
Well over 500 hits already , scant hours later ) , there ’s a link to a fascinating email thread discussing the floating point speed of Gambit - C. I have Brad Lucier ’s paper printing to read later as I type this .
There ’s also a reply in the thread by Brad himself , my favorite part of which is the end summary , which is generally similar to the “ NetBSD approach ” mentioned above .
Is there some sort of established term for this idea ?
Anyway , I ’ll certainly be rethinking my opinions of Gambit - C as “ that threading / Termite implementation ” .
[ update 2 ]
It ’s morning , getting close to 1500 views for this post now … searching for r5rs performance on Google this is the 3rd result !
I still do n’t see why this is drawing so much attention , but as long as it is , have you seen Scheme Now !?
Scheme Now ! , also known as Snow , is a repository of Scheme packages that are portable to several popular implementations of Scheme .

What ’s crackin’ PlayStation players ?
This is John D from Capcom and I ’ve got some info to share .
Bionic Commando Rearmed is just around the corner and Ben Judd , our resident producer / rock star , wants to reach out to all you Sony fans by giving you weekly updates on this highly anticipated title .
Expect exclusive news , videos and artwork from now thru launch .
Ben has some really exciting details regarding the PSN version of Bionic Commando Rearmed , so hopefully you all will recognize that Capcom is giving love to all the Sony gamers out there .
Here ’s
Ben ’s first transmission :
Welcome to the first installment of our weekly Bionic Commando : Rearmed column .
The folks here at the PlayStation .
Blog have been kind enough to give us some space to strut our Bionic stuff .
Do n’t worry , I promise there will not be an excess of swinger jokes .
To kick off this edition , we ’d like to mention some of the “ PSN specific ” content that you can expect for Rearmed .
There will be Dualshock 3 support , because we all know that games that vibrate are better and besides … there really is no reason not to implement a feature that has become the industry standard .
Also , Rearmed is one of the only PSN games to feature Remote Play support .
This one was n’t as easy to add and , matter of fact , there is one point where we had to “ creatively ” reprogram the controls to give players the illusion of using 2 sticks ( you ’ll know when you see it ) .
The classic 2D side - scrolling graphics really fit with the PSP and just make the PSN version all the more cooler .
Of course there is one more VERY cool surprise for those of you who purchase the PSN version … but that is another story for another time .
So if Rearmed looks like it might be up your alley , come visit the “ Top Secret ” crew over at www.bioniccommando.com, where you can read the weekly serial comic , listen to one of the most ill - advised Japanese - publisher podcasts – Top Secret : The Bionic Commando Podcast , and , of course , listen to music from popular video game rockers , the BCR soundtrack , and the original 8 - bit Bionic Commando music , all on the Bionic Commando Music Player .
In the meantime , check this space again in about a week for update number 2 !

Haley
Haley is the FSA ’s finest helicopter pilot , who transports Nathan “ Rad ” Spencer through dangerous Imperial territory .
From a safe altitude , Spencer is then parachuted into enemy encampments .
Due to her unique piloting style and willingness to put both her chopper and her body on the line , Haley has been labeled as “ reckless ” and is considered a liability by some in the FSA Armed Forces .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
How , exactly , did Wal - Mart become the new Food and Drug Administration ?
The giant retailer , along with CVS ( CVS , Fortune 500 ) and Toys 'R Us , announced recently that it plans to stop selling baby bottles containing the chemical bisphenol - A .
The question is , why ?
Bisphenol - A has been widely used since the 1950s .
The Food and Drug Administration , as well as Japanese and European regulators , have no problems with it .
Canada is about to ban it from baby bottles , but officials term the move purely precautionary .
To be sure , other scientists worry because animal studies have linked small doses of BPA to cancer and other health problems .
But scientific debate is n't driving the baby bottle war ; a hard - hitting push by activist groups , politicians and trial lawyers is .
As traditional media picked up the story in the spring , spooked retailers like Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) backed away from BPA , while companies that had done so earlier scored a PR coup that boosted their fortunes .
One could argue , as BPA opponents do , that the government is too slow to take action to protect health , so private action by consumers and companies is necessary .
Or one could argue , as does Steve Hentges , a chemist and industry lobbyist that " the science can't compete with the emotion . "
What 's inarguable , though , is how rapidly markets can by reshaped today by an activist campaign that catches fire online .
The Environmental Working Group and the authors of the book Our Stolen Future have used the Internet to sound alarms about bisphenol - A. The Bisphenol - A Free portal keeps a running tally of bad news reports .
Bloggers at www.safemama.com and www.healthychild.org pound away at the chemical industry .
Got BPA ?
BPA is everywhere , used to make polycarbonate , a rigid , clear plastic for bottles , bike helmets , DVDs and car headlights .
It 's also an ingredient in epoxy resins , which coat the inside of food and drink cans .
About 93 % of Americans tested by the Centers for Disease Control had the chemical in their urine .
If opponents drive BPA out of the food supply , consumers will pay .
Some BPA - free plastic bottles sell for $ 10 each , more than twice the price of bottles with BPA .
Baby bottles made of glass can break , potentially causing injury .
Replacing BPA in the lining of cans would mean retooling all that packaging , and it's not clear that there are safe alternatives .
A handful of companies emerged as winners this spring when the BPA story got big : Whole Foods Market ( WFMI , Fortune 500 ) , which pulled BPA baby bottles and cups off its shelves several years ago ; Eastman Chemical ( EMN , Fortune 500 ) , which introduced a plastic alternative called Triton last year ; and Born Free , a private company started in 2006 specifically to provide BPA - free baby bottles .
Others , including SABIC Innovative Plastics , which was formerly the plastics division of GE and is now the U.S. 's biggest manufacturer of BPA , presumably suffered .
( SABIC declined to comment on the financial impact . )
Baby - bottle makers including Avent America , Evenflo and Gerber Products are now being sued because they sold products made with BPA .
The BPA battles were fought like a political campaign , with catchy soundbites , press releases , personal attacks , and warring Web sites .
The anti-BPA general is Dr. Frederick vom Saal .
He has testified before state legislatures and appeared on TV to denounce BPA in terms that gloss over the scientific uncertainty .
Referring to the fact that BPA is a mild estrogen , he says things like " the idea that you 're using sex hormones to make plastic is just totally insane . "
Vom Saal is n't the only scientist warning about BPA .
Dozens of others are active in trying to ban it .
But Vom Saal is the most visible and the most vitriolic .
He accuses a Dow Chemical ( DOW , Fortune 500 ) executive of trying to bribe him , a charge the company strongly denies .
The industry , in turn , has gone after vom Saal , noting that he has appeared in a video news release produced by Born Free , which makes BPA - free baby products .
He also consulted with a New York law that 's suing baby bottle manufacturers .
Vom Saal says he has not taken any money from a company or law firm .
Fenton Communications , a Washington , D.C. PR firm , is another key warrior against BPA .
Fenton 's clients have included Born Free and its BPA - free bottles ; the Environmental Working Group , which has led the fight against BPA for years ; and trial lawyers .
Fenton also works for liberal advocacy groups like MoveOn that support Democrats in Congress who have sponsored legislation to ban BPA from children 's products .
Sometimes these groups appear to be working in concert .
Last year , the Environmental Working Group tested canned foods and found that " many Americans are exposed to BPA above levels shown to be harmful in laboratory studies . "
This year , a congressional investigation led by Reps .
John Dingell and Bart Stupak asked manufacturers of infant formula to remove BPA from their cans .
They declined .
All this generated headlines - and worry .
Science for sale
The chemical industry has tried to get its message out , too .
See the Web sites http://www.bisphenol-a.org/ and http://www.factsonplastic.com/ , which offer a defense of BPA .
But the industry is often depicted as a " special interest group , " while environmentalists and politicians are seen as serving the " public interest . "
It is n't that simple , of course .
Controversy helps the enviros raise money , Democratic politicians love to find fault with the Bush administration .
And the trial lawyers sense a big payday .
The problem for the chemical industry is that its track record does n't exactly inspire confidence .
The Dingell - Stupak investigation of BPA looked at what the congressmen call " science for sale , " finding examples of consultants promising clients how research would turn out .
Needless to say , this is not how science is supposed to work .
This became a key element of the attack on BPA .
Dingell has said he 's concerned about whether " the science FDA relied on to approve the use of Bisphenol A was bought and paid for by industry . "
But , as Dingell must know , the FDA typically uses industry research because it does n't have the money to conduct independent studies of the thousands of chemicals on the market .
It then reviews what industry produces .
By April , all the news had turned bad for BPA .
" There is no safe level of BPA , " declared Dr. Nancy Snyderman , an NBC medical reporter , on the Today show .
( Maybe NBC is the new FDA ? )
The Canadian government recommended its ban on baby bottles with BPA .
A lengthy draft report from a part of the National Institutes of Health found " some concern " about the effect of BPA on fetuses , infants and children at current exposure levels .
The NTP report is a model of thoroughness and nuance .
Naturally , that makes it a flop in the court of public opinion .
With fear in the air , in the space of a few days Wal - Mart , Toy 'R Us , CVS and others said they will phase out baby bottles containing BPA .
Nalgene , a water bottle maker , and Playtex also said they will stop using the chemical .
I asked Wal - Mart why the company is removing a legal product , which may or may not be dangerous , while continuing to sell cigarettes , which are incontrovertibly harmful .
" We sell products our customers want to buy , " responded spokeswoman Linda Brown Blakley .
" Our customers are telling us they want this option . "
That wo n't end the war .
You can expect to see anti-BPA forces keep up the pressure .
Will soup , soda and beer cans be next ?
And is this any way to make judgments about public health ?

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
An omnibus housing rescue package , some elements of which have been debated in Congress for years , had been on track Wednesday to finally move toward enactment but hit a speed bump that puts in question when lawmakers will vote .
In a press conference Wednesday morning , Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky. , said he and the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , D - Nev. , have reached a general agreement on " the most pressing amendments " and that the bill " is likely to pass this week . "
But the Senate got bogged down by a procedural maneuver by one senator who insists the body include a series of energy tax breaks in the housing bill .
Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , said lawmakers were close to getting passage on the bill " if only we can get it to the floor . "
The package would create a new government - backed program to help at - risk borrowers .
It also would change how two of the biggest players in the mortgage market are regulated and alter key rules in how they may operate .
Furthermore , it proposes measures intended to spur activity in the housing market .
Dodd said he and other leading senators were engaged in talks with House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass . , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , to iron out differences between the Senate version of the housing package and the foreclosure - prevention bill that the House passed in May .
Once those differences are worked out , the bill the Senate votes on would likely pass the House as well .
What remains unclear is whether lawmakers can get a bill to President Bush on July 4 , the deadline Dodd and Shelby have pushed for .
The White House has signaled that President Bush would veto the Senate bill in its current form .
As a result , one element lawmakers are likely to discard is a provision that would give $ 4 billion in aid to states to buy up foreclosed properties - a measure the White House contends would do more to aid lenders than homeowners .
Major provisions
Even with amendments , the key measures likely to appear in the final bill are intended to prevent foreclosures , spur the housing market and increase oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The provision that has garnered the most attention is one that would allow the Federal Housing Administration to insure up to $ 300 billion in new loans for at - risk borrowers if lenders agree to write down loan balances below the appraised value of borrowers ' homes .
The program , which would be voluntary for both lenders and borrowers , would be paid for in the Senate bill by the premiums borrowers pay and by fees from Fannie ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) , the two government - sponsored enterprises that guarantee the purchase and trade of mortgages .
Critics of the plan say lenders are more likely to saddle the program with their worst loans - those most likely to foreclose .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the program would end up guaranteeing 400,000 loans worth $ 68 billion , and of those , about a third would result in default .
The CBO estimates the net loss from those defaults would be $ 680 million , or 1 % of the total loan amounts guaranteed .
Another provision would raise the cap on the size of mortgages guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie to $ 625,000 from $ 417,000 .
The House version raises the limit to nearly $ 730,000 .
The bill also calls for an independent regulator to oversee Fannie and Freddie , but Democrats are trying to amend the bill so that the regulator would not be put in place until the next president takes office .
Among the tax breaks in the legislation is a one - year tax credit for first - time buyers that would be worth up to $ 8,000 .
But in effect , the credit would work as an interest - free loan that the home buyer would eventually need to repay .

Before the close of this century , the tuatara may lose the first half of its topical designation and become , simply , a fossil .
Climate change will be responsible for raising the soil temperature in its remaining island habitats around New Zealand to the point at which female hatchlings cannot survive .
After the introduction of rats to the mainland by early explorers , the tuatara 's population was set on a course toward extinction .
Now its only remaining members there are in a fenced wildlife sanctuary .
This cousin of both lizards and snakes is the only remaining member of an order of reptiles stretching back 200 million years .
It is perhaps most curiously known for the third eye set on top of its skull , the exact function of which is largely speculative .
While it is connected to the brain by a dedicated nerve , the parietal eye is covered with scales and is hidden from view soon after birth , leading some to believe it is responsible for maintaining circadian rhythms .

Brad Ross ’ Difficult Week ( or : What ’s Up with the TTC’s Surface Routes ? )
This post is for developers , investors , and publishers of A - list games .
( Or is that AAA titles ?
Whatever .
“ Games on the shelf at Wal - Mart for $ 50 ” is a more accurate descriptor but it ’s kind of verbose .
Sort of like me . )
I know I ’ve got at least two or three of you in my audience , hiding amongst the crowd of regular gamers , indie developers , and my fellow curmudgeons .
I ’m going to have another go at talking you out of your obsessive pursuit of graphics , which at this point makes Gollum ’s pursuit of The One Ring look lackadaisical .
I realize this is a hopeless task , but it ’s no less hopeless and unfulfilling than trying to keep my humble hardware up to date in the face of your skyrocketing system requirements .
And since I ’m not having a good time I might as well drag you along with me .
If you ’re one of those people who is unable to tell the difference between spending money and making fun games then you ’re excused .
Go back to developing your juvenile plotless cookie - cutter tech demo and do n’t trouble yourself with this business .
In the 1980 ’s , while I was still fantasizing about becoming a programmer and trying to figure out how to kiss girls ( or maybe the other way ’ round ) your average videogame development team was A Guy .
Sometimes larger teams might include His Buddy .
As we entered the 90’s and the age of Doom we saw team sizes swell to numbers that occasionally made it feasible to play a little doubles tennis .
Not that anyone had time for that sort of thing .
A few years later and development teams could , if they ever went outside , possibly fill the positions in a baseball diamond .
A few years after that and we had teams of 20 or more people and something strange started to happen .
Games started getting shorter .
When Max Payne blasted his way onto the scene everyone pointed at his short little 10 hour game and giggled .
10 hours ?
Who is going to pay $ 40 for a ten hour game ?
Well , all of us , eventually .
If we ’re lucky .
But now we can look back fondly at those days .
Teams are still getting bigger and games are still getting shorter .
It now takes a hundred people to produce content that offers even less gameplay than Max Payne did .
Oh yeah :
And development time has increased as well , so not only are you paying a lot more people but you ’re also paying them for a lot longer before you actually get your game .
This is not a good trend and it should fill reasonable developers with apprehension , because it ca n’t keep going like this .
The number of PC gamers has n’t really gone up all that much .
You ’re still aiming for that 4 million units target you were a decade ago .
To put it another way , you ’re now funding teams five times as large for twice as long to sell shorter games to an audience that is roughly the same size .
You can quibble with these numbers if you like , but the trend is there , and it ’s visible .
If I ’ve overstated or understated the problem by some margin it does n’t really change that fact the PC Gaming is seeing an unsustainable escalation of development costs .
An example might be useful .
In Wolfenstein 3D , you can fire up the level editor and make a single room in less then a minute .
In Doom you might spend ten minutes making a room .
Around the turn of the century you might spend a couple of hours on it .
Last I heard it now takes several people ( usually a mapper , a 3D modeler , a texture artist , and possibly some sort of scripting person ) working together for a couple of days to make that room .
Yes , the room is very realistic and cool looking , but it takes 72 man -hours to make the damn thing .
Each new graphics generation requires more development hours to exploit it .
The jump from 2D spites to moving 3D characters was a pretty compelling one .
The leap forward in lighting technology that give us flashlights actually added something to the gameplay .
But adding another lighting pass to make sure a doorknob can support multiple specular reflections ?
Improving the shading and density of foliage by 25 % ?
Are these really worth the development time and the upgrade cost for the user ?
How many of those customers would you lose if you did n’t take the next step ?
What if you just stayed where you are right now from a technology standpoint , instead of adding another 50 people or another six months of development time to your game ?
Sure , you would n’t have the latest graphics , but how many sales is that going to cost you ?
I hear people claim that they ca n’t attract gamers without the next - gen graphics , but … when was the last time anyone honestly tried ?
I do n’t know what the hardware breakdown is out there .
How many PC owners have which graphics cards ?
Now , your first answer might be to jump over and have a look at the Valve Hardware Survey .
“ Oh look !
An overwhelming majority of users have NVidia 6000 series or better ! ”
It really gets on my nerves when you do that and if I could I would whap you on the head with this copy of Game Informer I keep handy for when I need a good laugh .
That survey is for Steam users , and therefore mostly people who already own Half - Life 2 .
Which is exactly the problem you keep running into .
You keep aiming your game at the same fragment of the potential audience .
Like I said , I do n’t know the breakdown , but if it ’s not a bell curve I ’ll eat my keyboard .
I ’ve heard that nothing makes a presentation seem professional like a good chart , so with that in mind I give you this :
Maybe that was n’t as professional as it could have been .
At any rate , you keep aiming your games so that users need the female terminator to run the game well , and a T - 1000 to run the game poorly .
This leaves out all those people in the middle , who are happy to spend a million billion dollars on Peggle and re-skinned Bejeweled clones .
I can hear you arguing , “ Oh Shamus , those people are all boring and stuffy and would n’t want our videogames .
Also I need to be hit in the face with that magazine again . ”
How would you know they do n’t want your games ?
You ’ve never made anything that they can run .
They have n’t rejected you , because you ’ve never given them the chance .
By the time Joe Average has hardware that can run your fancy - pants game , it ’s long gone from stores and replaced by newer games he ca n’t run .
Keep in mind that most of these peggle - players have no clue how to use torrents .
You keep aiming your game at this tiny , pirate - infested group and wondering why sales are so small .
( Also note that a lot of people in the middle are former PC gamers , who did the math and realized that could take the graphics - card money and put it into a console instead of mucking about inside of their computer every eighteen months .
Those people are n’t against PC games , they just do n’t have any available .
With a few exceptions . )
Case in point : Note how World of Warcraft is at least two graphics generations out of date , and yet Blizzard had to buy avalanche insurance just in case their pile of money falls over .
Their game looks like Lego Middle Earth and they are kicking your ass .
Part of the reason is because their game will run on almost every battered laptop and second - hand computer on the planet .
Your customers , on the other hand , need to blow a couple hundred dollars every other year just to run your games poorly .
As far as making a game fun , graphics spectacle is the most foolhardy and inefficient way to spend your money .
The fancy visuals are exciting for the first few minutes , but then the user becomes acclimated and desensitized to your razzle - dazzle and they ’re left with just the gameplay to entertain them .
And gameplay is the one thing you keep cutting to pay for the graphics .
That ’s like cutting off the top of your head because your high heels make you too tall to fit through the door .
If you would just take two steps back from that accursed bleeding edge and aim for the middle of the bell curve you would discover that :
You could work with a much smaller team , paying fewer salaries .
Since you ’re not re-writing your tools and changing your art pipeline every time you start a new game , development time will be shorter .
Your artists will be more productive since you wo n’t be snatching away the tools they understand for newer , more complex tools .
You might find it to be a little easier to make longer / deeper games .
You ’ll have a far larger potential audience .
You ’ll have fewer support / QA issues because you ’ll be building on established technology instead of working the gremlins out of the new stuff .
Better framerates , faster load times , quicker installs .
Even if none of those Peggle - playing goofs embraced your game , you ’d still be better off because you spent a lot less money to sell to the same group of gamers you ’ve been dealing with for years .
You risk so much money on your new pixel shaders , but you ’re not willing to risk spending less and see if you can still get the usual suspects to pony up ?
I realize I just summed up using a bulleted list , but let me sum up again , just to make absolutely sure I ’ve driven my point home :
You can spend far less to make a game with more value that can offer a better play experience to a larger audience with less pirates .
And now let me sum up my summary , for the benefit of those in marketing :
You can spend less money and make more money .
Me ?
I ’m saving up for an XBox 360 .
You guys are driving me nuts with this business .
What is a Klein Bottle ?
Three glass Klein Bottles , available from Acme Klein Bottle .
Ever hear of a Möbius Loop -- a one sided , one edged surface ?
Give a strip of paper a half - twist , then tape the ends together .
It 's one side and one boundary , with delightful properties dear to mathematicians ...
In 1882 , Felix Klein imagined sewing two Möbius Loops together to create a single sided bottle with no boundary .
Its inside is its outside .
It contains itself .
Take a rectangle and join one pair of opposite sides -- you 'll now have a cylinder .
Now join the other pair of sides with a half - twist .
That last step is n't possible in our universe , sad to say .
A true Klein Bottle requires 4 - dimensions because the surface has to pass through itself without a hole .
It 's closed and non-orientable , so a symbol on its surface can be slid around on it and reappear backwards at the same place .
You can't do this trick on a sphere , doughnut , or pet ferret -- they 're orientable .
A true Klein Bottle lives in 4 - dimensions .
But every tiny patch of the Klein Bottle is 2 - dimensional .
In this sense , a Klein Bottle is a 2 - dimensional manifold which can only exist in 4 - dimensions !
Alas , our universe has only 3 spatial dimensions , so even Acme 's dedicated engineers can't make a true Klein Bottle .
A photograph of a stapler is a 2 - dimensional immersion of a 3 - dimensional stapler .
The true stapler has been flattened into the flatland of the photo .
In the same way , our glass Klein Bottles are 3 - D immersions of the 4 - D Klein Bottle .
Acme's Klein Bottle is a 3 - dimensional photograph of a " true " Klein Bottle .
A Klein Bottle cannot be embedded in 3 dimensions , but you can immerse it in 3 - D . ( An immersion may have self - intersections ; Embeddings have no self - intersections .
Neither an embedding nor an immersion has folds or cusps . )
We represent a Klein Bottle in glass by stretching the neck of a bottle through its side and joining its end to a hole in the base .
Except at the side - connection ( the nexus ) , this properly shows the shape of a 4 - D Klein Bottle .
And except at the nexus , any small patch follows the laws of 2 - dimensional Euclidean geometry .
Contrast this with a corked bottle -- say , a wine bottle .
It has two sides : inside and outside .
You can't get from one to the other without drilling a hole or popping the top .
Once uncorked , it has a lip which separates the inside from the outside .
If you make the glass arbitrarily thin , that lip wo n't go away .
It 'll become more prominent .
The lip divides one side of the bottle from the other .
So an uncorked bottle is topologically the same as a disc ... it has two sides , separated by a boundary -- an edge .
But a Klein Bottle does not have an edge .
It 's boundary - free , and an ant can walk along the entire surface without ever crossing an edge .
This is true of both theoretical Klein Bottles and our glass ones .
And so , a Klein Bottle is one - sided .
A Klein Bottle has one hole .
This , in turn , causes it to have one handle .
The genus number of an object is the number of holes ( well , it 's more subtle than that , but I 'm not allowed to tell you why ) .
Other genus - 1 objects include innertubes , bagels , wedding rings , and teacups .
A wine bottle has no holes and so is genus 0 .
( The genus of a human being is difficult to define because it depends on what you consider a hole -- I 'd estimate most people have a genus of 0 to 4 , slightly higher when yawning .
Pierce your ear and you 'll increase your genus by one . )
As an alternative to buying an Acme Klein Bottle , you can save money by just memorizing this set of parametric equations , since it defines the surface of every Klein Bottle . :
x = cos(u ) *( cos( u/2 ) *( sqrt_2+cos(v ) ) +( sin(u/2)*sin(v)*cos ( v ) ) )
y = sin(u ) *( cos(u/2 ) *( sqrt_2+cos(v ) ) +( sin(u/2)*sin(v)*cos ( v ) ) )
z = - 1*sin(u/2 ) *( sqrt_2+cos(v ) ) +cos(u/2)*sin(v)*cos(
v )
or in polynomial form :
Yep , no doubt about it : Your Acme 's Klein Bottle is a real Riemannian manifold , just waiting for you to define a Euclidean metric at every point .
Acme is proud to be our universe 's foremost supplier of immersed , boundary - free , nonorientable , one - sided surfaces .
We make and sell Klein Bottles .

A popular pastime to show off the collective creativity : naming conference rooms .
In Google 's new San Francisco office , they pay homage to television shows and movies set in San Francisco , including " Charmed , " " Suddenly Susan " and " X - Men . "
In Washington , D.C. , the Internet giant has " The Secret , Undisclosed Location " room .
In Google 's Mountain View , Calif. , headquarters , you can go from Addis Ababa to Valencia without leaving the building .
That was the brainstorm of co-founder Sergey Brin , who wanted Googlers to know exactly where in a building a room is -- based on its name .
Each building covers a different region of the world .
Cities beginning with the letters A through L are on the first floor , and the M through Z cities are on the second floor .
At the YouTube headquarters in San Bruno , conference room names follow the Google tradition .

In Google 's Santa Monica offices , printers and bathrooms are named after characters on the old sitcom " Three 's Company . "
In December , YouTube field technician Joe Shockman , who is responsible for desktop support ( he 's also a former Googler who moved over to YouTube after Google bought it ) , suggested that the video - sharing site retire its old practice of naming its office printers after video formats such as QuickTime .
He asked for nominations and was so quickly overloaded ( 95 in one day ) that he had to enlist a friend at the Googleplex to set up a special " name the printer " page that would allow YouTubers to vote for their favorite .
In 15 minutes the page was up and YouTubers could either submit a new idea or vote for one already submitted .

More than science : Projects such as Galileo carry political significance Ambitious plans for European missions to the Moon and Mars are being considered by the French government .
It wants to kick - start a revolution in space by letting EU politicians not bureaucrats decide on priorities for the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
The French say that if Europe fails to change its approach to space , it will fall behind Japan , China and India .
Paris is seeking an alliance with the UK to drive the agenda forward during the French presidency of the EU .
' Political pilot ' President Nicolas Sarkozy 's well - known admiration for all things American now extends to space exploration .
Speaking to the BBC , a senior official involved in French space policy said that it was time to shake up the European Space Agency and make it more like the US space agency ( Nasa ) by giving it a new , politically - led direction .
The French take over the rotating presidency of the European Union on 1 July and are planning to make space policy a key area for reform .
The official said that Europe was in danger of becoming redundant in global space terms and it needed an agency that followed a clear political agenda .
President Sarkozy has big ambitions in space " The United States , Russia , China and Japan would not do what they do in space without a political motivation ; Europe has only had a scientific motivation until now .
So what we are saying is , let 's get the same chances as the others .
" Beside the scientific pilot , let us have a political pilot , too , which will be the EU , because there is only the EU that can speak at that level . "
But Alan Cooper , European space policy implementation manager with Esa in Paris , says that comparisons with Nasa are unfair .
" Nasa has the reputation it has on the strength of the programmes it has delivered , " he told BBC News .
" It spends seven or eight times as much as Esa spends in a year .
Its profile you would expect then to be seven or eight times higher than Esa .
If you want the European space programme to have the same impact , it will need a higher profile and the investment to match those goals . "
Record of success
The European Space Agency was formed in 1975 , and its seventeen member - states include countries outside the EU - Switzerland and Norway .
Canada also takes part in some projects under a co-operation agreement .
Its mission is to shape the development of Europe 's space capability .
Its objectives are scientific and industrial ; and the latter is reflected in its funding arrangements .
The agency invests in the space industry in each member - state roughly equal to the amount of money the member - state pays into Esa .
A current debate centres on Europe having an independent crew vehicle Esa has had many significant successes in space exploration .
It has developed a launch site in French Guiana , become a major player in the business of commercial satellites , trained an astronaut corps and has contributed the Columbus laboratory to the International Space Station .
It is also developing its own , controversial , global navigation system called Galileo .
But critics of Esa say it belongs to another age when European space activities were seen as a bridge between the American and Soviet space racers ; and it is time it lost its dependence on others .
Europe has no means of getting its own astronauts into space , for example .
Now , documents seen by the BBC indicate that the French plans for an overhaul of Esa are at an advanced stage .
The papers say that a politically - led space enterprise is necessary for Europe to be taken seriously in the international arena .
The documents talk about the manned exploration of Mars and the need for Europe to play an " indispensable " part .
Funding issues Commenting on the issue of Mars , the French official agreed it was now on the agenda .
" The French impetus would be to say that a European contribution to a human flight mission to Mars is something we should set as an objective .
It 's exactly this kind of question that needs to be answered - this is highly political .
You have to say , do you want to go human , to the Moon first , or do you want to go directly to Mars , which is the French position .
Plans at present only extend to the robotic exploration of Mars " These are all political questions , of course .
You can turn them into science , but they are political questions and Esa cannot answer them and this is why we need a political element . "
Alan Cooper says that political leadership which comes with extra resources would be very welcome at Esa .
" If we are focussing on the question of whether we welcome an increase in political interest in space in Europe - clearly , yes , if that results in higher goals and the investment to match , we would be extremely happy about that .
" It 's tempting to use a phrase like , 'he who pays the piper calls the tune ' , but really it 's down to accountability .
If you are accountable for the money you are spending , then you determine the rules under which it is spent .
If someone else is raising that money , they have that accountability .
" I think what you are talking about is fundamentally changing the aims of Esa and if you want a fundamental shift in goals for Esa then it's got to be a decision for all the member states . "
Joint interests According to the French , the UK is their model partner in this endeavour .
The two countries had similar views on how business should be encouraged to get involved in space to develop commercial opportunities .
And the two countries were now of the same view when it came to exploration , he said .
" It is mainly since the arrival of our new President that we have come up with a pretty British type of idea , " the French official added .
" Britain has always been pushing for exploration and by discussing our plans , we have had quite a good reaction from the British National Space Centre and from the ministry . "
France hosts Europe 's spaceport at Kourou , French Guiana
But not everyone is happy with this political approach ; and the French acknowledge there will be serious opposition from some countries .
" People are very much attached to the Esa which we understand .
But this attachment translates into keeping the status quo , and we think this is not a good position ; we think that Europe now needs political support otherwise the Chinese or the Indians will overtake us . "
The French EU presidency also coincides with the next major meeting of Esa member - state ministers in November , when many of these issues are sure to be aired .
The acknowledgement that EU and Esa interests increasingly overlap led to the creation in 2004 of a Space Council in which shared concerns could be discussed .
Some space projects , such as the Galileo satellite - navigation system , are deemed so fundamental to the future economic well being of the EU that the driving force to implement them comes direct from the European Commission in Brussels .

Advertisement Just why pears rot faster than apples can now be explained by science .
It is all to do with how oxygen is able to find its way to the centre of the fruit after it has been picked .
Belgian researchers used one of the world 's most powerful X - ray machines to image the tiny pores and channels that carry air through the two foods .
Pieter Verboven 's team was able to show how the structures in pears meant they got " out of breath " quicker than apples - key information for growers .
The results of the study will improve the models used to determine optimal storage conditions .
The study will help reduce waste in the fruit industry " If we know how the pears get into storage , we can better predict how they will behave , " the Catholic University of Leuven scientist told BBC News .
" From season to season , from batch to batch , even from orchard to orchard - we can give advice to the grower , saying ' well , for these pears , you may have to elevate the oxygen concentration in your storage room because there is the potential for problems ' . "
There is a clear economic driver to minimise wastage in the fruit industry ; and supermarket shoppers certainly do not want to cut into the flesh to find a brown , mushy mess .
Year on year , very practical experiments are run to see how different crop varieties cope under a range of shelf conditions ; but science is also trying to improve its understanding of the biochemical and physical mechanisms that underpin decay .
After picking , the cells in the fruit need oxygen for respiration - to produce the sugars and energy required to maintain good health .
If air cannot pass through the fruit , cells close to the core will eventually start to brown and rot .
Pieter Verboven 's group put apples and pears inside the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( ESRF ) in Grenoble , France , which produces an intense , high - energy light that can pierce just about any material , revealing its inner structure .

The giant X - ray machine is able to resolve features down to and below a thousandth of a millimetre ; and by turning the target in front of the light beam , it is possible to build up extremely high - definition , three - dimensional views of the subject under study .
The latest research illuminated the microscopically small structures for oxygen supply that exist in fruit .
In apples , the pathways appear as irregular cavities between cells , whilst in pears they have the shape of tiny interconnected channels .
" We already knew that different apple varieties have a different density which means they have a different fraction of air spaces ; but we did n't know the structures , " Dr Verboven told BBC News .
" We also knew that pears have a much lower amount of void spaces inside because pears sink to the bottom if you drop them in water whereas apples float , which indicates that one has more air than the other one .
EUROPEAN LIGHT SOURCE
Electrons are fired into a linac , or straight accelerator .
They 're boosted in a small ring before entering the storage ring .
The superfast particles are corralled by a train of magnets .
Energy lost by turning electrons emerges as intense light ( X - rays ) .
The 850 m - circumference ring has 32 magnet clusters , or cells .
Electrons turned by plain magnets produce ' standard ' X -rays .
Particles ' wiggled ' at undulator magnets emit stronger X - rays .
X - rays can't turn with electrons and head straight down beamlines .
Experiment ' hutches ' receive the most intense X - rays in Europe .
The light probes materials on the atomic and molecular scale .
Robots can place many samples in the beam for rapid science .
ESRF data leads to new materials , drugs , electronics , etc. BACK NEXT 1 of 3 " But also in pears , no - one knew what the structure of those air voids was . "
Now , the scientists understand not only what the cavities and micro-channels look like but also how they perform .
The Verboven team was able to describe the complex mechanisms of gas exchange , respiration and fermentation that take place in the different fruits .
There is much less water in apples to slow the penetration of the gas , and although the channels in pears are connected they just do not work as efficiently as the big pores in apples in allowing oxygen to pass through to the core .
" It is still unclear how airways in the fruit develop , and why apples have cavity structures and pears micro-channel networks " , explained Dr Verboven .
" The micro-channels are so small that oxygen supply to the fruit core is very limited and cells are quickly ' out of breath ' when oxygen levels fall below the safety threshold , " he said .
The research is published in the journal Plant Physiology .

PHILADELPHIA  Brandon Dilbeck , 20 , a student at the University of Washington , was complaining recently on his blog , Brandon Notices , about Comcast ’s practice of posting ads in its on - screen programming guide .
He assumed he was writing for his own benefit .
“ It feels like nobody ever really reads my blog , ” he said .
“ Nobody has left a comment in months . ”
Shortly afterward , he received an e-mail message from Comcast , thanking him for the feedback and adding that it was working on a new interactive guide that might “ illuminate the issues that you are currently experiencing . ”
Mr. Dilbeck found it all a bit creepy .
“ The rest of his e-mail may as well have read , ‘ Big Brother is watching you , ’ ” he said .
To some men , bicycles may look like the key to good health and a prosperous sex life — riding around all day keeps you fit and attractive ; you can save that $ 4.50 a gallon of gas money for your date / girlfriend / boyfriend / house party ; and you get to wear really , really tight clothes .
But there 's a downside .
Cycling can also cause genital numbness , erection problems and skin irritations in the groin area , a new report in the urology journal BJU International confirms , citing several medical studies over the last few years .
Automate backups on Linux
No excuses : do - it - yourself , secure , distributed network backups made easy
If you use Linux , you already have access to extremely powerful tools for creating custom backup solutions .
The solutions in this article can help you perform simple to more advanced and secure network backups using open source tools that are part of nearly every Linux distribution .
Simple backups
This article follows a step - by - step approach that is quite straightforward once you follow the basic steps .
Let 's begin with a simple , yet powerful archive mechanism on our way to a more advanced distributed backup solution .
Let 's examine a handy script called arc , which will allow us to create backup snapshots from a Linux shell prompt .
Listing 1 .
The arc shell script
#!/bin/sh tar czvf $ 1.$ ( date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S ) . tgz $ 1 exit $ ?
The arc script accepts a single file or directory name as a parameter and creates a compressed archive file with the current date embedded into the resulting archive file 's name .
For example , if you have a directory called beoserver , you can invoke the arc script , passing it the beoserver directory name to create a compressed archive such as : beoserver .20040321-014844.tgz
The use of the date command to embed a date and timestamp helps to organize your archived files .
The date format is Year , Month , Day , Hour , Minutes , and Seconds -- although the use of the seconds field is perhaps a bit much .
View the man page for the date command ( man date ) to learn about other options .
Also , in Listing 1 , we pass the -v ( verbose ) option to tar .
This causes tar to display all of the files it 's archiving .
Remove the -v option if you 'd like the backup to proceed silently .
Listing 2 . Archiving the beoserver directory
$ ls arc beoserver $ ./ arc beoserver beoserver / beoserver / bookl.dat beoserver/beoserver_ab_off beoserver/beoserver_ab_on $ ls arc beoserver beoserver .20040321-014844.tgz
Advanced backups
This simple backup example is useful ; however , it still includes a manual backup process .
The industry 's best practices recommend backing up often , onto multiple media , and to separate geographic locations .
The central idea is to avoid relying entirely on any single storage media or single location .
We 'll tackle this challenge in our next example , where we 'll examine a fictitious distributed network , illustrated in Figure 1 , which shows a system administrator with access to two remote servers and an offsite data storage server .
Figure 1 . Distributed network
The backup files on Server # 1 and # 2 will be securely transmitted to the offsite storage server , and the entire distributed backup process will occur on a regular basis without human intervention .
We 'll use a set of standard tools that are part of the Open Secure Shell tool suite ( OpenSSH ) , as well as the tape archiver ( tar ) , and the cron task scheduling service .
Our overall plan will be to use cron for scheduling , shell programming and the tar application during the backup process , OpenSSH secure shell ( ssh ) encryption for remote access , and authentication , and secure shell copy ( scp ) to automate file transfers .
Be sure to review each tool 's man page for additional information .
Secure remote access using public / private keys
In the context of digital security , a key is a piece of data which is used to encrypt or decrypt other pieces of data .
The public and private key scheme is interesting because data encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted with the associated private key .
You may freely distribute a public key so that others can encrypt the messages they send you .
One of the reasons that public / private key schemes have revolutionized digital security is because the sender and receiver do n't have to share a common password .
Among other things , public / private key cryptography has made e-commerce and other secure transactions possible .
In this article , we 'll create and use public and private keys to create a highly secure distributed backup solution .
Each machine involved in the backup process must be running the OpenSSH secure shell service ( sshd ) with port 22 accessible through any intermediate firewall .
If you access remote servers , then there is a good chance you 're already using secure shell .
Our goal will be to provide machines with secure access without requiring the need to manually provide passwords .
Some people think that the easiest way to do this is to set up password - less access : do not do this .
It is not secure .
Instead , the approach we 'll use in this article will take perhaps an hour of your time , set up a system which gives all the convenience of " passphraseless " accounts -- but is recognized as being highly secure .
Let 's begin by ensuring that OpenSSH is installed and proceed to check its version number .
At the time this article was written , the latest OpenSSH release was version 3.8 , released on February 24 , 2004 .
You should consider using a recent and stable release , and at the very least use a release which is newer than version 2.x .
Visit the OpenSSH Security page for details regarding older version - specific vulnerabilities ( see the link in Related topics later in this article ) .
At this point in time , OpenSSH is quite stable and has proven to be immune to many of the vulnerabilities which have been reported for other SSH tools .
At a shell prompt , type ssh with the capital V option to check the version number :
$ ssh -V
OpenSSH_3.5p1 , SSH protocols
1.5/2.0 , OpenSSL 0x0090701f
If ssh returns a version number greater than 2.x , the machine is in relatively good shape .
However , it is recommended that you use the latest stable releases of all software , and this is especially important for security - related software .
Our first step is to log in to the offsite storage server machine using the account , which will have the privilege of being able to access servers 1 and 2 ( see Figure 1 ) .
$ ssh accountname@somedomain.com
Once logged on to the offsite storage machine , use the ssh - keygen program to create a public / private key pair using the -t dsa option .
The -t option is required , and is used to specify the type of encryption key we 're interested in generating .
We 'll use the Digital Signature Algorithm ( DSA ) , which will enable us to use the newer SSH2 protocol .
See the ssh - keygen man page for more details .
During the execution of ssh - keygen , you 'll be prompted for the location where the ssh keys will be stored before you 're asked for a passphrase .
Simply press enter when asked where to save the key and the ssh - keygen program will create a hidden directory called .ssh ( if one does n't already exist ) along with two files , a public and private key file .
An interesting feature of ssh - keygen is that it will allow you to simply press enter when prompted for a passphrase .
If you do n't supply a passphrase , then ssh - keygen will generate keys which are not encrypted !
As you can imagine , this is n't a good idea .
When asked for a passphrase , make sure to enter a reasonably long string message which contains alphanumeric characters rather than a simple password string .
Listing 3 . Always choose a good passphrase
[ offsite ] : $ ssh - keygen -t dsa Generating public / private dsa key pair .
Enter file in which to save the key ( /home/accountname/.ssh/id_dsa ) : Enter passphrase ( empty for no passphrase ) : ( enter passphrase ) Enter same passphrase again : ( enter passphrase ) Your identification has been saved in /home / accountname/.ssh/id_dsa .
Your public key has been saved in /home / accountname/.ssh/id_dsa.pub .
The key fingerprint is : 7e:5e :b2:f2:d4:54:58:6a: fa:6b:52:9c:da:a8:53:1b accountname@offsite
Because the .ssh directory which ssh - keygen creates is a hidden " dot " directory , pass the - a option to the ls command to view the newly created directory :
[ offsite ] $ ls -a
. .. . bash_logout .bash_profile .bashrc .emacs .gtkrc .ssh
Enter the hidden .ssh directory and list the contents :
[ offsite ] $ cd .ssh
[ offsite ] $ ls -lrt
id_dsa id_dsa.pub
We now have a private key ( id_dsa ) and a public key ( id_dsa.pub ) in the hidden .ssh directory .
You can examine the contents of each key file using a text editor such as vi or emacs , or simply by using the less or cat commands .
You 'll notice that the contents consist of alphanumeric characters encoded in base64 .
Next , we need to copy and install the public key on servers 1 and 2 .
Do not use ftp .
Rather , use the secure copy program to transmit the public keys onto each of the remote machines :
Listing 4 .
Installing the public keys on the remote servers
[ offsite ] $ scp .ssh/id_dsa.pub accountname@server1.com :offsite.pub accountname@server1.com 's password : ( enter password , not new passphrase ! ) id_dsa.pub
100 % |*****************************| 614 00:00 [ offsite ] $ scp .ssh/id_dsa.pub accountname@server2.com :offsite.pub accountname@server2.com 's password : ( enter password , not new passphrase ! ) id_dsa.pub
100 % |*****************************|
614 00:00
After we install the new public keys , we 'll be able to sign on to each machine using the passphrase we specified when creating the private and public keys .
For now , log in to each machine and append the contents of the offsite .
pub file to a file called authorized_keys , which is stored in each remote machine 's .ssh directory .
We can use a text editor or simply use the cat command to append the offsite .
pub file 's contents onto the authorized_keys file :
Listing 5 . Add offsite .pub to your list of authorized keys
[ offsite ] $ ssh accountname@server1.com accountname@server1.com 's password : ( enter password , not new passphrase ! ) [ server1 ] $ cat offsite.pub >>
./ssh/authorized_keys
The next step involves employing a bit of extra security .
First , we change the access rights for the .ssh directory so that only the owner has read , write , and execute privileges .
Next , we 'll make sure that the authorized_keys file can only be accessed by the owner .
And finally , we 'll remove the previously uploaded offsite .
pub key file , since it 's no longer required .
It 's important to ensure that access permissions are properly set because the OpenSSH server may refuse to use keys which have non-secure access rights .
Listing 6 . Changing permissions with chmod
[ server1 ] $ chmod 700 .ssh [ server1 ] $ chmod 600 ./ssh/authorized_keys [ server1 ] $ rm offsite.pub [ server1 ] $ exit
After completing the same process on server2 , we are ready to return to the offsite storage machine to test the new passphrase type access .
> From the offsite server you could type the following :
[ offsite ] $ ssh - v accountname@server1.com
Use the -v , or verbose flag option , to display debugging information while verifying that your account is now able to access the remote server using the new passphrase rather than the original password .
The debug output displays important information which you might not otherwise see , in addition to offering a high level view of how the authentication process works .
You wo n't need to specify the -v flag on subsequent connections ; but it is quite useful to do so while testing a connection .
Automating machine access using ssh-agent
The ssh - agent program acts like a gatekeeper , securely providing access to security keys as needed .
Once ssh - agent is started , it sits in the background and makes itself available to other OpenSSH applications such as ssh and scp programs .
This allows the ssh program to request an already decrypted key , rather than asking you for the private key 's secret passphrase each time it 's required .
Let 's take a closer look at ssh-agent .
When ssh - agent runs it outputs shell commands :
Listing 7 . ssh-agent in action
[ offsite ] $ ssh- agent SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-XX1O24LS/agent.14179 ; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK ; SSH_AGENT_PID=14180 ; export SSH_AGENT_PID ; echo Agent pid 14180 ;
We can instruct the shell to execute the output commands which ssh - agent displays using the shell 's eval command :
[ offsite ] $ eval `ssh - agent`
Agent pid 14198
The eval command tells the shell to evaluate ( execute ) the commands generated by the ssh - agent program .
Make sure that you specify the back - quote character ( ` ) and not a single quote !
Once executed , the eval `ssh - agent` statement will return the agent 's process identifier .
Behind the scenes , the SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID shell variables have been exported and are now available .
You can view their values by displaying them to the shell console :
[ offsite ] $ echo $ SSH_AUTH_SOCK
/tmp/ssh-XX7bhIwq/agent.14197
The $ SSH_AUTH_SOCK ( short for SSH Authentication Socket ) is the location of a local socket which applications can use to speak to ssh-agent .
To ensure that the SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID variables are always registered , enter the eval `ssh - agent` statement into your ~/.bash_profile .
ssh -agent has now become a background process which is visible using the top and ps commands .
Now we 're ready to share our passphrase with ssh-agent .
To do so , we must use a program called ssh-add , which adds ( sends ) our passphrase to the running ssh - agent program .
Listing 8 . ssh-add for hassle - free login
[ offsite ] $ ssh-add Enter passphrase for /home / accountname/.ssh/id_dsa : ( enter passphrase ) Identity added : /home/ accountname/.ssh/id_dsa ( /home/accountname/.ssh/id_dsa )
Now when we access server1 , we 're not prompted for a passphrase :
[ offsite ] $ ssh accountname@server1.com
[ server1 ] $ exit
If you 're not convinced , try removing ( kill - 9 ) the ssh - agent process and reconnecting to server1 .
This time , you 'll notice that server1 will request the passphrase for the private key stored in the id_dsa file in the .ssh directory :
[ offsite ] $ kill -9 $ SSH_AGENT_PID
[ offsite ] $ ssh accountname@server1.com
Enter passphrase for key ' /home/accountname/.ssh/id_dsa' :
Simplifying key access using keychain
So far , we 've learned about several OpenSSH programs ( ssh , scp , ssh - agent and ssh- add ) , and we 've created and installed private and public keys to enable a secure and automated login process .
You may have realized that most of our setup work only has to be done once .
For example , the process of creating the keys , installing them , and getting ssh - agent to execute via a .
bash_profile only has to be done once per machine .
That 's the really good news .
The less than ideal news is that ssh - add must be invoked each time we sign on to the offsite machine and ssh - agent is n't immediately compatible with the cron scheduling process which we 'll need to automate our backups .
The reason that cron processes can't communicate with ssh - agent is that cron jobs are executed as child processes by cron and thus do not inherit the $ SSH_AUTH_SOCK shell variable .
Fortunately , there is a solution which not only eliminates limitations associated with ssh - agent and ssh-add , but also allows us to use cron to automate all sorts of processes requiring secure passwordless access to other machines .
In his 2001 three - part developerWorks series , OpenSSH key management ( see Related topics for a link ) , Daniel Robbins presented a shell script called keychain , which is a front - end to ssh- add and ssh-agent and which simplifies the entire passwordless process .
Over time , the keychain script has undergone a number of improvements and is now maintained by Aron Griffis , with a recent 2.3.2 - 1 release posted on June 17 , 2004 .
The keychain shell script is a bit too large to list in this article because the well - written script includes lots of error checking , ample documentation , and a generous serving of cross - platform code .
However , keychain can be quickly downloaded from the project 's Web site ( see Related topics for a link ) .
Once you download and install keychain , using it is remarkably easy .
Simply log in to each machine and add the following two lines to each .
bash_profile :
keychain id_dsa
. ~/.keychain /$HOSTNAME-sh
The first time you log back in to each machine , keychain will prompt you for the passphrase .
However , keychain wo n't ask you to reenter the passphrase on subsequent login attempts unless the machine has been restarted .
Best of all , cron tasks are now able to use OpenSSH commands to securely access remote machines without requiring the interactive use of passphrases .
Now we have the best of both worlds , added security and ease of use .

Scripting a backup process
Our next task is to create the shell scripts , which will perform the necessary backup operations .
The goal is to perform a complete database backup of servers 1 and 2 .
In our example , each server is running the MySQL database server and we 'll use the mysqldump command - line utility to export a few database tables to an SQL import file .
Listing 10 .
The dbbackup.sh shell script for server 1
#!/bin/sh # change into the backup_agent directory where data files are stored .
cd /home / backup_agent # use mysqldump utility to export the sites database tables mysqldump -u sitedb - pG0 oDP@sswrd -- add - drop - table sitedb -- tables tbl_ccode tbl_machine tbl_session tbl_stats > userdb.sql # compress and archive tar czf userdb.tgz userdb.sql
On server 2 , we 'll place a similar script which backs up the unique tables present in the site 's database .
Each script is flagged as executable using :
[ server1 ] : $ chmod +x dbbackup.sh
With a dbbackup.sh file on servers 1 and 2 , we return to the offsite data server , where we 'll create a shell script to invoke each remote dbbackup.sh script prior to initiating a transfer of the compressed ( .tgz ) data files .

The backup_remote_servers.sh shell script uses the ssh command to execute a script on the remote servers .
Because we 've set up passwordless access , the ssh command is able to execute commands on servers 1 and 2 remotely from the offsite server .
The entire authentication process is now handled automatically , thanks to keychain .
Scheduling
Our next and final task involves scheduling the execution of the backup_remote_servers.sh shell script on the offsite data storage server .
We 'll add two entries to the cron scheduling server to request execution of the backup script twice per day , at 3:34 am and again at 8:34 pm .
On the offsite server invoke the crontab program with the edit ( -e ) option .
[ offsite ] : $ crontab -e
The crontab invokes the default editor , as specified using the VISUAL or EDITOR shell environment variables .
Next , type two entries and save and close the file .
Listing 12 .
Crontab entries on the offsite server
34 3 * * * /home/ backups/remote_db_backup.sh 34 20 * * * /home/backups/remote_db_backup.sh
A crontab line contains two main sections , a time schedule section followed by a command section .
The time schedule is divided into fields for specifying when a command should be executed :
Listing 13 .
Crontab format
+---- minute | +----- hour | | +------ day of the month | | | +------ month | | | | +---- day of the week | | | | | +-- command to execute | | | | | | 34 3 * * * /home/ backups/remote_db_backup.sh
Verifying your backups
You should routinely check your backups to ensure that the process is working correctly .
Automating processes can remove unnecessary drudgery , but should never be a way of escaping due diligence .
If your data is worth backing up , then it 's also worth spot checking from time to time .
Consider adding a cron job to remind yourself to check your backups at least once per month .
In addition , it 's a good idea to change security keys every once in a while , and you can schedule a cron job to remind you of that as well .
Additional security precautions
For added security , consider installing and configuring an Intrusion Detection System ( IDS ) , such as Snort , on each machine .
Presumably , an IDS will notify you when an intrusion is underway or has recently occurred .
With an IDS in place , you 'll be able to add other levels of security such as digitally signing and encrypting your backups .
Popular open source tools such as GNU Privacy Guard ( GnuPG ) , OpenSSL and ncrypt enable securing archive files via shell scripts , but doing so without the extra level of shielding that an IDS provides is n't recommended ( see Related topics for more information on Snort ) .
Conclusion
This article has shown you how to allow your scripts to execute on remote servers and how to perform secure and automated file transfers .
I hope you 'll feel inspired to start thinking about protecting your own valuable data and building new solutions using open source tools like OpenSSH and Snort .

I am queueing up some road trip movies in our Netflix account , and I would love your suggestions to add to our list .
On my list so far are :
It ’s a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World ( 1963 ) G
Before literally kicking the bucket when his car careens over an embankment , “ Smiler ” Grogan ( Jimmy Durante ) tells onlookers he ’s stashed $ 350,000 in stolen loot beneath “ the big W ” in the town of Santa Rosita , and thus begins a mad dash to recover the dough .
What an amazing collection of talent : Spencer Tracey , Milton Berle , Sid Cesar , Buddy Hackett , Ethel Merman , Mickey Rooney , Dick Shawn , Phil Silvers , Terry - Thomas , Jonathan Winters , Jim Bakus , Peter Falk , Normal Fell , Buster Keaton , Don Knotts , Carl Reiner , Jack Benny , and even an uncredited cameo by Jerry Lewis ( as “ Man who runs over hat ” ) .
If our trip includes “ a big W ” we ’ll let you know once we ’ve dug up and re-stashed the loot .
The Blues Brothers : Theatrical Cut( 1980 ) R
After Jake Blues ( John Belushi ) gets out of prison , he and brother Elwood ( Dan Aykroyd ) reunite for a one - night charity concert , then wind up in a monumental chase .
This is not a good movie , but it still manages to be a great movie .
( I should point out , before Neil does , that Dan Aykroyd is Canadian , too . )
I still love the soundtrack and the church scene with James Brown is one of my favourite movie scenes ( right up there with “ I am Spartacus ! ” ) .
The Cannonball Run ( 1981 ) PG
Burt Reynolds , Farrah Fawcett , Dom DeLuise , Peter Fonda , Dean Martin , Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Chan are all entrants in an illegal cross-country car race , and all are willing to do anything to win .
I ’m not sure how Blues Brothers wound up rated R while Cannonball Run was rated PG .
I recall Cannonball Run as being in distinctly poorer taste .
I have n’t seen Cannonball Run in dog ’s years , and I ’m guessing that what I ’ll delicately term its “ 1970 ’s sensibilities ” are probably a little uncomfortable to watch today .
( Has anyone seen it lately ? )
But Cannonball
Run makes the list because it is still an ultimate road trip movie .
I remember loving Dom DeLuise in this film , and I think this must have been Jackie Chan ’s first big American movie role .
Strangers in Good Company ( 1990 ) PG
When a bus filled with eight elderly women breaks down in the wilderness , the group of strangers is stranded at a deserted farmhouse with only their wits , their memories and eventually some roasted frogs ’ legs to sustain them .
Rita Kemply of the Washington Post characterized Strangers In Good Company as Outward Bound on Golden Pond , and that strikes me as a pretty good description .
I saw this in Montreal back when it was released , and found it interesting and sweet but also substantial .
Given that their bus breaks down , I do n’t know if this is strictly speaking a “ road trip movie ” Kemply calls it “ a kind of road movie sitting still ” but then we have n’t been logging that many miles yet ourselves so I ’m not really in a position to point fingers .
Strangers in Good Company was produced by Studio D of Canada ’s National Film Board , which is now tragically defunct .
A film came out in 2007 about the history of Studio D , and Gail Vanstone of York University also recently published a book titled D is for Daring : The Women behind the Films of Studio D. I look forward to tracking down both the book and the film .
( If I keep including Canadian content , do you think Stephen Harper will send me some grant money ? )
Little Miss Sunshine ( 2006 ) R
Convinced little Olive ( Abigail Breslin ) is beauty queen material , parents Richard ( Greg Kinnear ) and Sheryl ( Toni Collette ) and the rest of the family embark on a life - altering road trip to a pageant .
Several friends recommended Little Miss Sunshine to us , but I dragged my feet on watching it because the trailers and promotions for it did nothing for me .
When we finally watched it , I was delightfully surprised by how quirky and subversive it is .
( That ’s high praise from us . )
Without spoiling the film for anyone who has n’t seen it , I ’d just like to clarify that Neil and I are not traveling with any dead bodies in the Mini .
So far .
What are your favourite road trip movies ?
As I look at this list , it occurs to me that many road trip movies are of dubious quality ; this genre seems prone to movies that , while great as road trip movies , are not necessarily good as just plain movies .
So be sure to explain your favourite road trip movies ’ redeeming qualities !
And do n’t feel constrained to American movies or English language films .
There ’s got to be some great road trip movies from other regions , and I ’m surprised I ca n’t think of any off the top of my head .

GOP senators scramble for lifeboats
Republican Senate leaders — terrified by the prospect of losing five or more seats in November — have freed their members to vote however they need to vote to get reelected , even if that means bucking the president or the party ’s leadership .
On at least four votes over the past month — Medicare , housing , the GI Bill and the Farm Bill — Republican leaders have n’t even bothered whipping members to toe the party line or back President Bush ’s veto threats .
Instead , a GOP leadership aide says leaders have told vulnerable senators that it ’s all right to “ get well ” with voters by siding with Democrats on anything but energy and national security .

It ’s unusual for rank - and - file members to get a green light to blow off their party leaders .
But these are unusual times for Republicans .
They are genuinely worried they could get their clocks cleaned in November .
The prevailing attitude :
It is better to lose some big votes now than big races in November .
This helps explain why so many Senate Republicans are taking flight from President Bush and their own leaders — and doing it loudly and proudly .
Shortly after the Medicare vote , the website for Sen.
John Cornyn featured news that the Texas Republican — best known as a Bush loyalist — had voted to override the president ’s veto .
In a brief conversation with POLITICO , Sen .
Saxby Chambliss ( R - Ga. ) openly discussed how Vice President Cheney had personally asked him about his Medicare vote .
Chambliss said he told the vice president that he needed to back his local doctors and senior citizens .
“ I said , ‘ Dick , I ’m beyond that , ’ ” Chambliss said .
Cheney ’s “ my good friend and my hunting buddy , but my mind was made up . ”
Asked whether Republican Senate leaders had whipped the Medicare vote , Chambliss said he had n’t been pressured .
Both Chambliss and Cornyn are up for reelection , and both were hammered back home over the Fourth of July recess by the American Medical Association lobby on the Medicare bill .
An aide to a Republican senator who voted to override the veto said , “ Republican leadership wrote us off from the get - go .
We were never whipped on this .
Leadership just left us alone . ”
Another GOP leadership aide said leaders did n’t bother whipping the housing bill , because only a small cadre of conservatives were opposed to it .
Senate Republican leaders argue that some votes have been so lopsided — 70 - 26 on Medicare , 84 - 12 on a procedural step on the housing bill — because Democrats , searching for compromise , removed some of the most objectionable items from their bills .
Indeed , Democrats have crafted narrower bills on housing , energy and even Iraq war funding in an effort to lure GOP support and build their legislative résumé heading into the fall .
Still , this trend in Senate voting represents a stark contrast to the first 18 months of the 110th Congress , which were defined by razor - thin partisan votes in the Senate and a near - daily blame game over the use of the filibuster .
“ It looks like after months of hanging together with their leaders , they ’re beginning to have an every - man - for - himself attitude , ” said Jim Manley , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) .
“ They started the year with a strategy of doing everything they could to grind the Senate to a halt .
What ’s changing now is we ’re getting closer to the election . ”
With the apparent freedom to vote their consciences — or at least their states ’ consciences — even members of the GOP leadership team have gone separate ways on certain issues .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) and Minority Whip Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) voted against the Medicare veto override , but two other GOP leaders , Cornyn and Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) — vice chairman and chairman , respectively , of the Senate Republican Conference — voted in favor of the override .
On a housing bill procedural vote , McConnell voted yes , but Kyl voted no .
On a Medicare amendment sponsored by conservative rabble - rouser Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) , McConnell , Kyl and Cornyn backed DeMint , but Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - Texas ) , also part of the GOP leadership , went the other way .
“ I do n’t think you can infer from that that we ’re not going to come together and block bad bills , ” Cornyn said .
“ I think Medicare was a special case . ”
But on virtually all of these mixed votes , it ’s not a case of McConnell and Kyl losing control of their conference and losing major votes .
In fact , GOP leaders are allowing for political expedience to trump partisan stalemate .
By letting politically vulnerable GOP senators such as Norm Coleman of Minnesota , Susan Collins of Maine , Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina and Gordon Smith of Oregon join Democrats on key issues , Republicans are neutralizing the issues .
Now these senators can head home and brag that they stood up to Republican leaders in Washington and voted to save Medicare from cuts , to expand GI benefits and to help out in the housing crisis .
Republican leadership aides point to the fact that the GOP has been unified on its top two issues right now : national security and energy .
“ On energy , you ’ve seen Democrats coming over to our side and not the other way around , ” said McConnell spokesman Don Stewart .
“ On national security , it ’s the Democrats who have been doing the jailbreak . ”
On the last major national security vote — the expansion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — it was the Democrats who were divided , with 21 voting for the bill and 28 voting against it .
The Democratic leadership stuck together in opposition .
For Republicans , the next opportunity for independence will come by the end of this week , when the Senate takes its final votes on the oil speculation bill .
Although the GOP leadership has been whipping energy votes generally , this one puts Republicans in a difficult spot : between voting for a measure they do n’t much like —
Republicans want a broader bill that includes drilling , conservation and electric car production — or risking being tagged as a friend of Big Oil .

Ministers face a legal dilemma in the wake of the Law Lords ' ruling A Law Lords ruling making anonymous witnesses in court illegal has left ministers urgently seeking to change the law .
Until then , those who have committed serious crimes could walk free .
For once , the government is grappling with a legal problem which is not the result of the Human Rights Act .
Yet , ironically , remedying it could put it into headlong conflict with one of the cherished provisions of the European Human Rights Convention - the right to a fair trial .
This is the dilemma which ministers face if they are to fulfil their pledge to legislate to allow witnesses in criminal trials to give evidence anonymously .
It is , on the face of it , surprising that such a long - established principle of English common law - that a defendant should be confronted by his accuser - has been eroded over the last 15 years or so with so little comment .
Even at the height of the troubles in Northern Ireland , where violent intimidation was widespread , witness anonymity was rejected as a way forward .
But under pressure from police and prosecution looking for every available measure to tackle organised crime and breach the " wall of silence " which surrounds many murders and gang attacks , judges have begun to look more favourably on so - called " special measures " for witnesses .
Key witnesses
This trend has been buttressed by three pieces of legislation - in 1988 , 1999 and 2003 - which have widened the statutory grounds for imposing such measures .
Diana Ellis QC , who defends in many murder trials , has watched this development with mounting concern .
In some cases , where the evidence is not crucial to the prosecution , anonymity may be acceptable
Diana Ellis QC
" At one time , even if the name of a witness was withheld from the wider public , it would be made available to the defendant and counsel .
" But , increasingly , potential witnesses are demanding complete anonymity as a condition of testifying .
And , in many cases , judges are granting it . "
And it is not only in murder trials .
Animal rights and drugs prosecutions have also benefited from measures designed to protect the identity of key witnesses .
And many anti-social behaviour orders have been imposed only because anonymous and hearsay testimony is permissible .
Parliamentary role Senior police officers are warning that as many as 40 trials may be affected by the lords ' ruling but , in truth , the use of anonymity and protective measures has permeated the culture of the criminal justice system , especially under the present government , in a way which will not be easy to roll back .
So , can the government legislate swiftly , as it has promised ?
Faced with similar problems , the governments of New Zealand and the Netherlands have done so and one of the law lords , Lord Carswell , thought it would be possible for Parliament to prescribe how anonymity should operate .
But Diana Ellis sees difficulties .
" How do you legislate to prevent an unfair trial ?
" In some cases , where the evidence is not crucial to the prosecution , anonymity may be acceptable .
" In others , it clearly is not .
But it must be up to the judge to decide the parameters .
" And just as judges have followed ' fashion ' by becoming more permissive of anonymity , perhaps this shock to the system will make them less receptive to it . "
In the meantime , there will quite probably be people walking free who have committed serious crimes - whether because trials are stayed or convictions overturned - and that has grave implications for the whole of society .

What are these ?
Crude oil is down for a third straight session today and natural gas is tumbling for the seventh time in nine sessions .
Maybe it ’s still wishful thinking to believe that the energy bull market has been broken , but the action in oil and gas stocks suggests that the thought has crossed the minds of more than a few investors .
How about this : Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. fell to a 52 - week low of $ 79.85 early today .
The stock has slumped 15 % from its recent peak of $ 94.56 on May 20 .
Chevron Corp. , off 88 cents to $ 85.51 at about 11 a.m. PDT today , has tumbled 17 % since peaking at $ 103.09 on May 20 .
The XOI index of 13 major energy stocks is down 1 % so far today , the eighth drop in nine sessions .
The index is off almost 20 % from its May high and is just about 3 % above its 52 - week low reached in August .
Energy - stock investors have racked up massive paper profits over the last five years , of course , so profit - taking should n’t be surprising at this point .
But the weakness in the stocks is underscoring the idea that record oil prices have done some serious damage to the global economy that may well loop back into sustained lower energy consumption .
Growth is slowing even in China , which on Wednesday said its economy expanded at an annualized rate of 10.1 % in the second quarter , compared with 11.9 % for all of 2007 .
Crude oil futures in New York were off $ 3.66 to $ 130.94 a barrel at about 11 a.m. PDT .
They ’ve fallen almost 10 % from the record high of $ 145.29 on July 3 .
Natural gas is off 87 cents to $ 10.53 per million British thermal units today .
Gas has plummeted 22 % from its recent peak of $ 13.58 , also reached on July 3 .

So what ’s up with our Sun ?
Is it going through a depression ?
It seems as if our closest star is experiencing a surprisingly uneventful couple of years .
Solar minimum has supposedly passed and we should be seeing a lot more magnetic activity , and we certainly should be observing lots more sunspots .
Space weather forecasts have been putting Solar Cycle 24 as a historically active cycle … but so far , nothing .
So what ’s the problem ?
Is it a ticking bomb , waiting to shock us with a huge jump in solar activity , flares and CMEs over a few months ?
Or could this lack of activity a prelude to a very boring few years , possibly leading the Earth toward another Ice Age ?
It ’s funny .
Just as we begin to get worried that the next solar maximum is going to unleash all sorts of havoc on Earth ( i.e. NASA ’s 2006 solar storm warning ) , scientists begin to get concerned as to whether there is going to be a solar maximum at all .
In a conference last week at Montana State University , solar physicists discussed the possibility that the Sun could be facing a long period of calm , leading to the concern that there could be another Maunder Minimum .
The Maunder Minimum ( named after the late 19th Century solar astronomer Edward W. Maunder , who discovered the phenomenon ) was a 17th Century , 30 - year period when very few sunspots were observed on the disk of the Sun .
It is thought by many scientists that this period contributed to what became known as the “ Little Ice Age ” here on Earth .
As the Sun provides Earth with all its energy , during extended periods when the solar output is lower than average , it seems possible a lack of sunspots on the Sun ( i.e. low activity ) may be linked with periods of cold down here .
“ It continues to be dead .
That ’s a small concern , a very small concern . ” – Saku Tsuneta , National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and program manager for the Hinode solar mission .
However , solar physicists are not too worried about this possibility , after all , it ’s only been two years since solar minimum .
Although activity has been low for the beginning of Cycle 24 , sunspots have not been non-existent .
In January of this year , a newborn spot was observed , as expected , in high latitude regions .
More spots were seen in April .
In March , sunspots from the previous solar cycle even made an appearance , putting on an unexpected show of flares and coronal mass ejections ( CMEs ) .
As pointed out by David Hathaway , a solar physicist at NASA ’s Marshall Space Flight Center , the fact that sunspots have already been observed in this new cycle means that it is highly unlikely we face anything as extreme as another Maunder Minimum .
Hathaway says there is nothing unusual about having a relatively understated solar cycle after several particularly active cycles .
Solar Cycle 23 was a very active period for the Sun with a greater than average number of sunspots observed on the solar surface .
It appears there are two different predictions for the activity level of the next solar cycle .
On the one hand we have scientists that think this cycle might be below average , and on the other hand we have scientists who believe the next cycle will be the biggest yet .
We certainly have a long way to go before we can begin making any accurate solar forecasts …

Cinderella 's slippers : glass or squirrel fur ?
I 'm a huge fan of Snopes .
And Cinderella's " glass slipper " is one of the most striking and absurdly effective details in the whole history of storytelling .
So it 's with a heavy heart that I must now register some doubt about Snopes ' defense of the glass slipper against the claim that it 's actually a linguistic mistake for an original fur slipper :
Claim : Cinderella 's slippers were made of fur in the original versions of the fairy tale , but they became glass slippers in later versions as the result of a mistranslation .
Status : False .
This came up in conversation a few days ago , so I looked into it a bit .
And alas , though mistranslation is not the culprit , it seems pretty clear to me that the slippers must originally have been fur , and turned into glass through a misunderstanding .
Snope 's discussion of the point is clear and well researched , as usual :
The standard explanation for Cinderella 's famous footwear is that it is the result of a mistranslation , someone having mistaken pantoufle de vair , fur slipper , for pantoufle de verre , glass slipper , when making an English version of Charles Perrault 's Histoires ou contes du temps passé avec des moralités ( 1697 ) .
( The title of Perrault 's collection — in English , Stories or Tales of Olden Times with Morals — also is known as Tales of My Mother Goose , after a line that appears on the frontispiece of the original , Contes de ma mère l'oye . )
The principal difficulty with the standard explanation is that pantoufle de verre appears in Perrault 's original text , so this is definitely not a question of mistranslation .
Nor does it seem to be a case of mishearing , with Perrault writing verre for vair when transcribing an oral account , since vair , a medieval word , was no longer used in his time .
( Vair , variegated fur , from the Latin varius , varied , also is a root of miniver , originally menu vair , small vair , which referred initially to the fur — perhaps squirrel — used as trim on medieval robes and later was applied to the prized ermine , or winter weasel fur , on the ceremonial robes of peers . )
Indeed , the original text of Perrault 's tale " Cendrillon ou la petite pantoufle " does use pantoufles de verre ( " glass slippers " ) not once but three times ( see below ) , so it 's clearly neither a mistranslation nor a ( simple ) misprint .
However , the argument against mishearing seems to me to be extremely weak .
Though I 'm not any sort of expert in the history of French , a bit of poking around on Gallica suggests that vair was still used to describe a glamorous and valuable kind of squirrel fur , in the context of talk about the olden days , quite a bit later than 1697 .
If the word had indeed gone out of everyday usage , then that creates exactly the sort of context in which a creative mishearing would be likely .
Specifically , in the Analyse raisonnée de l'histoire de France by François - René de Chateaubriand ( 1768 -1848 ) , a discussion of medieval society says that
Les chevaliers prenaient les titres de don , de sire , de messire et de monseigneur .
Ils pouvaient manger à la table du roi ; eux seuls avaient le droit de porter la lance , le haubert , la double cotte de mailles , la cotte d'armes , l'or , le vair , l'hermine , le petit - gris , le velours , l'écarlate ; ils mettaient une girouette sur leur donjon ; cette girouette était en pointe comme les pennons pour les simples chevaliers , carrée comme les bannières pour les chevaliers - bannerets .
and a description of Edward 's invasion of France explains that
Rien n'échappa , par mer et par terre , aux ravages de ce monarque , qui se disait roi des Français , et qui venait pour régner sur des Français ; par mer , tous les vaisseaux , depuis le plus grand navire jusqu'à la plus petite barque , furent pris et réunis à la flotte anglaise ; par terre , toutes les villes et les villages furent saccagés et brûlés .
Barfleur succomba la première , et , quoiqu'elle se fût rendue sans coup férir , elle n'en fut pas moins pillée elle perdit or , arpent et chers joyaux ; il se trouva si grande foison de richesses , que compagnons n'avoient cure de draps fourrés de vair .
Here are the contexts in Perrault where " pantoufles de verre " is used :
( 1 ) ... sa maraine ne fit que la toucher avec sa baguette , et en même tems ses habits furent changez en des habits de drap d' or et d' argent , tout chamarrez de pierreries ; elle luy donna ensuite une paire de pantoufles de verre , les plus jolies du monde .
( 2 ) Elle se leva , et s' enfüit aussi legerement qu ' auroit fait une biche .
Le prince la suivit , mais il ne put l' attraper .
Elle laissa tomber une de ses pantoufles de verre , que le prince ramassa bien soigneusement .
Cendrillon arriva chez elle , bien essouflée , sans carosse , sans laquais , et avec ses méchans habits , rien ne lui estant resté de toute sa magnificence qu ' une de ses petites pantoufles , la pareille de celle qu ' elle avoit laissé tomber .
( 3 ) Quand les deux soeurs revinrent du bal , Cendrillon leur demanda si elles s' estoient encore bien diverties , et si la belle dame y avoit esté ; elles luy dirent que oüy , mais qu ' elle s' estoit enfuye lorsque minuit avoit sonné , et si promptement qu ' elle avoit laissé tomber une de ses petites pantoufles de verre , la plus jolie du monde ; que le fils du roy l' avoit ramassée , et qu ' il n ' avoit fait que la regarder pendant tout le reste du bal , et qu ' assurément il estoit fort amoureux de la belle personne à qui appartenoit la petite pantoufle .
Note that the OED glosses vair as
A fur obtained from a variety of squirrel with grey back and white belly , much used in the 13th and 14th centuries as a trimming or lining for garments .
while the Dictionnaire de l'Académie Française ( Huitième Édition , 1932 - 35 ) has
VAIR . n. m .
Il se disait autrefois d'une Fourrure blanche et grise .
Un manteau , des pantoufles de vair .
Il ne s'emploie aujourd ' hui qu'en termes de Blason , pour désigner
Une des fourrures de l'écu , figurée par de petites cloches alternées d'azur et d'argent , disposées de telle sorte que la pointe des pièces d'azur est opposée à la pointe des pièces d'argent .
Tel porte de vair .
The fr.wikipedia entry for Cendrillon says that
Beaucoup de gens affirment que la pantoufle de Cendrillon était de vair et non pas de verre .
L'édition de 1697 des contes de Charles Perrault s'intitule bien " la pantoufle de verre " , donnée traditionnelle dans le folklore , puisqu'on retrouve des pantoufles de verre ou cristal dans les contes catalans , écossais , irlandais .
Il n'empêche que Balzac et Littré voulaient , au nom de la raison , corriger cette graphie en vair ( petit - gris , écureuil ) .
Cendrillon irait alors danser en chaussures fourrées .
Cette correction n'apporte cependant pas toute satisfaction , car outre que l'on ne fourra jamais par le passé de petit - gris des chaussures , de tels souliers ne semblent pas adaptés à la danse .
Sagement , il faut conserver ces poétiques et merveilleuses pantoufles de verre .
[ Update : Chris Waigl argues for a different conclusion :
... this seems to be a case of erudition run wild .
Balzac 's and Littré's ( a nineteenth - century man of letters , author of an important dictionary ) , to be precise .
They stipulated the verre / vair confusion .
But " pantouffles de verre " ( though in various spellings ) are in Perrault 's tale , and also in Catalan , Irish and Scottish versions .
The Grimm brothers ' has golden slippers -- not much better than glass , I 'd think , to dance in all night .
Wikipedia tells me that there are over 400 versions from all over the world , the oldest from China .
I 'm not entirely convinced .
The fact that the Grimm bros . have " golden slippers " resonates with de Chateaubriand 's observation that only knights " avaient le droit de porter ... l'or , le vair , l'hermine , le petit - gris , le velours , l'écarlate " ( " had the right to wear gold , vair , ermine , gray squirrel fur , velvet , scarlet " ) .
Note that " glass " is not on the list ( though in fairness , I guess that glass was also a luxury item in medieval times ) .
And I wonder what the collection date of the Catalan , Irish and Scottish versions is .
I believe that there has been much more diffusion of folk tale details in recent centuries than is commonly assumed .
Unless the other versions are from the era of 1700 -- which seems unlikely , since the collection of such tales was more typically a late 18th or 19th - century activity -- it seems as just as likely that Perrault 's invention spread to other cultures as that there was a common pre-Perrault source for the idea of " glass slippers " .
I 'm sympathetic to fr.wikipedia 's conclusions that " il faut conserver ces poétiques et merveilleuses pantoufles de verre " : " we need to preserve these poetic and marvelous glass slippers . "
At this point , though , their survival is guaranteed .
The small question in front of us is how they were born . ]
[ Update # 2 : Trevor suggests that the slippers were really amber !
DH Green ( Language and History in the Early Germanic World ) notes that both Pliny and Tacitus used glaesum / glesum to refer to amber , despite being aware of the difference in manufacture between it and glass .
This conscious confusion was based on the transparency of both materials , and in the competition between products manufactured thereof–native beads and Roman glass objects .
The relevance of this is to be found a while later in L0 pe de Vega ’s La Dorotea .
Published in 1632 , 65 years before Perrault , it recreates the author ’s passionate and disastrous fling with actress Elena Osorio in the early 1580s and has the heroine worrying of having to trade in her amber slippers for crudely bound sandals ( “ Si don Bela quiere , tú verás estos pies que celebrabas trocar las zapatillas de ámbar en groseras sandalias de cordeles ” ) .
Similarly , Quevedo in El mundo por de dentro ( 1612 ) has amber slippers being used to disguise sweaty feet ( “ a veces los pies disimulan el sudor con las zapatillas de ámbar ” ) .
Amber slippers were still available in Regency England , and are evoked in contemporary advertising for Miss Natasha Perfume ( “ this princess of perfumes makes her way on Amber slippers and Lily négligés .
A warm and slow burning temptress that stands on her own ” ) .
I , too , have made my way on lily négligés and hope one day to acquire a pair of amber slippers , which must surely have been what Cinderella aspired to wear .
Too bad her fairy godmother skimped and gave her the cheaper , glass alternative .
I 'm impressed by the quotations from Pliny , Tacitus , Lope de Vega and Quevado .
And I certainly wish Trevor well in his quest to complete his wardrobe .
But I wonder whether those Regency slippers had any real connection with the hard translucent fossil resin , rather than being merely amber in color .
After all , the same outfit features an " amber crape dress " and a " dami- turban formed of plain amber satin " .
And I'm I 'm just a bit skeptical that slippers carved from actual fossil amber would stand up to dancing with or without foot sweat . ]

With gasoline prices high and rising , a new financial milestone has arrived : the $ 100 tank of gas .
Bryan Carisone , a heating and air - conditioning contractor in Raritan , N.J. , “ absolutely loves ” his new GMC Denali XL , an extra - large sport utility vehicle with televisions built into the leather seats .
But in June , one week after he bought it , he pulled into a station on a near - empty tank and watched the total climb higher and higher  to $ 109 .
“ It just about killed me , ” Mr. Carisone said .
For decades , the $ 100 barrel stood as a hypothetical outlier in doom - and - gloom conversations about future oil prices .
And nobody could even imagine an American family paying $ 100 to fill the tank .
But the future is here .
Oil passed $ 100 a barrel in January and now seems headed toward $ 150 a barrel .
Gasoline prices surpassed $ 4 a gallon on June 8 , stalled for a while , and have been rising again in recent days , setting a record Saturday .
By late spring , owners of pickups and sport utility vehicles with 30 - gallon tanks , like the Cadillac Escalade ESV and Chevrolet Suburban , started paying $ 100 or more to fill a near - empty tank .
As gas prices continue to rise  the national average stood at about $ 4.10 a gallon Saturday  membership in the triple - digit club is growing .
Now , even not - so - gargantuan Toyota Land Cruisers and GMC Yukons can cost $ 100 to fill up .
What Does China
Think ?
Mark Leonard
Public Affairs , 2008
164 pp .
What does China think ?
Americans are n’t known for their international sophistication , especially when it comes to complex foreign issues .
And there are few more complicated issues than the so - called rise of China .
Almost everything you read about China is true , one of my friends opines , and he ’s right .
This ancient and fascinating nation has joined the international community with a dramatic flourish , and no one really knows where the so - called rise of China is going to lead .
But without doubt the end of this century is going to look very different from the start , and much of that difference is going to reflect the enhanced influence if not dominance of China  culture , wealth , foreign policy , and military capability .
Mark Leonard has produced a thin but important book .
For he asks the question , what are the Chinese themselves saying about China ’s rise ?
He finds no unanimity among leading intellectuals .
In an admittedly cursory review of a complex kaleidoscope of views , he explores economic and political philosophies of both " right " and " left , " as well as foreign policy views ranging between hard - line nationalist and squishy internationalist .
His work suggests two important conclusions .
The first is that the People ’s Republic of China is more open and less doctrinaire than often thought in the West .
The authoritarian Communist Party rules , but how it rules is not preordained .
The existence of an intellectual debate within the PRC does n’t necessarily mean a more liberal outcome , however .
The Chinese left , as it were , looks more traditionally socialist , though without the murderous madness of totalitarianism .
The second point is that similar forces are contending for control of Chinese foreign policy .
This obviously is n’t the first time that Beijing has been rife with factions .
But just as the West is wondering where China is going , the PRC is debating where it should go .
Again , the result wo n’t necessarily please the U.S. , and especially the neoconservatives who imagine permanent American hegemony everywhere , including in East Asia .
Yet these internal differences dramatically demonstrate that China ’s era of paramount political leadership is over .
A colorless bureaucratic and collective leadership is n’t likely to suddenly implement Westminster - style parliamentary democracy and Western - style free speech , but it also is likely to be cautious in expanding Chinese influence abroad .
This could change , of course , but no new Mao Zedong appears to be poised on the horizon .
All of this matters because China matters .
It seems like a lifetime ago when the Berlin Wall fell and we were told History Had Ended .
The U.S. and the Western model were going to be everywhere triumphant , and the world was about to enter a new halcyon age of democratic capitalism .
Those were the days !
That world has ended .
The U.S. and Europe have diverged on key questions .
Moreover , writes Mark Leonard , of the European Council of Foreign Relations , " The Russian credo of ‘ Sovereign Democracy ’ and the Islamist dream of theocratic rule already pose a serious challenge , even if they may yet turn out to be temporary phenomena . "
But the big cahuna , the potential peer competitor , the likely world - changer , is " China , with its vast size , its economic dynamism , and the political skill of its leaders that is the most serious contender for the global leadership in the long term , " Leonard explains .
China the state still faces enormous pitfalls  social unrest , economic instability , political struggle .
But China the culture and China the people have before been great and almost certainly again will be great , whatever the national context of their achievements .
What they will achieve , however , is not so clear .
The first major theme , which accounts for the first half of the book , is that the PRC ’s acceptance of Western - and American - style globalization is by no means unanimous .
Leonard writes : " A growing body of Chinese thinkers believe that since their country crawled out of the chaos of the Cultural Revolution , it has simply replaced the shadow of Maoism with another fundamentalist philosophy : the cult of the United States of America . "
That might seem unreal to Americans , who criticize China ’s human rights practices , worry about Chinese economic competition , and look askance at Beijing ’s military build - up .
But Leonard talks with nationalists who propagate a philosophy which he terms a " Walled World . "
The first part of this view is a return to socialism , or at least a planned economy .
So - called " New Left " intellectuals denounce Beijing for being despotic while failing to govern : " almost all of the problems hampering China ’s reforms  corruption , overheating of the economy , bad investment , non-performing loans , low levels of domestic consumption and growing inequality  had come about because the central government was too weak , rather than too strong , " writes Leonard .
Indeed , he makes an important point often lost in the West .
While there were students and intellectuals in Tiananmen Square demanding political reform , they were joined by " a wider group of workers who came to the square with more concrete social and economic demands triggered by mounting discontent about the radical market reforms of 1988 which had set off rocketing inflation and inequality . "
These protestors were , if anything , anti-globalization and anti-Westernization , rather like some of the opponents of globalization in Europe and elsewhere .
There have always been intellectuals in favor of economic collectivism .
More surprising is the rise of an anti-democracy movement among the intelligentsia .
In the early reform years , intellectuals debated the usual political reforms involving multi-party elections and constraints on government .
For many intellectuals today , however , writes Leonard , " Reform is less seen through the prism of human rights and freedom , than the question of how to increase the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party .
Instead of trying to develop a Chinese variant of liberal democracy , many intellectuals are looking for a different model altogether . "
That an expanding urban elite might fear a peasant - dominated democracy should surprise no one , and the equation of democracy with chaos is not unique to China .
But just as the PRC might very well fall short of Western - style capitalism , so it might fall short of Western - style democracy .
China has changed much and will continue to change .
However , it is possible that the world ’s dominant power will eventually be proudly authoritarian and modestly collectivist , rather than liberal democratic and largely capitalist .
The impact on the rest of the globe of such a phenomenon likely would be profound .
How so is the subject of the final section of What does China Think ?
What kind foreign policy is China likely to conduct ?
The Chinese " must be the most self - aware rising power in history , " Leonard writes .
This might be why they have worked so hard to underplay their influence , at times sounding almost obsequious in emphasizing the PRC ’s " peaceful rise . "
This , in turn , Leonard contends , " provoked a counter - attack from the assertive nationalists in Beijing ’s universities , " whom he terms the " neo-comms . "
This faction is the equivalent of America ’s militaristic neocons .
Leonard quotes one Chinese professor as dismissing the internationalists as appeasers .
While China should do all it can to avoid war , Yan Xuetong " argues that no great nation in history ever rose in peace . "
Neither of these ideological camps appears to be ascendant .
As in America , there are pragmatists in the PRC as well .
Moreover , Beijing is watching the U.S. and learning from its experience .
Ironically , at a time when American neocons dismiss the importance of " soft power , " China is ramping up its campaign to gain influence through cultural and economic means .
This does n’t mean military power is irrelevant to the PRC .
Far from it .
But while American neocons want to spend whatever it takes , however many trillions of dollars , to preserve America ’s ability to rule the globe , the Chinese have embarked on a far cheaper strategy to prevent permanent U.S. hegemony .
Writes Leonard :
" While [ Rear Admiral ]
Yang Yi rarely misses an opportunity to argue for increasing Chinese military spending , he does not want Beijing to get into an arms race with the USA .
It has become a truism in Chinese circles that the former Soviet Union spent itself into oblivion by being lured into a competition for military primacy .
So rather than trying to match the USA ’s military machine plane for plane and bomb for bomb , the Chinese approach is to go for an ‘ asymmetrical ’ strategy of finding and exploiting the enemy ’s soft spots .
‘ Asymmetrical warfare ’ has been voguish in Western military circles for a long time .
It has traditionally been used to describe how terrorists can take on and defeat standing armies , in the same way that David took out Goliath .
However , the Chinese have taken this debate far beyond the techniques of terrorism .
Chinese intellectuals and military planners have created a cottage industry of devising strategies for defeating a ‘ technologically superior opponent ’ ( their preferred euphemism for the USA ) . "
This puts the U.S. in an exquisite dilemma .
Spend wildly , as proposed by the neocons , to try to maintain the overwhelming military edge necessary to successfully intervene along the PRC ’s borders ?
Or accept that Washington no longer can dictate to Beijing ?
China is likely to be a particularly effective competitor because it is sophisticated and takes a long view .
Just as the West wants to " manage " the PRC ’s rise , Beijing wants to " manage " the West ’s decline , argues Leonard .
While we do n’t know where it will all lead , China ’s growing role as an alternative model has helped stall the drive towards Western universalism .
The point is not just that one - fifth of the world ’s population may be embarked on a very different course .
But , suggests Leonard , " The story of the next thirty years will be about how a more self - confident China reaches out and shapes the world . "
We already see the PRC ’s influence at work in such countries as Burma , Sudan , and Zimbabwe , and the result is n’t pretty .
For Beijing does not share the West ’s abhorrence of autocracy .
As unsettling as is Leonard ’s thesis , it does have at least one positive conclusion  for the West , at least .
If the 21st Century is the Chinese Century , that does not mean Chinese dominance so much as shared dominance along with America and Europe .
American and European power inevitably will recede , but the West ’s influence will live on for many years .
" Beijing ’s ascent has already changed the balance of economic and military power , and is now changing the world ’s ideas about politics , economics and order , " writes Leonard .
And it is doing so by offering an alternative geopolitical model .
The rise of this China  as opposed to the China that was supposed to arise , a capitalist and democratic disciple of the West  will pose an enormous challenge to the established order .
The outcomes are unpredictable and not necessarily benign .
But peaceful accommodation is possible , so long as Washington , in particular , recognizes that the so - called unipolar moment is quickly passing , and there may soon be two " essential " nations .

Advertisement A mother who wanted to give a birthday cake to her son featuring a photo of him as a baby was forced to have it censored because it showed his bottom .
Gail Jordan , 41 , had gone to Asda in Liscard , Wirral , on 13 June with the photo of her 21 - year - old son David taken when he was five months old .
Staff at the supermarket refused to scan the picture onto a cake as it featured nudity .
They eventually printed the image onto the icing with a star over the bottom .
Mrs Jordan , of Rock Ferry , said : " I took the photo of my son to the store in Liscard and they said we can't do that - it 's nudity .
" It was a photo of my son at five - months - old .
I could not believe it .
A star was put on the picture to cover baby David 's bottom " Eventually another member of staff cut a star out and put it on his bottom on the cake .
" I just wanted a picture on his cake .
Staff said it was deemed as pornographic .
" I do n't normally shop there , but it would not stop me going back . "
She added that her son was embarassed by the debacle but liked his cake .
A spokesman for Asda said : " We did not say it was pornographic .
It is policy across the board that we do n't do nudity of any sort at any age .
It is nothing new .
" They ( the staff ) made a couple of suggestions - enlarge it so you take the bottom out of it , make the border different and another suggestion was putting a star on the offending area . "
Read a selection of your comments on this story : I had the same experience with Asda in Chatham , my son's photo was when he was about 2 yrs but they refused to put it on the cake as he had NO pants on , I had to use another photograph with him with clothes on or they would refuse .
Not due to pornography but due to unsavoury characters ( paedophiles ! )
Christine Sandmann , Gillingham , Kent I took a photo of my son when he was 10 months old - naked on a rug - to Asda in Boston and had no problem getting it printed onto a birthday cake , so it must depend on the area you live at .
Mrs Lyon , Spalding , Lincs .
I experienced exactly the same problem with an Asda in Norfolk .
I was trying to arrange a cake for my Fathers 50th birthday and took along my " embarrassing " baby photo for the cake .
When I presented the photo to the bakery they told me they would not put the picture on as it showed his bottom .
I had to go home and actually choose a different picture for the cake as they completely refused to put the picture on !
It was n't a rude picture and was just one of him as a baby lying on his front .
I was completely shocked when they refused to put the picture on and when it came to my mothers birthday I found another supermarket to do the cake instead .

I took a photo of a painting of a mermaid that I saw in an art gallery window .
The painting was of a topless mirmaid .
When I took the memory stick to WalMart they refused to print the mermaid image because it showed nudity .
The image was of a painting , not a real person .
I agree that pornographic images can not be tolerated in commercial retail enviournments , but not all nudity is pornographic and situational dicretion should be allowed to be used , rather than a blanket ban caused by fear of litigation .
Lisa Lessware , London I was working for a company and it was coming up to its birthday celebrations .
So we went to Sainsbury 's in our uniforms with our name tags and were promptly told we couldnt have the stores name and logo on the cake as it was copywritten .

It was a friends 40th birthday at work last year and we wanted to have a cake done also .
i made a picture of her so it looked like George Clooney was hugging her and they would n't do it either because they didnt have his permission !
Can you believe it - after I made a fuss in the store they finally agreed .
Nick , Oldbury , West Midlands
About 7 months ago , soon after our baby was born , we went along to an art exhibition in London .
The exhibition was about the portrayal of sex in art over the years .
We went mid afternoon , the baby was about 1 month old and fast asleep .
We were told we could n't go in with the baby because due to the nudity depicted in the exhibition !
Gobsmacked we were .
The baby could n't even focus , let alone be corrupted and subsequently scarred for life by grubby images .
Get a grip people !

My mother once took some photos to a chemist ( the days before digital ! ) and they said they would make the photographs up because there was 2 pictures of my brother and sister in the bath ( at around 1 and 2 , respectively ) .
The rest were all of our holiday snaps - the whole family just relaxing on the beach or in a restaurant .
It clearly was n't sinister .
Ca n't for the life of me remember which chemists it was ?...
Owen Moone , Milton Keynes , UK " Another suggestion was putting a star on the offending area . "
Are they mad ?
Has common sense been totally lost ?
One can only sigh ...

This ties well with your article - Adults ' scared to go near kids ' - no wonder with an attitude like this
Christophe , Edinburgh Personally , I think it 's a good thing the staff had considered the implications of using such a photo .
It IS nudity after all ( although of a baby ) , nude is nude .
The fact that they had discussed it with the customer and had confirmed it is okay to use is a good thing , the store does n't want any law - breaking or offensive acts , it is just being careful since it is a family - friendly store .
Chilli , Cardiff , Wales
This country is a joke .
We have no problem letting our kids wander the streets unmonitored until all hours , take drugs at 12 or 13 & allow girls to have sex & get pregnant before they are even old enough to leave school , but if a photo of a 5 month old baby 's bottom is put on a birthday cake we get all self - righteous & prudish about it .
It 's pathetic .

What are these ?
While you and I both would probably agree that pigs wallowing in mud may be a little bit dirty and we may think it is gross , pigs love wallowing in it .
In fact , for pigs , it is a necessity .
The reason I say this is because I just finished reading Glenn ’s piece titled Democrats ’ strategy : Strength through bowing : ”
Historians writing about the Bush era were given a great gift yesterday — an iconic headline that explains so much of what has happened in this country over the last seven years :
Their rationale for doing that is that it prevents the Republicans from depicting them as “ weak , ” because nothing exudes strength like bowing .
Here ’s more evidence of the brilliance of the Democratic strategy to show how “ strong ” and “ tough ” they are by bowing to Bush and all of his demands , from this morning ’s New York Times article by Eric Lichtblau …
At some point , it might be useful to decide if they are actually bowing at all , and that they , in fact , might actually support the things many of you all view as betrayals .
There really is no other reason for their behavior - no one is this weak ( when was the last time Pelosi faced a primary challenge from a credible opponent to the RIGHT of her ? ) .
No one is this incapable and unwilling of saying no to the least popular President of the modern era .
Why do they keep passing stuff like AUMF ?
Why will this piece of crap bill , agitating for a blockade of Iran ( an act of war , mind you ) , most likely pass ?
Why is the Department of Homeland Security seizing people ’s electronic devices , rifling through their personal belongings and private information without any reason and without so much as a peep out of Congress ?
At some point , it might be useful to recognize that where you and I see a wet pile of mud , Congress sees a cool and refreshing bath .
There is no other explanation .
Most recently scientists found a new species of jellyfish that is more than 3.5 metres long off the south coast of New Zealand , along with star fish up to a metre wide .
The first full - sized carcass of a colossal squid , a deep - sea monster four metres long , was revealed for the first time earlier this year .
Dr Charles Paxton , a fisheries statistician at the University of St Andrews , Scotland , said : " There are plenty of places these creatures could be hiding .
" They may spend their lives in the middle layers of the oceans and never surface or be in the deep sea canyons yet to be visited , and new discoveries are being made all the time under the Arctic ice cap . "
But for anyone hoping the results could mean that the Loch Ness Monster could still be found lurking in the depths of the famous Scottish loch , Dr Paxton has disappointing news .
He has carried out similar analysis for freshwater species and concluded that mankind has discovered all the large freshwater creatures there are to be found .
" There are small creatures being discovered all the time , but to find species that are more than two metres in length is very rare , " he said .
" Normally you would expect the rate of discovery of species in a habitat to level off when there are no more to be found , but with large sea creatures , the rates are still to level out , which suggests we have not found them all yet .
" Sadly for Nessie hunters , I do n't think there is anything hiding in the lochs and lakes of the world any more . "
He said that often legends about mythical sea creatures could be explained by real life monsters of the deep .
" A lot of the mythical sea creatures such as the Kraken and sea serpents can be explained by sightings of sea creatures and mammals that are already known . "
Although humans have been travelling on the oceans for thousands of years , scientists ' knowledge of life beneath the waves is still extremely limited .
Most species are only discovered when they are washed ashore or dredged up by fishing boats .
Deep sea exploration and underwater camera technology is now allowing scientists to explore areas that have previously been unattainable .
One of the least understood parts of the ocean is actually the midlayers , known as the twilight zone , between 100 and 1000 metres down .
Dr Richard Lampitt , an ecosystems expert from the National Oceanography Centre at Southampton University , said : " It is extremely likely that there will be species of significant size still to be discovered in the deep ocean .
" The twilight zone , where natural sunlight is extinguished , has not really been sampled properly so there will be large creatures to be found there too . "
A spokesman for the Marine Conservation Society added : " The mid-layers of the oceans are so unexplored and the sea floor is so massive that there are almost certainly some giants there that are still to be found .
" It makes a very strong case for protecting the oceans , particularly the high seas where not every country has signed up to international treaties . "

Coca -cola to phase out controversial chemical linked to hyperactivity and gene damage
Phase out : Coca cola is withdrawing the chemical sodium benzoate , which is used to stop fizzy drinks going mouldy
Soft drink giant Coca - Cola is phasing out a controversial additive that has been linked to hyperactivity and causing damage to DNA .
The chemical Sodium Benzoate , also known as E211 , is used to stop fizzy drinks going mouldy .
But recent research has shown that the chemical can deactivate parts of DNA , the genetic code in the cells of living creatures .
Coca -Cola said it was withdrawing the additive from Diet Coke in response to consumer demand for more natural products .
The move will mean that by the end of the year no can will contain E211 - and it plans to remove it from its other products as soon as possible .
But the company said at present it had not found a satisfactory alternative to replace the additive in some soft drinks with a higher juice content including Fanta and Dr Pepper .
Other fizzy drinks made by rival companies , such as Irn - Bru , Pepsi Max and Lucozade will continue to contain the additive .
While the chemical occurs naturally in some fruits , such as prunes , apples and cranberries , it is used in much greater strengths by the soft drinks industry .
Peter Piper , a professor of molecular biology research at Sheffield University found that the additive could switch off vital parts of DNA that could be linked to cirrhosis of the liver and Parkinson 's disease .
He has also called for further research into the chemical .
In combination with vitamin C ( CORR ) sodium benzoate can form a potentially cancer - causing substance , benzene .
However the government - backed Committee on Mutagenicity - which investigates whether chemicals cause cancer - has dismissed the research .
The panel argue that while Sodium Benzoate has been shown to be harmful to yeast cells , it argues that human cells are stronger .
But Professor Piper called the dismissal a ' whitewash ' that failed to take into account modern techniques of monitoring DNA damage .
Research by Southampton University found that sodium benzoate was one of seven additives - the six others being food colours - that can lead to hyperactivity .
The Food Standards Agency called for the six colours to be withdrawn from UK products - although sodium benzoate has been allowed to remain .
Coca - Cola said it had begun removing sodium benzoate from Diet Coke production in January .
A company spokesperson said : ' We are continuously looking at emerging trends and listening to our consumers thoughts about ingredients .
' For a number of years we have been moving towards non-artificial colours , flavours and preservatives where possible in our drinks .
' We are looking to phase out the use of sodium benzoate where technically possible . '
The company stressed that E211 was an approved additive by many worldwide bodies including the European Food Standards Agency .
A new publication answers centuries ' old questions regarding the mechanism and function of humour , identifying the reason humour is common to all human societies , its fundamental role in the evolution of homo sapiens and its continuing importance in the cognitive development of infants .
Alastair Clarke explains : " The theory is an evolutionary and cognitive explanation of how and why any individual finds anything funny .
Effectively it explains that humour occurs when the brain recognizes a pattern that surprises it , and that recognition of this sort is rewarded with the experience of the humorous response , an element of which is broadcast as laughter .
" By removing stipulations of content we have been forced to study the structures underlying any instance of humour , and it has become clear that it is not the content of the stimulus but the patterns underlying it that provide the potential for sources of humour .
For patterns to exist it is necessary to have some form of content , but once that content exists , it is the level of the pattern at which humour operates and for which it delivers its rewards . "
Previous theories have only ever applied to a small proportion of all instances of humour , many of them stipulating necessary content or social conditions either in the humour itself or around the individual experiencing it .
But this does n't explain why an individual can laugh at something when no one else around them does , nor why two people can laugh at the same stimulus for different reasons .
The theory further identifies the importance of pattern recognition in human evolution as Clarke explains : " An ability to recognize patterns instantly and unconsciously has proved a fundamental weapon in the cognitive arsenal of human beings .
The humorous reward has encouraged the development of such faculties , leading to the unique perceptual and intellectual abilities of our species . "
Clarke 's new theory of humour could also provide the basis for an increased understanding of human cognitive functions :
" The development of pattern recognition as displayed in humour could also form the basis of humankind 's instinctive linguistic ability .
Syntax and grammar function in fundamental patterns for which a child has an innate facility .
All that differs from one individual to the next is the content of those patterns in terms of vocabulary . "
Pattern Recognition
Theory also identifies a correlation between the development of humour and the development of cognitive ability in infants .
" Amusing childish games such as peek - a - boo , clap hands and tower block demolition all exhibit the precise mechanism of humour as it appears in any adult form , but whether these instances of infantile humour actively contribute to the cognitive development of the child or are simply a record of the evolution of the species played out in the individual , is as yet unclear .

" Peek - a - boo can elicit a humorous response in infants as young as four months , and is , effectively , a simple process of surprise repetition , forming a clear , basic pattern .
As the infant develops , the patterns in childish humour become more complex and compounded and attain spatial as well as temporal elements until , finally , the child begins to grapple with the patterns involved in linguistic humour . "
Alastair Clarke identifies the implications of pattern recognition theory beyond anthropology .
" Understanding the basic function and mechanism of humour as it begins in infants will benefit the ongoing research into the presence of humour in primates and other mammals . "
He goes on to propose possible technological developments : " Now that we understand the mechanism of humour the possibility of creating an artificial intelligence being that could develop its own sense of humour becomes very real .
This would , for the first time , create an AI capable of exhibiting one of the defining characteristics that make us human , making it seem significantly less robotic as a result . "
Alastair Clarke offers two brief illustrations of the theory in instances of humour : " The application of the theory is unique in every instance and for every individual but the following two examples illustrate its basic structure .
A common form of humour is the juxtaposition of two pictures , normally of people , in whom we recognize a similarity .
What we are witnessing here is spatial repetition , a simple two - term pattern featuring the outline or the features of the first repeated in those of the second .
If the pattern is sufficiently convincing ( as in the degree to which we perceive repetition ) , and we are surprised by recognizing it , we will find the stimulus amusing .
" As a second example , related to the first but in a different medium , stand - up comedy regularly features what we might call the It 's so true form of humour .
As with the first example , the brain recognizes a two - term pattern of repetition between the comedian 's depiction and its retained mental image , and if the recognition is surprising , it will be found amusing .
The individual may be surprised to hear such things being talked about in public , perhaps because they are taboo , or because the individual has never heard them being articulated before .
The only difference between the two examples is that in the first the pattern is recognized between one photograph and the next , and in the second it occurs between the comedian 's depiction and the mental image retained by the individual of the matter being portrayed .
" Both of these examples use simple patterns of exact repetition , even if the fidelity of that repetition is poor ( for example if the photographs are only vaguely similar ) .
But pattern types can be surprisingly varied , including reflection , reversal , minification and magnification and so on .
Sarcasm , for example , functions around a basic pattern of reversal , otherwise known as repetition in opposites .
Patterns can also contain many stages , whereas the ones depicted here feature only two terms . "
Clarke concludes : " Pattern Recognition answers how and why we find things funny , but it can not say categorically what is funny since no content can be inherently more or less funny than any other .
The individual is of paramount importance in determining what they find amusing , bringing memories , associations , meta- meaning , disposition , their tendency to recognize patterns and their comprehension of similarity to the equation .
But the theory does offer a vital answer as to why humour exists in every human society . "
The Pattern Recognition Theory of Humour is published by Pyrrhic House .
This edition of the book presents the fundamentals of the theory for those who work in or comment on related fields .
The full - length book , Humour , which expands the explanation of the theory , including over 100 pages of analysis of examples of humour from Chaucer to Monty Python , will be published in October 2008 .

What better way to use all these vacuum tubes and ray guns than the formation of a pan-global mishmash of human cultures and customs ?
Politics , race relations and language barriers will finally be blended into a monotonous gray paste , for better or ( just as often ) worse .
Combining all of the worldâs countries into one monolithic mega - state not only presents a united front to alien invaders and cuts out all the hassle of a transparent government responsible to the people , it also saves the futureâs map and flag makers countless hours of work .

There is indeed a global , unified society that bridges all national boundaries and cultural differences , and youâre on it right now .

( Fortune ) -- Sean Knapp had it made .
As a young computer scientist , he could n't have had a better gig : working at Google , the engineer 's paradise .
He had all the usual perks - a massage every other week , onsite laundry , free all - you - can - eat haute cuisine .
Even better , he got to work on some of Google 's highest - profile products , including the search technology that is the heart and soul of the company .
And he made full use of his " 20 % time , " that famous one day a week that Google gives its engineers to work on whatever project they want .
A little over a year ago he and a couple of colleagues , brothers Bismarck and Belsasar Lepe , ages 28 and 21 , respectively , did what many of the young geniuses do at Google :
They came up with a cool idea , in this case a new way to handle Web video .
Then Knapp , who 's 27 , and the Lepes did something truly remarkable .
They expelled themselves from paradise to start their own company .
That sort of thing just does n't happen at Google - or it did n't used to anyway .
In April 2007 , when the trio informed Google they were leaving , they did n't give any specifics , just that they were going to do their own thing .
Without even knowing what their idea was , Google wanted them - and their project - to stay .
" They told us , ' Here 's a blank check , ' " recalls Knapp , a baby - faced former track star at Stanford .
" I said , ' You 're asking me to be a surrogate parent . ' "
Knapp and his pals would do the hard work , in other words , but Google would own the product .
Instead , off they went , leaving behind the perks , the 20 % time , and a combined seven - figure pile of unvested options .
( Google declined to comment on Knapp 's account . )
A year later the company the three founded , Ooyala , is precisely the kind of budding success Google wants to be creating inside its walls .
Ooyala 's 28 employees are building a system that runs videos for independent Web sites , and eventually they plan to sell video ads in the same way Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) hawks text ads for other web publishers .
The startup has raised $ 10 million in venture capital , which does n't even come close to matching Google 's resources .
But the Ooyala founders say what they lack in institutional backing they make up for in speed and the ability to communicate with one another by turning around in their chairs and talking .
Google was like that too , about eight years and 18,000 employees ago .
It would be easy to dismiss the exodus of some of Google 's best people if it were an isolated occurrence .
It is n't .
Paul Buchheit , an early Google engineer who coined the " Do n't be evil ! " battle cry , is a founder , with three ex-Google colleagues , of a social - networking company called FriendFeed .
Yanda Erlich , once a popular Google product manager , started an instant - messaging company called Mogad .
Nathan Stoll , who managed Google News , is hard at work on his new company , Mechanical Zoo .
( It 's in " stealth mode " - no details . )
Former business - development guys Salman Ullah and Sean Dempsey have a new venture capital firm , Merus Capital , that aims in part to fund startups founded by ex-Googlers .
( That 's employees , in Googlespeak . )
The departures have grown so numerous that the exiles have formed an informal alumni club of ex-Googlers turned entrepreneurs .
David Friedberg , another former biz - dev executive , who started a company called WeatherBill , which sells insurance pegged to climate risks , recently attended the club 's first meeting at a conference center in Palo Alto .
" I was surprised by the number of things that were being done that could have been done at Google , " he says .
There 's been an exodus of executive talent too :
Its chief information officer , Douglas Merrill , just left .
Several top people have gone to Facebook , most notably Sheryl Sandberg , who ran Google 's automated ad sales , and Elliot Schrage , who ran PR .
George Reyes , Google 's CFO , announced his retirement last summer and has yet to be replaced .
Employee turnover is the norm in Silicon Valley , especially at companies where early hires get rich enough to do whatever they want ( and post - jackpot hires do n't ) .
For his part , Google CEO Eric Schmidt - who left Sun Microsystems for Novell and then Novell for Google - brushes off the effects of all those departures .
" We 've been hiring on the order of 100 people a week , " he says .
" So in one week we hire more people than the people you just named . "
But fleeing executives and star engineers are n't the only challenges Google faces these days .
You may be thinking : Challenges ?
Google ?
The company that nets $ 1 billion - plus a quarter and is so powerful it even scares Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) ?
Yes , the very same .
Fact is , Google 's torrid growth is finally slowing , as the company 's sheer size dictates it must .
And size necessitates changes .
Gone are the days when Google could take full advantage of its quirkiness .
It 's the market leader now , which presents a classic conundrum :
Which is more important , process or innovation ?
For all Google 's success , it still has just one meaningful way of making money : its powerful search - advertising system .
It 's a gusher , but it 's the only one .
All the other projects it has in the works are just that , projects .
The mere hint that Google may have issues to deal with clearly hits a nerve .
As I was researching this article , Marc Benioff , the CEO of Salesforce.com ( CRM ) and a Google business partner , phoned to discuss an alliance his company had inked with Google .
I 'm always happy to hear from the voluble Benioff - except I had n't called him in the first place .
Someone " at the top " at Google had asked him to reach out to me .
" What they need to do is build a full portfolio of revenue , as Microsoft has , " says Benioff .
" They have a fantastic cash cow .
They need a goat and a chicken . "
More than diversification , though , Google has to prove that its quirks - its odd hiring practices ( e.g. , asking 45 - year - olds their GPAs ) , refusal to play the guidance game with Wall Street , the free food , etc. - will stand the test of time .
It has to show that its success is because of its Googleyness ( more Googlespeak ) , not despite it .
Even its friends harbor doubts .
" I 'm not convinced they 're in the ranks of GE or P&G or even Microsoft , for that matter , " says Peter Chernin , president of News Corp. , whose MySpace unit is a key Google partner .
" Not yet . "
A basic tenet of Google 's way of doing business is that it is not like other businesses .
Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin celebrated this quality in their famous letter to prospective shareholders before the company 's 2004 IPO , and they promised to keep things that way .
For example , Google 's operations themselves are unconventional .
One of the most fundamental precepts of modern management has to do with how to allocate resources : deciding which projects to pursue , where to spend money , when to take a pass .
In fact , MBAs learn in their first classes at business school that resource allocation is a manager 's most important task .
Yet it 's a concept that , while not exactly alien to Google 's top dogs , is n't their highest priority .
After all , why focus on allocating scarce resources when the resources are n't all that scarce ?
At the end of the first quarter Google had cash and other liquid assets of $ 12 billion ; it generates almost $ 2 billion of cash per quarter .
LOS ANGELES --
Two former NBA referees told ESPN on Thursday that federal investigators had questioned them about referee Dick Bavetta while conducting their probe into Tim Donaghy .
Former referee Hue Hollins said Thursday on ESPN's " Outside The Lines " that federal investigators " questioned me about Dick Bavetta more than they did about Tim Donaghy . "
" They wanted to know what I knew about Dick Bavetta in terms of holding calls , making sure this team wins , that team wins .
I said ' I never heard of that , and I did n't know anything about it , ' " Hollins said .
" When they called to interview me , I was again caught by surprise they asked so many questions about Bavetta .
I did n't know where they were going with that . "
Another ex-referee , who spoke to ESPN.com on the condition he not be identified , said federal investigators asked him about specific games Bavetta refereed and whether he had noticed anything peculiar about Bavetta 's actions .
NBA commissioner David Stern called a news conference prior to Game 4 of the NBA Finals and said he had no concerns about Bavetta .
Stern also said the league would reinterview all its officials , all of whom were asked in interviews with independent investigator Lawrence Pedowitz whether they had ever made a call based on anything other than the merits of the call itself .
The Pedowitz report has been in the league 's hands for several weeks , but the NBA has said it will not release the report until Donaghy is sentenced and that investigation is closed .
Stern answered " I do n't know " when asked how much Bavetta - related questioning had taken place during interviews between referees and federal investigators , although he acknowledged that the NBA was aware that questions were being asked about Bavetta .
In the 1920's , Carl Tanzler ( later known as Carl von Cosel ) emigrated from Germany to the the Florida Keys , in the United States , leaving behind a wife and two young daughters .
Von cosel had worked as an x-ray technician and inventor , barely making enough to get by , but claimed to be a former submarine skipper and owner of nine college degrees .
In 1934 , he found employment at a Key West hospital in the tuberculosis ward .
Shortly after bring his family to join him in Florida , he and his wife , Doris , separated .
Dr. Carl Von Cosel
A poor Hispanic 22 - year - old young woman , a former Cuban entertainer , Elena Hoyos , ( photo at right ) , was universally acknowledged to be a great beauty and Von Cosel , then working as a ward technician , was soon captivated , despite her rebuffs of his advances .
He quickly became determined to help Elena , even cure her , using unconventional methods .
There is was never any evidence of a romance between the young hispanic beauty and Von Cosel , but in his mind and will , he intended to rid her of the disease , with the ultimate aim of forming a lasting love attachment .
Her desperate family , knowing the severity of her illness , gave Von Cosel permission to try his unusual methods in an attempt to cure her .
The hospital staff was dubious but with his nine ' degrees ' and ocassional eccentric brilliance , they let him try his approach on Elena , knowing they could do nothing themselves to sabe her .
Using an odd mix of chemicals , herbs and even reportedly X - ray treatments , he attempted to stem the tide of her tuberculosis .
It was sort of a an early attempt at chemotherapy , but with untried methods .
Despite his efforts , Elena Hoyos died leaving Von Cosel despondent and once again , alone .
Von Cosel got permission from her family to build her a mausoleum .
There , Von Cosel used formaldehyde and other chemicals and spices to preserve the body , secretly visiting it nightly .
He had a key made that no one but her sister knew about .
The Hoyos 's trusted Von Cosel and since he seemed to love her in life ( even though it was an unrequited love ) , they were understanding of his fondness for visiting her grave .
They did not know he was inside attempting to preserve Elena .
Von Cosel paid for and built an above - ground burial vault which included a telephone so that he could communicate with her and a strange airship whose function he refused to state .
During these nightly visits , he would talk to Elena 's corpse and said later that one night he saw her ghost in the mausoleum .
He claimed she appeared to him from that time after every night and they would have long conversations and she expressed her love for him .
These nocturmal visitations continuted for two years until he lost his job at the hospital and moved to a remote shack .
But he was n't alone in his shack , for he had stolen Elena 's body from the mausoleum !
There he placed her body on a large bed , enough to sleep two , curtained with a cloth veil .
He continued his work on her decaying body as the chemicals could only delay her body from mouldering for so long .
He rubbed her entire body with strange oils and chemicals and then later had to reconstruct parts of her face with morticians wax to reform her features .
He later admitted to spending long pleasant nights talking to her and professing his love .
Not seeing Von Cosel outside Elena 's tomb for over seven years , her sister began to suspect something was amiss .
She notified the authorities and they searched her mausoleum only to find it empty .
Elena 's sister instantly knew who had taken her sister 's body and found Von Cosel 's shack and confronted him .
He kindly invited her inside , and to her horror , she saw what appeared be a wax dummy in the likeness of Elena laying on the bed .
He told her that he and Elena were happy and in love and invited her to come back again and visit .
The sister was livid and horrified and went to the police .
They came and took what they assumed to be a dummy to the local morgue to be autopsied .
The " dummy " ( pictured above left , from the autopsy ) was actually the long decayed corpse of Elena Hoyos ; her bones held together with piano wire , her skin had been treated with wax , her eye sockets filled with glass replacements , and she 'd been perfumed to mask the odor of decomposition .
This was terrible enough , but what the investigators found next was truly repulsive .
Von cosel had reconstructed many parts of her body , her eyes , nose , and most disturbingly , her vagina to which he added a tube that permitted sexual intercourse .
He had been having sexual intercourse with the corpse of Elena Hoyos for as many as eight years !
The case eventually went to trial where amazingly the majority of the public , especially women , were firmly behind Carl , seeing him as a man who loved a woman so much that he was unable to let her go .
In his confession he stated that he had planned to use the airship to take the both of them " high into the stratosphere , so that radiation from outer space could penetrate elena 's tissues and restore life to her somnolent form . " many people sympathized with von cosel after hearing his story and a latin love song was even composed based on the subject .
Von cosel was only imprisoned for a short time and elena 's body was buried in a metal cube which was buried in a secret location .
Before the burial there was another bizarre incident .
So much attention had been given in newpapers , press accounts and court records that the authorities thought it would be best to show the people Elena 's body before her secret burial .
[ shown here ] .
They placed her body , still grossly decayed and with a silken , waxy face , in a trailer cart and allowed the curious throngs to view her before her second burial .
One ten - year - old boy , now in his 60's , said ,
" I 've never been able to forget that sight .
It did n't even look like a human anymore .
So much reconstrution and decay .... it was the scariest thing I 've ever seen .
Her face was an odd white - ish color that looked more like a wax dummy than a womans face .
And she had horrible , black , staring , glass eyes .
I still dream about that sight . "
It seems that the press did not divulge the details of the necrophilia before showing her corpse and had the general public known about that aspect there probably would have been less sympathy for Von Cosel .
Declared sane , Von Cosel was not charged with a crime because the statute of limitations on grave robbing had expired .
Elena Hoyos was eventually buried at a secret location .
Von Cosel , separated from his love , used a death mask to create a life - sized dummy of her , and lived with it until his death in 1952 .

Are You Hiding From Your Dreams ?
Living Dreams
I love imagination , passion , and possibility .
Weave them together with a sprinkling of hope .
Dreams of a bright future will fill your heart and mind .
And dreams are the fuel that drives personal growth .
Do you think that you ’re too old to dream ?
Many people assume that only the young can dream .
Everyone has moments when they are filled with passionate dreams of the future .
For some of us those dreams flash and disappear , and are gone .
For others , the dreams are like the moon .
The dreams grow stronger , weaken , and then return .
Sometimes those dreams are sharp and alive .
They seem to surround us , and call to us .
At other times , those dreams are lost , buried , forgotten , or hidden .
Safety and Adventure
We have contradictory elements within us .
One side of us looks for the familiar .
It looks for familiar patterns among the world that greets our senses .
We want to connect today ’s world to yesterday ’s world .
We want to predict and control what happens to us .
This side of us makes us feel safe .
Another side of us swims in a sea of possibility .
We hunt for new patterns to taste , and explore .
We want to expand our world , and make it larger and larger .
This is the heart of all desire for freedom .
This side of us loves adventure .
It loves dreams , and lives on dreams .
This side of us makes us feel alive .
Perhaps the years you ’ve lived have weighed you down , and clouded your dreams .
But are your dreams really gone ?
No .
You ca n’t live without dreams , any more than you can live without air .
And , if you ’re only safe , you can never be free .
Getting Stuck
When our pain and fears and habits stand in the way of our dreams , we get stuck .
Most of us are stuck in one or many areas of our lives .
We have goals or dreams , but we ca n’t seem to make any progress toward them .
When we ca n’t connect with those dreams , they become another reminder that we ’re trapped , and the dreams lose their magic .
There are many ways to describe the feeling of being stuck :
resistance
trapped
enslaved
running in circles
life on hold
powerless
lifeless
small
old
It ’s easy , and natural to think of yourself and your life as something small .
Focus on the physical world that surrounds you .
You ’ll see a world of objects .
Objects fill a small place in space , and have a limited , predictable use .
It ’s easy to look at your body as just another object .
And you assume that your mind and heart and future must be similarly bound and limited .
This way of viewing the world comes from that part of us that wants the world to be small and predictable and safe .
But there ’s a price to be paid , when the drive for safety buries the dreams of the explorer .
The life drains away from the familiar , until it seems old and small and empty of life .
One of the reasons why we get caught up in looking for only safety is that we come to feel overwhelmed by change .
It ’s frightening when everything seems new .
You ’re overwhelmed by the endless possibility and you do n’t know what to do with it all .
You shut down , and look for a safe , familiar little corner to hide out in .
Safe Abundance
For most of us , our drive for safety has suppressed the drive for possibility .
We need to strike a balance between safety and possibility .
Let ’s try to reconnect with the explorer who is hunting for possibility .
There ’s another word that carries us to the world of possibility .
This word is popular in traditional religious works , as well as spiritual and new age works : abundance .
When we think of abundance , we think of rich possibility , but a possibility that is friendly and nurturing – a world of possibility that supports us fully in familiar ways , as well as offering pathways to new worlds .
Let ’s look into abundance a little deeper .
Look at how the idea of abundance enriches specific areas of our lives .
These pathways and directions add some structure to the possibility , and make it much less overwhelming .
Let ’s open ourselves to abundance in the following areas of our lives :
abundant vision of self
abundant learning , knowledge , and skills
abundant attitudes
abundant choices
abundant action
abundant relationships
abundant tools , objects , and space
abundant time , with abundant opportunity for growth & change
In later posts , we ’ll explore each of these in detail .
Massimo Gramellini su La Stampa di oggi :
Sono contento di essere un connazionale di Roberto Donadoni .
L’uscita di scena è il momento più difficile , sul palco come nella vita .
E questo bergamasco dalla faccia triste , cioè seria , che nel Paese delle macchiette non ha mai fornito materiale a una caricatura , ha saputo lasciare la panchina azzurra con dignità : senza un lamento e senza nemmeno passare alla cassa per la liquidazione .
La sua nazionale non ci ha mai divertito .
Ma , se è per questo , neanche quella che vinse l’ultimo campionato del mondo .
Ricordate la finale di Berlino contro i francesi ?
Fu una partita abbastanza orrenda , esattamente come il « quarto » di Vienna contro gli spagnoli .
L’unica differenza è che in Germania l’ottimo
De Rossi aveva segnato il suo rigore , mentre in Austria lo ha sbagliato .
E un altro lo ha sbagliato quel Di Natale che , giocando nell ’ Udinese , incarnava il nuovo corso ( già finito ) di un calcio aperto a tutti , dove anche i giocatori e i tifosi delle squadre meno ricche potessero sognare la Champions e la Nazionale .
Donadoni ha indossato la sconfitta con lo stesso decoro con cui si veste , parla e cammina .
Avrebbe potuto piangersi addosso , imputando il suo destino a una congiura .
Più prosaicamente avrebbe potuto trattare la resa , intascando la « penale » da 550 mila euro di cui tutti parlavano come di un risarcimento giusto .
Invece ha preferito andarsene in punta di piedi .
Però non è scappato dalla porta di servizio .
Ha chiesto di incrociare gli occhi dei giornalisti un’ultima volta : non per sfogarsi , ma per salutare , come è d’uso fra persone bene educate .
In tempi di crisi fa bene al cuore riscoprire che , accanto al modello di italiano cialtrone e furbastro che ingombra da un secolo le cronache dei giornali e che avrà per sempre il volto del grande Alberto Sordi , esiste un Altro Italiano che non urla , non millanta , non fa la scena .
E anche per questo esce di scena : con uno stile che non lo avvantaggerà nella carriera ma che gli vale , per quel poco che conta , il nostro applauso .

At first glance , Cesare Bonizzi looks like the archetypal Capuchin monk - round - faced , stout , with twinkling eyes and a long flowing white beard .
But beneath his robes beats a heart of metal .
Brother Cesare is the lead singer in a heavy metal band which has just released its second album .
A former missionary in Ivory Coast , he lives in a small friary in the Milan hinterland .
The 62 - year - old monk 's love affair with heavy metal began when he attended a Metallica concert some 15 years ago .
" I was overwhelmed and amazed by the sheer energy of it " he says .
Brother Metal Hard rock and heavy metal have , over the years , been criticised as the work of the devil .
It 's a claim which Brother Cesare , also known as Brother Metal , says is nonsense .
He started playing and recording cassettes , firstly with " lighter " metal music , but gradually he realised that what really moved him was the hard core .
People think that I am in fancy dress , they can't believe a robed monk is on the stage playing their music
Brother Cesare Bonizzi
The members of his band were at first sceptical at the idea of teaming up with a Capuchin monk but their doubts soon evaporated .
" Five minutes after meeting Brother Cesare I decided to go ahead , because he manages to convey so much energy , that other musicians and youngsters often do n't manage to express , " lead guitarist , Cesare Zanotti , told Reuters .
Sex , drugs and alcohol Brother Metal recently appeared in the Gods of Metal festival in Italy , along with giants such as Iron Maiden , Judas Priest and Slayer , playing to a crowd of leather - clad hard - core metal fans .
" It was wonderful being there among all these young people " he told the Rome newspaper La Repubblica .
" The only problem was that at one stage out slipped a " what the f " because each time some people think that I am in fancy dress , they can't believe a robed monk is on the stage playing their music " .
With a booming voice , Brother Metal belts out lyrics that are decidedly gritty , talking about real - life issues and not shying away from sex , drugs and alcohol .
He does touch on faith and religion but is adamant that he is not seeking to draw people to Catholicism through his stage performances .
Video clips of his performances on YouTube have helped spread his popularity and fan base .
Devotion to God His second heavy metal album , " Misteri " ( Mysteries ) has just been released .
In a sign of Brother Metal 's eclecticism , it drew inspiration from a group of women in southern Italy who sang about Mary , the mother of Jesus , and a heavy metal version of that song is on the CD .
Other songs talk about how alcohol warms the heart but excess drinking can damage the liver , and how important sex is to man .
Brother Cesare says he has never had any trouble with his superiors over his choice of musical career and would like to send his new album to the Pope .
" He is a music lover and metal is music ! " he says .
While Brother Cesare always wears his traditional brown robe and sandals as a reminder that he has chosen a life of devotion to God , he is keen to distinguish established religion from faith , and from proselytising .
" I do it to convert people to life , to understand life , to grab hold of life , to savour it and enjoy it .
Full stop " he says .

Figure 1 : Barbury Castle crop circle denoting Pi. Crop Circle photos and reports courtesy The Crop Circle Connector .
If we are to believe the latest signs from outer space , the local aliens are keen mathematicians .
A new crop circle appeared on the 1st of June this year in a barley field near Barbury Castle in Wiltshire , England , measuring 150 feet in diameter and correctly representing the first 10 digits of the irrational constant pi .
If you look at figure 1 , you will notice that the grooves in the circle spiral outwards with steps at various points along the way .
Taking a look now at figure 2 , you will see that these steps occur at particular angles — the circle is divided into 10 equal segments of 36 degrees each .
Starting at the centre , you can see that the first section is 3 segments wide .
Then there is a step and underneath this step is a small circle .
This is the decimal point .
The next section is 1 segment wide and then there is another step .
The following section is 4 segments wide , and so on until the final number encoded is 3.141592654 .
Michael Reed , the astrophysicist who first decoded the image , is quoted on earthfiles.com as saying :
" The fact that the Pi decimal point is included and there is rounding up to 10 decimal places is to me a little mind boggling ! "
The location of the new Pi crop circle is 51.488258 degrees north , 1.771964 west , but unfortunately it has not yet appeared on Google maps .
Figure 2 : Right image shows the circle divided into 10 equal segments .
The number of segments moved through at each step , starting from the centre , denotes a decimal point of Pi. Left image courtesy The Crop Circle Connector .
This latest crop circle has appeared on the eve of the new X - files movie I want to believe and has created quite a storm amongst crop circle enthusiasts .
Lucy Pringle , a crop circle researcher , was quoted in The Scotsman as finding it hard to believe such an intricate crop circle could have been created by humans , and whilst there was rain the night before it appeared , there was no mud inside the formation .
" You can do it on a computer , but you try putting that in a field in the middle of the night and achieving that degree of mathematical accuracy . "
Pringle 's theory is that crop circles are created by a spiralling electromagnetic force that hits the ground for a nanosecond .
Local councillor Stewart Dobson said : " It 's hard to believe somebody managed to work ( the design ) out so it shows pi so accurately .
It 's either a very educated person who has done it or a very educated alien . "
Plus tends to think that an alien capable of making it millions of light years across the Universe to visit us is more than likely to have some understanding of pi ...

It is not the first time mathematics has appeared in a crop circle .
Indeed , whether it's the nerdy nature of crop circle fraudsters , or because aliens choose maths as a method of communication because of its fundamental role in the Universe , mathematical patterns are fairly common .
One of the best - known mathematical crop circles appeared in the form of the Julia set 12 years ago , again in Wiltshire , near Stone Henge .
For the latest buzz on this crop circle , and to have a peek at all the theories regarding it , see crop circle connector .
And whatever caused these mathematical imprints on the face of the Earth , always remember , the truth is out there .
Barely two weeks after a polar bear was shot by police in northern Iceland , another sighting has just been confirmed in the same area .
The bear is on Hraun Farm in the Skagafjordur region .
Polar bears drift to Iceland on stray ice , usually just once every decade or two .
Standard procedure has been to shoot the bears to protect people and livestock .
The bear shooting two weeks ago sparked international debate , as the polar bear is now deemed an endangered species .
Many believed the bear should have been tranquilised and sent home to Greenland ; but the police defended their decision , saying the bears are very fast , conditions were foggy and many people had gathered in the area .
It is unprecedented for two polar bears to be seen in Iceland in the same region in such a short period of time .
This time police have cordoned off the area and banned onlookers .
Further reports to follow on the bear ’s fate .
For every acre of California forest that burns in this week 's 1,000 blazes , about 17 tons of carbon dioxide are being released into the atmosphere .
With an estimated 265,000 acres scorched already , these fires could have already sent up to 4.6 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere .
That 's as much CO2 as a mere 9 days ' worth of California traffic generates , according to our back - of - the - envelope estimate .
( See the end of the post for details and caveats . *)
Last October , during California 's last bout with wildfires , NCAR scientists calculated that the 500,000 acre blaze pumped 8.7 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , or 17.4 tons per acre .
Noted AP writer Seth Borenstein noted that this emissions tally was equal to human activities in California for a week .
Many people responded to this news by saying , " Wow , those fires are big . "
Borenstein even noted that the wildfire emissions were greater than the state of Vermont 's for a year .
Somehow , the more interesting , inverse point was lost : Human activity in California , from an emissions perspective , is like a massive wildfire every single week .
That should n't be a surprise , considering that cars and power plans both burn ancient biomatter .
That gas in your tank ?
In energy terms , it 's the equivalent of 200 pounds of wood !
Of course , the fires , unlike your gasoline - powered car , produce huge amounts of particulate matter , aka soot , which are making San Francisco 's air look like Beijing 's .
The most recent fire , using particulate emission factors ( .pdf ) calculated by another group of scientists , could have already produced 40,500 tons of PM .
That 's bad news for your lungs , if you happen to live in northern California .
Last year , the state estimated that lowering diesel emissions would annually prevent 6,500 premature deaths , and all of the diesel engines in California only produce about 27,000 tons of the stuff a year .
* We calculated a per-acre carbon dioxide number of 17.4 tons from the emissions calculations carried out last year by NCAR scientist Christine Wiedinmyer and UC - Boulder professor Jason Neff .
This was a higher CO2 estimate than California 's Air Resource Board estimate of 12 tons per acre for the same fire .
We calculated the California traffic CO2 numbers from the Air Resources Board 's 2004 emissions inventory , located here .
In 2004 , all on - road traffic generated 188 million tons of CO2 or 468 thousand tons a day .

Dallas DA : Jack Ruby docs ' too important to keep secret ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday February 18 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The Dallas County District Attorney 's Office has announced the discovery of a trove of documents relating to the assassination of John Kennedy .
Among the documents is an alleged transcript of a conversation between Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby , planning the assassination together on behalf of the Mafia .
This document has aroused the greatest amount of interest but has also been described as " highly suspect . "
Dallas District Attorney Craig Watkins explained at a news conference on Monday morning that the documents were found in a safe about a year ago -- soon after he took office -- and that his staff have been examining and cataloging them ever since .
Previous DA 's had decided not to reveal the information , but Watkins said his administration is devoted to openness and felt it was " too important to keep secret . "
" It will open up the debate as to whether there was a conspiracy to assassinate the president , " Watkins stated .
Ruby , the owner of a Dallas burlesque club , shot Oswald while he was in police custody two days after the November 22 , 1963 assassination .
The transcript has Oswald telling Ruby , " the [ Mafia ] boys in Chicago want to get rid of the Attorney General [ Robert Kennedy ] .
...
There is a way to get rid of him without killing him .
... I can shoot his brother . "
The curator of a Dallas museum devoted to the assassination has pointed out that Oswald is known to have been elsewhere on October 4 , the alleged date of the conversation .
The safe also contained a 1967 contract with the then - district attorney for a movie about the assassination , and the DA 's assistant has suggested that the transcript was part of a proposed movie script .
This video is from Fox 's Fox News Live , broadcast February 18 , 2008 .
About JPFO : Fierce Defender of American Liberty
Three primary goals drive the Washington - based human - rights group Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership ( JPFO ) :
Destroy so - called “ gun control ” ( code words for disarming innocent people ) .
Expose the misguided notions that lead people to seek out so - called “ gun control ” .
Encourage Americans to understand and defend all of the Bill of Rights for all citizens .
The Second Amendment is the “ Guardian ” of the Bill of Rights .
Founded by Jews in 1989 , JPFO initially aimed at educating the Jewish community about the historical evils that Jews have suffered when they have been disarmed .
JPFO has always welcomed people of all religious beliefs who share a common goal of opposing and reversing victim - disarmament policies while advancing liberty for all .
It was the brainchild of Aaron Zelman ( 1946 - 2010 ) , a leading national civil - rights activist .
JPFO is a non-profit tax - exempt 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) educational civil - rights organization , not a lobby .
JPFO ’s products and programs reach out to as many segments of the American people as possible , using bold tactics without compromise on fundamental principles .
Find out how you can donate to JPFO .
JPFO has always welcomed people of all religious beliefs ( or none ) who share a common goal of opposing and reversing potentially deadly victim disarmament policies .
You do n’t have to be Jewish to join JPFO ; you just have to love freedom .
Aaron Zelman , a proud Jew , initially aimed at educating the Jewish community about the historical evils that Jews have suffered when they have been disarmed .
He was appalled that so many Jewish politicians and influential Jewish public officials and spokespeople actually advocated citizen disarmament .
He said it many a time : “ Jews should be the last people on Earth to support ‘ gun control ’ .
See : An Interview With Aaron Zelman
As JPFO expanded its research into gun laws and the results of their enactments , it became blatantly obvious that so - called “ gun control ” had played a fundamental role in all the major genocides of the 20 th Century … not just the Holocaust .
See : The Genocide Chart
So -called “ gun control ” is a deadly lie .
Firearms registration lists lead governments - gone - bad straight to gun owners .
Licensing and registration of guns has resulted in outright banning and confiscation over the last one hundred years of world history .
The bloody results of these mass citizen disarmaments have been horrific .
Based on this insight , JPFO broke new ground with the award - winning documentary Innocents Betrayed .
In this powerful film , viewers learn the dirty secret of " gun control " : how governments have historically deprived people of firearms ... and then murdered them ruthlessly .
Fifty eight minutes of hard - hitting facts that leave viewers dazed .
More recently , JPFO has made additional award winning movies .
“ 2A Today for the U.S.A. ” is probably the best introduction to the Second Amendment available anywhere .
“ Shall not be infringed ” means what it says .
Gun registration , permits , and licensing are blatant infringements of the right to keep and bear arms .
Aside from being un-Constitutional , “ gun control ” simply does not work .
Criminals ignore all gun laws .
To again quote Aaron Zelman :
“ Anyone who is lawfully adjudicated unfit to carry a firearm should not be on the street in the first place .
They should be in prison or in a mental institution .
We ’ve thrown the baby ( our personal liberties ) out with the bathwater , making us helpless to protect ourselves from armed criminals and lunatics .
And who promotes this delusional illogic the most fervently ?
Politicians and the law enforcement hierarchy . ”
Please carefully consider the logic of what is being said here .
Next in JPFO ’s “ arsenal of intellectual ammunition ” came the controversial , but irrefutable , documentary “ No Guns for Negroes ”
This film carefully details the racist roots of American “ gun control ” .
The first widely applied “ gun control ” laws in this nation were enforced against freed slaves after the Civil War .
American children do n’t learn this in history classes ; they are more often programmed with the simplistic lie that “ guns are bad ” .
To counteract the brainwashing of America ’s youth ( and the rest of us ) , JPFO has also published the terrific set of easy - reading , comic - style , fully - documented " Gran'pa Jack " booklets that explain :
the entire Bill of Rights , its roots , its meaning , and how it is being trampled today
the racist roots of " gun control " in America
the United Nations assault on the U.S. Bill of Rights
how " gun control " laws enabled the murder of nearly 170 MILLION unarmed civilians in eight major 20 th Century genocides
unarmed civilians in eight major 20 th Century genocides how to debunk 21 " gun control " myths
... and much more !
JPFO also offers a wide variety of freedom - related fiction and non-fiction books in our bookstore area .
Then came “ The Ten Commandments of Self Defense ” , a rabbinic examination of Jewish Torah Law in relation to self defense .
Foundational to this lecture ( available on CD ) , is exposure of the centuries long mistranslation of the Sixth Commandment .
The proper Hebrew translation is “ thou shalt not murder ” .
Religious Jews ( and Christians ) simply must re-examine their views on righteous self defense .
Next came the groundbreaking expose film “ No Guns for Jews ” .
Expanding upon “ The Ten Commandments of Self Defense ” , this is an absolutely clear presentation of the Jewish moral and religious mandate for righteous self defense and the defense of the innocent .
You can watch all three of these more recent JPFO productions on YouTube ( search the title for segmented presentations ) , or download them in full from our website - reference the movies page for relevant links .
There is also available from the JPFO store , our “ Triple Play combo DVD ” containing all three major DVD 's together .
JPFO also maintains a dynamic , rapid response , website with a free e-mail alert subscription system to deliver intellectual ammunition both to Americans and to freedom lovers all over the world .

A Brief History of
Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership
From the passing of Aaron Zelman in December 2010 to its Adoption
by the Second Amendment Foundation in September 2014
by Alan Korwin
with guidance from
Rabbinic Director Dovid Bendory
former Executive Director Charles Heller
former Board of Directors officer Bob Meier
When Aaron Zelman left this world on December 21 , 2010 , after 21 years as the founder and mastermind behind Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership , he left the world a significant ideological legacy .
JPFO was Aaron ’s invention and creation , and like similar constructs , it reflected him uniquely from top to bottom .
There was no other Moses figure to step in and take over .
He had put his people on the path out of an iron bondage of mental oppression , a firearm slavery that took social , psychological and physical forms .
JPFO served a function matched by no other group in the freedom struggle , mobilizing a constituency that up to that point lacked voice .
Oddly enough , it resonated as loudly with Gentiles as with Jews , a point that surprised Aaron but one he took in stride .
He happily accepted any support in the quintessential battle that would never again allow government — or anyone — to attempt to wipe out His People — or anyone .
The organization with the long perceptive name had a precariously thin bench .
The only insider allies were a small “ inner circle ” of staff and associates when Zelman left us , and that cast of characters was as short as a one - act off - Broadway play .
No one stood out or stood up as the heir apparent .
A half - hearted low - key search began .
Without the unfathomable efforts of Lavonne Schuett , Aaron ’s right - hand woman , secretary , office manager , and of late , Board Member , JPFO might have died right there within a few months of him .
This is little known .
She kept that office in Wisconsin humming , filling orders , taking care of business , paying the bills , handling members ’ inquiries .
Thank G-d Lavonne was in place — she made it seem like JPFO was the machine the world thought JPFO was .
Do n’t get me wrong , JPFO was indeed a machine , with thousands of members , and a vast legacy of groundbreaking documentaries , books , white papers , and leadership in the gun-rights movement that no one else can touch .
When no one else would stand up and call the criminals in the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives the jack - booted thugs they are , and call for their elimination , JPFO was there four - square pulling no punches .
To this day , no one holds a candle to JPFO when it comes to calling out the Gestapo - like tactics we face from the enemies of freedom who deceptively cloak themselves in good - guy federal garb .
Just look at Boot The BATF or The Gang issued by JPFO for a taste of that dish .
But without Lavonne handling the day - to - day affairs of a non-profit , this non-profit might have ground to a halt , and people worldwide would have just numbly wondered what happened .
Unsung Heroes Kept JPFO
Alive
Lavonne was not alone .
Behind her was Bob Meier , Board Member number two , though he was the untitled Chairman of the three - member Board .
It was Bob who pulled the strings unseen behind the scenes , the angel who filled in the gaps when it was needed .
He and Aaron had run the organization hand - in - hand for more than a decade , because it was Bob who more than anyone understood the importance of Aaron ’s work , and knew it could not fail or falter for lack of funds .
He opened his checkbook as needed and generously filled in the not - infrequent requirements .
This gave Bob a commanding role in the four - year transition period , and he did it with a magnanimous hand , seeking to have the rudderless ship steer a sane course .
No one knew for sure what that course was or should be , the ship just sailed on .
Enter Kirby Ferris , a firebrand and close confidant of Aaron ’s who , as another member of the inner circle , took one of the active roles in directing the ship , while Bob and Lavonne helped keep it afloat and cruising .
Kirby found me and I liked him right away .
Outspoken and brimming with energy , he was as philosophically pure and principled as anyone I ’ve ever had the pleasure to know .
I ’m fortunate to know a handful of such individuals , I gravitate toward them and vice versa , a stroke of fate for which I am constantly thankful .
We spoke endlessly , lamented the trials and tribulations , and helped steer the ship around the shoals , often unseen .
Years earlier it was my distinct honor and pleasure to have had lunch with Aaron after the Gun Rights Policy Conference — I do n’t recall the exact date unfortunately , probably around 2006 or so — though I did n’t fully recognize how auspicious that meal was at the time .
I had been a fan of JPFO and their work , and was mightily impressed with Aaron ’s speech at the conference .
He invited me to break bread , and we had one of those immediately engaging talks that happen when people like us sit .
It was just food in the hotel lobby before flight time , and it was deeply meaningful , which I did n’t realize until later .
We remained in contact from then right up until his passing , a loss I felt deeply and do to this day .
The Search for an Executive Director
So it was with a great deal of appreciation of the cosmic nature of the request when , a few weeks later Kirby told me JPFO needed a leader and he asked me if I would accept the role .
This would be a great honor and a tremendous responsibility , and one I would have to decline .
In my heart of hearts I knew I could fulfill the task , it ’s just that my plate was already overloaded , as it has been for decades , to my happy displeasure .
I have my own business to run ( Bloomfield Press and GunLaws.com ) , and I neglect that way too often for every pressing rights struggle that crosses my path .
Running JPFO is not merely a struggle , it is a calling .
We would need to find someone else .
I agreed to aid in the quiet search .
Through all this Rabbi Dovid Bendory actively fulfilled his role as spiritual advisor , the Rabbinic Director of JPFO , counseling us all , assuring that the group ’s moral compass was properly set .
Dovid had one of the closest relationships with Aaron , and channeled him , if that ’s a suitable word in a Jewish setting , as we ran the ship without its proper captain .
Some of the best writings during this period came from the Rabbi ’s pen , including a widely disseminated piece circulated through the auspices of Lenny Magil ’s Glock Store , an insert that went into untold customer ’s packages —
Five Reasons Why You Should Want High - Capacity Magazines .
The no-compromise ethic blazed on .
There are a surprising number of Jews high up in the gun-rights battle , despite the fact that modern Jews in America , in general , are adamantly , ferociously , counterintuitively against gun rights , and who illogically wish guns would “ just go away . ”
They are hard - core left liberals , and stand against almost everything gun-rights advocates support .
JPFO ’s Rabbi and I wrote a White Paper on this , Why Jews Hate Guns , and it stands as the definitive statement on why this is so .
No need to reiterate the reasons here ( read it on the website ) or in the prior issue of The Sentinel .
When you ask these folks what they think Never Again !
means , they ’re likely to say it means the Holocaust will never happen again .
They are victims of their own victimhood .
Unfortunately in the search for a new Executive Director , many of the leading Jewish candidates — and the new ED must be Jewish of course — who are perfectly aligned in principle , proper mindset and outstanding credentials , are or were officers in the NRA .
If you know anything , you know Aaron Zelman and the NRA did not see eye - to - eye .
To be more clear , they are oil and water , cats and dogs , Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner .
As ideal as a candidate might be , if the person hails from the NRA , that would place at least a perception of taint — in the eyes of die - hard JPFOers — that would make the person untenable .
The echo of , “ You ’ve sold out to the NRA ! ” would never die , and they would forever say poor Mr. Zelman is spinning in his grave , even if it was n’t true .
Such a person could never poke the NRA hard in the eye , when it needs a solid poke .
Speaking truth to power is a JPFO hallmark .
If you doubt this for a nanosecond , see Aaron Zelman ’s seminal letter , “ I ’ll join the NRA when ... ”
You folks in the NRA — you need to re-read and heed Aaron ’s sagacious words .
Ted Nugent , it ’s time to respond to Aaron ’s letter , which was addressed to you , which you never did .
With which of his points can you honestly disagree ?
At our luncheon , Aaron had said to me , “ If the NRA had its way , every gun owner would need a permit to have a gun , and the NRA would be the issuing authority . ”
It shocked me at the time .
And it burned into memory .
It ’s how Aaron was .
And I ’ve seen signs of it in far too many “ theoretically ” pro-rights organizations .
And way too many gun owners too , who think their wallet - sized plastic - coated carry - permit permission slips are slicker than snot , which they show off with ludicrous pride — instead of revulsion at the thought that they need papers to exercise their rights .
But never even a hint of that at Aaron ’s JPFO .
Enter the Promising Candidate
It dawned on me that Charles Heller in Tucson , who I trust and have personally known for a decade might be the right candidate .
He is Jewish , a certified instructor and as gunny as anyone you ’re likely to meet .
He can talk the talk with the left or the right eloquently and articulately , having spent 13 years in talk radio , on programs he designed , produces and keeps on the air .
As Secretary and a founder of The Arizona Citizens Defense League , Charles has demonstrated the right stuff to help make Arizona the gun-friendliest state in the Union .
( OK , some other states are admittedly in the running for that coveted title ; but Guns and Ammo magazine granted it now two years running , GunLaws.com deemed it so in 2010 after AzCDL got Constitutional Carry enacted . )
With an OK from the Board , which includes unsung quiet third member Bruce Bell , the former Controller at Olympic Arms , who served on JPFO ’s board for more than a decade , I asked and Charles accepted the position .
JPFO had its first and only new Executive Director in its history .
Charles served admirably for a while .
The organization was invigorated , we held phone conferences with the Rabbi , three board members , Kirby and myself , and in various combinations , much of it without me .
I was just an outside ad hoc advisor .
Agendas were set , fund - raising programs and membership drives were developed , trips were arranged , JPFO attended the SHOT Show , an Ambassador plan began to take shape for states .
JPFO Forged Ahead
Little by little , a stable of writers grew ( completely outside my purview ) and the flow of good solid eblasts went out under the unyielding stewardship of webmaster Chris Beglin , who never faltered .
Chris was another bedrock without whom JPFO could not survive .
Like Lavonne , he worked in an almost invisible background , keeping the frenetic website current , adding products as needed , posting papers as they were written , making everything look effortless .
The public had a face for JPFO .
Charles is good with the media .
They like him , and he knows how to relate to them .
An organization has to speak with a single coherent voice , and Charles provided that in exemplary fashion .
Where things began to fray was operationally .
No one else could be Aaron .
He managed to juggle all the balls at the same time .
How he raised all the money he did was nothing short of a miracle , and Charles for all his assets , was not a miracle worker .
Charles and Kirby did not get along as famously as I did with either , and I spent long hours providing a shoulder , as did all of us with each other .
Bob spent way too much time smoothing waters , seeking advice , and financing his personal independent contractors to amplify the work Lavonne was doing on the database and fund - raising lists .
At one point Bob called me the Rabbi ’s Rabbi for all the counseling I was doing — not that Dovid needed it per se , but it was a cool phrase that I certainly did n’t mind .
After some relatively smooth sailing , we were negotiating dangerously turbulent waters .
Then disaster struck .
Kirby Ferris was called away from this Earth on June 13 , 2012 , and we lost one of the most outspoken remaining direct vestiges of radicalism in the inner circle ( though we still had L. Neil Smith and the writers hard at work ) .
That really hurt , even if it salved the friction between Kirby and Charles .
There still remained concerns between the Board and its replacement Executive Director .
For all the things they wanted done , the vast list of unfilled things on the to - do list grew .
Pressure on Charles grew as his performance came under ever increasing scrutiny and funding grew ever more precarious .
If that was n’t enough , Lavonne suffered a stroke and we soon lost her .
How could an organization survive this ?
Any Jew who has asked why G-d let the Holocaust happen could certainly ask again why G-d lets bad things happen to good people — and good organizations — at this point .
And only reply with G -d works in mysterious ways .
The Tectonics Shifted Internally
In a great stroke of luck and providence , Lavonne ’s husband , formerly so far in the background that we did n’t fully realize he was there , Doug Schuett stepped up to the plate , and through his enormous personal grief picked up where his wife left off and started taking care of the Wisconsin office .
Bob put him on the payroll and Board of Directors ( replacing Lavonne ) and things started to hum again .
His management style was very different than we were familiar with , it was mainly business and not ideologically driven , which was a good thing in most respects .
JPFO had been a labor of love for most of its participants : love of Aaron , love of freedom , love of firearm rights ( Aaron disparaged the idea of “ gun rights , ” guns do n’t have rights , but our language lacks an adequate way to express the concept in a simple phrase ) .
Doug approached things in a non-Jewish , business - efficiency model that worked .
This was not exactly the style Charles had brought to the table .
With all the tumult , business had not been moving forward properly .
Memberships , donations and cash flow were showing the strain .
Bob , our angel , was reaching the end of his rope as well .
When I met with the Rabbi on a trip to New York several years earlier I had asked , what happens to a group like this when it loses its leader ?
He sagaciously replied that it can flounder around for a few years and quietly slip into the night , it can die a sudden death , or it can experience a rebirth in some fashion .
It was our hope during that meeting in a quaint coffee shop in lower Manhattan that the third option would be the one ( rebirth ) , though we both felt the first might be more likely ( slow death ) , and we were sort of maybe watching that occur .
Not to lose hope , the inner circle decided we should produce tangible evidence of our existence , and a new edition of The Sentinel was commissioned and came out in January 2013 .
It was a blockbuster , very well received , contained some first - rate writing by L. Neil Smith , the Rabbi , Charles , Kirby , myself and others .
It attracted praise , memberships and revenue .
But one newsletter in a four - year period , and an unending series of eblasts does not an organization make .
Another Shift and a New Horizon
Eventually , the Board reached a decision to let Charles go , which he graciously accepted , stepping into the role of Public Relations Director , so there was still a name for the media to reach .
An announcement was quietly made of the change .
To this day , many still think Charles heads JPFO , but it has been without a real leader since May 2013 .
By the summer of 2014 , it became obvious JPFO could no longer continue as it was .
The finances just were n’t there , not to mention the energy .
Some of the writers , apparently led by Claire Wolfe , considered taking the group over , but they lacked the resources to do so .
No other offers came about .
JPFO had commitments to its members and its creditors , including life members , and the Board of Directors of a non -profit cannot simply turn it over to any person or group that asks .
Bob suggested the Board would have to see a six - figure commitment or an apparent ability to run the group for at least a year before he could in good faith hand over the responsibility .
An offer to pay the next month ’s bills was insufficient fiduciary standing to consummate a deal .
Meier had wisely suggested that without an evident ability to run JPFO for at least a year any proposal had to be looked upon askance .
The only group on the horizon with that ability , and the interest , was Alan Gottlieb and the Second Amendment Foundation .
Despite the Board ’s legitimate wariness , and with a precarious time frame before an utter collapse , SAF consummated a deal to take JPFO under its wing .
Rumors flew , which was to be expected .
My impression of Gottlieb ’s move is that it is honorable , done in the best interests of JPFO and the gun-rights movement , and that the future is as unknown to him as it is to the rest of us .
As Meier framed it , Gottlieb , “ assumed responsibility for the survival of JPFO with assurances that its fiercely radical positions will not be undermined . ”
As I came to understand it , Alan is relying on what ’s left of the inner circle to keep JPFO running true .
He certainly believes that having JPFO extant is better than seeing it pass away .
The inner circle is unanimous in this sentiment .
The Big Pow Wow at GRPC 2014
At GRPC Chicago in September I called for and got a pow wow with the key players present , starting with Gottlieb , Massad Ayoob and Miko Tempski .
Mas is certainly well known and highly respected in the gun-rights community , a Board member of SAF with a keen interest in JPFO .
Miko is SAF ’s general counsel .
He drafted the papers for the transfer , and with Doug oversaw the packing and shipment of five palettes of JPFO materials from Wisconsin to Washington State , the new home of JPFO ( at SAF HQ ) .
You can think of them as the current SAF oversight committee .
JPFO ’s new official Board of Directors is Gottlieb , Tempski and Ohad Lowy , a former Israeli Defense Forces soldier , now an Assistant Attorney General in Washington state .
Joining them at the meeting were Charles , myself and David Codrea , a JPFO writer and stalwart gun-rights advocate who people in this game know well .
Along with the Rabbi and others we are the newly developing JPFO Board of Advisors who will be doing the legwork and designing , hmmm , the second coming of JPFO .
There ’s an interesting turn of phrase , eh ?
Claire ’s name came up numerous times in our hours of discussion into the night that night .
While none of us approved of how she aired her complaints , to the extent her criticisms had merit and reflected fears many people hold — and they did — they provided valid direction .
JPFO must never lose its moral compass .
We have a Rabbi to help us steer this course , and if we transgress against our principles we will have irreparably erred , though we recognize that as humans we probably will make some mistakes along the way .
One of our standards has become WWAD , “ What Would Aaron Do ? ”
In the agenda I prepared for the meeting , I placed this guideline at the top , to which no one voiced any objection :
“ How do we keep JPFO running true ,
what are the immediate needs and
what are appropriate areas for expansion . ”
The inner circle presently consists of Rabbi Bendory , Charles and myself , and along with Chris Beglin , and a handful of the writers like Codrea , Kurt Hofmann , L. Neil Smith and people we might not even know yet we ’re going to generate the output .
Richard Stevens , who was Aaron ’s ally and co-author for a decade or more , is my neighbor and a close personal friend , and though he does n’t have time to be fully involved , is a trusted confidant .
My apologies to the writers and others whose names I do not know .
My involvement has been deep but not necessarily wide .
Chris and the new team are in touch with those doing daily web output now , and Gottlieb has been moving the ship slowly forward .
Meier and Bell , who want some distance at this point , are still in the wings and want to stay in touch .
We have set a few goals at GRPC for ourselves in the near term :
Issue The Sentinel on a regular basis .
Create a new Gran ’Pa Jack # 9 ( already under way )
Undertake a new DVD documentary
Begin a membership drive
Increase our presence in the Jewish community
Many other ideas are bubbling around .
They will take time , money and especially shoe leather , a shortage of which has stymied JPFO ’s efforts since this organization began .
You are encouraged to get involved by :
a ) donating sorely needed funds
b ) increasing your membership to a higher level
c ) membership joining if you ’re not already a member
d ) getting your friends , Jewish or not , to join , and
e ) volunteering .
Call or write to the office for opportunities to help .
Call 800-486-6963 for Kasey Goodman , or write to : JPFO | 12500 NE 10th Pl | Bellevue | WA 98005
We no longer have our “ Moses ” but his faithful followers and supporters are still very much alive and deeply committed .
With the structure and support Alan Gottlieb has provided , and help from above , the future looks bright indeed .
Respectfully submitted ,

The Tesla roadster goes from 0 to 60 in 3.9 - seconds ( by December anyway ) and costs $ 100,000 if you 're lucky enough to get dibs on the 10 or so electric cars delivered so far .
Come to find out , it also goes from 30 to 0 in a nausea - filled second when ground to a halt of twisted carbon - fiber beneath a Mercedes .
The image above was snapped by Alex Volkov at the scene of a Friday evening accident in San Francisco .
Of course , this is n't the first wrecked Tesla we 've seen .
According to Fortune , ousted co-founder Martin Eberhard suffered further distress when his Tesla rear - ended a truck en route for delivery to Eberhard 's home .
While the cause of the new accident is n't official , a few eye - witnesses said that Tesla # 6 -- driven and owned by an unidentified man -- had gone " unnoticed " as it went " bumper - to - bumper between the cars . "
Interestingly enough , the Tesla 's air - bags never deployed .
One thing seems obvious : we expect to see more crashes from the silent , ultra - low - profile Tesla street - racer as it attempts to compete for space on roads dominated by SUVs , Hummers , and Testosterone .

Editor - New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's pathetic pratfall well illuminates a persistent sexual double standard .
While the media 's predictable feeding frenzy all but ignored this angle , columnist Debra J. Saunders nailed it ( " The emperor 's wife " , March 12 ) .
Kudos to her !
About a dozen years ago I watched TV news covering the arraignment of a 30 - ish female teacher charged with statutory rape of a male student .
I thought it odd enough that male defendants so seldom suffered similar focus .
Then the television crew exposed their " news " for what it was - sheer titillation - by slowly panning the camera downward from the defendant 's face to her clingy black dress , to her exposed lower thigh , to her well - turned ankle and sandal - clad feet , and then slowly retracing this route to her face .
As if they'd do the same with a similarly charged male defendant ?
Ever since that tawdry episode I 've shunned TV coverage of female sex scandals .
Now , with the print media 's universally prominent display of Silda Spitzer 's anguished face alongside her husband , I 've simply turned the page without reading .
Thank you , Ms. Saunders , for repudiating the invidious sexual discrimination on which your profession too often feeds .

An unsettling feeling
Editor - I 'm sorry to learn of Eliot Spitzer 's fall from grace and resignation .
What saddens me most is how the evidence against him was collected without a warrant under the guise of searching for terrorists ' banking transactions .
So , how many GOP clients of the Emperor 's Club will be trembling over possible " leaks " from the White House ?
Zero . How may Democratic
Pols who were clients are worried ?
All of them .

Toll on marriage
Editor -
What value do we place on having sex that so many believe having sex outside marriage not only justifies , but even demands that a 20 - year , 30 - year marriage has to end ?
Of course , it hurts to learn our spouse cheated on us .
Of course , it is hard to forgive and we want retribution .
But to walk away from a lifetime together ?
We can have any number of other experiences with others outside the marriage , we can fritter away all our money or burn down the house , but having sex ends it .
I do n't get it .

Will it bring back to life the eight soldiers killed in Iraq that same day ... will it save those millions of homes ... provide some insight into why oil has risen to $ 108 a barrel ?
Kudos to that logic !
I think the next time I 'm pulled over for speeding I 'll ask , " Officer , will giving me this ticket stop the killing in Dufar ?
Will it stop the escalation of health care costs ?
Will it stop columnists from making irrelevant and nonsensical arguments ? "

Ferraro : Truth or blasphemy ?
Editor -
It is politically correct for Sen. Hillary Clinton to distance herself from Geraldine Ferraro 's opinion that the excitement over Barack Obama 's candidacy stems in part from his ethnicity .
But Ms. Ferraro is fundamentally correct in defending her right to express a valid opinion when asked for it by a newspaper .
It would be naive to think that Obama 's being the first serious biracial candidate for president is not a significant factor in the attention he is getting .
If we have to stifle free speech in order to have a biracial president , Mr. Obama becomes a divisive , not a unifying , force on the political stage .
LYNN SNYDER

Making of kings
Editor - Geraldine Ferraro's contention that Sen. Barack Obama would n't be leading the race for the Democratic presidential nomination if he were n't black reminds me of what Colonel Tom Parker said .
Give me a white man who sings like a black man , the Elvis Presley impresario said , and I 'll make a fortune .
If I may borrow from the colonel : Give us a white man - a young Irish Catholic , for example - with Obama 's charisma , eloquence , ability to inspire and to assemble a superior campaign organization , and this race would have been over long ago .

Makes us proud
Editor - I am a nice 64 - year - old professional white lady , and I have this to say , as her peer , to Geraldine Ferraro :
My dear , is n't it positively wonderful that after three centuries of only white men , women and children having access to the White House because they are n't " colored , " we finally have the opportunity to move a very presidential black family into the White House ?
Does n't it make you so proud , at long last , to be in an America where white people are n't the only ones who get to vote for a member of their own race ?

Editor - I 'm appalled by Geraldine Ferraro 's statement , " If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position . "
Ferraro's is perpetuating an American disgrace that few of us admit still bedevils our society .
No , not racism - that societal cancer remains as American as apple pie .
I 'm referring instead to the death of the subjunctive mood .
Clearly , Ms. Ferraro should have said " If Obama were a white man ... " since her statement is a conditional one .

June 19th , 2008
The best commentary I could offer is a link to a previous story :
World ’s Largest Maker of Crop Nutrients : Famines May Occur Without Record Harvests
But I ’ll ramble on a bit more about this , anyway .
As soon as I became aware of the flooding situation in the American Midwest , I posted the story with the EMERGENCY prefix on the title .
Just so we ’re clear , when I write EMERGENCY at the beginning of a post title , this is my way of indicating that the situation is as serious as it gets .
It means that I feel as though everyone reading should consider taking immediate evasive action .
All the jawboning about conspiracy , how things could have been , how things should be , etc. are behind us now .
You know , EMERGENCY , act fast , eyes wide , nostrils flared , etc .
While the food supply situation has skated along a knife edge so far this year , with higher prices and many countries experiencing food riots , widespread famine did not take hold .
In an incredible move , the Japanese quietly eased rice shortages by releasing portions of their imported rice stockpiles — from giant warehouses in Tokyo — into the system ; a welcome but one off blip in the big picture .
What happens next time ?
Now , this growing season , when yields need to be at record levels to avert disaster , what do we find ?
Floods or droughts in several of the breadbaskets of the world .
Whatever your plans are , I hope that you ’re ready to execute them ( or , better yet , are executing them ) .
I ’m pretty sure that most people have done nothing , and I do n’t know why this continues to amaze me .
How can so many people , even those who should know better , be content to hit the wall without doing anything at all to change course ?
This includes my own family , who lives in Southern California .
I view Southern California as one of the most dangerous death traps in the world .
Since it ’s such an important focus of economic activity , though , I like to keep tabs on herd activity there , just for my own situational awareness .
I ca n’t get a meaningful response from my dad — who thinks that traffic jams everywhere in the region and at all times of the day and night represent ‘ progress ’ — I emailed someone there who ’s about to flee to a country in Northern Europe .
I asked if there was even a subtle sense of panic setting in with regard to the food and fuel prices .
Here is part of the response I received :
I have noticed that most people do n’t even have instinct enough to panic and hoard , and they would n’t know * what * to hoard .
They do n’t cook , they do n’t know what a ‘ staple ’ means .
A young woman in my training last week brought animal crackers and cheese ruffles for breakfast , and a box of Cheezits and Coke Zero for lunch .
I asked her mockingly if she ’d tried fruit or vegetables , she said she could n’t afford them .
I once saw a woman behind me at Ralphs with food stamps , and she was buying cottage cheese , dry pinto beans , and wheat bread , and told her kid to put the Doritos back .
If you do n’t have that kind of sense to begin with , the current situation is not going to give it to you .
We ’re now well into a phase where system maintenance depends on the inability of the herd to grasp the nature of the immanent threat .
“ Yes , Kevin , ” you say .
“ Same as it ever was . ”
I do n’t think so .
The food situation is far off the radar screens of Joe Average .
It only becomes a problem after it ’s too late to do anything substantive to ameliorate conditions .
We ’ve already seen food riots , armed escorts for grain deliveries , rationing , sharply higher prices .
And still , I ’m mostly noticing yawns and drugged gurgles from the herd .
Meanwhile , the die is all but cast on this year ’s lower crop yields .
If the herd had any idea of what was coming , this show would be over inside of 24 hours .
You might be sick of reading this on Cryptogon , but , it ’s worth repeating : Use your time wisely .
Via : Financial Times :
Consumers were warned to expect even sharper increases in global food prices after US officials said that some of the country ’s best farmland was facing its worst flooding for 15 years .
Agriculture officials and traders said the damage could push up worldwide corn and soyabean prices , which have spiralled in recent days as floods have swamped crops in parts of Iowa , the US ’s biggest corn-producing state .
The warning comes at a time when high food prices are already sparking protests across the developing world .
Corn futures in Chicago this week rose to record highs of more than $ 8 a bushel on fears that up to 5 m acres of the crop could be lost , while soyabean prices hit a record of $ 15.93 a bushel .
Tom Jennings , acting director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture , said : “ The price of corn and the price of beans could rise more .
If we lose a lot of corn the prices will continue to go up . ”
The increase in the cost of corn and soyabeans – the two main feed crops for farm animals such as cows and chickens – increased the price of live cattle yesterday for the second day in a row , to the highest level in 22 years .
Mr Jennings said that the impact of the heavy rains was “ dramatic ” .
“ According to the emergency reports I ’m getting , we ’re above what happened in 1993 but we ’ll have to see how that tapers off as [ the rain water ] comes down the river , ” he told the Financial Times .
The Mississippi River broke through its levee system in 1993 , destroying about 1 m acres of crops and causing $ 20 bn of damage .
Lewis Hagedorn , of JPMorgan in Chicago , said that the losses were significant .
“ The risk of still - higher agricultural prices remains decisively distributed to the upside amid the fundamental need to ration demand in light of smaller supply , ” he said .
Greg Wagner , at Ag Resource in Chicago , added that corn prices could take a pause to assess the weather impact .
However , he warned : “ Additional price gains are likely as the market is prone to overshoot . ”
After weeks of heavy rains and low temperatures , the US Department of Agriculture said that only 57 per cent of the country ’s corn crop is in good or excellent condition , considerably less than the 70 per cent registered this time last year .
Local farmers in Illinois said that the bad weather had delayed planting by up to five weeks , which would result in a much reduced crop of corn and soyabeans .
Some farmers expected their corn production to be down by as much as 50 per cent from last year ’s level .
Agriculture traders described the problem graphically , saying that corn plants in Iowa or Illinois should now be reaching almost waist height , but due to the impact of the heavy rains and low temperatures were below knee - height .
They added that expensive nitrogen fertiliser – critical for the plants ’ development – has now been washed out from the fields by the rains .
For that reason , some farmers are likely to leave their land fallow and , instead , cash in their crop insurance policies , further reducing supply .

I think we should permanently cut off the internet access of any company that sends out three erroneous copyright notices .
Three strikes and you 're out , mate .
Having been disconnected , your customers can only find out about your product offerings by ringing you up and asking , or by requesting a printed brochure .
Perhaps you could give all your salespeople fax machines so they can fax urgent information up and down the supply chain .
And there 's always the phone – just make sure you 've got a bunch of phone books in the office , because you 'll never Google another phone number .
Call it a modest proposal in the Swiftian sense if you must , but I 'm deadly serious .
You see , the big copyright companies – record labels , broadcasters , film studios , software companies – are lobbying in the halls of power around the world ( including Westminster ) for a three strikes rule for copyright infringers .
They want to oblige internet service providers ( ISPs ) to sever the broadband links of any customer who has been thrice accused of downloading infringing material , and to oblige web - hosting companies to terminate the accounts of anyone accused of sticking infringing material on a web server three times .
They 're not even proposing that this punishment should be reserved for convicted infringers .
Proving infringement is slow and expensive – so much so that the Motion Picture Association of America just filed a brief with the US court considering the appeal of Jammie Thomas , a woman
sentenced to pay $ 222,000 in fines for downloading music , in which the trade association argued that they should never have to prove infringement to collect damages , since proof is so hard to come by .
I mean , it 's not as though internet access is something important right ?
In the past week , I 've only used the internet to contact my employers around the world , my MP in the UK , to participate in a European Commission expert proceeding , to find out why my infant daughter has broken out in tiny pink polka - dots , to communicate with a government whistle - blower who wants to know if I can help publish evidence of official corruption , to provide references for one former student ( and follow - up advice to another ) , book my plane tickets , access my banking records , navigate the new Home Office immigration rules governing my visa , wire money to help pay for the headstone for my great uncle 's grave in Russia , and to send several Father 's Day cards ( and receive some of my own ) .
The internet is only that wire that delivers freedom of speech , freedom of assembly , and freedom of the press in a single connection .
It 's only
vital to the livelihood , social lives , health , civic engagement , education and leisure of hundreds of millions of people ( and growing every day ) .
This trivial bit of kit is so unimportant that it 's only natural that we equip the companies that brought us Police Academy 11 , Windows Vista , Milli Vanilli and Celebrity Dancing
With the Stars with wire - cutters that allow them to disconnect anyone in the country on their own say - so , without proving a solitary act of wrongdoing .
But if that magic wire is indeed so trivial , they wo n't mind if we hold them to the same standard , right ?
The sloppy , trigger - happy litigants who sue dead people and children , who accused a laser printer of downloading the new Indiana Jones movie , who say that proof of wrongdoing is too much to ask for – if these firms believe that being disconnected from the internet is such a trivial annoyance , they should be willing to put up with the same minor irritation at corporate HQ and the satellite offices , right ?
India Energy Subsidies Run Up Government Debt
Subsidiies to keep down domestic energy and food prices are running on the government debt in India .
The government also subsidizes 60 % of the price of such fuels as diesel .
In 2007 , when inflation was a low 3 % , economists such as Standard & Poor 's Subir Gokarn urged New Delhi to start cutting subsidies .
Instead , the populist ruling Congress government spent $ 25 billion on waiving loans made to farmers and hiking bureaucrats ' salaries .
Botched Opportunities
Now those expenditures , plus an additional $ 25 billion on upcoming fertilizer subsidies , is adding $ 100 billion a yearor 10 % of India 's gross domestic product , or equivalent to the country 's entire collection of income taxes to the national bill .
The Indian government can not sustain this foolish policy indefinitely .
The government 's official debt , which dropped below 6 % of gross domestic product last year , will now be closer to 10 % this year .
Socialistic policies are alive and well all over the globe .
But India 's government has chosen market interferences that are especially hard to sustain .
Oil prices are set to go much higher .
India 's people will have a much harder time adjusting to higher energy prices when the government finally can't sustain subsidies and the prices inevitably rise to higher levels very rapidly .
The rate of price rise will be even faster when the deregulation comes than it would have been had world market price changes had immediately translated into price changes in India .
With inflation over 11 % in India the Indian government is restricting exports of a variety of products in order to keep down costs .
To contain inflation that has tripled in the past seven months , the government yesterday banned exports of corn after restricting overseas sales of food items including wheat , rice , cooking oils and pulses .
India had earlier banned cement exports and imposed a tax on outgoing shipments of steel products .
These export bans only help in the short run since the resulting lower prices reduce incentives to increase productive capacity .
China suffers from similar distortions .
But the Chinese government has a much larger pile of money to use to hold down internal energy prices .
Also , the Chinese are letting some adjustments toward higher prices to take place .
Update : India is not alone with 10 + % inflation .
Economists at investment bank Morgan Stanley found that about 50 nations show consumer prices up 10 percent or more from a year ago .
They warn that some central banks feel constrained , because they are focused on maintaining currency exchange rates against the US dollar .
A weak dollar has caused loose monetary policy in nations with such " dollar - pegged " currencies .
These high inflation rates and the problem with oil production rates makes me think a global recession is inevitable in the next 2 years .
By a BBC reporter in southern Burma
Thousands of people in the area have received no aid You do not have to travel too far out of Rangoon to smell the stench of death .
Rotting animals lie bloated in the paddy fields , but there are human corpses here too , lying under the wreckage of trees and buildings flattened by last Saturday 's storm .
In those areas closest to the capital there are also signs that a little aid is getting through : a few Burmese army vehicles could be seen distributing food on Friday .
Locals said the military had arrived a day earlier to help clear the bodies away .
We saw a lone helicopter in the sky overhead , but the aid is meagre , sporadic and completely inadequate for the scale of this disaster .
Desperation Thousands of people in this area have received nothing .
On one stretch of road dozens of families sat next to makeshift shelters .
Many people have fled to safety , abandoning all their belongings
One man told how he had escaped to higher ground with his family as the waters started to rise .
He had survived , but lost all his belongings .
He had little to start with , now he has lost everything .
No clothes left but the ones on his back , no food other than the rice he could carry that night , scooped up into the bowl of his hat .
He had had something to eat on Friday , and would maybe again tomorrow .
Next week depends on the Burmese government .
All across this area families were desperately trying to dry out their sacks of rice drenched by the flood , even spreading the grains across the road to catch the Sun 's rays .
If not enough rice is salvaged , even the better off here will struggle without help .
Already this storm promises long - term misery for a country that goes hungry , even without a cyclone .
' Frustration turning to anger '
In the town of Kungyangon , things did seem a little better .
There are fears that diseases may be spreading in the storm - hit areas
The military had arrived and the Red Cross hospital was open again .
But a few miles away there was nothing to mitigate this calamity .
" Children dead !
Old men dead !
Old woman dead !
No food ! " one man shouted .
But no assistance had arrived at all .
There was no doubt who he blamed , saying " the government " was " no good " .
He then made a sign of a gun , as if to shoot the people in the government responsible .
In a country as repressive as Burma , that is an extraordinary act of defiance against the generals presiding over this disaster .
It is a sign of the frustration felt here , and across much of southern Burma at how inadequate the relief operation has been .
It is frustration that is turning to anger - even though the majority are unaware that just over an hour 's flight away - in Bangkok - food , medicine , shelter and expertise lie waiting on the region 's airfields , ready to arrive , but prevented from coming by Burma 's leaders .

What are these ?
Washington has become Versailles .
We are ruled , entertained and informed by courtiers .
The popular media are courtiers .
The Democrats , like the Republicans , are courtiers .
Our pundits and experts are courtiers .
We are captivated by the hollow stagecraft of political theater as we are ruthlessly stripped of power .
It is smoke and mirrors , tricks and con games .
We are being had .
The past week was a good one if you were a courtier .
We were instructed by the high priests on television over the past few days to mourn a Sunday morning talk show host , who made $ 5 million a year and who gave a platform to the powerful and the famous so they could spin , equivocate and lie to the nation .
We were repeatedly told by these television courtiers , people like Tom Brokaw and Wolf Blitzer , that this talk show host was one of our nation ’s greatest journalists , as if sitting in a studio , putting on makeup and chatting with Dick Cheney or George W. Bush have much to do with journalism .
No journalist makes $ 5 million a year .
No journalist has a comfortable , cozy relationship with the powerful .
No journalist believes that acting as a conduit , or a stenographer , for the powerful is a primary part of his or her calling .
Those in power fear and dislike real journalists .
Ask Seymour Hersh and Amy Goodman how often Bush or Cheney has invited them to dinner at the White House or offered them an interview .
All governments lie , as I.F.
Stone pointed out , and it is the job of the journalist to do the hard , tedious reporting to shine a light on these lies .
It is the job of courtiers , those on television playing the role of journalists , to feed off the scraps tossed to them by the powerful and never question the system .
In the slang of the profession , these television courtiers are “ throats . ”
These courtiers , including the late Tim Russert , never gave a voice to credible critics in the buildup to the war against Iraq .
They were too busy playing their roles as red- blooded American patriots .
They never fought back in their public forums against the steady erosion of our civil liberties and the trashing of our Constitution .
These courtiers blindly accept the administration ’s current propaganda to justify an attack on Iran .
They parrot this propaganda .
They dare not defy the corporate state .
The corporations that employ them make them famous and rich .
It is their Faustian pact .
No class of courtiers , from the eunuchs behind Manchus in the 19th century to the Baghdad caliphs of the Abbasid caliphate , has ever transformed itself into a responsible elite .
Courtiers are hedonists of power .
Our Versailles was busy this past week .
The Democrats passed the FISA bill , which provides immunity for the telecoms that cooperated with the National Security Agency ’s illegal surveillance over the past six years .
This bill , which when signed means we will never know the extent of the Bush White House ’s violation of our civil liberties , is expected to be adopted by the Senate .
Barack Obama has promised to sign it in the name of national security .
The bill gives the U.S. government a license to eavesdrop on our phone calls and e-mails .
It demolishes our right to privacy .
It endangers the work of journalists , human rights workers , crusading lawyers and whistle - blowers who attempt to expose abuses the government seeks to hide .
These private communications can be stored indefinitely and disseminated , not just to the U.S. government but to other governments as well .
The bill , once signed into law , will make it possible for those in power to identify and silence anyone who dares to make public information that defies the official narrative .
Being a courtier , and Obama is one of the best , requires agility and eloquence .
The most talented of them can be lauded as persuasive actors .
They entertain us .
They make us feel good .
They convince us they are our friends .
We would like to have dinner with them .
They are the smiley faces of a corporate state that has hijacked the government and is raping the nation .
When the corporations make their iron demands , these courtiers drop to their knees , whether to placate the telecommunications companies that fund their campaigns and want to be protected from lawsuits , or to permit oil and gas companies to rake in obscene profits and keep in place the vast subsidies of corporate welfare doled out by the state .
We cannot differentiate between illusion and reality .
We trust courtiers wearing face powder who deceive us in the name of journalism .
We trust courtiers in our political parties who promise to fight for our interests and then pass bill after bill to further corporate fraud and abuse .
We confuse how we feel about courtiers like Obama and Russert with real information , facts and knowledge .
We chant in unison with Obama that we want change , we yell “ yes we can , ” and then stand dumbly by as he coldly votes away our civil liberties .
The Democratic Party , including Obama , continues to fund the war .
It refuses to impeach Bush and Cheney .
It allows the government to spy on us without warrants or cause .
And then it tells us it is our salvation .
This is a form of collective domestic abuse .
And , as so often happens in the weird pathology of victim and victimizer , we keep coming back for more .

Climate change means that creeping deserts may eventually drive 135 million people off their land , the United Nations estimates .
Most of them are in the developing world .
But Southern Europe is experiencing the problem now , its climate drying to the point that it is becoming more like Africa ’s , scientists say .
For Murcia , the arrival of the water crisis has been accelerated by developers and farmers who have hewed to water - hungry ventures highly unsuited to a drier , warmer climate : crops like lettuce that need ample irrigation , resorts that promise a swimming pool in the yard , acres of freshly sodded golf courses that sop up millions of gallons a day .
“ I come under a lot of pressure to release water from farmers and also from developers , ” said Antonio Pérez Gracia , the water manager here in Fortuna , sipping coffee with farmers in a bar in the town ’s dusty square .
He rued the fact that he could provide each property owner with only 30 percent of its government - determined water allotment .
“ I ’m not sure what we ’ll do this summer , ” he added , noting that the local aquifer was sinking so quickly that the pumps would not reach it soon .
“ I come under a lot of pressure to release water , from farmers and also from developers .
They can complain as much as they want , but if there ’s no more water , there ’s no more water . ”
Rubén Vives , a farmer who relies on Mr. Pérez Gracia ’s largess , said he could not afford the black market water prices .
“ This year , my livelihood is in danger , ” said Mr. Vives , who has farmed low - water crops like lemons here for nearly two decades .

The land of southern Spain has dried , leading to rationing and disputes over water .
Credit ... Monica Gumm for The International Herald Tribune
The hundreds of thousands of wells  most of them illegal  that have in the past provided a temporary reprieve from thirst have depleted underground water to the point of no return .
Water from northern Spain that was once transferred here has also slowed to a trickle , as wetter northern provinces are drying up , too .
CAHOKIA , Ill . 
Even as many found cheer that floodwaters along the Mississippi River here would fall well short of what had been predicted , residents and the authorities in this town discovered a stark reminder of what might lie ahead : a sand boil on the aged levee that protects the town , a telltale sign that the swollen river had begun eroding the structure from beneath .
“ I did n’t even know what a sand boil was , ” Mayor Frank Bergman said as he surveyed the waterlogged levee , referring to the mix of sand and water that bubbles up from the ground .
“ But it ’s clearly time to upgrade our levees and keep our system safe . ”
The flooding that has claimed 24 lives and forced thousands to evacuate across six states continued Sunday , as the Mississippi crested in the northern Missouri town of Canton .
Just upriver from St. Louis , Winfield , Mo. , and Grafton , Ill. , continued battling rising waters .
Forecasters from the National Weather Service predicted that floodwaters would begin receding in the St. Louis area later this week .
As the river at nearby St. Louis leveled out at around 12 feet below the record set during the 1993 flood and about two feet below what had been predicted for the weekend , investigators had identified and contained several more boils on the levee , and the marshland that sits just behind it had crept to within 100 yards of the village hall .
There is a buy - it - now listing on eBay today where the seller is offering $ 630 in cash , which he will send electronically to the buyer through PayPal .
The current price for this listing is $ 715 .
Why would someone pay $ 715 for $ 630 in cash ?
Well , you may have heard that Microsoft recently launched a ridiculous “ cash back ” promotion in the hopes of bribing Google customers to switch to Microsoft ’s search engine , Live.com .
Seems some resourceful people found a loophole in the system .
Apparently , you can get a 10 - 35 % cash back reward for all buy - it - now eBay purchases if you access the eBay listing through Live Search .
So , people are simply selling cash and arbitraging the cash back reward .
Your move , Ballmer .
Electronic Arts has released details on Spore 's Creature Stage , the second phase of life in the upcoming evolution simulator from game designer Will Wright .
The Creature Stage is the point in Spore where your customized organism crawls from the primordial goo , grows legs ( or arms , or wings ) and begins life on land .
The overarching goal of the Creature Stage is to " gather DNA points as you interact with other creatures either socially or aggressively , " according to the gamemaker .
Though EA 's stated objective could n't possibly be more ambiguous , it 's the next line of the informational packet that 's really interesting : " Depending on how you played Cell Stage , your creature will begin Creature Stage with one of three super powers at its disposal . "
It 's nice to see these stages will translate into some kind of coherent life cycle as opposed to just individual , functionally separate game experiences .
Assuming it avoids further delays , Spore should hit store shelves this September .

Anarchy ’s for sale here .
You can buy it on the street for $ 49.99 , plus tax , in the form of studded belts , scuffed leather jackets , fingerless gloves , and Sex Pistols action figures .
But that did n’t stop Suvy , who is 18 years old , from arriving two months ago , straight out of juvie with a backpack and spiked hair — a simple decision , really , for a kid who thought of himself as a punk .
Such is the pull of the St. Marks mythology .
It ’s late afternoon , and though he ’s been drinking since he woke up around noon in a squat in Brooklyn , Suvy now plots his next beer .
He ’s sprawled with some of the usual guys on the sidewalk next to the abandoned falafel shop on St. Marks Place , a piece of prime real estate if you hang out on the street .
Suvy squatted inside for a while , until a man came in one night , found him in his sleeping bag , naked and wasted , and kicked him out .
“ I guess I did n’t pay my rent . ”
You ca n’t get away with anything around here anymore .
“ St. Marks used to be , like , a punk block , ” Suvy says .
“ It used to be overrun with punks .
Now it ’s like fucking BBQ Chicken and fucking Chipotle , whatever that fucking store is . ”
John Varvatos has taken over CBGB .
Trash & Vaudeville peddles overpriced punk trinkets to tourists .
That very day in Tompkins Square Park they ’ve set up a big stage , and there ’s an infestation of tweens in dance uniforms and glitter paint and families with juice bottles preening on the benches — a far cry from the park ’s glory days as a tent village for the city ’s lost and broken .
“ Everyone used to live there , ” Suvy says .
“ But then the cops came and bulldozed it , and now it ’s pretty much just a cop hot spot . ”
The halcyon days of the punk movement were over before Suvy was born , of course , but each year as the weather warms , hundreds of kids like him descend on St. Marks .
They ’ve learned the names of the bands .
They ’ve memorized the lyrics .
They ’ve carefully crafted the look , gotten the piercings , the tattoos .
They come hoping to tap into a scene that no longer exists , but in the process they ’ve accidentally created a new one , an ersatz summer camp of misfits and would - be rebels .
Some come from the boroughs or the suburbs ; for others , it ’s a stop on a migratory circuit that includes Portland , Oregon , and New Orleans .
Some are fleeing broken families , others just looking for adventure .
The common denominator seems to be not family , not class , not race , but merely a highly evolved sense of teenage angst , for which punk provides a ready - made , if recycled , outlet .
There are glam punks and goth punks and skater punks and ska punks .
Suvy ’s squatting partners Greg and Jamie are crustie punks — that ’s punk with a dash of hippie .
Jamie ’s girlfriend , Jazmin , is a metal punk .
Their friend Miquel is a hobo .
And Eric is a rockabilly punk who combs his green hair back fifties style .
Suvy calls himself a gutter punk — the closest thing , he says , to the original version .
He was kicked out of his home in Philly about a year ago because , he says , “ my parents are metal heads and they hate me . ”
He dropped out of school , couch - surfed for a while , then got picked up for breaking into houses .
After seven months in juvie , he had only one plan : getting himself to St. Marks Place .
“ I heard about St. Marks in a Casualties song , ” he says , “ so I ’m like , ‘ Wait a second , I want to hang out there . ’ ” That ’s what he was doing when he met Greg , who showed him places to squat .
He sometimes sleeps in an industrial building in Williamsburg , sometimes in the park , sometimes under a bridge by the East River , sometimes even with women who warm to his cherubic features and haphazard charisma .
A few more years of living this life and he wo n’t be so pretty .
“ Hey , what ’s up ? ” he calls out to a girl walking past in plaid pants and a Casualties shirt .
She pauses long enough for him to know he might have a chance .
“ You ’re really hot .
Come over here . ”
Up close , she ’s not as cool as she initially seemed .
She tells Suvy that she ’s a freshman at a high school in Brooklyn , which means first of all that she goes to school and second that she probably lives with her parents .
Then there ’s the striped glove she ’s wearing on one hand , which besides being impeccably clean is exactly the type of merchandise you purchase if you want to look punk .
Still , she ’s cute , voluptuous and freckled , and Suvy aims to impress .

“ You guys should have been here the first day I came to New York , like right after I got out of being locked up , ” he drawls , looking over to make sure she ’s listening .
“ My alcohol tolerance was so low I ’d be passed out every day , like drunk in the middle of the sidewalk .
I ’d be yelling at people , like , ‘ Fuck you ! ’ ”
The girl , Mariya , giggles and twists a strand of streaked hair around her finger .
“ Fuck you ! ”
Suvy yells , inspired , at an unremarkable hipster walking past .
“ I fucking hate yuppies . ”
“ Yuppies are assholes , ” Miquel agrees .
“ This is St. Marks .
They should go away . ”
“ They have no culture .
They have no history .
They ’re like plastic . ”
“ Of course , I do n’t discriminate , ” Suvy reasons , grinning at Mariya .
“ I hate everybody besides punks . ”
Punk , says Suvy , is “ the only view that makes sense to me . ”
Work is for yuppies .
Rent is for yuppies .
Shelter is a basic human right .
The government is bullshit .
Corporations are bullshit .
He “ fucks capitalism ” by pissing in the corner of the Dunkin ’ Donuts .
“ No one has a right to tell anyone else what to do , ” Greg says .
“ Like , it ’s your life , you should be in control of it .
I do n’t pay for anything — just drugs .
They do n’t tax drug dealers . ”
“ Hey , you guys want to see that punk show ? ”
Suvy suddenly asks .
Rumors have been circulating of a free show that night in Bushwick .
The question is how to get sufficiently blasted to appreciate it .
Greg thinks he knows where they can get ecstasy for $ 15 a pill , but who has that kind of money ?
Eric agrees with Suvy that Elmer ’s glue or rubber cement might be the best solution , if they can find some .
“ You should come to the show , ” Suvy tells Mariya as she nestles next to him .
Make no mistake : A house punk , who can go home at night , is not a punk punk .
“ MySpace punks , ” Jazmin calls them .
“ Like , ‘ Oh , Mom , I want a pair of bondage pants ! ’ ”
She grows suddenly shy , peeking out at him from behind her bangs .
“ I sneaked out , ” she admits .
“ I have to get home . ”
“ Man . ” Suvy looks crestfallen .
“ The show ’s free . ”
He pours from a brown - bagged Colt 45 into a McDonald ’s cup , and she downs it in one gulp before writing her number on his arm in black Magic Marker .
When she leaves , she gives him her glove and a quick kiss .
“ Mariya ’s a hottie , ” Miquel comments , watching her go .
“ She ’s a mall goth , ” Jazmin tells Suvy , disapprovingly .
“ That ’s so lame . ”
Suvy glares at her .
“ I do n’t care , dude .
I still like her . ”
“ You like her for who she is , right ? ” Jazmin asks , rolling her eyes .
Alex and Toast are waiting for them on the steps outside Saint Mark ’s Church on 10th Street and Second Avenue .
Alex goes to college , but during summer break he comes down to the city from Westchester to get stoned .
Toast lives in Queens and wears Armani glasses and calls himself Toast “ because I ’m always toasted . ”
They ’re both house punks , meaning that they have homes they sleep in every night and at least some money , and for this the squatter kids — even the ones from the city who can go home when it rains or if they need a good meal — find them both slightly suspicious and also intermittently useful for buying things like beer and weed .
But make no mistake : A house punk is not a punk punk .
They water down what ’s left of the scene .
“ Now it ’s a bunch of fucking kids who are like , ‘ Ooh , I ’m punk , I ’m punk ! ’ ” says Greg .
“ They think they know a few bands and they think that gives them the right to call themselves whatever they want and they fucking run around and then they go back home to their white , suburban comfort zone . ”
“ MySpace punks , ” Jazmin calls them .
“ Like , ‘ Oh , Mom , I want a pair of bondage pants ! ’ ”
The squatter kids mostly get by with spanging ( spare - changing ) , especially Greg , who ’s disconcertingly thin .
Suvy picks up cash from the tourists who come to St. Marks hoping to see someone just like him and who pay , a dollar a shot , for the privilege of taking his picture to show the folks back home : Look , punk is still alive !
Tonight they and their limited funds have n’t managed to scrounge up anything stronger than alcohol , but Toast has pot , which he ’s packed into a one - hitter — a small pipe painted to look like a cigarette — and there ’s a chance that he ’ll share .
He holds the pipe covertly as the others gather around , lounging on the clammy steps .
The churchyard usually makes a good place to hang out — far back from the street , enclosed by a fence .
But tonight proves unlucky .
They had barely settled in when two stocky cops amble out of the darkness and pull Toast to his feet .
“ You got any more weed on you ? ” the younger one asks , cinching a pair of handcuffs .
Photo : Rona Yefman
“ Um , I do n’t know . ”
Toast ’s voice is tiny .
Unlike some of the squatter kids , he ’s never been arrested .
“ You got any I.D. ? ”
“ Yes , sir .
In my pocket . ”
The young cop rummages in Toast ’s pants , while the other checks out his one - hitter for debris .
“ Let ’s go .
You ’re coming with us .
Gonna spend the night in jail , all right ? ”
Alex asks if he can follow his friend to the station , but they cut him off .
“ What , you want to get arrested , too ? ”
The cops lead Toast away .
For a few seconds , no one speaks .
Then Miquel whistles through his teeth .
“ Dude , that was fucking nuts . ”
“ What the fuck was that ? ” Eric asks .
“ Dude , we ca n’t stay around here , ” Suvy says .
“ They know we ’re all fucked up . ”
If there ’s one thing Suvy hates more than anything else , it ’s cops .
In addition to the anarchy sign tattooed at the base of his thumb and the inverted cross on his middle finger , he has ACAB inked between his knuckles .
All. Cops. Are. Bastards .
“ Let ’s just go , ” he says .
“ Let ’s go to this show .
Where is this show ? ”
“ Um , ” Alex mutters .
“ I think the guy who knew just got arrested . ”
Turns out the show is at a place called the Wreck Room in Bushwick , which would n’t necessarily be worth the subway ride to get there if it did n’t have the reputation as a decent spot to hear punk .
“ Let ’s go , let ’s go , let ’s go ! ” Suvy chants .
Music is important to him ; it ’s what drew him to the punk scene in the first place .
“ Like , when I was a little kid , I had so much anger and shit , ” he says .
“ I listened to a whole bunch of different music , but the only thing that really touched me was punk .
It ’s a good way to , like , express your anger . ”
The thought of this concert gets him so worked up that he drops his beer .
As the others egg him on , he kneels down to slurp it off the street .
In the L station at 14th Street and First Avenue , they wait until they can hear the train coming before jumping the turnstile , a trick to keep the attendant from having time to stop them .
Eric , Miquel , and Alex squeeze into a car just in time , but the door closes on Suvy , Jamie , Greg , and Jazmin .
Luckily , the guy on duty is n’t paying attention .
They reunite in Brooklyn , clambering out of the subway and back into the night , a ragtag parade of dyed hair and patches , ripped pants and piercings .
No one knows exactly where the bar is , so they try first one street , then another , filing quickly past the low - slung warehouses , the gloomy garages .
The night has grown blustery and rain darkens the deserted pavement .
“ Where the fuck are we ? ” Jazmin asks to a round of silence .
Finally , they see a glow of light in the distance : a storefront with fluorescent beer signs illuminating the window .
From outside , you can hear the muffled pulse of a heavy drumbeat and the hum of a crowd .
Jazmin grabs Jamie ’s hand excitedly .
Suvy smoothes up his Mohawk in anticipation .
Once inside , though , their faces fall .
The front room is riddled with hipsters , the current incarnation of yuppie scum , lined up at the bar .
In the small back room where the band is playing , there are only a handful of people , not nearly enough for a mosh pit .
And even if there were , the music could hardly inspire any thrashing about .
The band is a joke — a bunch of paunchy guys in their forties flopping around on a plywood stage .
“ I used to be able to jump higher , but I ’ve put on some weight over the years , ” the lead singer admits between songs .
This is not punk .
Suvy is disgusted .
“ I want to die young .
Once I hit like 30 , I want to start being really self - destructive and just see what happens .
Like ride around in cars really fast and do crazy stuff — even though I already do that now , so I ca n’t really say I ’m going to do it . ”
The rest of them just stand there , dumbfounded , or plop down in the folding chairs that border the walls .
“ Eric , you lose cool points for taking me here , ” says Greg .
“ Fuck this shit , ” Suvy adds with disdain .
After five minutes , they decide that there ’s no point in sticking around .
They head back to St. Marks .
It may not be punk anymore either , but as Suvy says , “ It ’s not gonna help it just by leaving , abandoning it , you know ?
You ’d be just as bad as these yuppies coming in and making stores . ”
At least it ’s got people , like them , trying to be punk .
At least it ’s got history , the faint residue of New York in the eighties .
“ And New York in the eighties , ” Suvy says with authority , “ was insane . ”
The Maine Marine Patrol is considering purchasing a “ sonic cannon ” capable of broadcasting earsplitting , “ disorienting ” sounds , like those that have been used to break up peaceful demonstrations in public spaces in Iraq and the country of Georgia .
The device , called a “ long - range acoustic device ” ( LRAD ) , is described by its manufacturer , the California - based American Technology Corporation , as having the ability to emit an “ attention - getting and highly irritating tone for behavior modification . ”
( The company ’s Web site helpfully adds that the device , which costs roughly $ 20,000 , is two feet in diameter , and weighs 60 pounds , has been used “ in combat since December 2003 . ” )
A demonstration model on loan from the manufacturer was tested in Maine over the July 4 holiday weekend by Marine Patrol officers interested in another aspect of the device : its capability to broadcast highly directed sound that can reach people as far as a mile away — for example to communicate with a boat approaching a security zone , according to Marine Patrol Major John Fetterman .
That was one of the intents of the device when it was invented for the US military in response to the failure of a security zone to protect the USS Cole from a suicide - bomber ’s attack in a Yemeni port in 2000 .
That attack killed 17 sailors .
But it was n’t the LRAD ’s only purpose , nor the most worrisome to those who might be more inclined to peaceful assemblies than attacks on warships .
The manufacturer ’s Web site touts another “ feature ” of the LRAD — its “ warning ” sound .
That tone can be as loud as 151 decibels , which is enough to cause permanent hearing damage to a person as far as 1000 feet away after just a few seconds of exposure .
So if a Marine Patrol officer even accidentally switched the device over to “ warning ” mode from its more benign “ communication ” mode , it could literally and permanently deafen anyone in its line of fire .
According to news reports , the warning tones from LRADs , which can be mounted on trucks as well as boats , have been used against civilians by Iraqi police and US troops in Iraq over the past few years , and were used in November 2007 by police in Tblisi , Georgia , to disperse an anti-government rally .
( The New York Police Department deployed at least one LRAD near a demonstration outside the Republican National Convention in September 2004 , but did n’t use the warning tone . )
The most - often touted “ success ” of the device ’s warning tone was in defense of a Carnival Cruise Lines cruise ship attacked by pirates firing assault rifles and rocket - propelled grenades off the coast of Somalia in 2005 .
While it did repel the attack , one of the two men who used the device against the pirates says he has lost some of his hearing as a result .
But perhaps we can take some comfort in Fetterman ’s remark that if the Marine Patrol did buy an LRAD , it would probably buy “ only one ” and move it from boat to boat as needed .
And he says the agency is “ only looking at it for communications , ” not for crowd - dispersal purposes .

The Best ‘ Crap ’ Museum
In Asia contrasting things are very popular ; sweet and sour , yin and yang , etc .
The Japanese are not immune to this associating of opposites .
In April and May of this year in Himeji , Japan , there was a Confectionery Exposition and a Poop Museum Exhibit going on at the same time , but thankfully in different venues .
What the sign says :
Everybody come and play !
Come and look !
We have poop books !
Rabbit :
It ’s poop time !
Gorilla : Come and see my poop too !
Elephant : Animal poop is here yo !
See it .
Touch it !
Smell it !
Explore !
Can you guess what animals made this poop ?
( 3 pictures )
Just imagine leaving displays of beautiful candy castles and then gazing upon poop ( unchi ) in cute little boxes just like Easter Candy .
The Poop Museum Exhibit had displays of poop from all sorts of animals , books and diagrams concerning how poop is made , and videos of poop in the making , a virtual one - stop poop emporium .
One of the books was even made out of recycled elephant poop , and though I might read it , I would n’t lick my fingers to turn the pages .
The Poop Museum Exhibit should tour the world ; it could be a life saver .
Every time you stumble upon a pile of poop you ’ll be able to immediately determine whether it ’s just a Cocker Spaniel dump or if a lion is in the neighborhood .

Ivan sits in the passenger seat of a dusty white SUV , fidgeting nervously .
The trim Uruguayan shakes a Marlboro loose from the pack and stares out the window as if he 's searching for something .
He has the rough hands of a carpenter but is dressed more like a J.
Crew model in a starched , black , buttoned - down shirt and jeans .
His smooth , handsome face is childlike for a man of 34 , but today , his brow is furrowed .
It 's 9:50 a.m. Almost time .
After he and a friend roll past the suburban shopping centers and faded , one - story houses of east Hialeah , they pull into a parking lot next to a towering gray courthouse on East Sixth Street .
A portly , wavy - haired woman in a purple blouse is waiting .
Her name is Eunice Lopez , and when Ivan spots her , he feels nauseated .
Outside the car , he twists his head around to see if anyone is watching , then walks over to her .
" Hi , " he says softly , carefully .
" How do you want to do this ? "
" We 'll do it first , " she replies .
" Then the money . "
With businesslike efficiency , the unlikely couple marches into the courthouse .
They step through a metal detector and turn down a hallway that smells like bleach .
At a sign that reads " Marriage Licenses , " they stop .
The dull beige room is empty , aside from an older couple that waits joylessly on a wooden bench .
Soon , Ivan and Eunice are ushered into a locked room .
After taking a deep breath , he holds out a clammy hand .
She reaches for it , and he feels her plump fingers lock with his .
" Even the moment of the wedding , I knew I was doing something bad , " he would say later .
" But it was like watching a movie ; it did n't feel like it was happening to me . "
The ceremony room is nothing special : small and white with forest - green carpeting and a cheap black podium as the centerpiece .
The bride and groom stand awkwardly in front of a black - haired notary who prepares to power through the vows .
To one side are hokey pink cutouts of cupids taped to a window — leftovers from Valentine 's Day .
To the other : a painting of a woman in a wedding gown bent happily over a contract , signing her name .
When it comes time to kiss his new wife , Ivan closes his eyes .
Afterward , underneath an arch , they pose for photos .
Eunice holds a bouquet of plastic baby 's breath .
Ivan ( not his real name ) is a virgin when it comes to breaking the law .
But he plays it cool once they 've left the courthouse :
He slips Eunice an envelope .
Inside is $ 4,000 in crisp $ 100 bills .
Ivan 's May 2006 marriage to Eunice Lopez was a guaranteed way to get a green card .
That much he knew .
But two days after the wedding , he could n't find her anywhere .
" That 's when I thought , I am such an asshole , " he says .
" I tried her cell phone , but it was disconnected .
I went to her house , but neighbors told me she had moved . "
It got worse .
He would later learn that she had wed at least nine other men — and possibly as many as 16 .
Together , Eunice Lopez , boyfriend Rodneys Gonzalez , and her Hialeah - based Cuban - American family have racked up 32 felony charges of bigamy over five years .
The sham is among the clumsiest and most lucrative marriage operations ever prosecuted in Miami - Dade County , the nation 's most concentrated immigrant community .
With phony weddings going for up to $ 15,000 a pop , the clan garnered hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Even bigger — likely the largest sting of its kind — was " Operation Knot So Fast . "
Four months ago , Central Florida prosecutors indicted 83 people in one week for running and participating in Mafia - style businesses that paired Americans with foreigners seeking status .
That trumped a 2006 Southern California crackdown called " Operation Newlywed Game " that indicted 44 and one in North Texas that took in 16 .
With an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States — and both presidential candidates pushing for stronger border and workplace enforcement — busts will certainly rise .
Even so , well - executed rings are almost unstoppable .
" You have a better chance of getting hit by lightning " than being arrested for marriage fraud , says Michael Cutler , who worked as an Immigration and Naturalization Service agent and adjudicator in New York for 30 years .
" [ Authorities ] do n't have the will or the resources . "
A few days before Thanksgiving 2004 , James Sirls awoke hung over in a boxy white van near Orlando International Airport .
He pulled a crumpled bar napkin from his pocket and scanned an address scratched in pen .
Heavy - set and happy - go - lucky , the 42 - year - old had a scruffy mustache - goatee combo .
He stared down at the address ; it defined his mission for the morning .
With a turn of the ignition , he started the van and drove to an office sandwiched between a DMV branch and a Wendy 's in an L - shaped complex off State Road 50 near Clermont .
Outside the offices of All Kind Services , an advertisement for passport photographs was painted on the windows .
As Sirls entered , chatty Hispanic couples were leaving .
Once inside , he sat down with 13 Americans around a conference table .
Eventually , 14 South American immigrants were called in .
Couples were then paired off by age .
Sirls spotted a fancy champagne bottle and several glasses on a nearby table .
He downed one and then another .
About the time he got a nice , warm buzz going , he and a homely , pale brunet named Laura Garcia migrated to a back room , where a cream - colored plastic wedding cake sat on a table .
On a rack hung men's suits of all sizes and styles .
Nearby were women 's wedding dresses .
The pragmatic folks just slid them on over their own clothes .
Flipping through the suits , Sirls opted for a dark - blue jacket to fit his 5 - foot - 9 , 255 - pound frame .
Then he set down his drink and smiled for the photographer , who snapped a picture of him and his bride with a disposable camera .
The photo , and others like it , would later be used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) as evidence , seized during a 2005 warrant search of All Kind Services .
Agents would make note of the same plastic wedding cake in many other couples ' photos .
( Three and a half years later , this past July 8 , Sirls pleaded guilty to marriage fraud .
He awaits sentencing . )
The week of May 10 , after a four - year investigation , agents fanned out across Central Florida from Orlando to Sarasota , Fort Myers , Cocoa Beach , Tampa , and Jacksonville .
They collared 83 men and women .
Half of them were immigrants , mostly from Central and South America .
Nearly all were brides and grooms .
News of it was blasted around the world .
At a news conference the week of the arrests , Robert O'Neill , U.S. attorney for Florida 's Middle District , showed a photo of one " couple " who had wed at All Kind Services .
An Argentine man named Hugo Luppu posed with a tall , thin woman named Angelia Raimer .
" In these photographs , there are no pictures of people in the audience , " O'Neill said .
" They 're having photos taken to make it look like these sham marriages are legitimate . "
Raimer and Luppu were two of 17 people indicted from All Kind Services , which was one of four Orlando - area businesses cited .
The others were called A - 3 and American Solutions .
A fourth , with no name , was run by a Venezuelan businessman named Ender Rodriguez .
Defense attorneys said the rings worked like this :
Owners sent out recruiters to find broke U.S. citizens and immigrants with expired status .
They hung around bars and hunted down prospects through friends — and earned commissions for each person who agreed to participate .
" If it were a drug case , [ the recruiter ] would be like the delivery boy , " explains Kyle Fletcher , Raimer 's lawyer .
Immigrants generally paid $ 4,000 to $ 10,000 for the marriages .
Of that , about $ 1,300 paid for application and license fees , and a fixed percentage went to leaders of the rings — usually two or three owners .
The rest was left for the citizen and the recruiter to haggle over .
Sirls was typical of the Americans they nabbed .
On a Sunday in November 2004 , he sat slumped over a drink at Shooters sports bar in southeast Orlando .
It was two - for - one Corona night , and he was swigging from a lukewarm bottle , watching sports on television .
There were plenty of sorrows to drown :
His wife had kicked him out and filed for divorce .
His boss had laid him off .
And for the past few weeks , he'd been living in a van and showering at truck stops .
With a little cash left over from working construction jobs , he paid for food and took out his teenaged daughter now and then .
" He 's a hard - working guy with no priors , " says his lawyer , R. Fletcher Peacock .
" He 's a pretty straight shooter . "
Around 11 p.m. , he gulped down the last of his beer , ordered another , and handed the bartender some cash .
" I was drinking my last five dollars , " he remembers .
As he paid , a Hispanic man who spoke good English approached .
" He saw I was depressed , and he came and sat down beside me , " Sirls recalls .
After some small talk , the man offered him $ 1,500 to sign his name on a marriage license .
He would just have some photos taken and be on his way .
The man scribbled the address of All Kind Services on a napkin and slid it across the bar .
" Be here tomorrow morning , " he said .
The $ 1,500 was just enough to rent a U - Haul truck and drive to Miami , where Sirls had family .
" I needed to get the hell out of Orlando , " he says .
So he showed up the next day , and when it came time to kiss his wife — whose face he now can't recall — he gave her a quick peck for the camera .
Sirls had almost forgotten about the day of champagne and tuxedos when the phone rang last spring .
It was his sister in Atlanta with news that the FBI had come looking for him .
He made some arrangements to take time off from a new job driving trucks and returned to Orlando to turn himself in .
" I wanted to take care of it , " he explains .
His indictment states he " knowingly entered into a marriage for the purpose of evading provision (s ) of immigration law . "
" Most of these people would never do this if they thought there was some other option , " attorney Peacock says .
" Obviously , they 're desperate . "
At a hearing June 13 in downtown Orlando , several American citizens including Raimer pleaded guilty .
The Melbourne native wore her thick hair tied in a bun and held hands with her sister until she was called before a judge .
Her attorney , Kyle Fletcher , then explained that the young mother had been living in a motel and was hurting for money when a man she called " Biggie " approached her in early 2005 .
Although ringleaders forged Raimer 's signature on some papers , Fletcher pointed out that his client could face six months in prison .
" It 's a shame she 'll be adjudicated a felon , " he says .
" It 's not a heinous crime . "
Dozens of requests from New Times for comment from those indicted — by phone and in person — were declined .
Two spoke briefly .
At an Orlando apartment complex overlooking a dirt field , Luisa ( not her real name ) told the story of her dramatic 7 a.m. arrest .
" This country is putting fear into immigrants , " she said with tired eyes .
" I 'll be happy to go back to Uruguay . "
José Luis Class , another of the 83 arrested , stood outside his flat - top Orlando house on a rainy Friday .
" Right now , I 'm looking at zero to six , and I want to keep it that way , " he said .
" I did it as a favor to a friend , and it backfired . "
Sirls entered a plea of guilty three weeks ago and , because of his clean record , is looking at probation .
Others will face much more .
All but one of those arrested have been released on bond and await sentencing .
To date , none has been deported , according to ICE .
But those found guilty will be promptly sent back to their countries .
University of Miami immigration law professor David Abraham , who has taught and practiced for 30 years , says the situation is unheard of .
" In all these years , I have never seen a case under this section of the statute , " he says .
" To now use criminal sanctions on the immigrant is a new frontier .
It 's a step up in enforcement . "
The sound of a woman screaming echoes through a large , white , 1920s house in Miami's Design District .
Upstairs , in a sage - green master bedroom , a couple is arguing in Spanish .
Susana Baker , a pretty , tan 50 - year - old , is sobbing .
Her mascara is running down her cheeks all the way to her thick salmon - pink lipstick .
Victor , a younger man with a round belly , a soft mocha complexion , and thinning hair , grabs her T - shirt at the chest and throws her against a wall .
A loud thump sounds as she slams against it .
" No , no !
Victor ! " she shrieks .
He grips her neck like it's a football and lifts her against the wall by the throat .
Just then , her lanky 13 - year - old son , Alex , enters and sees his frantic mom .
He runs out and returns with a metal bat .
When Victor notices the bat , he puts her down and leaves swiftly through the front door .
" His eyes were bulging ; he was foaming at the mouth , " Susana remembers .
" He was n't the man I knew . "
That fight in early April was the first time Susana , a New York City native of Puerto Rican descent , had seen her Argentine husband lash out that way .
But it would n't be the last .
A month and a half later , he 'd return to seek revenge on the woman who says she was conned into marrying him .
( Victor 's phone has since been disconnected , and he could not be contacted for comment at an address listed in public records . )
Susana tells the tale of a jilted bride — of betrayal — and of inconsistent enforcement by ICE , the agency that polices immigration law .
She provides a peek at the problems that arise from a secretive system that values numbers and headlines over people and situations .
Whether completely true or not , it 's the kind of case that happens every day in South Florida .
Susana , pregnant and alone , moved into her house on NE First Avenue 14 years ago .
" I was totally by myself fixing it up , " she says .
" I came to this neighborhood when nobody would . "
Recently divorced , she was holding down a job in real estate and bought the place for $ 135,000 .
When she became pregnant in 2002 with her second child , this time from a man she did n't know well , she could n't help feeling lonely .
She did charity work and spent time with her cousin and Alex .
But love — romantic love — was missing .
On a muggy day in June 2004 , there was a knock at the door of her big , empty , white house .
Victor , who worked installing windows across the street , had come over asking to rent a room .
He offered $ 500 .
" I have a small child ; I do n't rent , " she told him in Spanish .
He returned four times during the next month , hoping she would change her mind .
" No " was always the answer .
But then , as she reviewed a pricey electric bill , she thought , What the hell .
Five hundred bucks is five hundred bucks .
And she agreed to let him take the room .
Victor moved in about a week later and talked her down to $ 450 .
Around the house , he'd do carpentry jobs and play with Susana 's 2 - year - old daughter , Chantal .
" He had that old - country charm , " Susana remembers .
By July , he was living there for free , and by August , they were a couple .
Eventually , he moved his clothes into her room .
By the following November , he proposed to her " with a little Kmart ring . "
On March 31 , 2006 , they signed a marriage certificate .
At a wedding in December , Susana 's friends and family came by the dozens to Miami's Trinity Episcopal Cathedral , one of the city 's most beautiful churches , just off the Venetian Causeway .
But no one from Victor 's side attended .
I do n't know much about his past , she thought .
" I was so in love .
Stupid me . "
Adds Yvette Jimenez , Susana 's cousin : " You know how movies show men sweating at weddings ?
It was worse than that with him .
He was green . "
Soon , Victor stopped doing things around the house and working .
He blamed varicose veins in his legs , which he would wrap , like a mummy , with cloth .
Meanwhile , Susana paid all the bills .
When Susana lost her job this past March , things changed .
She pushed him hard to find work .
On April 7 , he brought home a paycheck for $ 823.48 .
When she asked him to help pay the bills , he told her he was sending the money to his family in Argentina .
That 's when the fight broke out in the bedroom .
The next week , he went missing .
She called the design company he worked for and learned he had been granted permanent residency — which Susana claims he kept secret .
" That 's when I knew it was fraud , " she says .
About two weeks after he got his papers , he disappeared .
In mid-May , Victor left a message on her cell phone explaining that he'd moved to San Diego .
Because he had gained status , he could remain in the United States legally even if they divorced .
Susana was devastated .
In early May , she took out an old silver tape recorder and dialed his phone number .
The plan was to use the conversation to show ICE he planned to smuggle in his family .
The following , Susana says , is an excerpt :
Susana : Victor , I took care of you for four years .
Victor :
If you call me again , I will break that mouth of yours .
Susana : But Victor , I helped you out for so long ...
I 'm asking you — as a friend — for money .
Victor : Money ?
I 'm giving money to my son .
I need $ 1,500 to bring my son over here .
Susana :
To bring him here ?
Is he coming tomorrow from Mexico ?
Victor :
He 's coming from Argentina .
The next day , she drove to the Miami ICE office in Doral and set the tape recorder down before Special Agent Robert Colon .
She figured it was proof he planned to smuggle someone across the border .
Colon , she explains , stated ICE is n't interested in individual cases .
" I was dumbfounded , " she says .
The agent said only , " We have handled cases individually . "
Afterward , she took the tape to Victor 's boss in northeast Miami .
She was escorted out of the building , angry and distraught .
On May 22 , Victor surprised her at home while she was cooking bacon .
She says he crept quietly into the kitchen , grabbed her from behind , and threw her against a wall — again .
" What did you do ? " he yelled .
" You almost got me fired ! "
Sizzling bacon grease splattered out of the pan and over both of them .
A week later , Judge Victoria del Pino granted Susana a restraining order and advised her to stay in a shelter .
As the sun sets on a recent Monday night , Susana grips a wine glass and a photograph of her and Victor .
Raw pink burns from the bacon grease dot her arm like freckles .
" I threw a whole box of these away , " she says , holding up the picture .
" I do n't want this shit anymore . "
At 3:50 a.m. on December 9 , 2007 , Eunice Lopez and her aunt , Loida Rodriguez , were cruising South Florida 's wealthiest barrier island , Palm Beach , in a 1994 Chevy Astro van .
After they passed Mar - a - Lago — the island 's Taj Mahal — and headed toward the mainland , a cop pulled them over .
According to the police report filed by Officer Bryan Wilkins , Loida was " consuming a 12 - ounce can of Heineken . "
The cop soon discovered an outstanding warrant for Eunice 's arrest .
The crime must have surprised him : bigamy .
Nine counts of it .
Miami-Dade County Court Judge Mark King Leban set her bond at $ 75,000 , and less than a week later , a mug shot of her plump , haggard face aired all over South Florida TV news stations .
By the beginning of January , she had a court date .
There , Judge Leban told Eunice : " Stay out of churches , " a reference to her serial weddings .
Outside the courtroom , a pregnant Eunice dodged TV cameras and photographers and then said she had n't married all of those men .
" Maybe someone was using my identification , " she explained .
The arrest of Eunice and her family would eventually make history .
In the past ten years , bigamy charges , which carry a maximum five - year jail term , have been leveled 28 times in Miami - Dade .
The last time was in 2004 .
" It 's usually a guy with a couple of counts , " says Brian Tannebaum , former president of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys .
But Eunice , three family members , and her boyfriend , Rodneys Gonzalez , were nailed on 32 bigamy counts .
" I 've been here 29 years , and I 've never seen anything like it , " says Terry Chavez , spokesperson for the Miami - Dade State Attorney 's Office .
Public records show that Eunice came to Miami from Cuba in 2002 as a 20 - year - old and bounced between low - end apartments in western Hialeah and North Miami .
Eventually , she met up with family : her mother , Eurice Rodriguez ; aunt Loida ; and uncle Jesus Ruben .
They worked remedial jobs — housekeeping , factory work , building .
In June 2002 , Eunice married her first — and only legal — husband , Mauricio Matos , a 27 - year - old from Peru .
Between 2002 and 2006 , she wed ten times without divorcing , according to an arrest warrant filed this past November .
But that 's not all : Public records show that 17 marriages are filed under her name and birthday .
( Eunice was divorced eight times before the news broke . )
Some of the weddings — to mechanics , bank tellers , construction workers — were as close as four days apart .
The men ranged in age from 23 to 48 and were from seven South American countries .
She typically charged $ 8,000 to $ 15,000 .
Afterward , in some cases , she continued to collect fees , prosecutors believe .
Her attorney , Robert Lamons , did not respond to calls seeking comment .
Six friends and husbands who declined to be named described Eunice as having " a good heart , " " restless , always moving , " and " not smart with her money . "
" She seemed like a strong person mentally , " recalled Ivan , the courthouse groom .
" I do n't know if she was strong or dumb . "
Others pointed out that she had 7 - and 8 - year - old children and that she strove to be a good mother .
Public records tell another story .
Less than a year after she arrived , in October 2002 , Eunice was found guilty of petit larceny .
It 's unclear what she stole ( files have since been destroyed ) , but she paid a fine .
Then , in November 2004 , Hialeah police officers arrived at her house on West 29th Street to find boyfriend Rodneys breaking in .
According to the police report , he " pried the victim 's window open " and cops found him " halfway inside the residence . "
He told an officer he was upset because she " was with another male . "
The next day , Eunice filed a domestic violence report .
Details were n't available .
A couple of years later , in January 2006 , she married Euclides Yepes Ceballos , a 45 - year - old Colombian - born auto mechanic .
He told New Times : " When I met her , she was living alone .
She said , ' I can help you with papers . '
I was going to give her a car that I was repairing , but we never talked about money .
Never . "
Asked if he lived with her for love or for residency , he replied , " We lived together . "
Her next husband , Walter Cabrera , a 45 - year - old self - employed Argentine from Hallandale Beach , said , " I do n't have time to talk . "
New Times asked if he had five minutes .
" No , I 'm at work . "
Then came a November 2006 wedding to Francisco Rosales , a 48 - year - old from Ecuador .
" She cheated me , " he said .
" But listen , I really do n't want to make a story out of this . "
At the beginning of 2007 , Eunice moved into a rundown Pepto Bismol - pink house on West 43rd Street in Hialeah .
A landlord explained that she and her mother , Eurice , would disappear with food , medicine , and money to Cuba for weeks at a time .
Eunice had first appeared at the door begging for a place to stay , and he rented it to her for about $ 300 a month .
Soon after she was picked up in Palm Beach , two husbands divorced her — joining eight others who had filed for divorce between 2005 and 2007 .
The files show no shared debts , property , or children to quarrel over .
Most of the husbands stated they did n't know where she was .
A month after Eunice 's arrest , Hialeah Police pulled over boyfriend Rodneys on SE Ninth Court for driving with a suspended license .
Cops found out he had an outstanding warrant for three counts of bigamy .
The 33 - year - old , who has short hair and full lips , had married women from all over the map .
There was a 37 - year - old Italian , a 22 - year - old Venezuelan , and a 40 - year - old Colombian .
All tied the knot between March 2005 and December 2006 .
Eunice 's mother , 46 - year - old Eurice , was next .
On June 8 , ICE investigator Jorge Broche picked her up on NW 12th Avenue at 14th Street on three counts of bigamy .
Her husbands were about her age and from Venezuela , Argentina , Colombia , and Uruguay .
On a recent warm Wednesday at dusk , Eurice , a stocky , sweet - faced woman , stood in the back doorway of a gated tan house off Ali Baba Avenue in Opa-locka .
The back door was open , exposing a bed with hot - pink sheets .
She held a tiny infant and invited New Times inside .
Then with a gesture , she offered a seat in a computer chair .
Asked about the marriages , she refused to comment and motioned toward the door .
( Eunice declined to comment by phone . )
On June 24 , Eunice 's uncle , Jesus Ruben Rodriguez , 38 , turned himself in to ICE for having five illegal wives — all from Latin America .
Eunice 's aunt , 42 - year - old Loida Rodriguez , still has n't been arrested .
Police released her after the Palm Beach traffic stop and later figured out she had married 13 men .
Her record also shows that a 2003 theft charge for driving with stolen tags was dismissed .
Together , Eunice , Rodneys , and the Rodriguez family could serve up to 160 years in prison .
So far , prosecutors have n't charged any of the spouses — a different approach than the feds took in the Orlando bust .
" They 're irrelevant to our case , " says Ed Griffith , spokesperson for the Miami - Dade State Attorney 's Office .
ICE spokesperson Nicole Navas would say only that each case would be " handled individually and evaluated on its own merits . "
Not long before he met Eunice , Ivan had a nightmare .
In it , he was wandering around a hot , cramped room with white walls .
A twin mattress lay on the floor .
Something was familiar about the place — the smell or the feeling .
And it was unsettling .
In the middle of the night , he sat up in bed , sweating .
" It 's my old room in Uruguay , " he says .
" And I realize I 've been deported . "
Now he wonders if he should have taken the dream as a sign .
Next to some volleyball courts in a park off Biscayne Boulevard , he thinks about Eunice , and his face tightens .
He speaks with a slight accent and wears a Yankees baseball cap pulled down low .
" When I met — " he stops himself .
" I do n't like to say her name .
It gets me sick . "
Ivan came to the United States in 2002 .
A bad economy hit Uruguay hard and sank his minimart business .
" I looked for jobs , even cleaning bathrooms , but there was nothing , " he says .
So he flew to the States and got a gig at a shipping company in Aventura .
Immediately , he began learning English .
He secured construction jobs and then freelance graphic design work .
" I was living my life like an American , " he says .
" Sometimes you forget you 're not . "
Then in late 2005 , he was offered a $ 90,000 salary in New York at a graphic design company .
He could n't accept it because of his immigration status .
That , along with not being able to visit his family ( leaving the country would mean he could n't return ) made him feel like he was living in " a golden cage . "
So he began searching for a solution :
He asked around about paying for a wife .
In two months , through friends , he found Eunice .
Word on the street was marriages went for about $ 10,000 , so when she agreed to $ 8,000 — half beforehand and half when his papers came — he thought it was reasonable .
Four days before the wedding , he met Eunice for the first time in the Hialeah shopping center .
She brought along a skinny , nondescript white guy who lingered in the background .
Ivan scrunches up his face at the idea of meeting her .
" I know I 'm not a model or anything .
But I thought , Nobody is going to believe us . "
She invited him into a dark - colored sedan , where she gave him a copy of her Social Security card , and they arranged to meet and marry that week .
His heart was racing .
The day of the wedding , he skipped breakfast .
An old friend from work picked him up in the morning and drove him to Hialeah in his SUV for moral support .
Growing up Catholic , Ivan had a different idea for what his wedding would be like .
" It was my first marriage , and it was n't for love , " he says , shaking his head .
" One part is legal .
The other is moral . "
After the wedding , when he could n't find her , he began digging through public records online .
Sixteen other men ?
he thought .
He felt his stomach twist .
A month of insomnia followed .
" I was part of a little club , " he says .
" I felt my life go down the toilet . "
Returning home crossed his mind , but it was n't an option .
" I 'd rather jump from a bridge , " he says .
" I think I love America more than Americans do . "
Then he got a lawyer .
Practically speaking , Ivan should have let that day at the courthouse go a long time ago .
But lately , he 's been paralyzed by panic attacks .
He 's afraid to drive alone at night for fear of getting pulled over .
He can't set foot in an airport .
And every time the phone rings or there 's a knock on the door , he 's sure it 's the feds ready to ship him away .
" You have to have eyes in the back of your head , " he says , forcing a smile .
" I tried to jump , and I fell . "
The Democratic - controlled House of Representatives quickly passed a bill Friday that will expand the government 's ability to install blanket wiretaps inside the United States .
It will also put an end to the lawsuits filed against the nation 's telecoms for helping the government spy on Americans without getting the necessary court orders .
The vote hands a significant victory to the White House , a few months after House Democrats forced a high - stakes showdown on the same issue in February .
The 293-129 vote came just 24 hours after the compromise bill was released on Thursday .
Only one Republican voted against the bill , while Democrats split nearly evenly .
Speaking on behalf of the deal prior to the vote , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended her support , saying that a bill was necessary and that the measure rightly expanded both intelligence - gathering powers and oversight .
" We took an oath to defend the country from all enemies , foreign and domestic , " Pelosi said .
" Good intelligence is necessary for us to know the plans of the terrorists , so we can't not have a bill . "
Pelosi said she did not like the amnesty provision , saying the telecoms " come out of this with a taint . "
But Pelosi added that the bill 's required inspector - general report was more likely to " learn the truth about the president 's surveillance program " than the lawsuits would have .
The bill allows the National Security Agency to order phone companies , ISPs and online service providers to turn over all communications that have one foreigner as a party to the conversation .
If any Americans are party to the conversation , the government is supposed to mask their names , but these procedures to minimize privacy - invasion are easily overridden .
The longstanding Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act required specific court orders to wiretap phone and internet lines inside the United States , but did not regulate spying conducted on non-U.S. soil .
Under the so - called FISA Amendments
Act of 2008 , the government would need a court order to wiretap an American overseas , regardless of where the tap was .
Under the current regime , targeted taps aimed at Americans overseas requires the sign - off of the attorney general .
The nation 's telecoms will soon be freed from some 40 lawsuits accusing them of eavesdropping illegally , if the bill is passed into law as expected .
The legality of the retroactive amnesty is n't clear , and groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation will likely challenge the provision on constitutional grounds .
President Bush urged quick passage of the bill Friday morning , citing support of the bill ( .pdf ) by Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell and Attorney General Michael Mukasey .
The White House began pushing for expanded powers last summer , after a secret spying court repeatedly struck down the administration 's attempt to use broad , nonspecific orders to conduct wiretaps inside the United States .
Those rulings came just months after Bush bowed to political pressure and allowed judges to rule on his secret , five - year warrantless wiretapping program .
Bush maintains , however , that he has the legal right to wiretap inside the United States without court approval , as part of his powers as commander in chief .
California Republican Dan Lungren described the measure as the " single most important bill we will vote on this year , " because the intelligence gathered could prevent having to send more troops abroad .
More than a handful of House Democrats assailed the bill prior to passage .
California lawmaker Barbara Lee referred to the days of J. Edgar Hoover and concluded , " This bill scares me . "
Rep. Jay Inslee ( D - Washington ) slammed retroactive amnesty , asking " Do n't we realize there are some lines we should never cross ? "
But the short debate and quick scheduling made it clear that the House leadership was confident the measure would easily pass , thus sparing conservative Democrats from campaign ads in the fall attacking them for not being tough on surveillance .
The Senate could take up the bill as soon as next week .
The bill is HR6304 .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday urged President Bush to release crude oil from the nation 's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to combat high prices , a call Republicans used to bolster their push to increase domestic production with more drilling in environmentally sensitive areas .
The Department of Energy plans to suspend this delivery of the 70,000 barrels of oil per day currently going into the SPR - per a law Congress passed in May that required the suspension until the end of 2008 .
But many Democrats want Bush to go further .
Pelosi sent a letter asking the president " to draw down a small portion " of the SPR 's more than 700 million barrels of oil " to help reduce record prices that are helping push the economy toward recession . "
" Releasing oil from the Reserve is a tool to manage our national and economic security , and when judiciously used will in no way jeopardize national security , " the California Democrat wrote .
Call for more drilling
The SPR was established in the aftermath of the oil embargo in the early 1970s and is intended for use in case of a disruption in oil supplies .
Suspending or drawing down supplies from the reserve is not typically done to regulate prices , but Pelosi noted that crude prices have dropped when the United States has opened the spigot on the SPR in the past .
Still , the White House rejected the speaker 's call , saying that using the reserve to manipulate prices was " ineffective . "
" It 's unfortunate that the only place Democrats in Congress can find to explore for more resources is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , " said White House spokesman Scott Stanzel .
" It is time to put aside these politically - motivated band - aids offered by the Democrats and do something that will improve our energy security in the future like expanding access to American energy in " the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) and Outer Continental Shelf ( OCS ) .
Without directly opposing her proposal , House GOP leader John Boehner of Ohio said that Pelosi 's call to release supplies from the SPR meant that she " is admitting yet again that increasing the supply of oil will help reduce the price of gasoline . "
" I agree , and so do my House Republican colleagues who have been arguing for decades in favor of more American energy production , " he said .
House Republican Conference Chairman Adam Putnam , R - Florida , and House Republican Whip Roy Blunt , R - Missouri , have pledged to force a vote on bills to allow offshore drilling and exploration in ANWR before Congress leaves for its month long August break .
Democrats have repeatedly driven back attempts to open ANWR and the OCS for oil drilling , arguing that any help for skyrocketing prices would be years away and miniscule .
Republicans argue that increased exploration for domestic oil sources would signal that the United States is intended to take care of its own energy needs and would drive down costs .
New drilling in the OCS - shallow ocean areas just off the coast that slope for miles into deep sea - was banned in 1991 after the disastrous Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound , Alaska .
The Energy Department has estimated that 86 billion barrels of oil may be present in areas currently off limits to drilling .
The Energy Department has estimated that ANWR could produce as much as 1.45 million barrels of oil per day within 20 years after it is opened for exploration .
The United States currently consumes about 21 million barrels of oil per day .
Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami noted that Democrats support a bill that would require oil companies that hold existing federal leases for oil drilling to begin exploration or lose the rights to those leases .
" ( Republicans ) are ignoring the fact that 68 million acres on shore and offshore could be drilled at this moment , " he said .
" Providing oil companies with additional public lands would not lower the price of gas and would not provide relief to American families . "
Nearly 10,000 such leases are open .
Republicans say it takes time to develop such leases and that if older leases are not currently in production , it 's because it 's not financially viable to do so .
Putnam and Blount admitted their options for forcing the ANWR / OCS issue in the House of Representatives are limited , but Putnam predicted the issue could be " potentially a game changer " for Republican prospects in the November election .
Cheaper gas ?
Regardless of the back - and - forth on oil supplies , experts are divided on whether increasing supplies would mean lower gasoline prices .
Noting that the SPR holds crude oil and not refined gasoline , Mark Cooper , research director for the Consumer Federation of America , told a Congressional hearing in April that the oil industry has failed to add refinery capacity to keep up with demand .
" By failing to expand production capacity to meet demand and provide a reasonable reserve in an industry with very low supply and demand elasticities that is prone to accidents and disruptions , the markets became tight and volatile , " he told members of the House Select Subcommittee on Energy Independence and Global Warming , adding " Crude oil will not do much good without the ability to refine it . "
Cooper testified that putting SPR 's 70,000 barrels per day back into an 85 million barrels per day market would have " little if any impact on prices . "
But he told the representatives that the current SPR policy should be overhauled , noting that the Bush administration had failed to fill the reserve when prices were low and now objects to stopping the fill with prices at record highs .
Melanie Kenderdine , associate director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative and former oil policy analyst for the Department of Energy , testified at the same hearing that the SPR has been " inconsistently " used .
Kenderdine noted that drawdowns from the reserve were not triggered with the loss of more than 2 million barrels per day at the start of the Iraq war but were used with the loss of less than a million barrels per day after Hurricane Katrina disrupted refineries in the Gulf Coast .
In that instance , crude oil from the reserve was traded for refined product from Europe .
She also said that the sale of crude oil from the reserve , currently at an average cost of less than $ 30 per barrel , could dramatically reduce gasoline prices and also could provide needed funding for research and development into alternative energy sources - ultimately the only way to eliminate the country 's dependence on fossil fuels .
" An outright sale of 40 million barrels of oil from the SPR would generate almost $ 4.5 billion in new revenues , " she testified .
" This would have the added benefit of lowering prices to consumers .
" For those who say we would diminish our energy security by so doing , I would point out that this would reduce the amount of oil in the SPR to around 660 million barrels , roughly 60 million barrels more than was in the reserve when we invaded Iraq when , presumably , this level of oil insurance was deemed sufficient to protect our energy security interests during a war in the Middle East . "

WASHINGTON ( AP )  President George W. Bush agreed to seek " a general time horizon " for deeper reductions in American combat troops in Iraq , a dramatic policy shift that complicates an issue on which presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain have staked opposite positions .
Bush 's announcement came as Obama geared up for a Europe and Mideast trip aimed at helping him bolster his foreign policy and national security credentials , an area in which Republicans say his experience is inadequate for the White House .
The Democrat , who is seeking to become the first black U.S. president , has spent much of the week outlining his foreign policy views , even as the faltering U.S. economy has eclipsed Iraq as the top campaign issue in the November election .
IRAQ PLAN : Iraq , U.S. agree on ' general time horizon ' Obama , whose schedule includes visits Iraq and Afghanistan , has pledged to withdraw combat troops within 16 months if he is elected , and argues that McCain offers nothing more than an extension of Bush 's unpopular policies .
He has maintained that McCain would do little more than continue a war that has diverted necessary U.S. forces from the conflict in Afghanistan where Taliban and al - Qaeda militants are regrouping , posing a renewed risk to Americans .
The presumptive Republican nominee , a former Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war , has trumpeted his foreign policy credentials while trying to focus his campaign on the country 's economic struggles .
McCain 's efforts to portray himself as an economic leader took a hit earlier this month when a top policy adviser , former senator Phil Gramm , said the United States had become a " nation of whiners " who constantly complain about the economy .
On Friday , Gramm resigned from his role as co-chair of the McCain campaign , saying in a statement that he wanted to " end this distraction . "
Earlier in the day , in an appearance before General Motors workers in Michigan , McCain once again sought to counter the impression that he was not as strong as Obama on the economy .
He promised the auto workers that he would help make the company 's long - range electric car a success as he outlined ways to help a state and industry hit hard by the economy .
But foreign policy remained a key focus .
The veteran Arizona senator aired a new TV ad saying that while Obama has not been to Iraq for years , and voted against war funding to win the Democratic nomination , he is now " changing to help himself become president . "
McCain , it says , has always supported the Iraq strategy " that 's working " — a reference to the troop buildup credited for sharply reducing violence in the country .
But Bush 's announcement after repeated pressure on the issue from Iraqi leaders appears to put him at odds with McCain , and could make his own administration a tougher target for Obama 's criticisms .
The plan comes as Bush and Iraq 's prime minister have talked about the timing of the force drawdown as part of discussions over a broader security agrement to keep U.S. forces in the country after the expiration of a U.N. mandate on Dec. 31 .
Iraqi officials , buoyed by recent security gains , have proposed that U.S. forces fully withdraw five years after the Iraqis take the lead on security across the country .
That condition , however , could take years to materialize .
The accord would include " a general time horizon " for meeting goals like " the resumption of Iraqi security control in their cities and provinces and the further reduction of U.S. combat forces from Iraq . "
That could sap some of the strength from Obama 's push to appear as the candidate most ready to bring an end to a conflict that 's in its sixth year .
Obama 's trip was at least partly aimed at highlighting that strength .
It affords the first - term Illinois senator — who currently leads McCain in many polls but is , at best tied on those relating to foreign policy — a chance to promote his plans to mend rifts with allies weary of the Bush administration and end the Iraq war .
Campaign officials have announced stops in Jordan , Israel , Germany , France and England .
Aides have not said whether the Iraq and Afghanistan trips will be part of the same trip .
The visits could also factor in his favor in further invigorating supporters and winning over others like independents and swing voters .
An Associated Press - Yahoo News poll showed that Obama 's supporters are much more energized by the election than McCain 's are .
It showed that 38 % of Obama 's supporters say the election is exciting compared with 9 % of McCain's .
The passion and interest shown by blocs of voters are important because they affect who will be motivated to vote .
In addition , 65 % of Obama 's backers say they are hopeful about the campaign , double McCain's , and the Democrat 's supporters are three times likelier to express pride .
But not all Democrats are equally intrigued with Obama .
The poll showed 31 % of those supporting Obama are Democrats who had preferred former rival Hillary Rodham Clinton during the party 's primary battle .
Just 12 % of former Clinton supporters say they are excited about the campaign , one - third of the excitement level among Obama 's longer - term backers .
Independents , whom both McCain and Obama are avidly pursuing , show little enthusiasm about the race .
Only 21 % find the election interesting — down from 31 % in November — and just 7 % say it is exciting .
Substantial numbers say they feel frustrated , helpless and even bored .
The AP - Yahoo News poll , conducted by Knowledge Networks , has measured the political sentiments of the same 2,000 adults since November .
Friday 's poll was conducted from June 13 - 23 among 1,759 adults and has an overall margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points .

The volatile oil markets have been blamed on speculators
The US energy regulator has taken civil action against a Dutch - based oil trading firm and three top employees for manipulating crude oil prices .
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission complaint relates to Optiver Holding and two subsidiaries .
As the price of oil has risen sharply since last year , the watchdog has turned its focus on the activities of speculators .
It is feared that traders have contributed to swings in oil prices .
Bastiaan van Kempen , the boss of Chicago - based Optiver , a subsidiary of Optiver Holding , was named as a defendant along with trader Christopher Dowson and Randal Meijer , a supervisor of Optiver .
The CFTC alleges that they attempted to manipulate the price of different types of oil during 11 days in March 2007 .
Out of 19 attempts , five were successful earning the accused about $ 1 m ( £ 502,000 ) .
Serious step
" These charges go to the heart of the CFTC 's core mission of detecting and rooting out illegal manipulation of the markets , " said CFTC acting chairman Walt Lukken .
In a statement , Optiver Holding said : " We have learned that the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has filed a civil lawsuit against Optiver .
" We have received a copy of the complaint and are reviewing it .
We take the CFTC 's action very seriously and are treating it with the utmost attention and care . "
The lawsuit comes as US lawmakers review a plan put forward by the CFTC to prevent speculators trading on the London oil market to escape strict US rules on trading .
Venezuela 's Chavez : No warmer a reception for Obama Reuters
Published : Wednesday July 16 , 2008
Print This Email This CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Wednesday his prickly relations with Washington would not improve even if Democrat candidate Barack Obama wins the U.S. presidential election in November .
Chavez , a relentless critic of U.S. foreign policy and President George W. Bush , advocates weakening the influence of the United States and calls the nation " the empire . "
Chavez told his supporters not to raise their hopes that relations with the United States would improve if Obama is elected U.S. president , saying there was little difference between him and Republican candidate John McCain .
" The two candidates for the U.S. presidency attack us equally , they attack us defending the interests of the empire , " Chavez said at a meeting of his socialist party .
" Let 's not kid ourselves , it is the empire and the empire must fall .
That 's the only solution , that it comes to an end . "
Obama said earlier in his campaign that he would be prepared to sit down to talk with Chavez .
But in recent weeks he has called the leftist Venezuelan leader an enemy of the United States and urged sanctions against him .
Chavez also had previously expressed a hope that the end of the Bush administration would bring warmer ties between the two countries .
The United States considers Chavez a negative influence in Latin America and has accused him of being soft on cocaine traffickers and of having ties to Marxist guerrillas in Colombia .
Although Venezuela is one of America 's top crude oil suppliers , relations between the two countries have deteriorated since a brief 2002 coup against Chavez that Washington initially welcomed .
( Reporting by Patricia Rondon )
His conservative friends agree that he is addicted , but their solution is to carve out areas in the U.S. where we can grow more tobacco , and therefore his addiction can at least be homegrown .
Sort of like " If you are going to smoke pot , at least smoke American pot . "
This is the Bush approach .
I have a friend who is addicted to nicotine .
His liberal friends tell him that this addiction is bad , and point out that it is costing him too much money .
Therefore , they want policies passed that ensure that he can continue to consume as much as he likes , and not hurt his budget too much .
They are sure that nicotine substitutes will come along soon to save the day .
For reasons I detail below , I call this the Boxer approach , but it could just as easily be the Pelosi / Democratic Party approach .
It seems to me that his friends perhaps have good intentions , but their policies are misguided and do n't address the root cause of the addiction .
In fact , much like their policies on our addiction to oil .
On one hand , the Democratic Party argues 1 ) .
We are too dependent upon fossil fuels ; 2 ) .
We must find alternatives ; 3 ) .
Carbon emissions are too high ; and 4 ) .
We need to promote higher fuel efficiency .
Those are good points .
But they can't seem to see the irrationality in one of their proposals .
At a time when Americans are starting to conserve ; starting to trade - in their SUVs for Priuses , it seems to be fast - becoming a core principle of the Democratic party that we should : 5 ) .
Tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( SPR ) to bring oil prices down so people can afford to consume more .
In fact , in a recent chain letter to me , Senator Barbara Boxer - who even maintains a website on the importance of acting on global warming , stated that we must go after " real solutions on gas prices " , like " releasing some oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve . "
Ignoring for a moment the glaring inconsistency between this proposal and her position on global warming , just what is the purpose of the SPR ?
In the event of an energy emergency , SPR oil would be distributed by competitive sale .
The SPR has been used under these circumstances only twice ( during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 ) .
Its formidable size ( 700 - plus million barrels ) makes it a significant deterrent to oil import cutoffs and a key tool of foreign policy .
However , the calls for tapping the reserve continue to come , because high prices apparently constitute an energy emergency in some people 's minds .
Here American Progress defends this view :
Eight Reasons to Release Oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
Let 's look at a couple of the reasons given :
1. Record oil prices have hurt American families Ordinary families are struggling with record high energy prices .
Many families ’ gas costs have increased by hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year .
The price of home heating oil has doubled in the past year .
And the Department of Energy predicts that average electricity prices will increase by 5 percent this year , and go up 9 percent in 2009 .
Yes , and we are seeing significant drops in gasoline demand as a result .
You know what that means ?
The people who argue for lower fossil fuel usage and by extension lower carbon emissions should be happy .
The kicker is that the author of this article , Daniel J. Weiss , is " the Director of Climate Strategy at American Progress , where he leads the Center 's clean energy and climate advocacy campaign . "
What 's wrong with this picture ?
Do climate advocates think getting people to change is going to be easy ?
No , there is going to be cost , pain , and inconvenience .
But people respond to price , and we are seeing that now .
It is not hypothetical , it is observable .
What people do n't respond to are feel - good speeches about the need to cut back .
Let 's look at one more :
6 . There is plenty of oil in the reserve to withstand a supply disruption
The SPR has more oil than ever before — 706 million barrels , which is 98 percent capacity .
Selling 50 million barrels over 100 days would still leave it filled to over 90 percent capacity .
This is enough oil to cope with a complete foreign supply disruption for nearly two months , assuming zero reduction in demand in the wake of such a catastrophe .
This is just an argument that the SPR is bigger than it needs to be .
Yet the authorization to fill ( eventually to 1 billion barrels ) was made by congress as a part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 .
Per the DOE , it the filling of the SPR is also funded by royalties on oil companies extracting oil from the Outer Continental Shelf ( OCS ) :
The royalty - in - kind program applies to oil owed to the U.S. government by producers who operate leases on the federally - owned Outer Continental Shelf .
These producers are required to provide from 12.5 percent to 16.7 percent of the oil they produce to the U.S. government .
The government can either acquire the oil itself or receive the equivalent dollar value .
As someone who is very concerned about disruptions of future oil supplies , I want a healthy volume in the SPR .
I want it tapped only in the event of something like a major supply disruption that actually threatens to sharply reduce the amount of available oil .
I did n't want it tapped at $ 20 oil , and I wo n't want it tapped at $ 500 oil .
If my choice in the long run is between a gallon of gasoline for $ 30 or no gasoline at all , guess which one I am going to pick ?
Let 's also not forget the history here .
A story right here at TOD shows that Chuck Schumer has been Wrong on the SPR Since 1999 , when oil was hitting the outrageous value of $ 20 a barrel .
He wo n't learn his lesson , as here Schumer ( and others ) are at it again in 2004 ( which was also an election year ) .
Oil at that time had risen to $ 35 a barrel .
Here 's another TOD essay that recognizes Schumer 's misguided logic in tapping the SPR .
Where would we be had we heeded these perpetual calls to tap the reserve ?
With higher gasoline consumption , higher carbon emissions , a drained SPR , and Senator Schumer still complaining that we need to reduce our dependence on oil .
We would be much more vulnerable to supply disruptions , and our financial position with respect to the SPR would be billions of dollars worse off than it is now ( i.e. , down 100 million barrels or more from today 's level with oil at $ 130 / bbl ) .
Think about that .
Heeding Schumer 's calls would have endangered national security , and put us in a multi-billion dollar hole .
High fuel prices have led to many positive changes in people 's behaviors .
Demand is down , fuel efficiency is being embraced , and sales of SUVs are down .
The very same people who advocate these things are the same people who would reverse these positive changes by tapping the SPR .
It appears that they do n't understand that cheap energy is the very reason we became so dependent upon fossil fuels .
We wo n't wean from fossil fuels if they remain cheap .
As I have noted before , a big reason that Europe 's per capita energy usage is half that of the U.S. is because they have maintained prices at artificially high levels .
This caused them to develop different living / transportation / consumption preferences than is the case in the U.S .
If people are forced to tighten budgets - and heaven forbid carpool , ride the bus , or simply drive less as a result of high prices - that does not constitute an energy emergency .
We need to get past these ridiculous calls to tap the SPR , and highlight the inconsistencies ( and past history ) of those who advocate such a move .
In the next essay , I am going to address President Bush 's calls to answer our addiction to oil with more drilling .
It makes as much sense to tell a heroin addict that what they really need is homegrown heroin .
I think there is a compromise that may satisfy both sides .
A 15 - page paper on the process requirements for casting and machining of uranium metal into hemispherical forms  said to useful only for making the core of a nuclear weapon  has been raised by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in recent months as evidence of an alleged Iranian intention to built nuclear weapons .
The agency ’s May 26 , 2008 , report said that the IAEA ’s " overall assessment of the nature of Iran ’s nuclear program requires , inter alia , an understanding of the role of the uranium metal document . "
Two days later , the deputy director and head of the Safeguards Department of the IAEA , Olli Heinonen , was quoted by an anonymous diplomatic source in an AFP story as telling a closed door briefing of IAEA member states in Vienna that Iran ’s possession of the document was " alarming . "
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) then referred in its draft congressional resolution calling for a blockade of Iran to Tehran ’s alleged " importation of designs to convert highly enriched uranium gas into metal and shape into the core of a nuclear weapon . "
But the IAEA has long had information supporting the Iranian claim it never asked for the document and has never used it since Pakistan ’s A.Q.
Khan network added it to a centrifuge purchase without any prior discussion .
In fact , an IAEA report last November appeared to clear Iran from suspicion on the issue .
The revival of that issue in 2008 appears to reflect political pressure on the IAEA from the United States and its allies .
Iran admits having gotten the document from Pakistan ’s A.Q. Khan network when Iranian scientists obtained centrifuge designs from that group .
But Iranian officials have contended from the beginning that its scientists never requested any such instructions , and that the Khan network suppliers threw the document into the deal when the Iranians purchased plans for P - 1 centrifuges .
When scientists from the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran ( AEOI ) first met with the Khan network in Zurich in July 1987 , they were given a handwritten one - page offer .
The IAEA has described that offer , which was later turned over to it by Iran , as including a sample disassembled centrifuge , along with technical drawings and specifications for production , plans for a complete enrichment plant with 2,000 centrifuges , and auxiliary equipment for uranium re-conversion and casting .
Iran told the IAEA that the intermediaries had offered the re-conversion unit with casting equipment on their own initiative and that AEOI had neither requested nor received it .
The agency demanded that Iran turn over all documents pertaining to the Khan network offer and what was actually purchased .
But Iran said it had no other documentary evidence relating to the 1987 offer , blaming the secretive management style of the AEOI at that time .
What the IAEA has not revealed in its reports , however , is that in January 2005 , Iran allowed IAEA investigators to look through boxes of old AEOI files , according to a source close to the IAEA .
During that search , the investigators came across the infamous 15 - page " uranium metal document . "
" As they were going through boxes of papers , it literally fell out , " says the source .
Iranian officials explained that the document had been provided by the Khan network supplier when Iran purchased centrifuge blueprints at a meeting in Dubai in 1987 but insisted that Iran had not asked for it .
Had the document triggered a secret Iranian nuclear weapons project , it obviously would not have been left in files related to the centrifuge and enrichment plans for the IAEA to find .
Far from Iran seeking to hide the document as incriminating , its atomic energy officials had apparently simply filed it away and forgotten it .
Although the Iranian officials refused to give up the actual document to the IAEA , during a January 2006 visit by IAEA officials , Iran allowed agency inspectors to " examine the document again and to place it under IAEA seal . "
That meant that IAEA inspectors could read it whenever they wanted , as the agency explained in February 2007 .
Iran agreed to provide a copy of the document to the IAEA in November 2007 .
In its Feb. 22 , 2008 , report , the IAEA suggested that it needed more information from Pakistan to resolve the issue .
" The Agency is still waiting for a response from Pakistan on the circumstances of the delivery of this document , " said the report , " in order to understand the full scope and content of the offer made by the network in 1987 . "
The agency ’s May 28 , 2008 , report confirmed that " an identical document exists in Pakistan " but provided no additional information on what had been learned about it .
The same report asserted that the issue remains " outstanding . "
However , contrary to the IAEA claim of ignorance about the " full scope and content " the 1987 offer , however , the IAEA actually had an extensive interview with the key Khan network figure present at the meeting with the Iranians in Dubai : Khan ’s chief financial officer , Buhari Sayed Abu Tahir .
Tahir was arrested in Malaysia in May 2004 , and Heinonen and other IAEA officials obtained an account of the meeting in Dubai in an interview with Tahir in February 2005  after the agency had become aware of the uranium metal document , according to the book The Nuclear Jihadist by journalists Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collins .
That account was made available to Frantz and Collins , who detailed the history of the A.Q. Khan network .
Frantz and Collins also obtained the account of the same meeting given by Iranian officials to the IAEA .
Although they quote Khan ’s salesmen as telling the Iranians how many atom bombs could be made annually from the uranium enrichment plant for which they were selling the plans , Frantz and Collins indicate that the Iranians did not ask for any plans relating to nuclear weapons manufacture .
Instead , the authors write that after agreeing on the price of the equipment and plans , Khan ’s men " sweetened the deal " by throwing in the uranium metal document .
The Khan network apparently added the uranium metal document as an afterthought in the hope of selling the Iranians on additional technology .
The document only outlined procedural requirements for casting uranium into hemispheres , not the technical specifications that would have been necessary to carry out the operation , as the IAEA report of Nov. 18 , 2005 , noted .
Contrary to IAEA claims that it needs more information to clarify the significance of the uranium metal document , moreover , the agency ’s Nov. 15 , 2007 , report said the issue had been resolved to its satisfaction .
That report concluded , " Based on interviews with available Iranian officials and members of the supply network , limited documentation provided by Iran , and procurement information collected through the Agency ’s independent investigation , the Agency has concluded that Iran ’s statements are consistent with other information available to the Agency concerning Iran ’s acquisition of declared P - 1 centrifuge enrichment technology in 1987 . "
The timing of the IAEA ’s decision in early 2008 to highlight the uranium metal document , after having previously indicated that it was resolved , suggests that it was the result of new political pressures on the agency .
The new IAEA hard line on the issue came after Iran had provided new information that resolved the entire list of issues about the history of its nuclear program on which the IAEA had been raising doubts since 2003 .
It also coincided with the introduction into the IAEA process on Iran of " alleged studies " of weaponization  documents whose authenticity has not verified by the agency and which it has not been allowed to share with Iran .

There was a time when I knew what I wanted to listen to .
I was poor , but I bought CDs anyway , and I had stacks of them , purchased with enthusiasm and knowledge shared among friends .
A pricey endeavor , sure .
But once I discovered Napster and CD - burning , finances stopped counting .
I started storing my music on my computer , and saving songs was no longer a physical , deliberate effort ; a mouse - click sufficed .
And I kept on clicking .
I 'm now closing in on 95 gigabytes of music — just over 22,000 songs .
Much of it I 've never listened to , but there 's no logic when passion gets in the way .
You might say I have too much music at my fingertips .
Google vice president Sukhinder Singh Cassidy predicts that in seven years , every song ever recorded in the world will fit into our pockets .
Info musical tastes
" The average 14 - year - old can hear more music in a month than someone would have heard in an entire lifetime just 300 years ago , " says psychologist Dan Levitin , author of This Is Your Brain on Music .
Thanks to digital music distributors like CD Baby , any independent musician 's songs can now appear on iTunes .
Heaps of old songs are finding new life in digital files , too .
According to Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr , more than 6 million songs are now in the iTunes store .
That means I have about 5,978,000 songs to go .
But does it mean I 'll be more passionately involved with my music ?
" It 's too early to say how this will affect our relationship with music , " Levitin says .
" We might become more attached — because we have so much choice — or less , because the choice causes us not to bond or bind to a particular musical piece . "
Why people desire what they do is intrinsically linked to imprinting , our states of mind during early experiences , and reinforcement .
And what gets hammered into our psyches is influenced as much by the size of the hammer as by our psyches themselves .
That 's what allows intelligent people to enjoy the Spice Girls in the company of long - lost friends , tequila , and an impromptu " Wannabe " karaoke session — and why a John Cage piano concerto annoys those same friends .
A glut of choices means we spend less time listening to the same music as other people do , so we do n't get as much reinforcement .
Music is more portable and thus more personalized .
Charles Areni , a former professor at the University of Central Florida and current professor of economics and business at the University of Sydney , speculates that our individual music libraries lead to " increasing dissatisfaction with radio , music CDs , and any other non-customized form of music consumption .
Since consumers can now customize their music environments , any ' one size fits all ' approach will not make anybody happy . "
Social psychologist Barry Schwartz , author of The Paradox of Choice : Why More Is Less , identifies changes from our habit of listening to singles , too : " Less album listening means that people are n't forced to listen to things that do n't turn them on right away , and as a result , tastes change less . "
Yep , having 6 million songs on hand means that tastes actually change less .
It 's a common predicament for anyone wanting to expand tastes : knowing that there 's no reason to listen to the end of a song , much less an entire album you do n't " get " right away .
Even though it ultimately will expand my palette , do I really have the patience to get into heavy metal , when I already know I love Spoon ?
Faced with such overwhelming choice , most people are fine with using filters to narrow the field , such as self - styled experts from music magazines and popular Web sites .
These " experts " define what 's hip and cool .
The danger is that we 're unaware of how dependent on filters we are , and how they filter in the first place .
We 're forced to leave out a lot , and possibly we 'll never find the song that will change our lives .
Are we okay with that ?
Pressing " shuffle " has replaced driving down to the local mom-and - pop record store on Tuesday and buying a new release .
I never had this problem in high school , listening to OK Computer on repeat .
Now my iPod is like a remote control or a slot machine , flicking through 500 songs , searching for another emotive spike .
I find myself getting bored even in the middle of songs simply because I can .
The paradox of spending so much time changing songs , trying to find one you like , is that you wind up attached to none of them .
" Yes , there is too much music product , and most of it is terrible , " says Peter Crabb , an assistant professor of psychology at Penn State University .
" Kids can spend more time trying to figure out what to listen to and fiddling with their computers and MP3s than actually spending quality time listening to good music . "
And there is good music out there .
As Ravi Dhar , the director of the Center for Customer Insights at the Yale School of Management , says , " At some point , one has to stop looking for the best strawberries and start eating them . "
Yes , this is David Hahn , of Radioactive Boyscout fame , the boyscout who inspired this Harper ’s Magazine article , about his attempt to build a nuclear reactor in his mother ’s shed .
Well , twelve years later , it turns out he ’s still into his hobby .
A Clinton Township man who gained notoriety a decade ago as the so - called “ Radioactive Boy Scout ” was accused Thursday of stealing numerous smoke detectors in an effort to develop a homemade nuclear reactor .
David Charles
Hahn , 31 , was being held on a $ 5,000 bond in the Macomb County Jail after he was arraigned in 41B District Court on charges of larceny from a building , a 4 - year felony .
The local police , and the FBI had been keeping an eye on him ever since he had returned home from his stint in the Navy .
When police arrested Hahn on Wednesday evening , they evacuated the apartment building and called in a Michigan State Police bomb squad to conduct a search of the apartment because of Hahn ’s background and the chemical items he was known to store in his residence .
They found 16 smoke detectors that allegedly had been stolen from buildings in the complex .
The suspect apparently was trying to harvest tiny amounts of the radioactive isotope americium - 241 , a silvery - white metal found in the detectors .
The chemical can cause cancerous tumors and damage internal organs .
There was no mention of what it can do to um …facial skin .

Some in U.S. replace oil heat with wood stoves Reuters
Published : Thursday July 10 , 2008
Print This Email This By Jason Szep BOSTON ( Reuters ) -
It 's summer in the United States , but many Americans are already fretting about winter .
Record prices for home heating oil are rippling across America 's northern regions , stoking demand for wood stoves and other alternatives , and forcing some heating oil companies out of business .
In New England , which has the nation 's highest rates of heating oil use , homeowners are bracing for a near doubling in the cost to fill home oil storage tanks compared with last year .
The surging cost has spread alarm among heating oil distributors , mainly small and often family - run businesses .
Their profit margins already squeezed , they now face the prospect of taking on unprecedented amounts of debt to buy fuel for winter .
" It 's cutting into us really deep now , " said Ray Scarfo , president of Ranco Fuel , a 33 - year - old family - run business in Medford , Massachusetts .
" We do n't even know if we 'll even have a heating oil business when it comes to next winter .
"
Three heating oil companies have failed since March in Connecticut .
Vermont is creating a task force to help residents deal with rising heating oil and gas prices , and from Maine to Minnesota authorities are warning residents to prepare for a surge in the cost of staying warm .
On July 9 , the governors of Maine , Massachusetts , New Hampshire and Rhode Island called on Washington to increase the region 's home heating assistance to $ 1 billion from $ 252 million last winter .
" This is a human catastrophe coming at us in the state of Maine in terms of energy supply and costs , " Angus King , the state 's former governor , told a recent alternative energy industry gathering .
Maine has the highest rate of heating oil use in the nation , with about 87 percent of homes using heating oil or kerosene .
King said he expects the cost to fill a typical family 's heating oil storage tank in Maine could top $ 1,000 this winter , double last year 's cost , following a recent spike in heating oil prices above $ 4 a gallon .
Other estimates put the cost at about $ 800 , up 60 percent from last year .
" Most people are going to have to fill up that tank six times , " said King .
" How is somebody who is making $ 350 or $ 400 a week going to pay to fill up the tank to keep warm ? "
New England pays more for energy than the rest of the nation because of its reliance on fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas extracted from distant states and countries .
The Massachusetts Oilheat Council estimates that heating oil prices in New England are now around $ 4.65 a gallon , up 116 percent since 2005 .
It expects prices to keep rising as the market tracks record - high crude oil prices .
Many homeowners are searching for alternatives to oil .
Sales of wood - burning stoves -- in use since before American independence from Britain -- are brisk , even as customers don shorts and bask in summer weather outside .
" Demand for wood pellet stoves has tripled .
We 're pre-sold out until probably the New Year , " said Tim Bushey , manager at Frost & Flame in Gorham , Maine , which sells wood stoves and stoves that burn wood pellets .
" Right now we have over 300 wood pellet stoves sold and almost 800 tons of pellets , " he added .
Wood pellets are usually made from compacted sawdust .
The Pellet Fuels Institute , a trade body for the U.S. wood pellet industry , said manufacturers are expanding capacity to meet growing demand .
" Could there be an unprecedented run on pellets ?
I do n't think that 's out of the question .
But I think things are happening early enough in the season that certainly our manufacturers will have the ability to ramp up their production as needed , " Bushey said .
The economics of the heating oil business look grim for the typical New England distributor , which supplies about 2.5 million gallons of the fuel each winter , with about 20 percent delivered in January alone .
A decade ago , when heating oil prices averaged around 50 cents a gallon , they needed just over $ 1 million to buy the fuel wholesale .
That was fairly easy to finance given the stability of the business during New England 's harsh winters .
Now , to buy the same 2.5 million gallons at current prices of more than $ 4 a gallon , the cost is 10 times higher at about $ 10 million , a significantly harder amount to borrow .
For some , their entire business is not worth that much , making it difficult to produce the collateral needed to secure a loan .
The weakening economy also means customers are taking longer to pay bills , further straining cash flow .
" Quite simply , their wholesale costs are outpacing their credit lines , " said Matt Cota , executive director of the Vermont Fuel Dealers Association , which represents 125 companies in Vermont , where 75 percent of residents depend on deliverable liquid fuel such as kerosene and heating oil .
" Also our dealers are selling 15 to 20 percent less than they did previously as people here in Vermont supplement their heat with wood , chopping down trees in their backyard in order to do a little parlor stove , " he added .
" So as a dealer you are faced with this reality : you are going to sell 15 to 20 percent less product this year yet you have to go to your banker and ask for two times more money .
That 's a problem , " he said .
Some states fear that heating oil supplies could be disrupted if companies fail during winter , leaving families with few alternatives for heat in remote regions .
Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and Maine Sen. Olympia
Snowe have proposed legislation to allow businesses hurt by rising heating fuel costs access to " economic - injury disaster loans " at subsidized rates until they can get back on their feet .
That could help in Connecticut , where three companies that sell heating oil have gone out of business since March , said Eugene Guilford , executive director of the Independent Connecticut Petroleum Association , an industry body .
" We 're going to begin meetings to determine whether it would be possible to have some state and federal resources put together to provide some additional borrowing power , " he said .
Some heating oil companies are already selling solar power , wood pellets and wood - burning stoves , along with natural gas , he added , but others cannot switch business models quickly enough while costs are high .
" Diversifying your product lines means you are prepared to undertake a capital outlay .
And maybe some are not in that position , " he said .
As a gamer , a writer , a full - time student , and a chat room and instant message addict , I tend to go through keyboards pretty quickly .
I 've been on the look out for a solid new multipurpose USB keyboard , and I managed to score the opportunity to test the soon - to - be- released Das Keyboard Professional , the new iteration of the infamous Das Keyboard .
Most of you will probably remember Das Keyboard as the slick , hacker - inspired , symbol - less keyboard .
The Professional is a new , more mature version of that original board , which I 've found to be a treat for typing and gaming alike .
Currently , the new units are only available in US keyboard layouts .
More information on the two models can be found on the official website .
The Professional strives to be the dream board for touch typers and gamers .
While the other new model , The Ultimate , maintains the traditional lack of inscriptions , the Professional puts them back on for the sake of the average typist .
This USB keyboard , which is compatible with PCs , Macs , Linux boxes , and game consoles , sports a 6.6 foot high - quality USB cable and acts as a USB 2.0 hub : two ports are located discreetly on the right side of the unit , allowing you to clean up the clutter around your machine for cables that you frequently add and remove .
The real stars of the show here , though , are the keys .
Touted as the " best mechanical key switches available , " the Professional keys are composed of gold - plated key switches engineered by German - based Cherry Corporation .
With each keystroke , a light click echoes .
For an idea of how it sounds , take a listen to this recording I put together while typing this article .
If you 're not a fan of noisy keyboards , this wo n't be the one for you : no keystroke goes unheard .
For those of us that prefer the click , though , you 'll receive the kind of satisfying tactile feedback that hearkens back to the typewriter age ; only , the keys are said to outlast normal keyboard keys by up to 40 million keystrokes .
The keys are easily removed and easily cleaned , and offer an impressive amount of response : those with a lighter touch will love how easy it is to press keys and how good high - speed input response is .
As a gaming keyboard , the Professional does away with the cosmetics and opts out of the additional data screen for the sake of pure key response bliss .
The most noteworthy add for gamers is the " n - key " rollover , which allows input of up to 12 key presses simultaneously without jamming .
This means that those vicious bouts of num - key spamming during a World of Warcraft duel will go unhindered by the computer 's cries for input mercy .
Because of this refusal for needless cosmetics , the Das Keyboard is a minimalist 's dream .
Like the great keyboards of the early age of home computing , the Das keeps its hard edges and straight lines in almost all places , while feeling slightly more hip and modern , thanks to a black glossy finish .
There are two small feet to prop up the keyboard as per usual , and some small pads to prevent scratches and hold the unit nicely in place .
Keys are suitably concave ; the home keys sport the small risers to let you know where your fingers are .
The only color on the board comes from the subtle LED lights for the Lock toggles , which glow a dim blue .
It may not have the white grace of , say , an Apple keyboard , but does n't make any sacrifices to performance for the sake of style .
Without question , the Das Keyboard Professional is a great product for touch - typists and gamers looking for simplicity and quality above all else .
It does n't have very many frills , and it 's loud , but the USB hub is a nice addition , and the keyboard is built remarkably well .
The true testament to the unit , though , came when I found myself hesitant to want to pack up the review unit and send it back .
Though it's hard to avoid high subjectivity in the matter , there 's something distinct about the feel of the Das Keyboard that you just wo n't find anywhere else .
Sure , there are cheaper keyboards that rival the Das in simplicity , and more expensive ones that outdo it in functionality , but none feel as good as the Professional .
Your hands will come to crave it .
Verdict : Buy
Manufacturer : Das Keyboard
Price : $ 129.00 ( $ 99 pre-order special on now )

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Most presidential campaign books come at the beginning of the campaign season .
This gives even a bad campaign book undeserved relevance .
But the increased relevance is generally offset by discernable reductions in candor and specificity , so as not to provide one ’s opponent with too many inviting targets .
Ron Paul ’s “ The Revolution : A Manifesto ” defies this convention .
Writing at the end of his campaign , and therefore knowing he will not be the next president , Mr. Paul forcefully articulates our bedrock constitutional principles and energetically advances his argument that these principles can restore American greatness for years to come , if we will only return to them now .
And although Mr. Paul ’s presidential campaign is over , this is indeed a manifesto , not a memoir .
These are political principles for our future , things Mr. Paul wants us to remember after he has left the rostrum .
Mr. Paul ’s central thesis is that we have departed from the principles of our nation ’s Founding in ways that systematically make us less free .
Consequently , we now have a much larger , more powerful national government , one our Founders would not recognize - or might recognize as an empire doomed to the fate of all previous empires .
Such a thesis could easily become unbearably dark and tedious .
But Mr. Paul , a medical doctor , makes his diagnosis in seven concise and lucid chapters that never lose the thread of hope for recovery .
Five of these chapters correspond to broad substantive areas of national policy :
Our role in foreign affairs ( too imperial ) ; the scope of federal power ( too broad ) ; fiscal and regulatory interference with free enterprise ( too heavily distorted by “ looting ” ) ; recent incursions on civil liberties and personal freedom ( too lawless and / or utopian ) ; and the foundations of our monetary system ( too shaky ) .
Mr. Paul ’s ideas on these subjects are not new , but they are well explained and supported here .
Often , he draws on his personal experiences , as a doctor , a congressman and a candidate .
He marshals facts .
He does not split hairs .
( On Social Security : “ The fact is , there is no money in any trust fund .
The government spent it on other things . ” )
Indeed , a great virtue of Mr. Paul ’s manifesto is that he states his views strongly and then deals openly with the counter - arguments his formulations invite .
He knows , for example , that calling income taxation “ forced labor ” will raise eyebrows and that most will regard his proposal to abolish it as impractical .
But Mr. Paul counters that income taxes on individuals account for only about 40 percent of federal revenues , and asks , “ is it really so radical ?
In order to imagine what it would be like to live in a country with a federal budget 40 percent lower than the federal budget of 2007 , it would be necessary to go all the way back to … 1997 . ”
Not every argument is equally strong .
Despite Mr. Paul ’s admirable discussion of inflation and its causes , many will be unpersuaded that a return to the gold standard is the only or even the best answer .
But even on this relatively weak point of Mr. Paul ’s program , he is surely right to wonder why fundamental questions of monetary policy are perpetually off the table .
Mr. Paul notes that comedian Jon Stewart asked Alan Greenspan why the Federal Reserve intervenes in credit markets at all , but few “ serious ” journalists share Mr. Stewart ’s curiosity .
Interestingly , this complaint goes both ways .
Media pundits often criticize the candidates for their vacuities , but here is Ron Paul , raising the questions and attracting a strong following , outperforming media magnets like Fred Thompson and Rudy Giuliani , yet the press never quite took him seriously as a candidate .
We should all take his manifesto seriously .
The McCain and Obama campaigns should both study Mr. Paul ’s “ Revolution ” as they fight for independent votes in November .
This would be a closer fight than Mr. Paul ’s image as a “ far right ” Republican would suggest , and one on which Mr. Obama may in fact have the edge .
As for Mr. Paul himself , his presidential campaign has been converted into the “ Campaign for Liberty , ” an advocacy organization that will try to inject Mr. Paul ’s paleoconservative principles into our political discourse and support candidates who share them .
Could Mr. Paul ’s “ Revolution ” reverse the “ do something ” bias in American politics and create a consensus for letting government do less ?
Mr. Paul puts the choice starkly before us : “ If freedom is what we want , it is ours for the taking .
Let the revolution begin . ”

Mac OS X 10.5.3 may have fixed over 200 bugs in Leopard , but it appears to be causing some significant new ones for users of various Mozilla products .
Mozilla 's developers have traced the problem back to an Apple bundle called VerifiedDownloadPlugin that was initially introduced in Mac OS X 10.4.7 and is thought to be part of a Dashboard widget validation system of some kind .
As a result of changes made by Apple in 10.5.3 , dynamically loading this library can cause the system to hang or crash .
Songbird product manager Daniel Raffel has already informed Apple 's senior vice president of software engineering , who says that Apple is investigating the issue .
A workaround patch that effectively solves the problem for Mozilla - based products was developed yesterday by Steven Michaud , a Firefox developer who is known for his work on the JEP .
" As you can see in my patch 's comments , it gets around the Apple bug ( that , as of OS X 10.5.3 , you can't dlopen the VerifiedDownloadPlugin ) by using nlist ( ) to check for a symbol first , to see if dlopen ( ) should be used on a given plugin , " Michaud wrote .
He has made available a Mac OS X Firefox build with the patch applied so that developers can test the solution and make sure that it works properly .
Several testers have reported that his fix seems to do the trick .
He intends to request that the bug be marked as a blocker for Gecko 1.9 so that it can be included in final release of Firefox 3 .
That would also require Mozilla to issue a third release candidate .
There are some concerns that the dynamic loading problem might not be isolated to the VerifiedDownloadPlugin bundle , which means that there could be a more serious problem in Apple 's platform caused by the 10.5.3 release .
Apple has not yet provided details about the scope of the problem or how it is being addressed .
Update : Mozilla has released a third Firefox 3 release candidate which contains the workaround patch that resolves the problem .
No doubt , mass production of the automobile is one of the greatest innovations of all times .
It has allowed for increased mobility of goods and people , which has greatly improved productivity and leisure .
But , is subsidizing mobility at the expense of taxpayers taking things too far ?
In various blogs and forums , I frequently come across the argument that the costs of automobile use are fully ( or mostly ) internalized through gas taxes and fees .
Often , this argument is used by free - market impostors against transit subsidies , or by automobile enthusiasts in defense of highway socialism .
The usual argument is that the costs of roads and infrastructure are paid through gas taxes , and thus the users of the roads are funding what they use .
This is a powerful and pervasive myth that will continue to distort the truth , unless serious scrutiny is given to the assertion .
Let us first examine the validity of the assertion through studies of the explicit costs ( actual dollars ) of roads in the US and the taxes and fees collected .
Next , we will look deeper and discuss the implicit costs ( ie opportunity costs ) of roads and automobile use as well as acknowledge externalities involved with automobile use .
The Explicit Costs
We can see the extent of the Urbanism Legend by looking at wikipedia :
Virtually 100 percent of the construction and maintenance costs are funded through user fees , primarily fuel taxes , collected by states and the federal government , and tolls collected on toll roads and bridges .[ citation needed ]
( The claim that only 56 percent of costs are funded by user fees is based on the misinterpretation of a table that applies to all highways , roads , and streets , not just the Interstate Highways .[ citation needed ] )
In the eastern United States , large sections of some Interstate highways planned or built prior to 1956 are operated as toll roads .
Mark A. Delucchi of The Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis has researched this topic extensively .
According to one study , Do Motor Vehicle Users in the U.S. pay their way ? :
I make a comprehensive analysis of all possible expenditures and payments , and then compare them according to three of the four ways of counting expenditures and payments .
The analysis indicates that in the US current tax and fee payments to the government by motor - vehicle users fall short of government expenditures related to motor - vehicle use by approximately 20 – 70 cents per gallon of all motor fuel .
( Note that in this accounting we include only government expenditures ; we do not include any ‘‘ external ’’ costs of motor - vehicle use . )
The extent to which one counts indirect government expenditures related to motor - vehicle use is a key factor in the comparison .
In the summary of the results , DeLucchi observes :
[ C]urrent user payments probably are on the order of 80 –90 % of the associated government expenditures on MVIS .
[ I encourage readers to link to other research on the matter in your comments – even if it dissents ]
One could argue that simply closing the funding gap with higher fees and taxes would take more than 20 - 70 cents per gallon since the higher cost would reduce demand of driving and thus gas tax revenues .
As DeLucchi states :
[ A ] n initial increase in the motor - fuel tax likely would reduce the quantity of motor - fuel demanded and thereby necessitate a further tax increase to compensate for the reduced volume of fuel subject to the tax .
Thus , we can clearly see that from a simple sources - and - uses analysis , roadway use is significantly subsidized above gas tax and fee revenues in the United States .
The Implicit ( Opportunity ) Costs
Looking only at the dollars going in and out is a simplistic way of looking at an economics issue .
However , to fully analyze , we must look at the opportunity costs of resources and productive activity that is forgone in order for the government to provide roads .
According to Nobel Laureate , James Buchanan , opportunity cost expresses “ the basic relationship between scarcity and choice . ”
To ignore opportunity cost would result in a huge distortion in the perceived value of roads in society .
Land :
Most empirical research looks only at construction and maintenance cost , which are easier to track .
However , we need to consider that highways and roads take up a considerable amount of valuable real estate .
If not used as roads , the land would likely serve some other productive use .
It would be difficult to estimate what the opportunity cost of the land would be , but it certainly would be significant .
Even more difficult to quantify is the forgone property tax revenue of the road land .
Consider land currently occupied as roads that could relatively easily be privatized for more productive uses .
The most obvious example of this is street parking .
In many instances , adjacent property owners could very profitably put street spaces to good use as seating for cafes , or landscaping and setbacks that improve home values .
Capital : Road construction is typically financed through tax - exempt bond issuance .
This puts a burden on the borrowing ability of governments for non-road spending , and diverts capital from non-exempt private investments in competitive capital markets .
Taxes :
On top of lost revenue from tax - exempt bond issuance and property taxes , the fact that roads are not private means governments forgoes taxing a private operator of the roads as it would tax other private enterprises .
Instead of being a source of corporate tax revenue , roads themselves drain government resources .
Environmental and Other Externalities
One externality we can see plainly is the value of properties along highways , between nodes .
Because of noise , air quality , and other externalities , homes typically do n’t locate along highways .
( although commercial uses pop up at critical nodes )
As a result , this land is usually left undeveloped or used by location - insensitive industrial firms who keep land costs low .
The extent highways hurt nearby property values would be very difficult to estimate nationwide , but certainly significant .
It is even more difficult ( and contentious ) to quantify the environmental externalities involved with road use , and costs of defense of US oil interests .
So , I ’ll leave that discussion for another time , if I ever dare to touch it .
But , for your reading pleasure , at the extreme , one study estimates the subsidies and external costs of oil use to be $ 5.60 to $ 15.14 per gallon !
I am very skeptical of this study , but it does open discussion to many of the subsidies and externalities that could be considered in thoughtful examination .
Conclusion
Total gas tax and fee revenues fall short of funding total road expenses in the US .
This gap widens when considering opportunity costs before even considering externalities .
What ’s the proper solution ?
Just raise the gas tax and let politicians battle over the right amount to cover opportunity costs and externalities ?
Or even better : privatize the roads , and let the market sort out the optimal use of roads for automobiles .
( And when I say privatize , ideally I would n’t leave highways as a tax - exempt , public - private partnership .
Let roads compete in the marketplace with all other goods and services on a completely level playing field . )

A senior DHS official is seriously interested in EMD Bracelets for all airline passengers .
The basic idea is to replace boarding passes with bracelets that would connect passengers with their luggage , serve as passenger identification , enable tracking throughout the airport…oh and they have the abililty to taser you if you get out of line .
That ’s right .
EMD stands for Electro - Muscular Disruption .
If you do n’t believe that someone is seriously marketing this – here ’s the infomercial
These things are obviously a bad idea for several reasons .
Everyone is screaming Big Brother is watching !
But here are 5 more problems with EMD bracelets .
Montreal , PQ ( Reuters ) - Sarah Medhurst ( nee Black ) shocked journalists and legal scholars at a press conference held at the Black family estate Monday when she revealed that Black 's Law Dictionary , a highly regarded legal reference text , was originally written as a joke by her eccentric great grandfather Henry Campbell Black .
Medhurst appeared unapologetic , suggesting that the Black family had never tried very hard to keep it a secret .
" Have any of you actually taken the time to read it ? ” she asked , flipping open the renowned text .& nbsp ; “ Look at page 840 for instance .
' John - a - Nokes ' ?
Or how about page 347 ?
' Correality – the quality or state of being correal . "
She then cast a challenging look around the room .
Medhurst admitted that the entire Black family has participated in the century - long ruse , working together to generate content for the ever - expanding text .
She credits her Uncle Bertrand with developing one of their most successful filler techniques : " We created more than 30 new entries just by using the word ' actual ' .
Actual agency - see agency .
Actual allegiance - see allegiance .
Actual authority - see authority .
And on and on - you get the idea . "
Medhurst admits that the family started to get lazy in later editions , at times resorting to stealing terms from other dictionaries .
" I remember one time my brother pulled ' Le Roi ' ( literally : " the king " ) right out of his French - English dictionary to meet the deadline for the 5th edition while on a three - week ski trip in the French Alps . "
She claims the ploy has been used sparingly , however , and that the family put a stop to the practice when her brother started bringing the Official Scrabble Dictionary to editorial meetings .
Henry Campbell
Black had never intended - or even imagined - that his dictionary would become the authoritative source for legal terminology .
" My great granddad had actually written the text for an upcoming firm skit night " , Medhurst explains .
" It was his way of showing how convoluted and , well , pompous the legal profession had become . "
The dictionary became an instant hit , however , and Henry Black 's comedic intentions went unnoticed .
When the money started to roll in , Black elected to pursue a highly lucrative career in legal publishing instead of becoming a marginally talented prop comic .
When asked why the family is revealing the fake after all this time , Medhurst stated that they had grown tired of living a lie , and were genuinely concerned that the universally accepted legal lexicon " is actually just a bunch of made - up gibberish . "
The family is asking that lawyers and students alike immediately dispose of any editions of Black 's Law Dictionary into the nearest trash receptacle or recycle bin .
West Group , the current publisher of Black 's , could not be reached for comment .
Security was tightened up in Baghdad for the visit US Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama has met the Iraqi prime minister on his first visit to Baghdad as part of a major foreign tour .
Mr Obama has advocated pulling out US combat troops within 16 months if elected president in November .
Earlier , in Kabul , Mr Obama said the battle against terrorism had to focus on the situation in Afghanistan .
However , US commanders , and some members of the Iraqi government , are opposed to setting any timetables .
Constructive discussion Mr Obama held talks with Prime Minister Nouri Maliki shortly after arriving as part of a US Congressional delegation .
The pair met in Baghdad 's heavily - protected Green Zone , the seat of the Iraqi government .
The Illinois senator said he " had a very constructive discussion " with the Iraqi prime minister .
Senator Obama wants the US to hand over responsibility for security to Iraq .
Senator Obama also met President Jalal Talabani as well as the top US military commander in Iraq , Gen David Petraeus .
While advocating the withdrawal of combat troops , Mr Obama says he is prepared to be flexible on details , and could leave some troops behind for special tasks , such as training Iraqi forces and tackling remnants of the al - Qaeda in Iraq group .
But he did not speak with Prime Minister Maliki about the issue , according to an Iraqi government spokesman , Ali al - Dabbagh .
" This issue , we do not discuss , " said Mr Dabbagh , " Obama did not speak about anything which concerns the Iraqi government because he does not have any official ( government ) capacity , " he said .
Senator Obama is visiting a series of countries over the next week in an attempt to bolster his foreign policy and security credentials .
He is also due to visit Jordan , Israel , Germany , France and the UK .
' Time horizon ' [ Mr Obama ] is stubbornly adhering to an unconditional withdrawal
Randy Scheunemann
Adviser for John McCain
Pitfalls for Obama on world tour Travelling with Mr Obama are two Senate colleagues , Jack Reed and Chuck Hagel , who are long - time critics of the US military 's involvement in Iraq .
Mr Obama wants
Iraq to assume principal responsibility for security , according to one of his senior foreign policy advisors , Susan Rice .
" We cannot sustain the current high levels of deployment in Iraq indefinitely ... without breaking our military , " she told the BBC .
" Nor can we maintain them at high levels in permanent bases with the agreement of the Iraqi government because they 've been quite clear that they do n't want that . "
On Sunday , the Iraqi government denied that Mr Maliki had told a German magazine that he backed Mr Obama 's plan to withdraw combat troops within 16 months , saying his remarks had been misunderstood .
Last week , Mr Maliki and US President George W Bush said they had agreed to set a " time horizon " for the withdrawal as part of a security pact still being negotiated .
Mr Obama came to Iraq after a brief visit to neighbouring Kuwait Any decision to remove troops would be based on " improving conditions " , not an " arbitrary date " , the White House said .
The BBC's Jim Muir , in Baghdad , says the leaders of Iraq 's governing coalition are under pressure to show movement towards sovereignty .
They risk being outflanked in forthcoming provincial elections by more militant elements calling for an immediate withdrawal of foreign forces , such as the group led by the radical Shia cleric , Moqtada Sadr , our correspondent says .
Violence in Iraq is at its lowest level since 2004 , although frequent attacks continue throughout the country .
Some 50 people died in two separate twin suicide bombings last week .
Afghanistan ' focus '
Speaking before his visit , Mr Obama said some of the troops withdrawn from Iraq ought to be sent to Afghanistan to reinforce efforts there against a resurgent Taleban and to control spiralling violence .

" We have to understand that the situation is precarious and urgent and I believe this has to be the central focus , the central front , in the battle against terrorism , " he told the CBS programme , Face the Nation .
He said the US needed to start planning immediately to send in more troops and called for an extra one to two brigades in Afghanistan .
Mr Obama 's Republican presidential rival , John McCain , has criticised him for announcing a strategy before visiting the region and for setting a date for a US withdrawal from Iraq .
Mr McCain 's foreign policy adviser , Randy Scheunemann , said Mr Obama was " stubbornly adhering to an unconditional withdrawal that places politics above the advice of our military commanders " .

RUSUTSU , Japan — President Bush and leaders of the world ’s richest nations pledged Tuesday to “ move toward a low - carbon society ” by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050 , the latest step in a long evolution by a president who for years played down the threat of global warming .
The declaration by the Group of 8 — the United States , Japan , Germany , Britain , France , Italy , Canada and Russia — was the first time that the Bush White House had publicly backed an explicit long - term target for eliminating the gases that scientists have said are warming the planet .
But it failed to set a goal for cutting emissions over the next decade , and drew sharp criticism from environmentalists , who called it a missed opportunity .
On Wednesday , leaders of developing nations took up the climate change issue and said that they too supported “ a long - term global goal for emission reductions , ” but they were not specific and fell short of supporting the Group of 8 declaration .
In a sense , the Group of 8 document represents an environmental quid pro quo .
In exchange for agreeing to the “ 50 by 2050 ” language , Mr. Bush got what he has sought as his price for joining an international accord : a statement from the rest of the Group of 8 that developing nations like China and India , which have not accepted mandatory caps on carbon emissions , must be included in any climate change treaty .
ADRSPACH , Czech Republic 
Exactly a decade has passed since a man called Oxygen first hurled himself across Amerika .
Known for his jumping ability , Oxygen , a lanky Czech , catapulted to legend status by leaping a nearly 10 - foot - wide abyss separating two 100 - foot sandstone spires .
Today , Petr Kops , 21 , is wearing Oxygen ’s hand - me - down pants .
“ I did not know Oxygen personally , but my sister did , ” Kops said .
“ I wear his trousers for good luck . ”
Minutes later , Kops was standing at the edge of a 70 - foot chasm called Broken Bones .
He announced that he was about to damage his ankle .
Then he jumped .
While it may seem suicidal , leaping across a gaping crevasse is actually an extreme sport that is gaining in popularity .

Local reporters for Fox , CBS , and NBC in St. Louis squared off Wednesday with McCain press aide Nicolle Wallace , a former Bush White House communications director seen here claiming she " worked at the White House for seven years " ( Seven years ?
Really ? ) and her boss , Brooke Buchanan , McCain 's national press secretary .
It may be a bit hard to follow , but apparently all the fuss was over the McCain campaign 's attempt to micromanage " the shot . "
WIndy 's Matt Delong explains :
For all those who favor just " letting McCain be McCain , " it 's not going to happen -- not with this crew at least .
They decide what angles he 's shot from ( never from the left , he has scars from a bout with melanoma ) , and they make sure there is always some patriotic imagery in the background , no matter which direction the camera is facing .
Okay , that may help explain what was going on with the McCain camp , but why would the ' Show Me State ' reporters seem to recoil at a request to ' show me ' the shot ?
Could the media 's infatuation with McCain actually be hitting a snag , or could it have had something to do with the fact that all this happened just one day after the news that St. Louis - based Anheuser - Busch would be sold to the Belgian firm InBev when John McCain showed up to " to rub salt in the wounds of Missourians suffering the slings and arrows of a GOP - ruined economy " ?
Fired Up ! Missouri :
McCain promptly comes to St. Louis -- the home of Anheuser - Busch -- for a mega - dollar reception at the vast estate of the former United States ambassador to , of all countries , Belgium .
Notwithstanding the fact that John and Cindy McCain will reap millions of dollars from the Anheuser - Busch sale .
...
Whatever the reason , it 's worth noting that even before this train wreck , Missouri was already shaping up to be a tight race .

The push to improve the integrity of the white - hot oil futures market is gaining momentum .
With suspicions of oil speculation on the rise , the USA 's top commodities cop announced steps Tuesday to close some regulatory loopholes that hindered its ability to detect market abuse .
The moves are designed to make it easier for U.S. - based regulators to monitor investors that trade U.S. oil on foreign exchanges and identify ones that try to game the system .
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) will now require trades placed on the ICE Futures Europe , an electronic exchange based in London , to adhere to the same position limits and reporting standards that apply in the USA .
The more stringent rules apply to the West Texas Intermediary crude oil contract , which is linked to the New York Mercantile Exchange ( Nymex ) crude oil contract .
The new rules , which must be met for ICE traders to access U.S. markets , take effect in 120 days .
This change will , in effect , undo some of the regulatory differences between the CFTC and the Financial Services Authority , which oversees British trading .
It will enable the CFTC to gather more detailed overseas trading information — especially on large positions — on a more frequent basis .
The CFTC will now be able to observe a trader 's full position in both U.S. and foreign futures markets to " ensure that traders are not gaming one market to influence the other , " noted CFTC 's acting Chairman Walter Lukken .
The CFTC has been hamstrung in its surveillance because it had been able to closely monitor trading activity only on U.S. - based exchanges , such as Nymex .
It had less access and power to gather information about trades taking place overseas on markets such as ICE that it does n't regulate .
That setup made it easier for traders to build , disguise and hide big positions that could be considered speculative or even manipulative .
Lawmakers , many critical of CFTC , have blamed this regulatory blind spot for driving oil prices up roughly 40 % this year to $ 134 a barrel .
The CFTC 's announcement coincided with a Senate hearing Tuesday on Capitol Hill that addressed the role , responsibilities and resource needs of the CFTC .
At the hearing , Sen. Richard Durbin , D - Ill. , chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government , said the government is still trying to figure out the cause of the oil super spike .
He suspects that something other than supply - and - demand is at play .
He would n't rule out speculation or manipulation .
" No one knows for sure what 's going on here , " Durbin said in prepared remarks .
Durbin said he will work to secure additional funding requested by the CFTC .
It asked for $ 27 million above the $ 130 million budgeted for 2009 .

On Jan. 15 , Carsten Thomassen , a 38 - year - old Norwegian who worked for the Oslo daily Dagbladet , died in a suicide bombing at a hotel in Kabul .
On Feb. 27 , Shihab al - Tamimi , head of the Iraqi Journalists Syndicate , died after being shot in Baghdad .
On March 29 , Carlos Quispe Quispe , a Bolivian journalist for a government - run radio station , was severely beaten by protesters demanding the ouster of the local mayor and died .
On April 25 , Jassim al - Batat , a correspondent at Al - Nakhil TV and Radio , was shot and killed by unidentified gunmen in a small town north of Basra .
On Friday , NBC News journalist and commentator Tim Russert died while doing voice - overs for his Sunday news program .
I â€ ” weâ€ ” have obviously heard of Mr. Russert .
But I had never heard of journalists Thomassen , al - Tamimi , Quispe , and al - Batat until I visited the Web site of the Committee to Protect Journalists , which tracks deaths , injuries , and disappearances of journalists worldwide .
Mr. Russert ’s life and legacy deserves the outpouring of grief and tribute after his unexpected death at only 58 years old .
He was an admirable , competent and compelling interviewer and seeker of truth .
But because he wielded an exceptionally large megaphone â€ ” the pulpit of “ Meet The Press ” â€ ” he was also a celebrity .
The amount and tenor of news coverage of his passing , particularly in broadcast media , reflected his celebrity as much as his journalistic accomplishments and integrity .
Even print media , particularly large east - of - the - Mississippi metro dailies , said farewell prominently both in print and on Web sites .
Today ’s Web pages of The New York Times , Washington Post , Boston Globe , Chicago Tribune , Los Angeles Times , Seattle Times , Denver Post , Houston Chronicle , and his hometown Buffalo News carry extensive obituaries , pieces in memoriam , and appreciations .
At MSNBC , a black banner flies over a photograph of Mr. Russert and invitation for viewers to leave remembrances .
This morning , CNN switched back and forth between Midwest floods and fawning remembrances of Mr. Russert by anchors and others .
CBS News has a story and video of Mr. Russert on its Web site .
I did not know Mr. Russert .
But I wonder :
Would he have been embarrassed that so much air time , print space and Web usage was devoted to chronicling his passing ?
Would he have asked of gatekeepers : “ You doing this because I ’m newsworthy â€ ” or merely a celebrity ? ”
Without wishing to hasten anyone ’s demise , consider the journalists still breathing â€ ” particularly those long - time , well - known , well - paid broadcast anchors and other pundits .
When they push up daisies , will the coverage reflect that of Mr. Russert ’s passing ?
Reflect , please , on the August 2005 death of ABC newsman Peter Jennings , anchor of “ World News Tonight ” since 1983 .
Was the coverage similar in scope ?
I think yes .
But why ?
Reason 1 : Broadcast journalists who spend decades on air and literally share our living rooms become a cross between family member ( witness many of the remembrances printed about Mr. Russert ) and a celebrity .
We , the readers and viewers , want to know as much as we can about these people to salve our own feelings of loss , and newsroom gatekeepers know this .
Reason 2 : Journalists of note who die have their colleagues back in the newsroom to place the news of their passing on prominent display .
The best , most respected bakers , butchers and candlestick makers do n’t have that luxury .
That has always troubled me , that journalists can elevate the deaths of their brethren higher than most other occupations can .
That is a significant power of gate - keeping , even though love and admiration of a colleague should not always equal automatic newsworthiness .
Reason 3 : Big-name , big - salary journalists are extraordinarily influential in corridors of power .
That makes them valuable assets to the corporations that hire them to be pundits .
Mr. Russert ’s annual salary no doubt had a significant number of zeroes after the first digit .
Perhaps those left behind in the newsroom wish to remind those in the corridors of wealth and influence elsewhere that we ’ve got the power , too , and do n’t you forget it .
Meanwhile , other journalists with talent and determination â€ ” but not the ratings or readership reach of Mr. Russert â€ ” continue to die doing what the profession has historically done â€ ” seek the facts that illuminate truth .
So far , 13 have died this year .
Since 1992 , 685 journalists have died with murder the most frequent cause .
They have received far too little recognition for their sacrifice and dedication .
Journalism has the capacity of elevate its own .
My newsroom godfather died far too early , at 56 .
He reminded us frequently that should he pass on , “ Just do an obit .
That ’s all .
Put in on the jump page with everyone else ’s . ”
We did n’t .
The story ran on page one … but at least it was below the fold .
Rest in peace , Mr. Russert .
“ Go Bills ! ”

World food prices have increased dramatically , by almost 60 percent on average since March of last year , according to the index compiled by the World Food and Agricultural Organization , and there 's no sign yet that they 're going to substantially fall back in the near future .
With record prices on the Chicago Board of Trade for futures contracts on agricultural commodities , it seems very likely that the high food prices are here to stay for the next few years .
Naturally , governments all over the world now feel compelled to rectify the situation and are busy enacting or preparing to enact various measures that they believe will help ease the rise of food prices .
In general , however , they only succeed in making things worse .
In some places , like Argentina , Egypt , India , Kazakhstan , or Indonesia , for example , local governments have imposed new export tariffs in order to protect the domestic food market from rising international price pressures , thus setting the stage for endemic shortages .
In other places , like Russia or China , things have gone much further , and export tariffs have been coupled with price controls on basic foods such as bread , milk , and eggs .
The Mexican government , on the other hand , has reacted by mixing one bad idea — namely , price controls for food — with a good idea rather a little too late : lowering import tariffs for various agricultural products .
Governments in several other countries from Latin America , Europe , Africa , and Asia , including the European Union — despite protests from the French minister of agriculture — have lowered or even suspended import tariffs for various agricultural commodities coming from certain trading partners .
While this is far from the ideal of an immediate abolition of all tariffs — and it's as distortionary as politically managed trade can be , even in time of crisis — it is certainly a small step in the right direction and might help ensure a smoother supply of food in some places .
All in all however , there seems to be little that can be done in the short term for the world 's poorest people .
The hundreds of millions of people who live on the border of poverty , who spend almost all their income on food , are now faced with the threat of starvation .
Already , in more than seventeen countries around the world , from Mexico to Indonesia , from Argentina to Mongolia , and from Mozambique to Morocco , the hungry poor have sparked riots and civil unrest in the wake of higher food prices that they cannot afford .
The anger felt by these rough but fragile people , the fruit of desperation born out of the usual mixture of poverty and oppression that characterizes the underdeveloped parts of the world , can sometimes be misguided ; but in its most fundamental expression , it is just , courageous , and even commendable .
But how did this happen ?
With hundreds of billions of dollars spent each year on development aid and various antipoverty programs in the so - called third world , with an array of governmental and intergovernmental agencies designed to lift the planet 's poorest out of earthly misery , and with no notable natural disaster affecting crops and agricultural production , how can a food crisis that threatens millions with starvation have come about ?
Undoubtedly , rising prices for oil and oil - derived fertilizers did have an impact on food prices , but oil prices cannot entirely account for the soaring food prices observed .
It is certainly true that increased demand from emerging markets , such as China and India , has also put pressure on prices .
Moreover , the increased demand for meat and dairy emanating from these countries — a result of diets moving away from more traditional vegetarian foods , in favor of more western - style meals — must have triggered a process of adjustment along the capital structure that necessitates some time before it is capable of supplying the additional specific demand .
However , the pressure from both higher oil prices and higher grain consumption in emergent economies pales in comparison with the recent increase of industrial demand for grain in the production of various types of biofuels that occurred during recent years .
Thus , almost all additional US corn production between 2004 and 2007 , for instance , has been diverted to the production of ethanol , while the European ethanol production more than tripled during the same period .
The increased use of grains for ethanol production has led to a fall in the supply of grains relative to overall demand during the last seven years ( with the exception of 2006 , which was compensated by the use of grain stocks , now at the lowest level globally in a quarter century ) .
This situation is not , however , a natural market phenomenon , but the direct result of various government programs — usually in the world 's most developed economies , although developing countries are catching up — that aim to promote more environmentally friendly energy technology or energy self - sufficiency by subsidizing and mandating the diversion of a growing percentage of agricultural commodities such as corn , sugar cane , wheat , and so on , to the production of bioethanol and biodiesel .
The increased production of biofuels in the United States , Brazil , Europe , and elsewhere is thus effectively obtained at the expense of food production — or , as it turns out , potentially at the cost of the lives of millions of the world 's poorest inhabitants who are now priced out of the market for food .
Contemplating the grotesque potential side effects of bioethanol subsidies in the world 's most developed economies is almost unbearable .
While everyone is affected by higher food prices , for some people they mean only giving up a new pair of shoes or a night out .
For others , however , the more costly food puts their very subsistence into question .
No doubt , the politicians who came up with the idea of subsidizing the diversion of grain to the production of bioethanol did not intend to starve the world 's poorest people ; but the fact that the consequences were unintended does not absolve them of responsibility .
This brief interview with MIT neurobiologist Matt Wilson , posted on the TIME website a few days ago , is an interesting addition to a long - standing debate about memory : do people recall good or bad events more easily ?
Convincing research exists for both arguments , but according to Professor Wilson it ’s much easier for people to recall negative occurrences :
“ We think of memory as a record of our experience .
But the idea is not just to store information ; it ’s to store relevant information .
[ The idea is ] to use our experience to guide future behavior . ”
“ … The speculation is that we process memory in order to solve problems .
And things we should learn from , things that are particularly important or that have strong emotions tied to them , may be things that are going to be important in the future .
If you present stimuli with a strong negative emotional component , the memories do seem to be more easily retrieved than neutral stimuli or even those that are somewhat positive … ”
Other studies run counter to Walker ’s ideas , however , such as this 2003 Review of General Psychology article by W. Richard Walker et al. entitled “ Life is Pleasant – and Memory Helps to Keep It That Way ! ” .
In the study , the authors found that people generally show a positive bias toward past memories , for two reasons .
First , people “ perceive events in their lives to more often be pleasant than unpleasant ” .
Second , “ the affect [ feeling or emotion ] associated with unpleasant events fades faster than the affect associated with pleasant events , ” a phenomenon known as the fading affect bias .
Depressed people were an exception to the rule – they tended to exhibit less “ fading ” behavior .
Overall , though , Walker and colleagues concluded that “ these biases allow people to cope with tragedies , celebrate joyful moments , and look forward to tomorrow . ”
So , what conclusions can we draw from these contradictory research findings ?
First , it ’s important to note that our memories are not unchangeable recordings , as we like to imagine .
Even Wilson admits this , adding towards the end of his interview :
“ [ Emotional content ] does not necessarily mean that events are remembered more accurately , and that ’s an important distinction .
In fact , there ’s a lot of evidence that all memories can be altered .
It ’s a normal process — we ’re constantly taking our experience and revising it , even twisting it to our own benefit . ”
Unless something is so traumatic as , say , the September 11 , 2001 World Trade Center attacks ( an example offered by Laura Blue , who interviewed Prof. Wilson ) , I like to think that time really can soften the blow of negative events , as with Walker ’s fading affect bias .
I have certainly found this to be the case in my own life – the painful feelings associated with negative events fade gradually over time , while happy memories reliably make me feel good when I recall them , no matter how long ago they took place .
The Persistence of Memory : Are Negative Events Easier to Recall ?
Thursday , June 19 , 2008 by Maasanova
With the global awakening of what really happened on 9/11 surging ahead at full steam , many people are now aware of facts such as prior government knowledge of the attacks , the mysterious collapse of WTC 7 , all of the military and terror drills going on at the same time of the attacks , and the possibility that WTC 1 , 2 and 7 were brought down by controlled demolition , and not by fire .
What is not known by the majority of these people , but is as equally important as WTC 7 is the story of Urban Moving Systems .
It is no surprise that the hidden history of Urban Moving Systems remains unknown to of the majority of the American population , and even within the 9/11 truth community , since it 's story was never included in the official 9/11 Commission Report , and has been absent from all of the popular 9/11 " truth movies . "
Please watch this seven minute video for more details :
So what exactly was Urban Moving Systems and how does it tie into 9/11 ?
" Dominick Suter , owner of the company Urban Moving Systems , flees the country to Israel .
The FBI later tells ABC News , “ Urban Moving may have been providing cover for an Israeli intelligence operation . ”
Suter has been tied to the five Israeli agents caught filming the WTC attack .
The FBI had questioned Suter around September 12 , removing boxes of documents and a dozen computer hard drives .
However , when the FBI returns a few days later , he is gone . " [ source : ABC News 6/21/2002 ]
So according to the FBI , an Israeli intelligence gathering operation was set up in Weehawken , NJ posing as a fake moving company , whose employees failed polygraph tests , whose owner was questioned but then mysteriously flees the US .
And why did our corrupt media and elected officials conceal this fact from the American people via the 9/11 whitewash commission ?!?
Maybe it was because this inconvenient fact would have made it hard for the Bush Administration to pin the horrific terrorist attacks on suicidal Muslim highjackers ?
What do you think ?
Well , it is time for the story of Urban Moving Systems to become as commonly known as WTC7 and controlled demolitions to the American people .
On Tuesday , June 17 , 2008 I was doing a bit of random 9/11 research and I came across a website called FedSpending.org , after I googled ' urban moving systems ' .
FedSpending.org is a project of OMB Watch , a Washington based , non-profit citizen 's watchdog group that is intended to promote government accountability and citizen participation .
All I can say is that this website has delivered , and I was pleased to have come across this piece of internet gold with relatively little digging :

As you can see based on the government data that was released on August 28 , 2007 , Urban Moving Systems was awarded federal funding in the amount of $ 498,750 and non-federal funding in the amount of $ 166,250 for a total of $ 665,000 and the payout date was June 22 , 2001 .
So in other words , our government , whether knowingly or unknowingly funded an Israeli intelligence gathering operation tied to an FBI investigation , with American taxpayer 's dollars !
But wait , it gets even nastier .
Urban Moving Systems was also a moving scam operation as well .
In December of 2001 , the State of New Jersey obtained a court order giving inspectors from Consumer Affairs access to the facility allowing all citizens who had goods stored at Urban Moving Systems '
Weehawken warehouse access to retrieve their belongings .

The complaint also alleges that Suter violated the Mover 's Act by , among other things , failing to provide Consumer Affairs the name of a current contact person or agent , not adequately responding to consumer requests for access to their belongings and not having an agent available for at least 20 - 30 per week to allow consumers access to their belongings .
The State of New Jersey , at the same time , filed a lawsuit in Hudson County Superior Court against Urban Moving Systems and its owner Dominick Suter alleging violations of both the State 's Consumer Fraud Act and regulations set forth in the Public Movers and Warehousing Licensing Act .

To me , the master of modern stop motion is film maker Adam Pesapane ( aka PES ) .
He can do more with a matchstick and a bag of candy corn that most film makers could hope to with a full crew and million dollar budget .
Perhaps necessity is the mother of invention in his films , but he uses his remarkable skill and ingenuity to take the most innocuous household items and turn them into something outstanding .
His recently released short , “ Western Spaghetti ” , is his best one yet and has to be seen to be appreciated :
In a recent profile in Paste Magazine , the brilliant Michel Gondry said of PES “ Clicking on a PES film is to open a safe and see a million ideas glittering and exploding .
The only reason you close the door is to re-open it just after and discover what will pop this time . ”
Damn .
High praise indeed .
A success at taking his own quirky style and integrating into commericals for big time clients like Nike , Sony , Orange , and Bacardi , he has n’t let his commerical work dampen his own creative exploration .
And for that , I ’m very thankful .
All of the shorts and commercials on his site are worth a thorough checkout ( in fact , the more you watch them , the more you catch small details you missed before ) , but here are a few more of my absolute faves :

When you decided to learn Ruby on Rails ( if you did , that is ) , chances are that you bought a book .
I did , too , actually : there are a lot of very interesting and fairly comprehensive books out there after all .
I actually never bought a book to learn PHP , in the past though .
Why ’s that ?
Well , for two simple reasons :
The PHP manual can easily be searched and provides enough documentation , in most cases .
manual can easily be searched and provides enough documentation , in most cases .
When the documentation is not enough , there ’s always plenty of comments by experienced developers to save your day .
That being said , PHP is still an awfully disorganized language , but believe it or not , coming from PHP I did n’t find Rails documentation useful enough simply because it did n’t have these two simple but very powerful features .
Sure , there ’s the Rails Documentation Project which provides more organized docs , and Noobkit does a nice job with its search - as - you - type feature … but still is not quite enough : you ’d expect something much better than that for something like Rails !
h3 .
Introducing Rails - Doc.org
Rails - Doc.org focuses on providing a better interface to Rails documentation by offering two key features :
A powerful , fast and useful document search
The possibility to add notes to Rails documentation
When the app went live , I immediately registered ( it ’s free of course ) and started playing with it …
Search as you type …
The first thing I did was trying the search features , of course .
I started typing “ rout ” for Routing , and I was immediately shown a list of matches :
It took a small fraction of a second to load the matches , which makes me think that definitely they have all the names indexed somewhere .
Nevertheless , it was a pleasant surprise : normally , these search - as - you - type utilities are not that refined !
All you need to do is start typing at least three letters , and you get results , if any .
if you press ENTER , you get automatically redirected to the first result .
This can be good , but maybe it would have been nicer to load a “ traditional ” list of results , but it depends on your taste , really .
… or browse through the namespaces
Alternatively , it is possible to browse the docs in the more traditional way , i.e. according to their class or module : the Browse page does just that : it lists all Rails classes and modules , regardless of the nesting .
But there ’s more : a little roundy icon precedes each class name , to indicate whether the documentation is present , and to what degree :
This is an interesting concept : in this way , in theory , people should contribute to the documentation where it ’s more needed .
Each reference page is very neatly re-formatted : you can hardly imagine it ’s actually the same content included in Rails ’ RDoc pages !
Finally , another nice addition is the Related column , which lists links to other items which are related to the current topic :
Contribute , contribute , contribute !
You have to register for something , do n’t you ?
Yes .
If you register , you can post notes to any document .
Simple enough , all you have to do is to click the Add Note button and a form will slide down for you to fill in :
As you start typing , you ’ll notice that a preview of the note is displayed instantly : as you can use SimpleMarkup to write notes , exactly like in RDoc , this feature can be very handy :
What if there ’s no documentation for a particular class or method ?
You ’ll get a warning like this one :
The idea behind this is that , if you provide some useful insights , they ’ll eventually end up in Rails core documentation .
An Short Interview with Mikael Roos , from Nodeta
Before the application went live , I was lucky enough to get Mikael Roos to answer to some of my questions .
Here ’s the full interview …
What are you actually trying to do on Rails - Doc.org ?
The initial goal of the project is to provide the existing documentation in a more accessible way , most importantly to provide a lightning fast search feature that gives weighted results based on the
quality and amount of documentation .
This we have already accomplished , and all remaining issues are related to browser compatibility .
Another initial goal is to present a smooth interface for creating inline notes to
the documentation so that Rails developers can post notes about certain methods etc. for themselves and others to draw knowledge from .
Our longer - term goal ( N.B. we are an agile project , so long - term means , say , three months ) is to provide a way for the active members of the Rails community to improve the existing documentation based on the posted notes
to create an extended documentation that could optimally even be made in to a patch and would find its way back into the actual Rails source .
Another clear and obvious goal is to keep improving the service steadily as we progress toward the goals that I mentioned above .
Could you spend a few words on the “ development process ” followed by your company to develop this app ?
Did I read the word “ Scrum ” somewhere ?
Am I correct ?
Yes , our development process of choice is Scrum .
The core team is only three members , one backend developer , one backed / frontend develope and one frontend developer / UI specialist .
I feel the team is optimal in many ways .
The team also has a few more experienced developers who are primarily active in other projects to ask questions from , one of whom is also the acting product owner on the Rails - doc project ( that ’s me ! ) .
Did you develop it in three months , or… ?
The first release was developed in three SPRINTS , not months – so what I ’m saying is the first release was developed in five weeks ( first sprint was mostly introductory and lasted a week , the next two sprints , first
development and then stabilization , were two weeks each ) .
However , it is a FIRST RELEASE , which means the app is by all means not complete , but since we make software in a very agile way , it ’a all about “ Ship , ship , ship ! ” .
What is Nodeta , exactly ?
My Finnish is a bit rusty nowadays …
Nodeta is a software development company that focuses on web software .
We employ a highly agile and effective process .
We have worked both on light independent projects and in the environment of large global enterprises .
There are currently 10 Nodetans .
Rails - Doc.org is a pilot project for your new shiny app , ApiDock .
Is it an open source app ?
Unfortunately , I can not go into details about APIdoc yet .
What I can tell is that it is developed with Rails and that it wo n’t be open source , but rather it would optimally be offered as a service , which after all is what
the word “ app ” on the web means these days .
Open source projects could however use it for free , sort of in the spirit of GitHub .
It will also most likely be separately targeted to larger companies .
Can you give me more technical details about the way keyword search is performed ?
Are you indexing / tagging documentation beforehand ?
There will probably be a blog post on the Nodeta blog about the search and how it works after the first release comes out .
What about the social side of it : you ’re hoping people will contribute with notes , which will then be collected and integrated in the documentation correct ?
Do you have any moderation or anti-spam precaution ?
The quality of notes is judged in a social way .
Notes can be thanked by other users and notes that get many thanks are showed in a more prominent way .
Registration will be required in order to post notes and the registration will feature a captcha .
Will contributors be credited somehow ?
Who can contribute and at what level ?
Anybody can post notes and good notes get thanks and thus so do their posters .
Users that get lots of thanks will be later asked to become core users that can alter the extended documentation ( not in the first
release . )
You want to blow out competition and that you do n’t want to fail : sounds a good plan !
How is Rails - Docs different from other similar apps ?
We think that our app is the first that is serious about making things happen .
We think about users first and above all at this stage our search feature is frankly unparallelled .
Do you have DHH ’s seal of approval ?
Will you ?
Is there any copyright issue with your domain name ?
Time will tell what DHH thinks .
We did contact him just a few days ago to ask what his thoughts about all this are and are waiting for his comments .
I doubt there is any wrinkles with copyright as Rails - doc itself is a completely non-profit project .
What about doing something similar for the whole Ruby language ?
Ruby docs may also be easier , in a way …
It is possible that we might do just that but right now it ’s all about Rails .
The Bottom Line
Rails - Doc.org is definitely an interesting project , which has all the potential to become a powerful , Rails - powered service .
Sure , it ’s not open source and this can be a bit of a letdown for some : but after all people flocked to GitHub when it opened , did n’t they ?
The search capabilities of Rails - Doc.org are definitely a very important step forward in making Rails documentation more accessible and easier to use , but the killer feature is definitely the possibility to add notes , if used wisely .
I ’ll be watching this project closely and I ’ll pay particular attention on what happens to the community ’s contributions : will it really be useful ?
Will it really help creating documentation patches to Rails core ?
Only time will tell , of course .

Thanks to the recent run-up in gas prices , many of our email accounts have become cluttered with chain emails asking us to boycott major gasoline stations on a certain date in the future .
The reason being , we ’re pissed about having to pay so much for gas and if we all band together for one day and refuse to buy gas , we ’re supposedly going to cost the major gas companies billions of dollars and force them to drop the price of gas .
For those of you who continually forward these emails to everyone on your contact list , please stop .
This is one of the most ridiculous ideas out there and it would never work .
There are plenty of extremely logical and obvious reasons why this tactic would never work , yet most of us tend to overlook these as we focus on trying to place blame for the nearly 40 % jump in the price of gas since the end of February .
As is usually the case , logic tends to take a backseat to emotion .
That being said , I ’m going to try my best to explain why this idea wo n’t ever work in the real world and why you should automatically delete any emails like this that you may receive .
The first ( and most obvious ) reason is you are simply delaying the purchase of the gasoline you need ; we ’re not actually decreasing the demand for gas ( which might bring the prices down ) , we ’re just shifting the demand to another day in the very near future .
For example , let ’s say that 100,000,000 people decide to join this boycott , which causes 1,000,000,000 fewer gallons of gasoline to be purchased on that particular day .
In theory , this would cost the major gas and oil companies about $ 3 billion in revenue .
However , you mean to tell me that during the next couple of days that those 100,000,000 people are n’t going to go back to the gas stations to purchase the gas that they did n’t buy the day they were boycotting ?
Of course they ’re going to ; they still need all that gasoline in order to get to work , drive the kids to soccer practice , etc .
There was n’t a drop in demand , just a shift in demand – which means that the gas companies do n’t actually lose the $ 3 billion in revenue , they just get it within the next couple of days .
The second reason is if for some insane reason this boycott tactic actually worked and did cause the gas companies to lose money , do you actually think that these companies would lower prices to gain back the small percentage of their total annual revenue that they lost ?
I highly doubt it .
The more likely scenario would be these companies would actually slightly RAISE prices in order to try and collect some of the money that they may have lost .
Hopefully it has become pretty obvious that the only way we ’re going to be able to save money on our car ’s gasoline is to reduce the demand for gasoline by driving less and driving more fuel efficient vehicles .
It ’s not going to come by some crazy scenario where we boycott gasoline stations for one arbitrary day .
So on that note , please take me off of your spam list .
A few weeks before the March 4 Republican primary , a group of candidates gathered at the Shady Valley Golf Club in Arlington for a meet - and - greet luncheon with voters .
For the most part , the candidates were seasoned pros who all seemed to know each other , but one stood out from the rest .
His name was Barney Maddox , and he looked lost .
He wore an ill - fitting gray suit , his Coke - bottle glasses kept slipping down his nose , and he looked as if he cut his own hair .
While the other candidates worked the room , Maddox wandered around , looking for a hand to shake .
Eventually , he ended up at a table overlooking the golf course , where he sat alone , waiting for the event to begin .
Not much was known about Maddox , because he did not grant interviews to the press .
He had , however , been identified as perhaps the most dangerous man on the ballot by the Texas Freedom Network , a watchdog group in Austin that keeps tabs on the religious right .
The reasons for this were clear .
Maddox was a young - Earth creationist , a Bible - literalist who believed the Earth was just 6,000 years old .
He had written part of the curriculum for the Institute of Creation Research , a Dallas - based school that offers courses in creation science , and he had lectured at the Creation Evidence Museum in Glen Rose , which claims to have fossil evidence that dinosaurs and man walked together .
He had once called evolution " the most irrational belief ever held by man . "
Now he wanted a seat on Texas ' State Board of Education .
His opponent , Pat Hardy , sat across the room .
Fair - skinned and tall , with short red hair , she carried herself with the cheerful demeanor of a former school teacher , which she had been for 30 years .
Social studies had been her subject , and truth be told , she missed the classroom .
For the last six years she had served on the State Board of Education and was running for re-election .
Hardy believed God had created the Earth , but she was n't sure this belonged in the classroom .
It was no secret this had made her the target of the religious right .
When their turns came to speak , Hardy went first , pointing out that she had 36 years in education and that as a member of the state board she had lead an effort to require that all high school students take four years of science before graduation .
She considered this her proudest accomplishment on the board .
When she finished , Maddox stepped to the microphone .
He said nothing of his experience in education , because he had none .
Nor did he have any experience in politics .
What he had to offer were true conservative credentials , he said , and if elected he would have something to say about the teaching of evolution , which he called " a pre-Civil War fairy tale . "
The candidates took a few questions from the audience , and when they were done , Maddox slipped out the door .
Over the next several weeks , Maddox ran a quiet campaign , avoiding events where the press might show up and ignoring their phone calls .
While Hardy was relying on the mainstream press and the education establishment to get elected , Maddox was courting a different stripe of voters .
He had the backing of the state home - school association , social conservative groups such as the Plano - based Free Market Foundation and people like former State Board of Education member Richard Neill , who , before serving as Maddox 's campaign treasurer , had once endorsed a candidate who wanted to dismantle the public education system and replace it with private Christian schools .
Two weeks ago , while the rest of the state was watching the results of the Democratic presidential primary , Hardy quietly defeated Maddox .
Had Maddox won , a movement more than 10 years in the making — a religious right takeover of the State Board of Education — would have been complete .
Already , the board is dominated by a far - right faction deeply concerned with promoting political and religious ideologies .
In recent years , the board has rejected one textbook that taught about global warming — calling it " junk science " and " anti-capitalist " — and forced the publisher of another to replace a picture of a woman carrying a briefcase with a picture of a woman baking a cake .
Board member Terri Leo has accused " liberal New York publishers " of inserting " stealth " homosexual messages into textbooks , and Republican David Bradley of Beaumont , the de facto leader of the far - right faction , once criticized an algebra book because it had pictures , recipes and references to Vietnam in it he considered inappropriate for the subject matter .
Knowing that legally he could not reject a book on these grounds , he ripped the cover off .
" Ladies and gentlemen , " he said , tossing pieces of the cover to both sides of his chair , " worthless binding .
I reject this book . "
All of which is a prelude to the looming battle over the science curriculum , which is up for review in November .
Seven of the 15 board members support the teaching of creationism or intelligent design .
With Maddox , they would have had a clear majority .
But even without Maddox the fight for control of the state board is far from over .
And the battle over the teaching of evolution is just getting started .
It is no surprise that this fight — which during the last 150 years has been waged in courtrooms across the country — would now come to Texas .
From the beginning , Texas has played an important role in the creationist movement .
The infamous creationist textbook , Of Pandas and People , was published by the Richardson - based Foundation for Thought and Ethics ( which seeks to advance a biblical worldview in the classroom ) , and the first meetings of the intelligent design movement were held here .
In fact , the strategy of the intelligent design movement , sometimes called " the wedge , " was first outlined at a conference at Southern Methodist University in 1992 .
In recent years the state has become a gathering place for the leading proponents of young - Earth creationism , which holds to a fundamentalist view of how the world was created .
Last year , the Institute for Creation Research , which teaches that evolution is no more scientific than Biblical creationism , relocated from San Diego to Dallas because California would no longer offer accreditation for its degrees .
Texas has proved a much more welcoming environment .
In July , Governor Rick Perry appointed a devout young - Earth creationist named Don McLeroy to head the State Board of Education , and in November , the state 's director of science education for public schools was forced to resign because she would not take a neutral position on the teaching of evolution .
Board members such as McLeroy share Maddox 's fundamentalist view of the Earth 's origins .
McLeroy says he does not want to do away with the teaching of evolution ( although he considers the theory " far - fetched " ) but he does think schools should " teach the controversy " surrounding the theory , although mainstream science holds that there is n't any more controversy about the theory of evolution than there is about the theory of gravity , and that remaining questions about evolution are simply opportunities for additional research .
The decision the state board makes on the science curriculum this November will determine what every public school student in Texas learns about science for the next 10 years .
And that 's not all .
Because Texas buys more textbooks than every other state except California and publishers would rather not create separate editions for smaller states , the books ordered here will end up in classrooms across the country .
" If Texas falls , this is the beginning of a giant move backward in science education , " says Chris Comer , the former science director who resigned in November .
" What really disturbs me most of all is how the average citizen does n't really care .
The entire education system is about to be subverted , because this is n't just about science .
This is about a group of people who are trying to dictate what should be taught in every subject , not according to research or facts , but according to their own whims and personal beliefs . "
For both sides in this issue , the battle is n't just about education .
For people like Kathy Miller , president of the Texas Freedom Network , it 's about what kind of image Texas projects to the rest of the world and what kind of leaders we are producing for tomorrow .
" We can get them ready for the century they 're living in , for the jobs that are being created right here in Texas , or we can give them a 19th - century education that puts them at a disadvantage to kids in every other state in this country and around the world . "
The religious right frames the issue in a similar way .
For them , teaching evolution is just a small part of a larger problem in society .
The way they see it , America has become increasingly godless and materialistic .
To hear them tell it , they are simply trying to return America to what it once was .

To understand the creationist movement , and the main arguments its adherents have against evolution , there is perhaps no better place to start than the Creation Evidence Museum in Glen Rose .
The museum sits on the banks of the Paluxy , a slow - moving river in Somervell County that winds through rolling hills , thickets of mesquite and juniper and low - rising limestone walls before pouring into the Brazos River .
The museum , which occupies a peach - colored trailer , is run by Carl Baugh , who claims to have found fossil evidence in the river that man and dinosaurs walked together .
A few weeks ago , I drove out to Glen Rose to pay Baugh a visit .
When I arrived , a Baptist church group was sitting in the museum 's main room watching a video in which Baugh explained the creationist theory .
In the video , Baugh wore a red Mr. Rogers - style cardigan and carried himself with the earnest swagger of a televangelist .
He had soft , almond - colored eyes , a gray pompadour haircut and a voice that was at once soothing and commanding .
In another life , he could have anchored an evening news program or served as a stand - in for Dick Clark on American Bandstand .
I paid my $ 2 and looked around the museum , which was crowded with slabs of fossilized dinosaur footprints , tropical - looking plants and a fish tank holding a balloon - sized piranha .
My gaze stopped at a black - and - white picture behind the cash register of what appeared to be a giant man at some kind of carnival or fair .
It looked like something out of Ripley 's Believe It or Not .
" Who 's that ? "
I asked the guy behind the counter , a doughy 30 - something with rosy cheeks .
" That 's Max Palmer .
He was 8 - foot - 2 , " he said wistfully .
" He was a resident of Glen Rose and personal friends with Dr. Baugh . "
" What does he have to do with all this ? "
I asked , pointing at a fossil gathering dust on a shelf .
" It confirms the Genesis account that men grew to be giants .
Genesis 6:4 . "
Baugh materialized from the back room , shook my hand and glanced at his gold watch .
He had just finished giving a lecture , he said , and was about to start another , but he could give me a few minutes .
Baugh arrived at Glen Rose in 1982 , and by that time the Paluxy was already hallowed ground for creationists .
Dinosaur fossils were first discovered in the river in 1909 , and the next year there were reports that " giant man tracks " had also been found in a limestone shelf of the river .
In 1961 , this alleged discovery was featured prominently in a book called The Genesis Flood , which would become the seminal text of the creationist movement .
The book , which was written by Old Testament scholar John Whitcomb and college professor Henry Morris , held that the traditional scientific understanding of the geologic column was incorrect .
The geologic column , which contains different layers of sedimentary rock , had not been created over millions of years , as science held , but had instead been formed in one year , as a result of the global flood and its aftermath .
Noah 's flood explained everything from submarine canyons to frozen woolly mammoths found in the arctic .
The implications of this theory — which would later form the basis of Morris ' " creation science " — were enormous .
If true , then everything scientists believed about evolution and the history of the world — in other words , everything based on scientific evidence and observation — was wrong .
Ever since publication of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species , Bible literalists had been buffeted with one scientific discovery after another that seemed to fly in the face of their faith .
Now with The Genesis Flood , there was a book that attempted to reconcile science with the Bible instead of other way around .
Since The Genesis Flood 's publication , a parallel universe has been created for those who believe in creationism .
Today , there are schools that teach creation science , museums where that science comes to life in skeletal displays and Hollywood - style films , and organizations that push these views into the public realm of mainstream thought .
Over time , the claims the book made about the discovery of " man tracks " at Paluxy would be challenged , and eventually , Morris himself would distance himself from what he had once said was found at the river .
Baugh was in his late 40s when he came to Glen Rose , eager to find the smoking gun of creation science .
As he began digging in the limestone bed of the river , he says , he uncovered several large three - toed footprints probably from sauropods , or as they are more commonly known , brontosaurs .
But as he kept digging , he found what he was looking for — a winding path of footprints that looked like the tracks of a breed of giant men .
These tracks were in the same sedimentary layer as the dinosaur tracks , meaning they had been created at the same time .
" I was blown away , " Baugh says .
" To secular scientists , this would be like finding a Cadillac with a polished bumper in the very same layer with the dinosaurs . "
While Baugh 's work was celebrated by young - Earth creationists , the science community has not been as welcoming .
Evolutionists and students from local universities show up at his museum so they can ask him about his degrees ( which reportedly came from diploma mills ) and laugh at his claims .
I asked Baugh why science was so threatened by his work .
" They are threatened , are n't they ? " he asked with a smile , surprised , it seemed , that a reporter would ask such a friendly question .
" I ask the question , ' What are you afraid of , are n't we looking for truth , good science ? '
" They 're threatened because , in my opinion , if you lay the two scientific theories , creation and evolution , side by side , innately the student chooses creation .
It 's obvious that he 's too complicated , that living systems are too complicated to have arisen by chance . "
This has been the main tenet of creationism from the beginning , and it has held great sway with the public .
In fact , in the 1970s and ' 80s , several states , including Louisiana and Arkansas , passed laws that either banned the teaching of evolution or required that where evolution was taught , creationism must be taught with it .
That ended in 1987 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Edwards v. Aguillard that teaching creationism in public schools violated the constitutional separation of church and state because it relied on biblical texts and " lacked a clear secular purpose . "
In the aftermath of that decision , the Institute for Creation Research , which was founded by Morris in 1970 , proposed a new strategy for creationists .
The ICR suggested that " school boards and teachers should be strongly encouraged at least to stress the scientific arguments against evolution in their classes ... even if they do n't wish to recognize these as evidences and arguments for creationism . "
Edwards v. Aguillard also gave birth to a new arm of the creationist movement .
Not long after the decision , the Texas - based publishers of the creationist textbook Of Pandas and People , which had been at the heart of the case , changed references to " creation " to " intelligent design . "
The book also offered the first definition to appear in print of intelligent design , which asserts that life is too complex to have arisen by chance and therefore must have a creator .
Today , young - Earth creationism and intelligent design represent two distinct belief systems within the creationist movement .
Intelligent design , which does not define who the creator is and does not rely on the Bible as its foundation , has attracted more than 100 scientists — molecular biologists , biochemists and physicists among them — from places such as Yale , Princeton and the University of Chicago .
Young - Earth creationists are much larger in number , primarily because of the explosion of Christian fundamentalism across the country in the last 50 years .
While members of both camps claim their movement is different from the other , even conservatives like Rush Limbaugh have said there is no difference .
" While young - Earth creationists and proponents of intelligent design do not always agree , their goals are the same : to undermine the teaching of evolution and introduce some form of creationist teaching into the classroom , " says Barbara Forrest , an expert on the movement .
Back at the museum , I asked Baugh if he thought creationism should be taught in public schools .
" Of course , " he said .
" It has more evidence than evolution does . "
He called over a high school math teacher named John Heffner , who had been listening in .
Heffner was getting ready to give a lecture on how math proved that evolution was impossible .
He wore jeans and cowboy boots and the look of a man weary with where the world had gone .
" Let 's face it , evolution is the only theory of science that needs laws on the books to protect it , " he said .
" I think it 's time to uncensor science .
The evidence for creation is so strong that it 's really illogical to believe anything else . "
( Science begs to disagree .
For responses to his arguments , see " Arguments Creationists Make Against Evolution " . )
He quickly ran through his criticisms of evolutionary theory , which could have been cribbed from the notes of a Creationism 101 class .
He began with peppered moths .
In England , during the Industrial Revolution , factories spewed so much black smoke into the air that soot covered everything , including the trees in the forest .
As a result , moths began to grow darker .
Those that did not — the white - colored peppered moth — were gobbled up by hungry birds , while the darker - colored moths blended in with the trees .
It was natural selection at work , and seemingly irrefutable proof that evolution was real .
" Well , it was all fake , " Heffner said .
" They faked the results . "
He continued with Haekel 's Embryo , which supposedly showed that the human embryo goes through evolutionary stages — first it has gills like a fish , then a tail like a monkey — before it is fully developed .
Well , that was a fake too .
Haekel had changed drawings of dog embryos to make them look similar to human embryos .
And that was n't all .
Lucy , the ape - like fossilized skeleton found in Africa in 1974 — the supposed " missing link " — was more plaster of Paris than actual skeleton .
" And on and on it goes , " he said .
" I think it 's time for scientists to stop trotting out these tired old icons , recycling them every year in the textbooks , and move into the 21st century .
Modern science , with its understanding of DNA and the human genome , has shown that the sort of complex information sequencing that exists on the cellular level could not have arisen by chance . "
These arguments , roundly refuted by science , are used by creationists of all stripes , whether they are men like Baugh , who are more steeped in Bible literacy than formal scientific training , or college professors at the Seattle - based Discovery Institute , which has become the leading think tank for the intelligent design movement .
" The common misconception is that we want to bring the Bible into the classroom and just preach out of Genesis instead of teaching science , and nothing could be further from the truth , " Heffner said .
" We actually want more evolution taught .
We want the whole story taught .
What we 're getting right now is an edited version .
The problems with evolution are numerous ; they are well - known .
We pride ourselves for teaching kids to think for themselves , and yet we do n't give them the full information . "
Heffner told me he was keenly interested in the upcoming State Board of Education review of the science curriculum .
In fact , he had appeared before the board in 2003 , when a biology textbook was up for review .
" I 'll ask you what I asked them , ' Whose kids are these anyway ?
They 're not the evolutionists ' kids alone .
They 're our kids too . '
And my second question to them was , ' What 's wrong with the truth ?
What 's wrong with telling kids the truth ? ' "
The way Heffner saw it , Texas was just the latest battleground in a war that had been raging ever since publication of Origin of Species .
Secular science , and Darwinism in particular , had done more to erode the moral fabric of our country than anything else , he said .
For him the choice was simple .
On one hand there was Jesus and the belief in a life after death , and on the other was Darwin and pond scum .
" We look at what kids are doing now — with drugs and sex and all the violence and gangs — and we wonder why .
Well , it 's obvious .
We expect kids to make the right decision and then you tell them that they 're nothing but evolved pond scum , nothing but an animal ?
And you wonder why their world view is basically one of ' me and now . ' "
Before I left , I went back to the original museum to get a look at the fossils Baugh claimed to have dug from the river .
Baugh 's assistant showed me a duckbill dinosaur skull , some dinosaur eggs out of China and the fossilized print of a three - toed dinosaur .
During the same dig , he said , they had also found the footprint of a prehistoric woman , size 7 .
He said he knew this sounded crazy to a lot of people , and that he regularly fielded hostile questions from science teachers and the like .
But he had numbers on his side .
" More than 50 percent of Americans reject evolution and believe in some form of creationism , " he told me .
He also had power on his side .
President George W. Bush had advocated teaching the " weaknesses " of evolutionary theory .
Governor Perry had appointed a young - Earth creationist to head the board .
And state Representative Warren Chisum , the powerful chair of the House Appropriations Committee , had gone so far as to distribute a memo to his fellow legislators attacking evolution as an anti-religious plot cooked up by an ancient Jewish sect .
Perhaps the State Board of Education , being an elected body , was simply reflecting the will of the people .
As I was leaving , I thought of something Heffner had said : " If more than half the population does n't believe in evolution , do n't we also deserve equal representation in public schools ?
It 's our tax dollars too , after all . "

Last October , Chris Comer , then the director of science education for Texas public schools , got an e-mail inviting her to a lecture by a professor named Barbara Forrest .
The name rang a bell .
Forrest had testified in the much - publicized 2006 Pennsylvania case , Kitzmiller v. Dover , in which intelligent design had essentially been put on trial .
After two weeks of testimony , which had included detailed discussion of topics such as bacteria flagellum and Galapagos finches , the judge ruled that intelligent design was not a scientific theory , as its proponents claimed , but " an interesting theological argument " that could not " uncouple itself from its creationist , and thus religious , antecedents . "
Like the rest of the science world , Comer had closely followed the trial and had been interested in Forrest 's testimony .
As Forrest saw it , intelligent design was part of a covert strategy to get creationism into public schools .
This view was based on a document she claimed to have uncovered called " the wedge , " in which the leaders of the intelligent design movement outlined a 20 - year plan to reverse " the stifling materialistic worldview " of which evolution was a part and replace it with " a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions . "
Like a metal wedge splitting a log , they would introduce intelligent design into the classroom , which would open the way for creationism .
Forrest had written an exposé on the movement , Creationism 's Trojan Horse : The Wedge of Intelligent Design , and was coming to Austin to discuss the book .
Intrigued , Comer sent an e-mail to an online community of science teachers , notifying them of the lecture .
Considering all the controversy over the teaching of evolution in Texas public schools , she figured the event could be enlightening .
According to Comer , an hour later she got an e-mail from a supervisor .
She was told she should n't have sent the e-mail on a school computer .
Comer apologized and then sent out another e-mail clarifying that her invitation had not been meant to suggest that she endorsed Forrest 's views .
About a week later , Comer was told she could resign or be fired .
Comer chose to resign .
Today , Comer says she 's still not sure why she was fired , but she is almost certain it had something to do with the e-mail .
For her , the episode is indicative of the power and influence of the religious right and how that has come to bear on the State Board of Education .
For most of its existence , the state board was not divided by political and religious ideologies .
It occupied a sleepy corner of government , making headlines only when critics showed up to protest a sex ed book or the teaching of evolution .
That began changing in the late 1980s , when the religious right began to realize the board 's power .
In addition to overseeing the $ 25 billion Permanent School Fund ( a perpetual endowment established in 1854 to help finance public education ) , the state board also reviews curriculum and approves textbooks .
In short , it determines what every public school student learns in every subject .
For those interested in molding the minds of America 's future leaders , there is no better place to start .
It was n't until the election of San Antonio Republican Bob Offutt in 1992 that the Christian right 's influence began to be felt on the board .
Two years later , Offutt recruited five other far - right social conservatives to run .
Their campaigns were ugly affairs and foreshadowed what lay ahead .
In campaign fliers , Democratic incumbents were accused of promoting a " radical leftist agenda " that included homosexuality , lesbian adoption and condom usage .
One flier included a picture of two shirtless men — one black and one white — kissing each other .
The smear tactics worked , and three of the five candidates won election .
For the first time in history , Republicans had a majority on the state board .
They would not have been able to do so if not for the support of James Leininger , a millionaire San Antonio hospital bed manufacturer known in leftist circles as " God 's Sugardaddy . "
For the next 12 years , Leininger would continue to back state board candidates , often using his money to unseat a Republican who was n't conservative enough .
In 1998 , he donated to the campaign of current chair Don McLeroy , and in 2004 , he helped bankroll the candidacies of current board members Terri Leo , who directed attacks against a biology textbook in 2003 ; Barbara Cargill , the founder of a Bible - based science camp that teaches classes on intelligent design ; and Gail Lowe , who also has advocated teaching the purported weaknesses of the theory of evolution .
Two years ago , he helped Cynthia Dunbar and Ken Mercer defeat their primary opponents by outspending them 3 - to - 1 and 5 - to - 1 respectively .
During her campaign , Dunbar said she would like to see intelligent design taught in public schools , a concept she considers " at least as viable , if not more so , than evolution . "
With Dunbar and Mercer 's victories , the religious right had attained seven seats on the board .
Those seven members have voted in lockstep on almost every issue in the time since .
Ironically , despite their positions as guardians of the state public school system , several of these board members have eschewed public education for their own children , opting instead for home school and private schools .
" I wish more voters and members of the media would ask about that , " says Kathy Miller of the Texas Freedom Network .
" What is it exactly that you want to see done with public schools ?
And why , as someone who did n't even care enough about the public schools to join the PTA when your kids were young , do you now want to dictate what other people 's kids learn and how they are taught ? "
From the time social conservatives began taking control of the board in the mid-'90s , they pushed hard to remove material they deemed inappropriate from textbooks .
In 1994 , for example , social conservatives on and off the board demanded that publishers make hundreds of changes to proposed high school textbooks .
Despite the fact that Texas had some of the highest teen birth and sexually transmitted disease rates in the nation at the time , they insisted that schools teach an " abstinence - only - until - marriage " form of sex education .
They also made other demands , including that publishers remove illustrations of breast self - exams for cancer .
In response , in 1995 the state Legislature imposed strict limits on the board 's ability to censor textbooks .
The board could only reject a textbook if it contained factual errors , failed to meet manufacturing standards or did not meet established curriculum standards .
These guidelines had little effect on the board .
Factual errors , board members decided , could include ideological objections to material either in textbooks or missing from them .
In 2003 , for example , the board demanded that a reference to the Ice Age occurring " millions of years ago " be changed to " in the distant past . "
A passage saying that fossils " explained " evolution was changed to " may explain " evolution .
These changes conformed to the young - Earth creationist views that many of the state board members held .
By the next year , publishers were anticipating the arguments state board members would have to potentially objectionable material and responding in advance .
Publishers brought proposed health textbooks to the board in 2004 , for example , that did not have any information in them on using condoms to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases .
The censorship has continued to the present day .
Last month , board chairman McLeroy asked the board to reject a proposed revision of the language arts curriculum that a committee of educators had been working on for two years to complete .
In its place , he recommended a substitute document that had been rejected 10 years before .
It was the work of a former Waco - area high school English teacher named Donna Garner .
According to several state board members , McLeroy supported the alternative document because it includes a reading list of approved books ( classics mostly ) that teachers can not waver from .
" It 's all about control , " says Mary Helen Berlanga , a Democrat from Corpus Christi who has been on the board since 1982 .
" They want to dictate to teachers exactly what they can have students read .
It 's no longer the choice of the teacher , or even the school district . "
It is no surprise that Democrats such as Berlanga would butt heads with Republicans on the board , but in recent years even old - line social conservatives such as Geraldine " Tincy " Miller have found themselves alienated from the far - right faction .
Miller , from Dallas , has served on the state board since 1984 .
For her , the sign that things had gone too far came last November when the board voted to reject a math textbook .
The book in question , a third - grade text that teaches a series called Everyday Math , had been a success in Miller 's Dallas district .
Between 2003 and 2007 , classes that used it in the Dallas Independent School District had seen math scores improve 11 percent .
Fourth - grade classes that had used the same series had seen scores rise nearly 32 percent , and fifth - grades using the series had seen a 42 percent improvement .
Miller argued passionately for the books .
The state math review panel recommended them , as did the state 's commissioner of education , and several top - notch private schools in the Dallas were using the book .
But for reasons Miller did n't understand , the seven far - right members of the board were arguing against it .
" They said the multiplication tables did n't go high enough .
They said it introduced calculators too early and that was a crutch , " Miller recalls .
" So I turned to the publisher and said , ' Here are the concerns they have , are you willing to work with the board and make these changes ? '
And they said , ' Absolutely . '
They stayed up all night working on it , and in the morning they made this beautiful presentation on how they would make the changes . "
Miller says the publishers then asked the board if they had any other requests .
None was given .
The vote was called .
And the book was rejected 7 - 6 .
" You know what that was ?
That was a display of power .
That 's when I realized the direction the board had gone and became very worried , " Miller says .
Like others , Miller now thinks the main reason the book was rejected was to set a precedent .
" If they can reject a math book and not give a reason , then they can do the same thing to a science book , " Berlanga says .
" It was very clever how they got rid of that book in November , and they will use the same tactics to get rid of books that do n't say what they want about intelligent design . "
Comer , the former science director , agrees .
" I think this whole thing has been a rehearsed effort to get ready for when the science standards come up , " Comer says .
" The book Barbara Forrest wrote on the intelligent design movement is almost a template for what they 're doing right now .
It is their manifesto ; it is what they 're doing in the state of Texas . "

As it stands , Texas state law requires that science teachers go over the strengths and weaknesses of the evolutionary theory .
But a committee of educators now working on revamping the curriculum standards will recommend to the board that that provision be taken out .
" What they say sounds very reasonable — teach the controversy — but there is no controversy about evolution within the science community , " says Kevin Fisher , a secondary science coordinator for the Lewisville Independent School District who is on the committee .
" We always get a chuckle when someone says it 's just a theory .
Gravity is a theory ; atomic structure is a theory .
Theories are open to change , but they 're open to change only if there is evidence to support another theory , and as it stands there is no evidence to support intelligent design . "
Board member Mavis Knight of Dallas says McLeroy has told her the teaching of evolution will not come up during the review of the science curriculum , but this seems highly unlikely based on what McLeroy told me , and what he has said in the past on the subject .
At a 2005 lecture at Grace Bible Church in Bryan , for example , he encouraged the audience to work toward undermining the teaching of evolution in public schools .
" Keep chipping away at the objective empirical evidence , " he said .
" Keep pointing out that their deductive reasoning depends on the premise ' nature is all there is ' to be true .
Remind them that they may be wrong . "
When I called McLeroy in February , he told me that while he will not push for the teaching of creationism in public schools , he will resist any efforts to take out the provision that requires teachers go over the weaknesses of the evolutionary theory .
" Evolution should be taught because that 's the dominant view of science , you have to teach it .
But I want to teach more of it , " he said .
" Hey , they 've been teaching it for 50 to 60 years and still most of the people do n't accept it , because it 's so far - fetched .
It 's far - fetched !
" I 'm looking at a beautiful tree out here , and according to what 's in those textbooks we share a common ancestor with that tree .
We 're not descended from the tree , but we share a common ancestor .
I mean , that 's a pretty bold claim , and it 's not supported by any evidence . "
The vote this November is expected to go along party lines , and if history is any indication , the state board chamber will be packed with young - Earth creationists such as John Heffner and Barney Maddox , science educators such as Fisher , and others who fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum .
" What I 'm hoping is that teachers come out in full force , " Berlanga says .
" Scientists are going to have to come out in full force , and I hope preachers will come out , as they have in the past , saying , ' Leave the creationism to me and my church , please do n't leave it to the teachers .
You teach the science , and I 'll teach the faith . ' "
For Comer , the stakes could n't be much higher .
Already , she says , science teachers are afraid to teach evolution , which she calls the cornerstone of biology .
" They look at my situation and they go , ' Boy , if she was fired , what hope is there for me ? '
And so they handle this with kid gloves .
It 's not just happening in Texas ; it 's happening across the country .
" Biology is such an important subject because it deals with understanding the human body and medicine and life .
But it 's not just about biology .
I really think this whole thing about not understanding climate change and global warming and the attack on science in general that we 've seen from this administration is another clear example of how radical groups that have little or no understanding of the nature of science are dictating to scientists what they can and cannot research , what they can and cannot say about subjects that are vital to our health and future . "
In the end , the vote may come down to three board members — Tincy Miller , Hardy and Rick Agosto of San Antonio — who are seen as swing votes .
Both Miller and Hardy , self - described conservative Republicans , told me they personally believe God created the Earth , but neither thinks this belongs in a science classroom .
While Hardy won her election comfortably , the amount of money Barney Maddox spent to unseat her was enough to put fear into the state 's science community .
Miller , once considered the most conservative member on the board , thinks she might be next .
" Oh , I would n't be surprised at all if they target my seat in four years , " she says .
In the meantime , the creationist movement shows no signs of slowing down .
A multimillion dollar creation evidence museum is going up on the campus of the Oak Cliff - based Christ for the Nations mission church .
The Dallas - based Institute of Creation Research is waiting on approval from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to offer masters degrees in creation science .
" These people wo n't give up , " says Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network .
" They just keep evolving . "
Stress resistance at the cellular level is correlated with longevity at the organismal level , to such an extent that one can screen for longevity mutants by first identifying stress - resistant animals .
Conversely , the cells of prematurely aging mutants tend to be hypersensitive to stress .
The idea here is that longevity is controlled in part by basal and inducible molecular defenses like antioxidants and chaperones , and that high levels of such factors confer both stress resistance and enhanced longevity .
What ’s interesting about this pattern is that it seems to apply to a wide range of multiple stresses , with very different physical bases : oxidation , irradiation , starvation , heavy metal toxicity , and temperature , to name a few .
Without a great deal of experimental proof to support it , one can imagine some central homeostatic integrator of cellular well - being , upon which all manner of perturbations might impinge and which might in turn control both the appropriate defensive responses and factors that determine longevity .
It would therefore come as a surprise if a long - lived organism turned out to be unusually sensitive to stress — and in particular , sensitive to particular stresses .
In one fell swoop , this would falsify both the general , well - accepted correlative pattern ( stress resistance = longevity ) and the somewhat more fanciful model of a central homeostatic integrator .
Lo , the naked mole rat , Heterocephalus glaber .
A eusocial rodent roughly intermediate in size between a mouse and a rat ( depending on where you shop ) , and slightly less aesthetically pleasing than an overcooked boudin blanc with teeth , the naked mole rat has recently drawn the attention of model - hungry biogerontologists worldwide : Perhaps because of the quirky selection pressures on eusocial animals , H. glaber is unusually long - lived compared to animals of similar size and body plan ( like mice and rats ) .
Like , ten times longer - lived .
So , compared to mice and rats , mole rats should be much more resistant to all stresses , right ?
Well , yes and no .
From Salmon et al. :
Fibroblasts From Naked Mole - Rats Are Resistant to Multiple Forms of Cell Injury , But Sensitive to Peroxide , Ultraviolet Light , and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Fibroblasts from long - lived mutant mice are resistant to many forms of lethal injury as well as to the metabolic effects of rotenone and low - glucose medium .
Here we evaluated fibroblasts from young adult naked mole - rats ( NMR ; Heterocephalus glaber ) , a rodent species in which maximal longevity exceeds 28 years .
Compared to mouse cells , NMR cells were resistant to cadmium , methyl methanesulfonate , paraquat , heat , and low - glucose medium , consistent with the idea that cellular resistance to stress may contribute to disease resistance and longevity .
Surprisingly , NMR cells were more sensitive than mouse cells to H2O2 , ultraviolet ( UV ) light , and rotenone .
NMR cells , like cells from Snell dwarf mice , were more sensitive to tunicamycin and thapsigargin , which interfere with the function of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER stress ) .
The sensitivity of both Snell dwarf and NMR cells to ER stress suggests that alterations in the unfolded protein response might modulate cell survival and aging rate .
Short version : naked mole rats are more resistant than mice and rats some stressors , but not all of them .
Heat and starvation , two of the classic and longest - known types of stress known to correlate with longevity , work in the expected direction , with the mole rat more resistant .
Beyond that , curiously , it ’s hard to find patterns .
Mole rats are resistant to some oxidative stressors ( paraquat ) but not others ( peroxide ) — and to some DNA - damaging agents ( MMS ) but not others ( UV ) .
So it ’s hard to imagine that broad - spectrum defensive measures can explain the longevity of the naked mole rat , and the opposite responses to similar stresses more or less rules out the central integrator idea I floated above .
The authors take special note of the fact that cells from both Snell mice ( a dwarf variety that is also long - lived ) and mole rats are unusually sensitive to factors that block protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) .
Here we have two different longevity models , both showing increased sensitivity to the same stress .
Admittedly , it ’s a sample size of 2 , but it ’s still tempting to speculate : Could some output of the unfolded protein response be involved in governing organismal longevity ?
At home , Jon Stewart was poking fun at the grandiosity of the “ Obama Quest ” and “ the Obamanauts . ”
He showed film clips of “ our hero ” in chain mail fighting off dragons and a Cyclops in his crusade to come home and rule over Dreamerica .
By happenstance , on O - Force One I raised the matter of quests and Cyclops with the candidate .
Having read that he had left the trail in early June to go back to Chicago and see his daughter Malia perform in “ The Odyssey ” for theater class , I wondered if that rang any bells on this trip ?
The hero on a foreign journey , battling through obstacles to get back home , where more trouble would wait ?
“ The whole sort of siren thing , the Cyclops , that ’s interesting , ” he said .
Unlike an idol , Bobby Kennedy , Obama does not see himself in terms of Greek myth , although he did tell The Times ’s Jeff Zeleny on the trip that he knew the risks of “ flying too close to the sun . ”
The Obamanauts were so pleased with navigating their complex thicket of global photo - ops  without even one embarrassing picture of Obama hugging an Arab  that they were n’t as wary with the press .
The senator left his briefing books behind for a rare instance of mingling with his journalism posse at a Berlin restaurant as he sipped a rare “ very dry ” martini with olives .
( This was either because he wanted to charm the press , which , contrary to popular imagination , is not universally enchanted with him , or because he could not get ESPN in his hotel room . )
The White House said the mistreatment of detainees had never been a policy A US Senate committee has criticised military officials for the manner in which they developed interrogation techniques used at Guantanamo Bay .
Pentagon lawyers testified to the Armed Services Committee that methods such as water - boarding were based on training given to soldiers on resisting torture .
Chairman Sen Carl Levin said they had then " twisted the law to create the appearance of legality " .
The White House responded by saying the US had treated all detainees humanely .
" Abuse of detainees has never been , is not and will never be the policy of this government , " spokesman Tony Fratto said .
" The policy of this government has been to take these detainees and to interrogate them , and get the information that we can get to help protect this country , " he added .
' Subject to perception '
The lawyers ' comments on the development of the controversial interrogation techniques employed by the US military and security services were released as part of the initial findings of a report by the Armed Services Committee .
If the detainee dies , you 're doing it wrong
John Fredman
Former senior CIA lawyer
The Pentagon 's general counsel , William Haynes , sought information as early as July 2002 - nine months after the 11 September 2001 attacks - about training given to US military personnel on how to resist enemy interrogation .
The Survival , Evasion , Resistance and Escape ( Sere ) programme is based on the experiences of US prisoners of war in previous conflicts .
Sere trainers provided Mr Haynes with a list of techniques , including sensory deprivation , sleep disruption , water - boarding and stress positions .
Several were approved by the then Defence Secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , in December 2002 despite objections by military lawyers .
CIA 'ENHANCED INTERROGATION ' TECHNIQUES
Water boarding : prisoner bound to a board with feet raised , and cellophane wrapped round his head .
Water is poured onto his face to produce fear of drowning Cold cell : prisoner made to stand naked in cold , though not freezing , cell and doused with water Standing : Prisoners stand for 40 hours or more , shackled to floor Belly slap :
Hard slap to stomach with open hand .

News by un-named CIA agents in 2005
Q&A : Water - boarding Water - boarding scrutinised Mr Haynes said he had been unaware of the legal objection from the military and that he had been doing the best he could to prevent further attacks .
The committee also released details from previously classified minutes of a meeting in October 2002 in which a top military lawyer at Guantanamo said previously banned techniques such as sleep deprivation were being used secretly .
" Officially it is not happening , " Lt Col Diane Beaver told the meeting , adding that commanders feared the Red Cross might find out .
John Fredman , then chief counsel to the CIA 's counter - terrorism centre , argued during the meeting that torture " is basically subject to perception " .
" If the detainee dies , you 're doing it wrong , " he said .
' Irresponsible and short - sighted ' Discussing the testimony , Armed Services Committee chairman Sen Carl Levin , a Democrat from Michigan , said such comments contradicted the White House 's argument that the cause of the abuse scandals at US detention centres such as Abu Ghraib had been merely the result of a " few bad apples " acting on their own .
The guidance that was provided during this period of time , I think will go down in history as some of the most irresponsible and short - sighted legal analysis ever provided to our nation 's military and intelligence communities
Sen Lindsey Graham
" The truth is that senior officials in the United States government sought information on aggressive techniques , twisted the law to create the appearance of their legality and authorised their use against detainees , " he said .
Mr Rumsfeld 's endorsement of harsh interrogation techniques , Sen Levin said , had " unleashed a virus which ultimately infected interrogation operations conducted by the US military in Afghanistan and Iraq " .
" If we use those same techniques offensively against detainees , it says to the world that they have America 's stamp of approval . "
Republican Sen Lindsey Graham said the lawyers ' guidance would " go down in history as some of the most irresponsible and short - sighted legal analysis ever provided to our nation 's military and intelligence communities " .

' Democracy ' group chaired by McCain caters to lobbyists , executives David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday July 29 , 2008
Print This Email This Among the more obscure items on Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's resume is his chairmanship since 1993 of a " democracy - building " group called the International Republican Institute ( IRI ) .
That relationship has now taken on fresh significance , with both the New York Times and CNN raising questions about whether donations to the group by lobbyists and business executives have given then unacknowledged influence over McCain 's policies .
" To hear John McCain tell it , he 's your guy in Washington , fighting against the unchecked influences of big businesses and their lobbyists , " began CNN 's Joe Johns .
" But how does that McCain rhetoric square with this -- a fancy 2006 soiree of the little - known but well - respected International Republican Institute in Washington . "
" The video from the group 's own website , " Johns continued , " shows the chairman of AT&T , which has just donated $ 200,000 to the Institute , introducing none other than John McCain , who is still chairman of the Institute 's board .
McCain was fresh off a term as chairman of the Senate committee that regulates telephone companies -- like AT&T .
AT&T says there were no strings attached to the donation , but that 's not always the point . "
" Access is the name of the game , " political analyst Larry Sabato told CNN .
" It 's getting in the door . "
The Times story reported at greater length on that same fundraising event , noting that " AT&T at the time was seeking political support for an $ 80 billion merger with BellSouth .
...
When Mr. McCain finally took the podium , he expressed ' profound thanks ' to AT&T before presenting the institutes Freedom Award to the president of Liberia , a lobbying client of Charlie Black , an institute donor and McCain campaign adviser . "
" Certainly the institutes mission is in keeping with Mr. McCains full - throated support for exporting American democratic values , " the Times story continues .
" Yet the institute is also something of a revolving door for lobbyists and out - of - power Republicans that offers big donors a way of helping both the party and the institutes chairman , who is the only sitting member of Congress  and now candidate for president  ever to head one of the democracy groups . "
" So which is it ? " Johns asked .
" Is he the scourge of the system in Washington that rewards lobbyists and their wealthy bosses ?
Or is he the guy who hobnobs with -- and therefore might somehow be influenced by -- the very interests he says he 's trying to root out ?
Answer : Both .
Smart politicians know that tough talk on lobbyists sounds good to the public , but the reality is players at this level can't live without them . "
Todd Harris , a Republican strategist who has worked for both McCain and IRI , denied there has been any overt quid pro quo , telling CNN , " There has never been a single time when someone gave money and said , ' This is what I want in exchange . ' "
However , although CNN called IRI is " a cause McCain believes in , " they never mentioned that the group is " well - respected " in all circles nor unambiguously committed to democratic values .
As RAW STORY reported two years ago , " the organization , nominally dedicated to nurturing free institutions in emerging democracies , has also been associated with unscrupulous and undemocratic campaign practices both at home and overseas . "
IRI has frequently been accused of inappropriate partisanship in the countries where it is nominally building democratic institutions , concentrating its support on extreme right - wing and pro-Bush parties rather than on improving the electoral process overall .
It had close connections with the groups that attempted to oust Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in a 2002 coup and helped destabilize Haiti prior to the violent ouster of President Jean - Bertrand Aristide in 2004 .
Its work on elections in Iraq and Afghanistan has been carried out through Republican PR and polling firms that have been associated with campaign dirty tricks in the US .
The IRI also appears to have ties to questionable foreign policies .
McCain 's chief foreign policy advisor , Randy Scheunemann , who serves on the board of IRI , was closely linked with Ahmed Chalabi prior to the invasion of Iraq .
The Times , which did touch lightly on the charges by IRI 's critics , further noted that one of McCain 's first acts as chairman in the 1990's was to replace IRI 's former president with Bruce McColm .
Although the Times calls McColm a " human rights expert , " since leaving IRI he has done PR work for the dictatorial leader of Equatorial Guinea and has been an active member of the Iran Policy Committee , which advocates regime change through destabilization and supports the terrorist MEK .

( CNN ) -- Earlier this month , legendary entrepreneur and philanthropist T. Boone Pickens unveiled a new energy plan he says will decrease the United States ' dependency on foreign oil by more than one - third and help shift American energy production toward renewable natural resources .
T. Boone Pickens speaks with CNN about his energy plan he says will decrease U.S. dependency on foreign oil .
" The Pickens Plan " calls for investing in domestic renewable resources such as wind , and switching from oil to natural gas as a transportation fuel .
CNN 's Lou Dobbs talked to him Monday about his plan .
DOBBS : Let 's be clear , President Bush has put the pressure on Congress to drill or not to drill off shore .
There are vast deposits of natural gas lying offshore and throughout this country and it's a potentially important alternative to foreign oil and other energy sources as well .
The Energy Department now reports that with the current technology that the United States has access to 1,744 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
That 's a lot .
And Americans consume roughly 23 trillion cubic feet each and every year .
At that rate , we have enough natural gas to satisfy the demand for the next 75 years .
Conceivably , more natural gas could become available with technological advances and discovery .
One man who is calling for Congress to stop its partisan fighting and work together on offshore drilling is oil man T. Boone Pickens .
He recently unveiled his Pickens plan aimed at reducing our dependency on foreign oil .
He is the author of the upcoming book , " The First Billion is the Hardest . "
The book will be published in September .
T. Boone Pickens joins us now from our bureau in Washington , D.C. Boone , good to have you with us .
T. BOONE PICKENS : Thanks ,
Lou .
DOBBS : I 've got to say this first , I 've got to be clear .
You and I have known each other for nearly 30 years .
And throughout that time , whatever you were involved in , you were always at the forefront .
You are coming our right now -- I 've got to give you credit .
You are talking straightforward about what to do and how to fix a problem while not another single elected official , another business association , because most businessman now are represented by the Chamber of Commerce or the Business Roundtable and have n't got the guts or the vision , apparently , to talk for themselves .
I want to compliment you for doing so , if I may .
PICKENS : Thanks , Lou .
The problem is unbelievable for this country .
We are in a crisis mode and let me give it to you right quick .
We 're spending $ 700 billion a year on foreign oil , $ 700 billion .
We 're going to break the country in less than 10 years and we 're now importing almost 70 percent of all the oil we use .
iReport.com : How are you using alternative energy ?
DOBBS : Seventy percent .
And back when the first OPEC oil embargo began , back in 1973 , OPEC won .
What was it , about 20 percent ?
PICKENS : Twenty percent .
1991 it was 42 percent .
And I said then , we 're going to be 60 percent at the end of the century .
We were at 60 percent -- I was told I was a fool .
I did n't know what I was talking about .
I can tell you now , you 're almost 70 and you 're going to be importing in 10 years from now .
So we 've got to do something about it and we can , Lou .
The solution for it is natural gas .
Natural gas can replace foreign oil .
DOBBS : Now , your plan is to have natural gas move into transportation , correct ?
PICKENS : That 's correct .
It already is .
There are 8 million vehicles around the world on natural gas and only 142,000 of them are in the United States .
Can you believe , I mean , with our leadership , did not take us in the right direction .
But not trying to place blame , it 's really our problem .
Yours , mine , and the rest of the people in America .
DOBBS : You 're exactly right .
And the cost of conversion to natural gas for large vehicles , those dinosaurs or the gas guzzlers are the ones in many cases that are most readily convertible to natural gas , are they not ?
PICKENS : I 'm not interested in passenger car near as much as I am in heavy duty equipment .
The government should move quickly to mandating that all new vehicles that be purchased by the government would be natural gas vehicles .
General Motors has 19 different vehicles they make but none in the United States .
All of them out of the country .
South America and Europe .
DOBBS : Right .
PICKENS : But here 's what is interesting .
Gazprom last week , the biggest company in the world , Russia , they announced that they were going to put natural gas fueling stations all over Europe .
Now , that 's interesting because it tells you that we 're behind again .
We 're behind again .
Here we are .
We have natural gas , which is cleaner , cheaper , abundant and domestic .
Watch Pickens discuss plan for wind power »
DOBBS : And let 's be clear about this , too , Gazprom , the Russian oil and energy company , is not doing it out of the goodness of its heart , it 's driving profits but at the same time creating greater dependency in Europe , Western and Eastern Europe on Russian energy because of the pipelines that move from Russia into Europe .
So there 's a strategic plan behind what they are doing as well .
There is no strategy in this country whatsoever , even as a consumption economy we do n't have a plan .
PICKENS : We have not had a plan in 40 years , Lou .
What I want to do is to fold in the great resource we have in the central part of this country , which is wind .
And then you have resource from Texas west to California .
You 've got solar .
Those two resources have to be developed .
So when you develop the wind , you can then remove natural gas from power generation and put it into a transportation fuel market .
We can do that ; and is it easy ?
Almost easy .
There have to be some things , some hurdles to clear .
But when you take that natural gas out of power generation and put it into transportation fuel , that 's 22 percent of that 23 trillion .
That amount , you put into transportation would reduce our imports by 38 percent .
See where states stand on renewable resources »
DOBBS : I 'm going to round it off to 40 percent .
That 's an immense impact immediately .
It 's about $ 300 billion that you would save a year .
PICKENS : That 's right .
DOBBS : More on the out years as we move into the next decade .
Where you estimate , we could be transferring as much as $ 10 trillion in wealth from this country to primarily to the Middle East and to other oil - producing nations unless we change directions and do so quickly .
PICKENS : OK .
Quickly .
You said 38 percent ...
DOBBS : Right .
PICKENS : ... of the oil we import comes from the Mideast and Africa .
The two most unstable areas .
And if we did this , we can do it in five to 10 years , and we could get away from that dependency of 38 percent .
DOBBS : Now , I want to point out , Boone Pickens is not only offering a plan and solution and strategy , he 's also investing his money in wind power while others are talking about it .
And posturing and playing some ideological and partisan games .
Boone Pickens , as always , it 's a great pleasure to talk with you .
Thanks for looking out for the country .
We appreciate it .

ぼくが大学に入って間もなくアキバの雑居ビルにあるジャンク屋で店番をしていた頃，DOS/Vの普及でパソコンの価格が暴落し，消費税が5%になって客足もパタリと止まり，メモリとかも潰れた問屋からのフロア買いが横行して香港のスポット価格よりアキバの店頭価格の方が低いという無茶苦茶な状況になってたんだけど「あのいい歳して量販店の店頭でハッピ着てパソコン売ってるおっちゃんたち，20年くらい前は系列SI業者でRPGとかJCL使ってホスト運用してたんだぜ」とか店長にいわれて，あーIT業界というのはこうやってヒトを使い捨てにしていくのか．グループでずっと面倒みてくれるのは親切という気もするけど，恐ろしい世界だな，と思った．自分はどう生きれば，20年後にハッピ着て量販店の店頭で接客しているのではなしに，自分の経験を糧に，周囲から尊敬され，やり甲斐のある仕事にありつけているんだろうか，と悩み始めた．
間もなくジャンク屋は潰れ，僕は出たばかりのECサイトで汎用機＋UNIXサーバーからNTサーバーへの移行で運用コストを数分の一にするというコンサルティングの仕事をした．月に数十件しかないトラヒックを，Web系はCのCGI，ビジネスロジックは汎用機で処理するという無茶苦茶なシステムだったから，赤子の手を捻るようにコストを削減できたけども，何でもグループ会社の発注先にCが分かる奴，Cobolが分かる奴しかいなかったから，そんなヘンテコなシステムが出来上がったらしい．当時大学生だった僕が，発注先とそこを背後で操っている汎用機ベンダのSEを並べて片っ端から論破したら，ボスのところに発注先の社長から「コスト削減のために，ちゃんと新しい技術を勉強するから半年くらい待ってくれないか」と泣きが入った．それを聞いたボスは「君たちは他を知らないで，こちらをカモと思って不必要に何倍も高いシステムを売りつけたのか」と激怒してグループ企業である発注先を切り，ベンダ探しから僕が担当することになった．技術者としてのキャリアも，前の会社や今の会社とのコネも，よくよく考えてみるとこの仕事にはじまっていて，僕に全てを任せてくれた当時の社長には今も足を向けて眠れない．その仕事も一段落した頃，やっぱり自営コンサルという業態で背伸びし続けることの限界を感じて就職した．
前の会社では最初の1年くらいは不得手な仕事で修行をさせてもらったけれども，ネットバブルとか諸々あってサイトの立ち上げを何件かやった．だいたい，サイトが立ち上がるまでは誰もが僕に依存しているので権限が集中するのだけれども，立ち上がった途端に政治的に動く奴からねじ伏せられる．僕もガキだったし，オヤジたちと張り合いながら出来上がってしまったシステムをメンテするのは馬鹿馬鹿しいし，新しいサイトのことを考える方が楽しかったので，潔く身を引いた．会社からも暗にそうすることを求められていた．「君は引く手あまただけど，君の喧嘩相手はそこにしか居場所がないんだから」と．いわれた当時は理不尽だと思ったし，自分の好き勝手にやらしてもらえれば不具合は減って業績だって改善すると思ったけど，自惚れかも知れない．
ひどくしんどいSI仕事をこなした後に脱力して社内NEETとなり，1年くらい無線LANの研究をやったり，所長の代わりに役所の研究会に顔を出したり，ベンチャーを値踏みする手伝いとかをした．その後，いまの会社から僕に相談があり，真面目にやると重そうな仕事だったので会社で受けた．会社の財務は最悪な時期だったし，結構な数のエンジニアは暇しているのに，上長は暇なエンジニアが僕より5も10も年上だというので部下はつけてくれなかった．仕方なく暇してる年上の同僚を自分でみつけて仕事を頼んだ．仕事量を手加減して，彼の独立準備を手伝ったりもした．半年仕事して，先方からは契約を継続・拡大したいといわれたのだが，相変わらず部下をつけてくれる気配も給料を上げてくれる気配もないし，手伝ってくれた同僚も独立して僕に転職を促す始末で，彼とやはり転職した別の同僚から唆されるかたちで会社を見切って客であった今の会社に転職した．人事制度改革の対案を出すべく，人事について勉強しまくったのはこの頃だ．
転職先は外資という割には日本的な会社だった．潰れかかってた会社で従業員がまるで働かないところをみていた僕は，どんなに自分が仕事をサボってもびくともしない会社で，何故みな真剣に仕事するのかという疑問を持ってその会社に入った．けれども理由は簡単だった．指標を決めて，達成度に応じて確実に報いるという単純な仕掛け．仕事そのもののやりがいとかプライドとか，ビジョンの共有とか透明性とか．けどそれができるのは儲かっている会社だからだよね，努力指標と利益とが必ずしも連動しない訳で．それに，どんな会社，どんな仕掛けでも，働いているひともいれば働いていないひともいる．きっと世の中なんてそんなものなのだろう．
まだ入社して間もない頃，競合の旧式製品から自社製品に乗り換えさせる仕事を専門にしている米国本社のコンサルタントを呼んでセミナーを開く機会があり，酒の席で「日本ではシステムを担当する技術者のこだわりで，旧いシステムを簡単には捨てられない．彼らが新しい技術を習得する期間や費用を考えると，必ずしも割安といえないのではないか」と聞いたら「決まってるじゃないか．人材ごと入れ替えるんだよ．それを経営者に説得するのが僕らの仕事だ」といわれた．納得．簡単に人の首をすげ替えられるなら，システムもすげ替えられるよな．米国でうまくいっている方法が日本に当てはまらないのは，日米で雇用慣行や業界構造が違うからではないか，とか真剣に考え始めたのはこの頃からかな．
( まだあるけど後で書く )
とりとめもなく書き進んできたけど，だいぶ前から情報サービス産業で昔ながらの終身雇用・年功序列でやっていけるのだろうか．特に大手SI事業者でオープン系で儲かっていないことの背景に，オープン系の技術とか，それらの技術を価値づけるコスト計算の手法が，米国の雇用慣行を前提としていることで，そうでない仕組みでそういった技術を取り込むことが，ひどく高コストになっているのではないか，或いは技術者を使い捨てざるを得ない世界をつくっているのではないか，ということを考えている．
自分が使い捨てられるのが怖くて先に自分から会社なり組織に見切りをつけてしまうという生き方は決して問題の解決にはなっていないけれども，自分のことを自分でどうにかできるようになってから，時間をかけて世の中のことに目を向け，できることがないか試行錯誤しているところだ．
