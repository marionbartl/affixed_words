For the life of me , I still do n’t understand what Lee Harvey Oswald ’s motive was for killing President John F. Kennedy .
The lone - assassin theorists say that he was a lonely and disgruntled communist sympathizer who sought glory and fame for killing someone as powerful as the president of the United States .
But if that ’s the case , why would Oswald deny that he killed the president ?
Why would he claim that he was  a patsy ,  i.e. , someone who had been set up to take the fall ?
Why would n’t he proudly admit that he had killed the president of the United States ?
If he were seeking glory and fame , how would that be achieved through a successful denial of having committed the act ?
Moreover , if Oswald intended to deny commission of the offense , I ’ve never understood why he would leave such an easy trail behind him , such as the purchase receipt for the Carcano rifle found in the Texas School Book Depository .
If he was going to deny killing the president , would n’t he have been better off simply going to a gun shop and purchasing a rifle with cash ?
There were no background checks back then .
I ’m no expert on the Kennedy assassination but it seems to me that many of the things that people point to in support of Oswald ’s guilt are also consistent with his having served in a deep undercover role for the CIA or other U.S. intelligence , as many people have alleged .

In fact , early on there were assertions that Oswald was a federal undercover agent .
According to a biographical sketch of Waggoner Carr , the Texas Attorney General who led the investigation in Texas into the assassination and worked with the Warren Commission ,  Carr testified that Lee Harvey Oswald was working as an undercover agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and was receiving $ 200 a month from September 1962 until his death in November , 1963 .
However , the Warren Commission preferred to believe J. Edgar Hoover , who denied Carr ’s affirmations . 
Yet , the problem is that Hoover could be expected to lie about such an association and thus , his denial is meaningless .
Much has been made about Oswald ’s communist sympathies , including his defection to the Soviet Union and his affiliation with a group called the Fair Play for Cuba Committee .

Yet , those actions are entirely consistent with being a CIA undercover agent .
For one thing , Oswald was a Marine .
Most people who join the Marines are patriotic individuals who have the utmost loyalty to their government .
How likely is it that a person who hates America is going to join the U.S. Marine Corps ?
Not very likely at all .
In fact , would n’t the Marines be a likely place that the CIA would do recruiting ?
Many people point to Oswald ’s dysfunctional behavior , including his propensity for violence , citing the fact that he beat his wife .
But the problem is that the CIA has a history of attracting dysfunctional people to work there , including alcoholics and people who have a propensity for violence .
Indeed , what better types of people to assassinate and torture than dysfunctional people with a propensity for violence ?
The thing that I have long found mystifying is the U.S. government ’s reaction to Oswald when he returned from the Soviet Union .
Did they arrest and indict the guy ?
Did they even subpoena him to appear before a federal grand jury ?
Did they harass him ?
No , none of the above .
Do n’t forget that Oswald was a former Marine who had security clearance and had worked at a military base in Japan where the super - secret U - 2 spy plane was based .
He was also a man who purportedly defected to the Soviet Union , supposedly tried to give up his U.S. citizenship , and presumably was willing to divulge all the secret information that he had acquired as a Marine to the Soviet communists , who were a much bigger threat to the United States during the Cold War than the terrorists are today .
Yet , U.S. officials did n’t lay a hand on him when he returned to the United States .
Compare that treatment to how they treated , for example , John Walker Lindh , the American Taliban .
How come they did n’t subject Oswald , whose case was much more egregious than Lindh ’s , to the same treatment ?

Moreover , I ’ve never understood how Oswald was able to learn the Russian language so well .
It ’s not easy to teach one ’s self a foreign language , especially one as difficult as Russian .
It ’s even more difficult when one has a full - time job , which Oswald had in the Marines .
He certainly could n’t have afforded a private tutor .
Since he obviously learned Russian while he was in the military , how was that accomplished ?
Did the government provide the language training and , if so , why ?
What would have been the CIA ’s motive in developing Oswald as a deep undercover operative posing as a communist sympathizer ?
Well , do n’t forget it was during the Kennedy administration that the CIA was in partnership with the Mafia to kill Fidel Castro .
Since the CIA was developing such weird assassination schemes as poison pens and infected scuba suits to kill Castro , it does n’t seem beyond the pale that they would also consider sneaking a trained assassin with communist credentials into the country to get rid of the communist leader .
Of course , the fact that Oswald might have been operating deep undercover does n’t negate the possibility that he did in fact assassinate Kennedy or participate in a conspiracy to kill the president .
If such were the case , the motive for denying commission of the offense would be stronger , along with the CIA ’s denial of Oswald ’s employment with the agency .
Of course , there are those who claim that it is inconceivable that the CIA , being the patriotic agency it is , would ever have participated in such a dastardly scheme .
Last Sunday , October 11 , the New York Times published a book review detailing the history of Ramparts magazine , a leftist publication that was revealing in the 1960s some of the bad things that the CIA was engaged in .
What I found fascinating was the CIA ’s response :

 Outraged , the C.I.A. retaliated with a secret investigation of Ramparts ’ staff and investors in hopes of uncovering foreign influence , but it found nothing … .
The agency fought back with even more snooping — clearly illegal — as it  investigated ’ 127 writers and researchers and 200 other Americans connected to the magazine . 
So , the CIA was clearly not above retaliating against Americans who went after the CIA and was clearly not above breaking the law to do it .
Now , consider the threat issued by President John F. Kennedy to tear the CIA into a million pieces .
That threat was issued after Kennedy had fired CIA Director Allen Dulles , which occurred after Kennedy had supposedly betrayed the CIA by refusing to provide air support for the CIA - directed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba , whose aim was to kill Castro or oust him from power .
Let ’s not forget , also , that the CIA was not above using ruthless means against foreign presidents , including assassination .
Guatemala ( coup ) , Iran ( coup ) , Cuba ( invasion and assassination attempts ) , and Vietnam ( coup and assassination ) come to mind , to mention a few .
 But they would never have done bad things to an American ? 
Oh ?
What about Project MK - ULTRA , the nasty and infamous mind - control project in which CIA officials conspired to employ LSD experiments against unsuspecting Americans ?
 But they never would have employed their assassination talents or their partnership with Mafia assassins against an American president . 
Maybe , maybe not .
But let ’s not forget that the CIA sees itself as the ultimate , permanent guardian of U.S. national security .
What if it concluded that a young , inexperienced president himself was jeopardizing the national security of our country by establishing secret contacts with communist leaders , such as Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel Castro , by plans to surrender Vietnam to the communists by withdrawing U.S. troops , just as he had surrendered Cuba to the communists , by philandering with a Mafia girlfriend , a Hollywood starlet , and even a wife of a CIA agent , and by threatening to destroy the CIA , America ’s loyal and permanent guardian of security and liberty ?
Would the CIA simply stand by and refuse to protect America from such a threat , even while it was doing everything it could to protect U.S. national security abroad with assassinations and coups ?
For an excellent discussion of that question , see JFK and the Unspeakable : Why He Died and Why It Matters by James W. Douglass .
Most likely though , we ’ll never have a definitive answer to that question because if the CIA did participate in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy , there is virtually no possibility that such a crime would have ever been uncovered without a hard - driving , honest , independent federal prosecutor with grand - jury subpoena powers charged with the specific task of targeting CIA officials for investigation and possible prosecution for murder .
And we all know that the CIA and its supporters would never have permitted that to happen .
The Best of Jacob G. Hornberger
Scientists , mariners , and weather hobbyists started directly measuring temperature with thermometers globally in the late 1800s .
When modern climatologists want temperature data farther back in time than those first global measurements , they have to use things called “ proxies . ”
A proxy for temperature is something that , when calibrated properly , indirectly measures temperature .
The most common proxies that are used as temperature stand - ins tend to be tree rings , the amount of an oxygen isotope in ice cores , and coral growth rings .
There are a couple of problems with proxies , however .
The first problem is that scientists have to develop an appropriate and accurate calibration method to convert the width of a tree ring to an average annual or summer temperature .
The second problem is that a given proxy may well be influenced by other factors beyond temperature , and so calibrating the proxy becomes a difficult and potentially error - prone process .
For example , tree rings are a proxy for both temperature and moisture , and so any climatologist who wants to extract just the temperature information needs to discover a way to independently estimate the effect of moisture changes on the tree ring before the effect of temperature on the tree ring can be accurately determined .
A new study published September 17th as a letter in the journal Nature describes a new method to compensate for proxy changes due to elevation in the Greenland ice sheet ( GIS ) during the Holocene ( the present geologic epoch , starting about 12,000 years ago ) .
This basic problem is that the oxygen isotope used as a temperature proxy in ice cores , 18O , varies with regional temperature , the body of water from which the snow originated , the path the water vapor traveled from its source to where it falls as snow , what season the snow was deposited in , how close the ice core is to the pole , and even the altitude at which the snow fell .
A great deal of science has been done to understand how 18O changes with all of those factors , but sometimes errors creep in anyway .
In this case , a previously un-corrected error in ice core 18O data from the GIS had confounded understanding the response of the GIS to warming during the Holocene .
The main problem is that the GIS used to be a lot thicker than it is today .
At the start of the Holocene , the Earth was transitioning from an ice age to an interglacial , and as a result the Earth was quickly warming and sea levels were rising as a result of melting ice caps .
And during that period , the GIS shrank and thinned , effectively lowering the elevation of the GIS at the same time .
What this means is that there was some unknown amount of error in the 18O isotope signature in the ice cores , and that error was causing all sorts of problems .
The image below , specifically part “ b , ” illustrates how the 18O varied significantly from one part of the GIS to another ( part “ a ” shows where the cores were drilled , and part “ c ” will become important in a minute ) .
The authors set out to find sites that they could use to correct the 18O elevation effects in the GIS .
They found two ( Agassiz and Renland ) that they could justify as being understood well enough to correct the other four sites in the GIS cores .
And when they calibrated the 18O for those two cores for their known elevation and distance from the North Pole , they got the image above , part “ c . ”
They ’re not exactly the same , but they were close enough to use as calibration sources for the other four ice cores .
When the authors calibrated the other four ice core locations , they discovered that there had been significant elevation changes as the GIS thinned during the transition to the Holocene .
In addition , the authors compared their new corrected proxy information to an elevation proxy , specifically the total gas content held in the ice .
They compared the estimated elevation changes at two sites ( GRIP and Camp Century ) using the two different methods and discovered that they were qualitatively and quantitatively similar .
The authors also compared their data against models of the GIS and found that the ice sheet models did not accurately estimate the changes in elevation .
In general , the models underestimated the change in GIS elevation , and thus the rate and amount of ice melt .
So in addition to correcting a significant bias in the 18O temperature proxy record , the author also found that the GIS is more sensitive to temperature changes than expected .
It is therefore entirely possible that a future temperature increase of a few degrees Celsius in Greenland will result in GIS mass loss and contribution to sea level change [ that is ] larger than previously projected .

Careless consumers share the blame for forking over $ 24 billion to banks in overdraft fees last year , but , as the NY Times points out , bank policies encourage these penalties .
( If you have over drafted with Wachovia / Wells Fargo , call customer service and ask them to waive your fees . )
Since 45 % of U.S. banks rely on these funds to stay profitable , it ’s little surprise that they rig their banking practices to maximize the amount of overdrafts incurred .
Here are five rip - off techniques :
Aptly named for its location behind a ball field in New York City 's Central Park , Umpire Rock may offer a useful vantage point for calling balls and strikes .
For scientists , however , it has served as a speed gun for calculating the trajectory and timing of an ancient glacier that once played an active role in global climate change .
" The Laurentide coughs and the climate will change , " says Joerg Schaefer , a geochemist at Columbia University 's Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory .
Schaefer refers to the Laurentide Ice Sheet that covered the island of Manhattan , along with the northern third of the U.S. and most of Canada , until about 18,000 years ago when the great glacier finally retreated .
It had spent more than 70,000 years affecting and reflecting the world 's weather through periods of melting and growth .
Today , only carved terrain and rocky remnants remain , including the popular leftover that lies a short walk east of West 62nd Street .
Umpire Rock is just one of many enormous boulders — from Antarctica to New Zealand — created under the weight and movement of glacial ice .
With increasingly sophisticated techniques , Schaefer and other scientists are more closely studying the chemical footprints on these rocks , thereby gaining valuable insights into climate change .
" Glaciers are great climate indicators , " says Richard Alley , a glaciologist at The Pennsylvania State University , in an e-mail .
" Although they respond to many things ( such as increased snowfall , for example ) , they are controlled primarily by changes in summer temperatures .
Warming melts ice — and it is almost that simple . "
A glacier 's response to climate can be very sensitive to even the slightest temperature fluctuations : " Just one degree [ Celsius ] has forced glaciers to move back and forth , " Schaefer says .
As researchers determine precisely when and where glaciers have advanced and retreated , they can add to a global map of summer temperatures during the Holocene epoch , which spans from 10,000 years ago , after the last ice age , to today .
Schaefer thinks a better understanding of variations in this era could fill in missing key predictors for Earth 's future climate .
" We can only evaluate how dramatic changes will be if we know this natural variability , " Schaefer says .
" Everything humans do to the climate now is on top of this . "
Shedding new light on the climate
Schaefer and other scientists are using a combination of old stonemason tools and cutting - edge machinery , along with some basic geochemistry , to decipher and date this distribution of ancient temperatures .
When a glacier starts its retreat , it exposes the surface it had entombed to daylight .
This accumulation of debris , known as a moraine , is often identified when geologists see large boulders that were formed as a result of sediment compacted over thousands of years under a glacier 's weight .
Cosmic rays zipping through Earth 's atmosphere begin bombarding these previously protected rocks at the moment they are coughed out from under the receding ice sheet .
The collisions trigger chemical reactions that form a unique radioactive element , beryllium 10 .
Scientists can then count these newborn nuclides , or isotopes ( an element whose atoms have a different number of neutrons , giving it slightly different properties from the common variety ) , using a technique known as cosmogenic dating , to determine exactly when the glacier pulled back and the bombardment began .
" The glory of cosmogenic dating is that you can ask a rock how long it has been sitting there being zapped by cosmic rays , " Alley notes .
To get an answer from the rock , the nuclide is isolated from a chiseled sample — about the top centimeter on its surface — and then analyzed via mass spectrometry .
With chemists ' ability to isolate pure beryllium 10 and spectrometric sophistication growing over the last decade , Schaefer says , " tiny , tiny amounts of these nuclides can now be measured with very high precision . "
The total count is then compared with the background rate at which the beryllium 10 is naturally produced in the atmosphere , and a precise age is derived .
In the best cases , Schaefer says , a date can now be stamped with an error of plus or minus 10 years .
( Only one mass spectrometer accelerator , located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California , is currently powerful enough to provide these kinds of estimates . )
Cosmogenic dating has been around since the 1980s , but this improved sensitivity is allowing the possibility of dating much younger rocks that have had less time to accumulate beryllium 10 .
" The isotope records now overlap our historic record , " Schaefer says .
" This opens up a climate record that we could n't read out before . "
Tree rings , ice cores and marine life also offer glimpses into climate 's past , yet they are not always available , nor always precise .
" You could get lucky and run into a tree stump , but most glaciers leave deposits that are always traceable by this technique , " says John Stone , a geochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle who uses cosmogenic methods for glaciers in Antarctica .
" This allows a wide variety of glacial records to be obtained . "
Global data set in stone
Schaefer wants to see the improved dating method taken around the world , and has been chiseling rocks himself from New York to New Zealand .
He is the lead author of a study published in the May 7 , 2009 , issue of Science that investigated the ebbs and flows of glaciers in New Zealand 's Southern Alps .
Unlike the majority of the world 's glaciers , some in this region are advancing , rather than retreating .
But hope that this glacial behavior means a less dire global climate predicament is arrested by Schaefer 's findings : Glaciers in the Northern Hemisphere seem to behave independently from those in the south , and these " growing glaciers " have been expanding at an increasingly slower rate over the last several thousand years .
Conventional wisdom has held that climate fluctuations during the Holocene have been fairly stable and consistent around the globe .
Previous work by Schaefer , published in Science in 2006 , showed that before the end of the last ice age , about 17,000 years ago , most of the world began warming more or less simultaneously , with the exception of the North Atlantic . *
His research nearly three years later , however , paints a much more complicated picture :
The rates at which the glaciers were retreating in each hemisphere fell out of synch in the past 7,000 years , and underwent rapid periods of growth and decline .
Ice sheets in New Zealand appeared to reach their maximum post–ice age advance some 6,500 years ago , whereas in the Swiss Alps glaciers did n't peak until sometime between 700 years and 150 years ago — during the Little Ice Age .
This surprising difference did n't fit with either of the prevailing theories for planetary or hemispheric climate drivers .
Cyclical variations in Earth 's axial tilt and orbit relative to the sun are thought to control global climate changes , including the advance and retreat of major ice ages .
And inverse climatic patterns between the hemispheres are thought to be triggered by ocean currents :
As more fresh water is deposited in the north with melting glaciers , the " great ocean conveyor belt " slows down its delivery of warm water to the Southern Ocean .
But neither this phasing nor anti-phasing fit the data .
" In New Zealand , the influence is from neither an orbit nor the ocean , so we have to come up with something else , " Schaefer says .
One new theory points to the influence of regional shifts in wind patterns , like those that blow in with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation .
After scientists chiseled into moraines in the northern and southern latitudes , the next obvious site was around Earth 's equator .
The question there :
Do tropical glaciers act like those in northern or southern regions ?
According to a new study in the tropics led by a team at the University of New Hampshire , past fluctuations of tropical glaciers near Machu Picchu in Peru match up very closely with behavior in the Northern Hemisphere .
The Little Ice Age , which was known to have expanded glaciers in North America as well as Europe , appeared to chill the climate at least as far south as Peru .
Schaefer is a co-author on this cosmogenic dating paper published in the September 25 issue of Science .
This finding sparks even more questions :
What are the mechanisms for this link ?
Where , between Peru and New Zealand , is the link lost ?
The research does at least offer hope for finding answers : " These two studies [ from New Zealand and Peru ] primarily prove that we now have the tools in hand to decipher an almost untapped climate record : glacier moraines , " Schaefer says .
Implications from the ice
Penn State 's
Alley , too , is optimistic that scientists can use these perfected tools to fill in this global puzzle , glacier by glacier .
" With enough of this work , we should get a full understanding of the times of warming that forced glacier retreat from the moraines .
The pattern of this across the planet will tell us a lot about the mechanisms that caused the warmings of the past , " Alley says .
" By sorting out the causes of climate changes in the past , we should gain a better understanding of what has happened , a better ability to test our models , and ultimately better and more confident projections of what future climate might hold for us . "
Back in Central Park , Schaefer has been working with his team to finish sorting data from remnants of the Laurentide Ice Sheet as well as take more measurements on far - reaching continents ; he also continues to think about the consequences for humanity : " This is more than an academic problem , it 's a society problem , " Schaefer says , highlighting many regions ' dependencies on glaciers for agriculture , water and energy .
He would like to see a greater focus on adaptations that prepare societies for the impacts of glacier fluctuations — especially as the growing global map of cosmogenic chronologies more confidently projects severe impacts .
" Climate drivers are tiny , tiny , tiny , " Schaefer says , also pointing out that even the most conservative warming estimate from the United Nations 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a group of leading climate scientists , is bigger than anything the Holocene has ever seen .
" There 's no reason to believe that glaciers are n't going to do the same thing they always do :
If you make it warm they are gone . "
But with a growing lineup of hard - hitting players in this field , he 'll let the rocks make the final call .

MANDATORY VACCINATION IS AN ASSAULT ON INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY
By Attorney Jonathan Emord
October 12 , 2009
NewsWithViews.com
Public health services nationwide and the Secretary of HHS are sounding the alarm that the H1N1 virus ( swine flu ) may kill many Americans and infect tens of thousands of others .
Many scientists who study the H1N1 virus believe the authorities have exaggerated the extent of infection and risk associated with it .
Underlying this entire debate is the stark reality that federal and state officials are gearing up to compel Americans to be vaccinated .
That compulsion is part of an historic assault on liberty , where the state demands that healthy people be injected with foreign substances that may cause ( and indeed have caused ) severe side effects .
The National Vaccine Information Center ( NVIC.org ) monitors adverse events associated with vaccinations as does the Food and Drug Administration .
Among the ill effects caused by vaccines are contraction of the disease for which vaccination is administered , learning disorders , seizures , mental retardation , inflammatory bowel disease , autoimmune disorders , and even death .
Every state mandates that children be injected with a whole host of vaccines before they enter kindergarten ( for diphtheria , tetanus , and acellular pertussis ( DTap ) ; polio ; measles ; mumps ; rubella ; varicella ( chickenpox ) ; conjugate pneumococcus ( PCV ) ; hepatitis B ; rotavirus ; haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) ; measles , mumps , rubella ( MMR ) ; hepatitis A ; and meningococcal ( MCVt ) , not to mention a host of new vaccines required in certain states , including one for the human papilloma virus ( Gardasil ) ) .
Parents who dissent from the requirement that their children be injected meet with disfavor not only from their pediatricians but also from the authorities who may even construe the refusal to vaccinate as evidence of child abuse or neglect .
An allegedly abusive or neglectful parent can lose custody of a child , at least temporarily , to permit the state to vaccinate them forcibly .
Under federal laws adopted post 9/11 , the Secretary of HHS can declare a national emergency and order all citizens to be vaccinated .
These extreme powers can permit agents of the federal government to enter private residences to compel those inside to receive vaccinations .
Let there be no mistake mandatory vaccination is an assault on individual liberty .
It offends the core definition of liberty that underlies our Constitution for a person , against his or her will , to be forcibly injected with a foreign substance .
Sadly neither the federal nor the state governments provide any meaningful protection against mandatory vaccination .
Instead , it is the rule of law everywhere in this country that everyone be vaccinated , thus subjecting the vast majority to a bodily intrusion that can have severe side effects for the sake of a minority who are or will become ill .
The few exemptions that apply under state law ( for religious , medical , and — in certain states — conscientious objections ) are increasingly construed narrowly , making it more difficult for parents to escape the demands of public health authorities .

Properly understood , liberty is an inalienable right that may not be deprived of those who have not transgressed against the equal rights of others .
Our Declaration of Independence reminds us that just governments are instituted among men to protect the rights of the governed , including the right of liberty .
Our Bill of Rights protects liberty against the federal and state governments in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments .
In his April 4 , 1819 letter to Isaac H. Tiffany , Thomas Jefferson perhaps best defined “ rightful liberty ” as the “ unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others .
I do not add ' within the limits of the law , ' because law is often but the tyrant 's will , and always so when it violates the right of an individual . "
Since Justice Harlan ’s 1905 decision Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 US 11 , the courts have consistently refused to protect individual liberty to the extent our founding fathers intended .
In the case of mandatory vaccination , our Supreme Court has given local authorities considerable leeway , effectively reversing the burden of proof that ordinarily applies to any invasion of liberty .
Ordinarily , when the government seeks to deprive an individual of liberty , it may do so only upon the state meeting a very heavy burden of proof ( the establishment of a compelling state interest and means narrowly and precisely chosen to effect the end ) .
In the case of vaccination , however , the government need only show a reasonable relation between the means ( administration of a vaccine ) and the end ( reducing the risk of disease ) .
It does not need to show , for example , that less intrusive means were not available or adequate to meet the crisis .
The solution to this problem lies in restoring our Constitution of Liberty to its ascendancy over laws that would sacrifice liberty for the convenience of the state .
Consistent with “ rightful liberty , ” there should be a presumption in favor of each individual ’s right not to be vaccinated and there should be a requirement that no vaccination occur without fully informed consent ( informing the patient of the known risks and side effects along with the potential benefits ) .
If a person refuses to be vaccinated and the state perceives a threat to public health , it should have to resort to means that do not require invasion of the person .
For example , ordinarily state law requiring those who become ill to wear face masks and avoid contact with others would suffice .
If the threat involves sexual transmission of disease , prohibiting the ill from engaging in unprotected sex would suffice .
If the threat ultimately involves a disease that can be transmitted from the surface of the skin or from exhalation , then the state may require quarantining of infected individuals .
If people may be unwitting carriers , the state can require that all wear masks in public and avoid contact outside of family members .
Those measures would likely be more effective in arresting the spread of disease than many of the unproven vaccines and would protect the individual ’s right to personal autonomy and liberty against the state ’s amorphous interest in protecting the public health .
Finally , recognize that vaccination is one of the most extreme examples of prior restraint in the law .
Vaccination is not limited to the ill ; indeed , it aims to arrest disease by compelling the vast majority of well people to undergo inoculation .
In that way , it attacks the innocent and makes them bear the burden of those who are ill , compelling them to tolerate the risk of foreign agents injected into them as a way of reducing overall risk of disease .
Most vaccines lack adequate evidence of efficacy .
The flu vaccine is notoriously debated among scientists because all too often it either does not work ( affects the wrong strain ) or , if presumed to work by lessening the severity of the disease , does not prevent contraction of the disease .
The old fashioned remedy of hand washing , hand sanitization , and avoiding contact with others and with surfaces touched by others remains the best defense against influenza .
We would do well to invent a new vaccine against violation of liberty by the state , one that can be raised against the threatened onslaught of federal and state officials who believe they know better than you do how best to raise your children and care for your health needs .
There may be no greater threat to personal liberty than this .

By the numbers , [ four - month - old ] Alex [ Lange ] is in the 99th percentile for height and weight for babies his age .

Zimbabwe 's prime minister , Morgan Tsvangirai , announced that he was boycotting the country 's troubled unity government today , citing the " persecution " of a top aide being tried on what are widely seen as trumped - up coup allegations .
At a news conference today , Tsvangirai said : " We are not really pulling out officially . "
But he added that his party would not attend cabinet meetings or engage in other executive work with President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party .
Tsvangirai said his Movement for Democratic Change would continue parliamentary activities .
Former white farmer Roy Bennett is being tried on charges linked to long - discredited allegations that his party , the MDC , plotted Mugabe 's violent overthrow .
The MDC 's move demonstrates deep unhappiness within the party with the coalition .
But Tsvangirai has repeatedly said he sees the coalition as the only way to ensure Zimbabwe 's future , and he made that clear again by stopping short of bringing down the government by pulling out altogether .
Tsvangirai and Mugabe entered the unity government in February after two violence - plagued elections left the country at a political standstill and in economic ruin .
" Until confidence has been restored we can't continue to pretend that everything is well , " Tsvangirai said .
" It is our right to disengage from Zanu - PF . "
Bennett , who was ordered back to jail earlier this week after seven months on bail , is due to stand trial on Monday .
Tsvangirai had nominated Bennett as deputy agriculture minister in the coalition .
Bennett was arrested the day the cabinet was sworn in in February and charged with weapons violations .
He denies the charges against him .
" Roy Bennett is not being prosecuted , he is being persecuted , " Tsvangirai said today .
The European Union said yesterday it was " deeply concerned " over Bennett 's jailing .
The EU added that it regretted " that politically motivated abuse persists in the country " .
In Washington yesterday , US state department spokesman , Robert Wood , told reporters that the case against Bennett was a " blatant example of the absence of the rule of law in Zimbabwe " .
Zimbabwe 's neighbours had urged Mugabe , who has held power since independence in 1980 , to form the partnership with Tsvangirai .
In forming their coalition , the longtime opponents pledged to work together to reverse the country 's economic and political collapse .
Since the coalition was formed , Mugabe has demanded that Tsvangirai do more to get international sanctions lifted and restore foreign aid and investment .
Tsvangirai has condemned continuing human rights violations .
The coalition is Mugabe 's only hope of taking Zimbabwe out of international isolation , and it has brought Tsvangirai closer to power than any election .

Editorial : Fusion is a gamble worth taking
THE balmy south of France has always been a magnet for sun worshippers .
So it is perhaps fitting that here , not far from the Côte d’Azur , an international team of researchers is building a machine to recreate the sun .
It will take tens of thousands of tonnes of steel and concrete , plus a whole host of more unusual materials : beryllium , niobium , titanium and tungsten ; frigid liquid nitrogen and helium .
Oh , and a supply of burnt coconuts .
This eclectic mix of ingredients will be turned into ITER , the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor – the next big thing in nuclear fusion research .
When completed in 2018 , the reactor will fuse together two heavy isotopes of hydrogen to release vast quantities of energy .
In theory , the result will be clean electricity galore with no carbon emissions and far less radioactive waste than today ’s nuclear fission reactors leave behind .
So why we are not already flooding our electricity grids with fusion energy ?
While the concept of nuclear fusion is simple , the practicalities are anything but .
That ’s because the nuclei themselves are reluctant participants : each carries a positive electrical charge and these repel one another , so forcing two nuclei together is almost impossible .
Only at stupendously high temperatures do the nuclei acquire enough energy to overcome their mutual aversion , smash into one another , and fuse .
It is much the same picture in the sun .
There , heat is generated from the fusion of hydrogen nuclei .
But the fuel barely smoulders even at 15 million kelvin , the temperature of …
( L to R ) Tanvir Hussain , Abdulla Ahmed Ali and Assad Sarwar were found guilty
Three men have been found guilty of plotting to kill thousands of people by blowing up planes flying from London to America with home - made liquid bombs .
A Woolwich Crown Court jury convicted Abdulla Ahmed Ali , 28 , Tanvir Hussain , 28 , and Assad Sarwar , 29 , of conspiring to activate bombs disguised as drinks .
Four other men were found not guilty of involvement in the suicide bomb plot .
The arrests in August 2006 caused chaos to international aviation and prompted the current restrictions on liquids .
The jury heard that at the time of his arrest , plot ringleader Ahmed Ali had identified seven US and Canada - bound flights to blow up over the Atlantic within a two - and - a - half - hour period .
They were flights from London 's Heathrow airport to San Francisco , Washington , New York , Chicago , Toronto and Montreal .
Had the planes taken to the air with bombers on board , there would have been little chance of saving them .
This was a calculated and sophisticated plot to create a terrorist event of global proportions
Sue Hemming
Crown Prosecution Service
Liquid bomb plot : what happened
The e-mails sent by the bombers Airline trial :
The verdicts His " quartermaster " , Sarwar , had secured bomb ingredients at his home and in woods in High Wycombe , Buckinghamshire .
A flat in the Walthamstow area of north - east London became the bomb factory .
There the men put together a special home - made mixture of chemicals that they planned to take onto planes in ordinary sports drinks bottles stored within hand luggage .
Ahmed Ali , of Walthamstow , Hussain , of Leyton , east London , and Sarwar had been found guilty previously of a conspiracy to murder involving liquid bombs .
The jury in that first trial could not decide whether their plans extended to detonating the devices on planes .
But a second jury was convinced .
The plot became the biggest terror investigation in the UK and intelligence officers believe it was directed by al - Qaeda figures in Pakistan .
The BBC understands that the key contact for the plotters was a British man , Rashid Rauf , now thought to be dead .
' Daring plot '
Security officials on both sides of the Atlantic believe the men wanted to kill thousands in the air and possibly more on the ground in a wave of attacks causing more devastation - and political fall - out - than the 11 September attacks .
We moved in at the time that we felt that the risks were too great
John McDowall
Head of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command
In profile : The bomb plotters Home Secretary Alan Johnson welcomed the verdicts , saying : " This case reaffirms that we face a real and serious threat from terrorism .
" This was a particularly complex and daring plot which would have led to a terrible attack resulting in major loss of life .
" The police , security services and CPS have done an excellent job in bringing these people to justice . "
Sue Hemming , from the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) , said the plot had been sophisticated and calculated to create a terrorist attack event of " global proportions " .
" The CPS is committed to prosecuting to the full extent of the law those who would use terror to try to achieve their aims , whatever their motivation and their perceived justification , " she said .
" This trial has been another demonstration of that commitment . "
Other defendants Umar Islam , 31 , from Plaistow , east London , was convicted of conspiracy to murder , but the jury failed to reach a verdict on whether he was involved in a plot to blow up aircraft .
He , like the ringleaders , faces life imprisonment .

Three others were found not guilty of plotting to bomb aircraft : Ibrahim Savant , 28 , Arafat Khan , 28 , Waheed Zaman , 25 .
The jury failed to reach verdicts on a more general conspiracy to murder charges against Mr Savant , from Stoke Newington , east London , and Mr Khan and Mr Zaman , both from Walthamstow .
The CPS has a week to decide whether to try the men for a third time .
An eighth man , Donald Stewart - Whyte , 23 , of High Wycombe , was cleared of all charges .
His lawyers have called for an inquiry into why the Muslim convert was prosecuted .
The security services installed a hidden camera in the Walthamstow bomb factory and saw both Ahmed Ali and Hussain preparing devices and making arrangements for the jihadist suicide videos , recorded in the same property .
The men's defence was that they had been planning a political stunt , including small explosions intended only to frighten people at airports .
These political demonstrations , they said , would be backed up by a documentary they were making about western injustices .
The videos they had made were part of that documentary , they said .
No other material from the alleged documentary was ever uncovered .
Airline terror plot :
The evidence Abdulla Ahmed Ali , Tanvir Hussain and Assad Sarwar were arrested in August 2006 .
They were each accused of two charges of conspiracy to murder using home - made explosives .
All three were found guilty in an earlier trial of conspiracy to murder involving liquid bombs - but that jury could not decide whether their plans extended to detonating the devices on planes .
Now a second jury has decided that such a terror plot did exist .
The prosecution alleged that the three ringleaders planned to explode home - made bombs disguised as soft drinks on seven trans -Atlantic flights from London 's Heathrow airport .
1. 1415 UA931 LHR - SAN FRANCISCO ( United Airlines )
2. 1500 AC849 LHR - TORONTO ( Air Canada )
3. 1515 AC865 LHR-MONTREAL
( Air Canada )
4. 1540 UA959 LHR - CHICAGO ( United Airlines )
5. 1620 UA925 LHR -WASHINGTON ( United Airlines )
6. 1635 AA131 LHR-NEW YORK ( American Airlines )
7. 1650 AA91 LHR - CHICAGO ( American Airlines )
During their investigation police found equipment that could have been used to make bombs in King 's Wood , High Wycombe , and in Forest Road , east London .
Assad Sarwar , the quartermaster , bought a suitcase to store bomb parts in the woods near to his home .
There , he hid bottles of hydrogen peroxide , also known as hair bleach .
This chemical was the key ingredient for the home - made bombs .
At the bomb factory in east London , the ringleaders experimented with the design of their devices which were to be disguised as soft drink bottles .
The small bombs would then be smuggled in hand luggage through airport security .
The theory of bomb construction is detailed above , but precise details shown to jurors have been omitted .
This video simulates the damage caused by a liquid bomb to a commercial airliner .
The BBC used a qualified explosives engineer , Sidney Alford , to construct the devices to demonstrate their likely effect on an aircraft fuselage .

It seems funny that Hawaiian Punch is still around , like it should have died out when Capri Sun came onto the juice drink scene but I guess it ’s one of those things that will never die .
Like with 90 % of the products featured on this blog , this was a forbidden item in my childhood – Juicy Juice only .
I remember one time I was maybe 9 years old , said something wise to my dad and held his hand up in a wimpy fist and said jokingly said “ How would you like a Hawaiian Punch ? ” and in my childhood naivete I got all excited thinking that maybe he broke down and bought some as a surprise .
I said “ Oh my gosh YEAH !
You got some ! ? ” and he laughed and said “ no ” my face fell expressionless and I thought “ I hate you ” .
To me , that was nothing to joke about .
It seemed like everyone else got have Hawaiian Punch except us and to make light of it seemed cruel … so very cruel .
That ’s how tough my childhood was .
Guess what dad ?
You ’re not the boss of me and I can buy whatever I want now , so …how would YOU like a Hawaiian Punch ?
Um…yeah , so anyway I saw this Shasta Tiki Punch and was curious how it compared to it ’s Hawaiian counter part .
Hawaiian Punch :
I know I must have had Hawaiian Punch at some point in life but it was n’t more recent than middle school so I was actually kind of shocked by the bright redness of the drink that is so poorly depicted in this photo ( I swear it looked brighter ) .
One thing Ethan and I noted was how overly sweet this was , and it even smelled sweet .
The flavor was fruity Ethan described it as a melted Popsicle or like a super sweet pineapple .
I thought it tasted liked a liquified red lifesaver .
Between the uncomfortable color and the overwhelming sweetness I could n’t finish my glass .
Tiki Punch :
I was n’t expecting Tiki Punch to be carbonated so that was a surprise .
Overall the flavor was pretty much the same .
In some way the carbonation seemed to cut the sweeteness just a little but I think it was really just that it was a bit watery , although Ethan thought it was syrupy .
I was reading the ingredients and there is some kind of gum in it so I think is possible to be watery and syrupy .
Wrap up :
Gross and gross .
Okay , I guess I was n’t missing out on anything as a kid by not being able to drink this .
I ’m actually feeling a little nauseous as I write this and funny enough Ethan just said he feels like drinking more .
If I had choose I guess I ’d pick Hawaiian just for familiarity and that it contains actual fruit juice ( although less than 2 % ) while Tiki is nothing but scary ingredients .
I also wanted to point out Tiki Punch does have the better graphics .
“ Punchy ” not only is a heavily pixelated image but the new Punchy is way lamer than the old one .
I thought it was mildly interesting that they are both making the same hand gestures .
Also while Punchy is a guy , I ca n’t really tell what the Tiki bro is .
He / it seems to be a face that has two legs , one arm and that ’s it .
I mean , he resembles a human but there ’s a some thing missing that is a little bothersome .

( New York ) - Iran secretly hanged a juvenile offender early today despite a flawed trial , a stay of execution and an unequivocal international ban on such executions , Human Rights Watch said .
Delara Darabi , 22 , was executed for a killing that she was alleged to have committed when she was 17 years old .
The execution was carried out at Rasht Central Prison despite a two - month stay of execution in the case issued on April 19 , 2009 , by the head of the Judiciary .
This is the second known execution of a juvenile offender in Iran this year .
Iran leads all countries of the world in executing juvenile offenders .
" It appears that Iran 's head of Judiciary has no ability to control even his own judges , " said Zama Coursen - Neff , deputy director of the children 's rights division at Human Rights Watch .
" This is an outrageous violation of Iranian as well as international human rights law , and a callous affront to basic human dignity . "
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child - an international treaty to which Iran is a party - clearly bans the execution of offenders who committed a crime when under the age of 18 .
Since January 2005 , only four other countries are known to have executed juvenile offenders : Saudi Arabia , Sudan , Pakistan , and Yemen .
Neither Darabi's lawyer nor her family were informed prior to the execution , despite the fact that Iranian law requires that authorities inform a prisoner 's lawyer at least 48 hours ahead of an execution .
The Iranian human rights lawyer Mohammad Mostafaei , who has been a leading advocate in Iran against imposing the death penalty on juvenile offenders , told Human Rights Watch that he spoke with Darabi 's parents after her execution .
They had paid a routine visit to her in prison on Thursday , April 30 .
She told them at that time that a judicial official had informed her that an appeal would be granted in order for new evidence to be heard in her case .
Mostafaei said that at 7 a.m. on May 1 , Darabi called her parents to say that she could see the hangman 's noose , pleading : " Mother they are going to execute me , please save me . "
Speaking to her father , she said she wanted to see them , and added : " In the name of God please save me . "
Mostafaei told Human Rights
Watch that a prison official abruptly took the handset from Darabi 's hands and informed the parents : " We will easily execute your daughter and there 's nothing you can do about it . "
Darabi's parents rushed to the prison and begged to see their daughter .
Officials rejected their pleas .
Iranian authorities may have ordered the secret execution in order to avoid the international outcry that occurred when Darabi was scheduled to be executed on or around April 20 , Human Rights Watch said .
" Iran continues to deny that it executes juvenile offenders , but the secret nature of this execution demonstrates that the government knows that these killings are illegal and shameful in the eyes of the world , " Coursen - Neff said .
" Iran urgently needs to change this policy , which isolates it from the rest of the world . "
Darabi had spent the last five years in prison for the alleged murder of her father 's cousin in September 2003 .
According to her lawyer , Samad Khorramshahi , her trial was marred by a lack of evidence of her guilt and repeated refusal by the court to accept evidence that could have exonerated her .
Her plight had gained international attention , and exhibits of her prison art work attracted attention to Iran 's record of routine executions of juvenile offenders .
On January 21 , Iran executed a 21 - year - old Afghan citizen , Molla Gol Hassan , in Tehran 's Evin prison for a crime allegedly committed when he was 17 years old .
According to figures available from human rights lawyers in Iran , at least 130 juvenile offenders are on death row in Iran .
During a telephone conversation today between Human Rights Watch and Khorramshahi , Darabi 's lawyer , Darabi 's mother could be heard crying and asking why this had happened to her daughter .
" This travesty of justice in Iran has taken the life of a woman who was not given a fair chance to defend herself , " Coursen - Neff said .
" Those responsible did n't even give Delara 's mother a chance to say goodbye to her daughter . "

The lure of gold has been the downfall of many , from those worshipping the biblical golden calf to those unsuccessfully staking their claims during the 19th century gold rushes .
Nevertheless , this lustrous metal continues to connote the pinnacle of achievement , as evidenced by Nobel Prize medals , Olympic medals , and Academy Award statuettes .
Would our fascination with gold be lessened if we knew that its shiny allure was the result of excited electrons ?
Silver , iron , platinum , gold , and copper are all metals , which generally are malleable and ductile , conduct electricity and heat , and have a metallic luster .
Some of their properties can be attributed to the way electrons are arranged in the material .
The bonding of metals
When two atoms combine , different types of bonding can occur : covalent , ionic , and metallic .
Silver , iron , platinum , gold , and copper all form metallic bonds .
Unlike covalent bonding , metallic bonding is non-directional .
The strong bond consists of positively charged metal atoms in fixed positions , surrounded by delocalized electrons .
These delocalized electrons are often referred to as " a sea of electrons , " and can help explain why copper and gold are yellow and orange , while most other metals are silver .
Band Theory
The color of metals can be explained by band theory , which assumes that overlapping energy levels form bands .
The mobility of electrons exposed to an electric field depends on the width of the energy bands , and their proximity to other electrons .
In metallic substances , empty bands can overlap with bands containing electrons .
The electrons of a particular atom are able to move to what would normally be a higher - level state , with little or no additional energy .
The outer electrons are said to be " free , " and ready to move in the presence of an electric field .
Some substances do not experience band overlap , no matter how many atoms are in close proximity .
For these substances , a large gap remains between the highest band containing electrons ( the valence band ) and the next band , which is empty ( the conduction band ) .
As a result , valence electrons are bound to a particular atom and cannot become mobile without a significant amount of energy being made available .
These substances are electrical insulators .
Semiconductors are similar , except that the gap is smaller , falling between these two extremes .
The highest energy level occupied by electrons is called the Fermi energy , Fermi level , or Fermi surface .
If the efficiency of absorption and re-emission is approximately equal at all optical energies , then all the different colors in white light will be reflected equally well .
This leads to the silver color of polished iron and silver surfaces .
The efficiency of this emission process depends on selection rules .
However , even when the energy supplied is sufficient , and an energy level transition is permitted by the selection rules , this transition may not yield appreciable absorption .
This can happen because the energy level accommodates a small number of electrons .
For most metals , a single continuous band extends through to high energies .
Inside this band , each energy level accommodates only so many electrons ( we call this the density of states ) .
The available electrons fill the band structure to the level of the Fermi surface and the density of states varies as energy increases ( the shape is based on which energy levels broaden to form the various parts of the band ) .
If the efficiency decreases with increasing energy , as is the case for gold and copper , the reduced reflectivity at the blue end of the spectrum produces yellow and reddish colors .
Silver , gold and copper have similar electron configurations , but we perceive them as having quite distinct colors .
Electrons absorb energy from incident light , and are excited from lower energy levels to higher , vacant energy levels .
The excited electrons can then return to the lower energies and emit the difference of energy as a photon .
If an energy level ( like the 3d band ) holds many more electrons ( than other energy levels ) then the excitation of electrons from this highly occupied level to above the Fermi level will become quite important .
Gold fulfills all the requirements for an intense absorption of light with energy of 2.3 eV ( from the 3d band to above the Fermi level ) .
The color we see is yellow , as the corresponding wavelengths are re-emitted .
Copper has a strong absorption at a slightly lower energy , with orange being most strongly absorbed and re-emitted .
In silver , the absorption peak lies in the ultraviolet region , at about 4 eV .
As a result , silver maintains high reflectivity evenly across the visible spectrum , and we see it as a pure white .
The lower energies ( which in this case contain energies corresponding to the entire visible spectrum of color ) are equally absorbed and re-emitted .
Silver and aluminum powders appear black because the white light that has been re-emitted is absorbed by nearby grains of powder and no light reaches the eye .
Transmitted color of gold
Gold is so malleable that it can be beaten into gold leaf less than 100 nm thick , revealing a bluish - green color when light is transmitted through it .
Gold reflects yellow and red , but not blue or blue - green .
The direct transmission of light through a metal in the absence of reflection is observed only in rare instances .
Colored gold alloys
When two metals are dissolved in each other ( as is the case with alloys ) , the color is often a mixture of the two .
For example , copper dissolved in gold changes the color from a yellow - gold to a red - gold .
Silver dissolved in gold creates a green - gold color .
White gold contains palladium and silver .
The color of gold jewelry can be attributed to the addition of different amounts of several metals ( such as copper , silver , zinc , and so on ) .
Some of these color changes can be explained by shifts in the energy levels relative to the Fermi level .
Some alloys form intermetallics , where strong covalent bonds replace metallic bonding .
Bonding is localized , so there is no sea of electrons .
When indium or gallium is added to gold , a blue color can result .
The cause of color in these intermetallics is different than that of yellow gold .
Surface colors
Many metals create the illusion of being colored .
The color can be attributed to a very thin surface coating , such as a paint or dye , or thin oxide layers can create interference colors ( see butterflies ) similar to those in oil or soap bubbles .
The color of nanoparticles
The color known as " Purple of Cassius " in glass and glass enamel is created by incorporating a colloidal suspension of gold nanoparticles , a technology in use since ancient times .
Colloidal silver is yellow , and alloys of gold and silver create shades of purple - red and pink .
Nanoshells are a recent product from the field of nanotechnology .
A dielectric core is coated with metal , and a plasmon resonance mechanism creates color , the wavelength depending on the ratio of coating thickness to core size .
For gold , a purple color gives way to greens and blues as the coating shell is made thinner .
In the future , jewelry applications may include other precious metals , such as platinum .

The economic illiterates in Washington are so impressed with the " success " of Cash for Clunkers that they 're readying Cash for Clunker Appliances .
The ludicrous " stimulus " bill gave $ 300 million to the Department of Energy to provide rebates for 10 types of appliances that have been rated energy efficient .
Before government extends Cash for Clunkers to more products , it might be a good idea to examine the original .
The fact that Washington and the buyers who took advantage of Cash for Clunkers are gaga is hardly evidence that it was in the public interest .
It was n't .
As usual , the program has been judged only by its first and most visible consequences , violating Henry Hazlitt 's teaching in his classic , " Economics in One Lesson " :
" The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy ; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups . "
If you only look at the immediate effects , Cash for Clunkers appears pretty good .
People traded in gas - guzzlers for more fuel - efficient new cars .
The program cut carbon emissions slightly and gave the auto industry a boost .
" Manufacturing plants have added shifts and recalled workers .
Moribund showrooms were brought back to life , and consumers bought fuel - efficient cars that will save them money and improve the environment , " Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood bragged .
" American consumers and workers were the clear winners thanks to the Cash for Clunkers program . "
But wait .
Should n't that be some consumers and some workers ?
And only in the short run ?
Let 's start at the beginning .
The government paid car owners to trade in their old cars , which will be destroyed .
But the government is running a deficit .
So it does n't have $ 3 billion to hand out .
It must borrow the money , which reduces the amount of money for other investments .
Moreover , the government must raise taxes in the future to pay back the principal and interest -- or the Federal Reserve will monetize the debt through inflation .
Either way , we pay .
That is n't all .
Those car buyers were either going to trade in their used cars soon or they were n't .
If they were , Cash for Clunkers simply moved up the schedule .
The stimulation of the auto industry occurred earlier .
Big deal .
But if buyers planned to keep their cars longer , the program imposed costs that are less visible .
Without the government incentive to buy cars , consumers would have bought other things -- computers , washing machines , televisions .
The manufacturers and sellers of those products did n't get to make those sales .
Why should the auto industry get privileges at the expense of others ?
Then there are the mechanics who would have serviced those used cars .
They 've lost business .
Some will be laid off .
Nor should we forget low - income people who depend on the used - car market for their transportation .
The cheap cars they would have bought were destroyed .
What about the alleged environmental benefits ?
Assuming that cutting carbon emissions is worthwhile , was Cash for Clunkers helpful ?
It 's hard to see why .
People who traded in inefficient cars for efficient ones will likely drive more and therefore use more gasoline .
Even if carbon emissions are cut by a lot , economist Christopher Knittel says the program will cost more than $ 365 per ton of carbon saved .
Economist Bruce Yandle points out what a lousy deal that is : " The much celebrated Waxman - Markey cap - and - trade carbon - emission control legislation estimates the cost of reducing a ton of carbon to be $ 28 when done across U.S. industries .
Yes , we are getting carbon - emission reductions by way of clunker reduction , but we are paying a pretty penny for it " .
Finally , there is something revolting about the government subsidizing the destruction of useful things .
It reminds me of the New Deal policy of killing piglets and pouring milk down sewers to keep food prices from falling .
Leave it to politicians to think we can prosper by obliterating wealth .
For Python language enthusiasts across India , all roads led to the Lecture Hall Complex at the Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore on 26th and 27th Sep .
The reason - to attend and be part of the first PyCon India which was held during the week - end .
The event saw tremendous enthusiasm and participation from all over the country .
Over 350 delegates and 30 + speakers attended the event .
The event generated a lot of interest in the academia , with a large number of college students and fresh graduates attending it .
A notable instance is the participation of 75 students from the Rajalakshmi Engg .
College in the neighboring city of Chennai , who just hopped on a train to Bangalore en-masse .
This is a worthy example of how Python has caught the imagination of young programmers in the sub - continent and that the language is poised for steady growth and adoption in India .
The opening keynote talk by Dr. Prabhu Ramachandran was well attended and appreciated by the crowd .
Dr. Ramachandran talked about his experiences with Python and gave a very good impression upon the audience of how Python is an effective tool in quick prototyping and rapid software development from concept to the finish .
He gave on to give another talk on the 3D visualizer application Mayavi which is written in Python .
There were over 30 talks in total in addition to several lightning talks towards the end of the closing day .
Overall , the event was a very memorable learning and fun experience to all the Pythonistas who took part in it .
The event is poised well to take the leadership in promoting Python in India in the coming years .

Flood defences in many parts of the country are not up to job , experts say Up to 20 million people in low - lying Bangladesh are at risk from rising sea levels in the coming decades , according to new research .
Scientists predict that salty water could reach far inland , making it hard to cultivate staple foods like rice .
The research comes as the government appeals for $ 5 bn ( £ 3 bn ) over five years to combat climate change .
In May , Cyclone Aila left thousands homeless , killed many and caused widespread flooding and damage .
The predictions come from the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services ( Cegis ) in Bangladesh .
It suggests a surprisingly small area of land will be permanently lost to the waters , but notes that vast tracts in the south - west could be inundated every monsoon season .
Food threats Ahmadul Hassan , a senior scientist at Cegis , told the BBC that the intrusion of salt water would disrupt rice production in one of Bangladesh 's poorest regions .
" These are very poor people , and vulnerable .
For four months they 'll have nowhere to work , " he said .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" So people will migrate to the cities for jobs , because of the uncomfortable situation with sea level rise .
" We are talking about 20 million people , " he adds .
According to the researchers , data from 11 Bangladeshi monitoring stations shows an average sea - level rise of 5 mm per year over the last 30 years , with climate models forecasting further rises .
Of Bangladesh 's total rice production , nearly half is so - called " monsoon " rice and much of that is grown in the areas most vulnerable to flooding .
In an interview with BBC News , Bangladesh 's Minister of Disaster Management , Dr Muhammed Abdur Razzaque , said he wanted sea defences similar to those in Holland .
" We have to have new designs for embankments and we have to raise their height , " he said .
" We are expecting $ 5 bn over the next five years in support from the international community .
" This must be a grant , not a loan with interest , " he stipulated .
I think it is not possible to live in this country any longer , we have to move
Asma Khatun
Gabura Island resident Bangladesh is among a number of developing countries campaigning for finance to help adapt to the effects of climate change .
There are hopes that the richest nations will agree to massive funding at the UN climate conference in Copenhagen in December .
Staff from the charity Oxfam point to the damage caused by Cyclone Aila last May to highlight why Bangladesh needs help preparing for future sea - level rise .
Abdul Khaleque is managing Oxfam 's emergency response in Satkhira region , where more than 20,000 people lost their homes on Gabura Island .
He said : " This place is very near to the sea and we know climate change is causing sea levels to rise .
" If the situation gets worse then these people cannot go back to their villages , so permanent arrangements to improve these embankments need to be made . "
Defences breached
Four months after the cyclone , the sea defences are still breached and the island floods with every high tide .
The chairman of the Gabura Island " union " or council , Shofiul Ajam Lenin , is calling for the embankments to be far higher .
" If the current design is not changed then not only my union , but the other unions as well will not exist . "
The flooding has ruined the island 's freshwater supplies and hygiene in the camp is poor .
Among those living in tents on a narrow strip of high ground is Asma Khatun , a 25 - year - old widow , who is now eager to leave .
" I think it is not possible to live in this country any longer .
We have to move to other countries .
" We can't live here just by drinking this water .
It is not possible to live here . "

Washington , DC - The Presidents of 57 liberal arts colleges in the U.S. , representing 22 states , have declared their support for the Federal Research Public Access Act ( S. 1373 ) in an Open Letter released today .
The letter is the first from higher education administrators to be issued in support of the 2009 bill , and further reinforcement that support for the Act exists at the highest levels of the higher education community .
The presidents ' letter notes , " Adoption of the Federal Research Public Access
Act will democratize access to research information funded by tax dollars .
It will benefit of education , research , and the general public . "
The Federal Research Public Access Act ( FRPAA ) , introduced in June by Senators Lieberman ( I - CT ) and Cornyn ( R - TX ) , is a bi-partisan measure to ensure online public access to the published results of research funded through eleven U.S. agencies .
The bill would require that journal articles stemming from publicly funded research be made available in an online repository no later than six months after publication .
The full text of the letter reads :
Open letter from liberal arts college presidents supporting the Federal Research Public Access Act of 2009
As liberal arts college presidents , we are writing to express our strong support for S. 1373 , the Federal Research Public Access Act of 2009 , which has been introduced into the U.S. Senate by Senators Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) and John Cornyn ( R - TX ) .
This bill would require federal agencies whose external research budgets exceed $ 100 million to develop policies that would ensure public access via the Internet to their funded research .
Liberal arts colleges are important components of our nationʼs scientific and scholarly productivity .
Studies have shown that our institutions are highly effective in producing graduates who go on to obtain Ph.D. degrees and become productive researchers .
Our faculty actively pursue research , much of it with government funding , and often working in partnership with talented undergraduates .
Unfortunately , access to research information paid for with tax dollars is severely limited at our institutions - and indeed at most universities .
Academic libraries simply cannot afford ready access to most of the research literature that their faculty and students need .
The Federal Research Public Access
Act would be a major step forward in ensuring equitable online access to research literature that is paid for by taxpayers .
The federal government funds over $ 60 billion in research annually .
Research supported by the National Institutes of Health , which accounts for approximately one - third of federally funded research , produces an estimated 80,000 peer - reviewed journal articles each year .
Given the scope of research literature that would become available online , it is clear that adoption of the bill would have significant benefits for the progress of science and the advancement of knowledge .
S. 1373 would build on a number of established public access policies that have been adopted by government agencies in both the U.S. and abroad .
The National Institutes of Health has implemented a very successful comprehensive public access policy , as required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2007 .
All seven of the Research Councils in the United Kingdom have public access policies as do the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .
The bill is also consistent with the growing number of institutional open access policies that have been adopted at universities such as Harvard , MIT , and the University of Kansas .
We are supportive of the Federal Research Public Access
Act because it has been crafted in a way that provides ample protection for the system of peer review .
It allows for a window of up to six months before final peer - reviewed manuscripts resulting from publicly funded research are made openly accessible on the Internet .
In addition , it leaves control of the final published version of articles , which is generally used for citation purposes , in the hands of publishers .
Adoption of the Federal Research Public Access
Act will democratize access to research information funded by tax dollars .
It will benefit education , research , and the general public .
We urge the higher education community , American taxpayers , and members of Congress to support its passage into law .

The letter , available at http://www. oberlingroup.
org / open - letter - federal - research - public - access-act , was organized through the library directors of the Oberlin Group , a consortium of 80 liberal arts college libraries nationwide .
The Federal Research Public Access
Act proposes to build upon the success of the first U.S. requirement for public access to publicly funded research ( through the National Institutes of Health Public Access Policy ) and is supported by : 90 research , advocacy , publishing , and student organizations that represent the Alliance for Taxpayer Access ; the Academic Council of the University of California System ; NetCoalition.com ( representing Amazon.com , Ask.com , Bloomberg , eBay , Google , Yahoo ! , and Wikipedia , as well as state and local ISPs ) ; the Rockefeller University Press ; OXFAM ; and major national and regional research organizations .

Now London 's
The Daily Mail is chiming in with some more " bad " habits that , if applied properly , can actually benefit you .
We 've already mentioned how swearing can help relieve pain , but the Mail also says that blasting loud music is a good way to stimulate your brain .
( Your ear drums on the other hand ?
Probably not so much , so be careful ! )

According to researchers at Manchester University , music fans are stimulating part of the inner ear known as the sacculus , which responds to the beat in music .
This gives the brain pleasure and makes us feel good — during the music and afterwards .
[ When loud music is playing , ] the brain is stimulated into releasing feelgood hormones that make us calm , happy and responsive .
So to trigger a dose of happy hormones on a Monday morning , you should , in theory , choose Black Sabbath over chamber music .

Just how loud should you play your tunes ?
The rag says that the above mentioned sacculus only responds to volumes above 90 decibels .

FCC chairman Julius Genachowski delivered Monday on President Obama 's promise to back " net neutrality . "
But he went much further than merely seeking to expand rules that prohibit ISPs from filtering or blocking net traffic – he proposed that they cover all broadband connections , including data connections for smartphones .
Genachowski , Obama 's law school classmate , announced in a speech Monday at the Brookings Institution his intent to codify and expand the four current broadband principles ( . pdf ) known as the Four Freedoms and extend them to all broadband connections .
He said that an open internet is necessary for economic growth and democratic participation .
The rules were originally applied only to wireline broadband services , and the FCC kept postponing any ruling on whether they also applied to wireless services .
" The Internet ’s creators did n't want the network architecture — or any single entity — to pick winners and losers , " Genachowski said , embracing what is known as the end - to - end principle .
" The principles that will protect the open Internet are an essential step to maximize investment and innovation in the network and on the edge of it — by establishing rules of the road that incentivize competition , empower entrepreneurs , and grow the economic pie to the benefit of all . "
So - called " Net neutrality " is shorthand for the idea that the government should mandate that ISPs should largely act as dumb pipes that transmit data across the net without regards to what is in the data packets .
Today 's announcement marks a huge win for advocates say the rules are necessary to keep ISPs from stifling innovation by erecting tollbooths and created tiered access plans .
But others argue that consumer pressure will keep the net open and the rules will stifle attempts at innovation , such as finding ways to prioritize video calls over less urgent traffic such as photo uploads .
ISPs balk at the rules , since they have grown envious of the profits of companies like Yahoo and Google , who they see as free riders on their infrastructure .
The current rules , which never went through an official rule - making process and are being contested in court by Comcast , give broadband consumers the right use whatever services , applications and devices they like , so long as they do n't harm the network .
Genachowski proposes adding two more principles :
broadband providers cannot discriminate against services or applications by slowing them down broadband providers must tell customers how its engineers manage the network when it gets congested
The first new rule seeks to prevent cable ISPs from slowing down online video services and 3G providers from messing with internet calling services like Skype .
Those rules are necessary because there is little competition in the broadband market , Genachowski added .
" The net result is that broadband providers ' rational bottom - line interests may diverge from the broad interests of consumers in competition and choice , " Genachowski said .
The second new rule is intended to prevent a repeat of Comcast 's blocking of peer - to - peer traffic , which was discovered by an engineer having trouble sharing public - domain barbershop - quartet songs on the net .
Comcast denied for months that it was blocking the traffic , and only after a year of substantial pressure from the FCC did the company explain what it was doing .
All six principles will become part of an official rule - making process starting in November , Genachowski said .
That will means a few rounds of public comment and much backroom negotiating among the FCC five commissioners , currently comprised of three Democrats and two Republicans .
But both longtime commissioner Michael Copps and the newly appointed Mignon Clyburn quickly issued statements supporting Genachowski , signaling that only the details are up for discussion .
The nation 's largest broadband providers and the wireless industry will surely strenuously objected to the proposal .
The former have argued that the rules are n't necessary , since consumers will simply switch away from any service that does n't play fairly .
They also say their engineers need to have the freedom to tinker with traffic in order to stop spam and viruses , as well as to keep the system running in times of peak traffic .
For its part , the wireless industry says that new rules will stifle innovation and that wireless networks are too complicated to allow consumers to use whatever compatible device they like , even though buying a smartphone and service separately is common outside the United States .
" Unlike the other platforms that would be subject to the rules , the wireless industry is extremely competitive , extremely innovative , and extremely personal , " said Chris Guttman - McCabe , a VP for the CTIA - The Wireless Industry , the industry 's lobbying group .
" How do the rules apply to the single - purpose Amazon Kindle ?
How about the efforts from Apple and Android , Blackberry and Nokia , Firefly and others to differentiate the products and services they develop for consumers ? "
Genachowski's announcement marks a big win for consumer groups such as Public Knowledge which have mobilized millions of netizens over the last few years to fight for new rules and who have complained that the nation 's telecoms held sway over the FCC .
" FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski struck exactly the right balance this morning when he announced a plan to require a free and open internet , " said Gigi Sohn , the president of Public Knowledge , in a press release .
" The chairman 's proposals for additional transparency in how companies manage their traffic , coupled with new rules prohibiting big telephone and cable companies from discriminating against some services in favor of others will go a long way to freeing investment not only in the network but also in new services and features . "
It 's clear public interest groups , not the incumbent telecoms , have a friend in the new chairman , who finished his speech Monday in a rousing call to action .
" We are here because [...]
Internet pioneers had unique insights about the power of open networks to transform lives for the better , and they did something about it , " Genachowski said .
" Our work now is to preserve the brilliance of what they contributed to our country and the world .
It 's to make sure that , in the 21st century , the garage , the basement , and the dorm room remain places where innovators can not only dream but bring their dreams to life .
And no one should be neutral about that . "
Indeed , neither the telecoms nor the interest groups will not be neutral or silent about that in the coming fight .

One of the greatest rivalries in the history of chess has resumed as Garry Kasparov takes on Anatoly Karpov in the Spanish city of Valencia .
The 12 - game rematch is taking place 25 years after the two chess legends first competed for the world title .
That epic , gruelling encounter lasted five months in Moscow , before being called off without a clear winner .
Kasparov went on to snatch the world crown from Karpov in 1985 and then defended his title the following year .
Strict time limits
The five - day match in Valencia will end on Friday and is being played under strict time limits .
Kasparov took an early lead , winning the first two one - hour games .
The event is being broadcast live on Valencia 's regional government website ( www.gva.es), with organisers expecting millions of chess fans to tune in .
EPIC 1984 FACE - OFF Games 1 - 9 - Karpov races to 4 - 0 lead Games 10 - 26 - draws Game 27 - Karpov leads 5 - 0 Games 28-31 - draws Game 32 - first Kasparov win Games 33 - 46 - draws Games 47 - 48 - Kasparov makes score 5 - 3 Match terminated - no winner
The great rivalries of chess Kasparov , now aged 46 , has been preparing for the clash by training in Norway with teenage prodigy Magnus Carlsen .
Kasparov has described the match as " a ceremonial tournament " .
Meanwhile , Karpov , 58 , has been sparring with a computer and a group of grandmasters from a base on the Spanish coast .
The Valencia tournament comes 25 years after the two grandmasters - then both representing the Soviet Union - squared off for the first time for the world crown .
Kasparov , now one of Russia 's opposition leaders , was only 21 when he took on Karpov , then aged 33 , in the 1984 match .
Karpov raced to a 4 - 0 lead after nine games in the " first to six wins " match , with some experts predicting a 6 - 0 whitewash .
In all , Karpov and Kasparov have battled in five world title matches But Kasparov battled on , drawing the next 17 games .
He lost game 27 , but - after another series of draws - claimed his first victory in game 32 .
Kasparov eventually managed to close the gap to 5 - 3 , before the duel was controversially stopped by the then Fide ( World Chess Federation ) boss Florencio Campomanes on alleged health grounds .
The decision was taken despite both players saying they wanted to continue .
In the 1985 rematch , Kasparov beat Karpov , becoming the youngest world champion and heralding a new era in chess .
In 1993 , Kasparov broke away from the Fide to form the Professional Chess Association and play English grandmaster Nigel Short for the world title , claiming his hand was forced by corruption and mismanagement .
He was beaten for the world championship by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000 .
Karpov was Fide world champion from 1993 to 1999 .
The chess world title was only unified in 2006 .

A deeply divided Senate committee on Thursday forwarded legislation to the full Senate that reauthorizes three expiring provisions of the Patriot Act hastily adopted in the wake of the 2001 terror attacks .
The measures greatly expanded the government 's ability to spy on Americans in the name of national security .
Thursday 's 11 - 8 vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee came as lawmakers struggled to beat a looming deadline .
The three provisions expire at year 's end , unless renewed .
During more than two hours of sometimes - heated debate in the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee , some lawmakers accused one another of caving to intelligence officials who wanted to expand their powers , while other senators said the renewal was necessary to protect against looming — and classified — terror threats .
But when the hearing was over , the committee approved renewing measures that include allowing broad warrants to be issued by a secretive court for any type of record , from financial to medical , without the government having to declare that the information sought is connected to a terrorism or espionage investigation .
A proposal that would put limits on such requests was defeated .
Many senators said they'd been privately briefed by intelligence officials who were worried that adding constitutional protections for Americans could place them in harm 's way and jeopardize ongoing investigations .
Lawmakers said they could not discuss the private briefing publicly because it was classified .
" That 's the very nature of dealing with some of the laws dealing with the collection of highly classified material .
It 's regrettable , " said Sen. Jon Kyl ( R - Arizona ) who approved the renewals .
Committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vermont ) said he wished " the American public could have seen " the classified briefing .
Leahy voted to forward the measure to the Senate .
Sen . Russ Feingold ( D - Wisconsin ) countered there was no evidence that adding limited privacy protections for Americans would hinder any investigation .
Instead , he said , his colleagues were sanctioning " fishing expeditions . "
" I do n't buy it , " said the senator , who voted against sending the measure to the full Senate , where it meets an uncertain fate .
The bill must also be approved by the House and signed by the president for the renewals to take effect .
No vote date for either body has been set .
Members also renewed the so - called " roving wiretap " provision , allowing the FBI to obtain wiretaps from the secret court , known as the FISA court , without identifying the target or what method of communication is to be tapped .
Finally , the committee renewed the so - called " lone wolf " measure that allows FISA court warrants for the electronic monitoring of a person for whatever reason — even without showing that the suspect is an agent of a foreign power or a terrorist .
The government has said it has never invoked that provision , but said it wanted to retain the authority to do so .
A Feingold measure ( .pdf ) to allow that provision to expire was defeated .
Feingold did not submit a much - discussed amendment to withdraw the immunity Congress granted to the nation 's telecommunications companies last year , one that shields the companies from lawsuits accusing them of funneling Americans ' electronic communications to the National Security Agency without warrants .
Feingold announced the proposal two weeks ago and had said he would submit it to the committee for consideration during the Patriot Act renewal negotiations .
With limited exceptions , the committee - approved measure largely resembles existing law .
However , one change requires publication of audits , including how many times the government has used the Patriot Act ’s provisions , including the number of targets .
Much of the government ’s public reporting on the topic has been voluntary , and very little is known about how often each power has been used and why .
Another change centered on library records .
In order to obtain warrants for them from the FISA court , the new plan requires a tangential connection to a terror investigation or foreign power .
The expiring version does not .
Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R - Alabama ) worried the provision might " encourage terrorists they have a safe haven " in America 's public libraries .
Session voted against the measure .
The most - intense debate centered on a controversial and often abused aspect of the Patriot Act that is not expiring at year 's end .
Lawmakers went back and forth on whether to alter the standard by which National Security Letters are issued .
The letters allow the FBI , without a court order , to obtain telecommunication , financial and credit records relevant to a government investigation .
The FBI issues about 50,000 of them annually , and an internal watchdog has repeatedly found abuses of the National Security Letter powers .
Sen. Richard Durbin ( D - Illinois ) proposed a new standard ( . pdf ) that would authorize those records only if the investigation concerned terrorism or spy activities of an agent of a foreign power .
Durbin , whose proposal was defeated , said his plan would set " reasonable limits on these powers to protect basic constitutional rights we have sworn to uphold as members of the Senate . "
But other members said the FBI needs the carte blanche authority because it cannot know if the records relate to a terror investigation or foreign agent until they get the records .
Terrorists , Kyl said , " do n't carry cards in their wallets that say I am a respected member in the al - Qaida organization . "
Voting to send the package to the Senate floor were :

Some of the employees of France Telecom – which operates the " Orange " brand in France – have seen the future .
It is black and comfortless .
The latest person to come to that view was a 51 - year - old father of two employed in an Orange call centre who threw himself from a motorway bridge near Annecy on Monday .
His death brought the number of France Telecom employees who have committed suicide in the past 19 months to 24 .
Trades union leaders blame the allegedly brutal management culture of a company which has transformed itself over a decade from a ponderous state utility to a leading telecommunications enterprise .
For months , the France Telecom management has dismissed the suicides as a contagious " fad " among its workforce .
Its chief executive and president , Didier Lombard , admitted yesterday that he had " made mistakes , which has increased the stress on my employees " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The suicides are disturbing because they are , on one level , a modern plague with implications well beyond France .
The number of suicides , especially work - related suicides , has been increasing in almost all developed nations .
The France Telecom victims have mostly been previously well - adjusted people in their 40s and 50s whose familiar working lives have been turned upside down by the triumph of the mobile telephone and the internet .
Tens of thousands of France Telecom workers were once needed to deal with physical repair or installation work on land lines .
Others dealt with familiar business clients .
Frequently , they worked in teams .
The decline of land lines and the transformation of France Telecom into a successful mobile phone and internet provider has abolished the need for many of these jobs .
But the employees remain .
Long - standing telecoms workers retain the protected status of French public servants .
France Telecom cannot easily make them redundant .
Instead , the company , which was spun - off in 1996 and became majority private - owned in 2004 , is accused of adopting " bullying " tactics to " encourage " unwanted workers to leave the company .
Many of the employees have been pitched overnight into faceless , high - pressure call - centres , where they are expected to compete for results against the person sitting in the next booth .
However , the alleged " epidemic " of telecoms suicides should also be placed in a wider context .
France – the country of savoir vivre , whose President would like national " happiness " to be measured and included in a new international yardstick of political achievement – has a higher suicide rate than almost all other large , developed nations .
Its rate of work - related suicides , up to 400 a year , is one of the highest in the world .
Some sociologists suggest a nation which sees personal contentment as a right is more likely to plunge into depression if disappointed .
France also has one of the world 's highest consumption of anti-depressants .
The 24 suicides among the 100,000 France Telecom employees since February last year is high but less than the overall French average ( 17.6 suicides a year for every 100,000 people , compared to 6.8 in Britain ) .

The suicide rate in France Telecom is , in fact , falling .
It was higher six or seven years ago but received little publicity .
There were 29 suicides among France Telecom employees in 2002 , 22 in 2003 , 12 in 2008 and 12 so far this year .
Some employees defend their company and suggest that publicity about a " suicide epidemic " has been generated by trades unions in an attempt to de-rail the company 's restructuring programme .
" These people should try working in a computer start - up company , " said Michel , a France Telecom employee since 1998 .
" France Telecom is idyllic by comparison .
To suggest that the work conditions incite people to commit suicide verges on the indecent .
Hundreds of thousands of people on the dole would love to have such jobs . "
Jean - Paul Rouannet , 51 , would presumably have begged to disagree .
On Monday he threw himself from a bridge over a motorway .
He left a suicide note for his wife and two children , aged 12 and eight , which said that the " conditions at work " had forced him to take his life .
Mr Rouannet used to work in a France Telecom agency which dealt with large business clients .
Six months ago he was transferred , without any choice , to a " reactive call centre " in Annecy where he dealt with customers ' problems and complaints but was also expected to chat them up to persuade them to buy new France Telecom services .
A friend , Danièle Rochet , said : " He could not cope with the stress of having to meet targets ...
He should not have been just abandoned like that , without personal guidance . "
Many – but not all – of the other 23 France Telecom employees who have taken their lives in the past 19 months had also been transferred from manual or managerial work to Orange call centres .
In some cases , they had to " cold - call " potential customers ; in others they were under pressure to sell additional goods or services to customers who rang in with questions or problems .
Olivier Dunand is a delegate of the moderate CFDT trades - union federation on the Comité d'Entreprise , or works council , of France Telecom .
He says many employees are being pushed into unsuitable work to try to " break their health " or encourage them to leave the company .
" Many people do n't want to go into direct sales , " he told The Independent yesterday .
" It 's a difficult adjustment to make , especially for older people , and you have to remember the average age at France Telecom is 48 . "
Each call centre had about 150 employees in an open - plan office , he said .
There was a manager for every 10 or 12 people .
" Everything the employee does is counted : when he or she goes to the toilet ; when he eats ; when he smokes a cigarette .
The workers are even made to wear wi-fi ear and mouth pieces so they can deal with calls during their breaks . "
Patrice Diochet , the France Telecom representative of the CFDT trades - union federation , said that despite promises made to the government after the 23rd suicide this month , nothing had been done to ease the pressure on employees at the Annecy call centre .
" Results were all that counted , " he said .
" The workers were treated like cattle .
When they failed to meet their targets , they were punished or screamed at . "
Market - oriented economists argue that unhappy France Telecom employees are victims , in part , of their public servant , job - for - life status .
In another company , or another country , they would have been obliged to take redundancy and , possibly , find more suitable work .
As it is , France Telecom does offer subsidies and training to employees who want to leave – 22,000 people have left the company in the past four years .
Mr Lombard – who was booed and pelted with rubbish when he visited the Annecy call centre on Monday – has suspended all job transfers and promised to employ more personal counsellors for his workers .
He insists the poor France Telecom suicide record – which goes back at least seven years – is " partly a question of contagion " .
But in trying to impose a culture of risk and uncertainty on employees trained in a public - service culture , he admits he went too far .
' This is one suicide too many '
The employee : Anne-Marie , 57
Like Jean - Paul Rouannet , who committed suicide on Monday , Anne- Marie works at the France Telecom Annecy call centre .
" They sent me here in June .
I had no choice .
My old job [ dealing with business clients ] was abolished .
After six weeks ' training , I was declared ready to start .
" My job is to sell more and more stuff , new services , to clients who ring up with some kind of problem .
I am supposed to be obsessed with making more and more money on commission but it does n't interest me .
I just do what I can .
" Apart from the occasional break , I spend the whole day with earphones on my head .
Some clients are cruel .
They say , ' Are you going to be just like the others ?
Are you going to commit suicide too ? '
" My colleague 's death will change nothing .
For Didier Lombard [ the CEO of France Telecom ] , we are just pawns .
We mean nothing .
He says that we are just suicide fashion victims , copying one another .
But things can not go on like this .
It is one suicide too many . "
Recently the upstairs toilet in my house backed up .
Unable to budge the clog , my wife called a plumber , who replaced both the seal and some of the inner workings of the toilet .
Let ’s say , just for the sake of this example , that the plumber charged us $ 200 for the repair .
Now suppose the next day the downstairs toilet had needed the same work , and suppose further that the plumber who did the job the first day was unavailable , so we called another plumber , who charged us only $ 100 for the repair .
Is there any injustice in the fact that the second plumber was paid less than the first , given that both agreed to do the job for the amounts they were paid ?
Common sense says that the compensation was perfectly just because the payer and the payee had mutually agreed on the terms .
Ah , but common sense and politics seldom mix .
Thus it was with great fanfare that President Obama signed his first bill into law , vastly extending the statute of limitations for filing legal claims of pay discrimination .
Of course , it should go without saying that the federal government has no constitutional authority to involve itself in setting wage rates for private - sector employees , and therefore that federal laws prohibiting wage discrimination should not even exist in the first place .
That such laws exist is bad enough , but Obama has significantly exacerbated the havoc that these statutes can wreak .
According to the Associated Press , the Supreme Court had previously ruled  that a person must file a claim of discrimination within 180 days of a company ’s initial decision to pay a worker less than it pays another worker doing the same job .
Under the new bill , given final passage in Congress this week , every new discriminatory paycheck would extend the statute of limitations for another 180 days .
Clearly the trial lawyers who contributed to Obama ’s campaign made a wise investment .
Economics in One Lesso ...
Hazlitt , Henry Best Price : $ 2.43 Buy New $ 7.43 ( as of 12:35 EST - Details )
The law , known as the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , is being touted as a law that guarantees equal pay for equal work .
Now who could be against that ?
Anyone who cares about liberty should be , and here ’s why .
First of all , it is exceedingly rare to find two people who are doing precisely the same work .
Perhaps only two workers doing the same job at the same rate on the same assembly line would qualify .
Two secretaries in an office , who in theory probably have the same duties , might still find that one of them ends up typing twice as many letters as the other .
And this second secretary may in turn do three times as much filing as the first .
One might take half again as many phone calls as the other yet do so in the same amount of time because she is able to get to the nub of the conversation more quickly .
Even in the plumbing example I cited at the outset , the two toilets were different models , so plumber number two may have had an easier time of it or found cheaper parts than plumber number one .
Productivity , proficiency , and even a certain amount of chance play huge roles in determining exactly what , and how much , work each person does .
It is next to impossible to say that any two people have done equal work .
Even if it could be shown beyond all doubt that employee A and employee B were doing exactly the same work , there would still remain the problem illustrated by the plumbing story .
If A and B each agreed to work at the wages they were being paid , then there is no injustice in paying A more than B for equal work .
In the case of Lilly Ledbetter , who sued Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. for alleged pay discrimination , the fact that Ledbetter continued to work for Goodyear for 19 years and , presumably , to cash her paychecks indicates that she was satisfied with her compensation during that time .
Had she at any time disagreed that she was being compensated fairly for the work she was doing , she had only to request an increase in pay and then , if the company declined her request , to quit .
By remaining in Goodyear ’s employ for nearly two decades , she gave assent to the wages she was receiving .
As long as a person accepts the pay he is receiving and is not the victim of either force or fraud by his employer — and paying a person the wage to which he agreed , even if it differs from others ’ wages , in no way constitutes fraud — the government has absolutely no business punishing the employer .
It ’s a simple matter of property rights .

Parable of the Vineyard Workers
In case I have still failed to convince you , allow me to call as my expert witness , Jesus Christ , who endorsed precisely this line of reasoning in a parable recorded in Matthew 20 .
In the parable the owner of a vineyard hired some men to work in the vineyard at the beginning of the day at the wage of one denarius for the entire day .
Throughout the day he continued to hire workers for his vineyard .
At the end of the day he paid every one of them the same wage , one denarius , he had offered to the men who had started working at daybreak .
These men , too , complained of wage discrimination , to which the employer replied ,  Friend , I am not being unfair to you .
Did n’t you agree to work for a denarius ?
Take your pay and go .
I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you .
Do n’t I have the right to do what I want with my own money ?
Or are you envious because I am generous ?
Now Jesus was trying to make a spiritual point with this story , but the fact remains that he did not dispute the vineyard owner ’s claims , nor did he suggest that Caesar ought to intervene and force him to pay the workers on the basis of how much time they had worked .
The money was , as the man said , his own , and he had a right to dispose of it as he pleased .
It comes as no surprise that Obama , as much a believer in the all - powerful state as anyone else in Washington , thinks it is the business of the federal government to regulate every aspect of our lives .
He probably even thinks he was doing women and minorities a good turn by signing the Ledbetter Act .
What he is really doing , however , is making it that much less likely that employers will want to hire them for fear that they will be sued for paying them exactly what these employees agreed to be paid .
It used to be said that a man ’s word is his bond , but in employer - employee relations in the age of Sugar Daddy Sam , that is strictly a one - sided proposition .
Employers must live up to their word , and then some , but employees are free to disregard theirs and then pillage their employers for failing to discern exactly how much money the employees thought they should have been paid .
What we really need are some plumbers to drain the cesspool that is the District of Columbia .
I ’d happily pay them all the same exorbitant fee to flush the whole malodorous system down the toilet .

Do n't Endure Unfair Treatment In The Workplace
In a fair world , employment decisions including hiring , firing , promotions and layoffs would be made based an employee 's performance alone .
Unfortunately , in some cases employers base their decisions on bias .
In some cases , employers demote or fire employees in retaliation for reporting unfair treatment .
These practices are not only unfair ; they are against the law .
If you need help resolving problems related to workplace discrimination , sexual harassment or wage and hour problems , contact employee rights attorney William Julien .
At the Boca Raton Law Office of William M. Julien , we fight for the rights of our clients to work in a safe , fair and productive environment .
How We Can Help
Sometimes it can be hard to detect if you are being discriminated against , and it can be hard to know if you should complain about the treatment you 're facing .
When you come in for your free initial consultation , you will speak with an attorney about what 's happening to you at work .
We can help provide clarity about your legal rights , no matter what kind of discrimination you may be facing :
Employees facing discrimination may suffer the consequences of a superior 's belief that skin color or national origin makes a difference for a person 's ability to do one 's job .
A worker 's career may be stalled or thwarted by discrimination based on gender .
Likewise , sometimes employers will discriminate against a worker based on his or her sexual orientation .
People over the age of 40 are protected by federal law from being discriminated against in favor of younger workers .
Pregnant women can face employment barriers , sometimes finding themselves demoted or even fired after taking guaranteed leave .
An employer 's belief that an employee is disabled and unable to perform certain tasks - even when this is not the case - can rise to the level of disability discrimination , as can an employer 's refusal to make certain reasonable accommodations for a worker with a known disability .
If an employer refuses to make scheduling allowances for Sabbath or religious holidays , this may constitute religious discrimination .
Discrimination can hurt your career prospects , financial outlook and morale on the job .
You do n't have to endure this unfair treatment .
Our firm can help you assert your rights in the workplace , just as we have in many other successful cases .
Unemployment Issues Can Raise Red Flags
Sometimes an employment law issue does n't come to light until an employee runs into trouble with the unemployment benefits process .
If your unemployment claim has been denied , we can evaluate whether you might in fact have a more substantial underlying claim against your former employer .
Contact Us For More Information
If you feel that you need protection against your employer that may have discriminated against you on the basis of a legally protected status , Florida employee rights lawyer William Julien can help .
If you 've been retaliated against or fired , contact us in Boca Raton as soon as you can -- time might be running out on your claim .

American and Western discussions of what to do about Iran almost completely ignore Iraq .
But no economic sanctions can effectively be placed on Iran without Iraqi support .
A gasoline embargo would fail completely if Iraqis smuggled gasoline to Iran ( which they certainly would , both for economic and religious reasons ) .
Jalal Talabani , the president of Iraq , said Saturday that new sanctions on Iran “ would not work ” and that Iraq would never allow its airspace to be used for an aggressive attack on Iran “ by any country ” ( he ’s looking at you , Israel and US ) .
Somehow I do n’t think this is what Bush was going for when he invaded Iraq .
Trita Parsi of the National Iranian American Council makes a more extended version of Talabani ’s argument .
Meanwhile , the Turkish government is seeking from its parliament authorization to extend its bombing campaigns against guerrillas of the Kurdish Workers Party ( PPK ) inside Iraq .
The US military once held 26,000 Iraqi prisoners , most picked up at the site of bombings and other guerrilla attacks .
It has released all but 8,000 , but the US officers are worried that those released often go back to guerrilla activity – some of them for the salary .
The Status of Forces Agreement requires the US to turn over to the Iraqi government all prisoners for whom specific and detailed criminal cases cannot be built .
Aljazeera English discusses the United Nations Human Development Report on Iraq .
Iraq has dropped off the American radar , but the country faces enormous challenges , from ongoing violence to lack of basic human services .

For those of you who have tested the beta or the Windows 7 RTM code , this might not come as any surprise .
For those of us whose production machines still run Windows XP ( Ziff - Davis and Intel , among others ) the improved performance of Microsoft 's new operating system is a nice surprise .
One of those surprises was delivered Wednesday , when Microsoft paired a quad - core Intel Core i7 microprocessor with a solid - state - disc drive and what Ruston Panabaker , the principal program manager for strategic silicon partnering at Microsoft , called a generic build of Windows 7 .
Panabaker fired up the system , and presto !
An 11 - second boot time .
Sure , this was most likely a fresh build on fresh hardware , and an SSD makes all the difference in the world .
But there was a little magic going on behind the scenes , as well According to Panabaker , the boot process can be parallelized across all four cores and all eight threads provided by Intel 's hyperthreaded processor .
" It 's an Intel reference design , " Panabaker said .
" But with high - performance hardware , this shows what system manufacturers can do .
" Part of the improved performance comes from the telemetry data that helped Microsoft boost battery life by a significant amount when running on Intel 's next - generation processors .
Other work was done by Microsoft itself , removing " thread locks " that stalled the system .
Intel also works with the Windows 7 scheduler to migrate threads to idle cores , and then to shut those idle cores down if there truly is no work to do .
Microsoft has been working with the software ecosystem to take advantage of the battery - boosting , low - power API .
And Intel executives , like others in the industry , have reported that Microsoft has been diligent about providing its partners time ( about 12 months ) to nail down drivers and the like .
Panabaker did say that there will likely be a Knowledge Base article listing incompatible hardware , as Apple 's Snow Leopard does .
When that will be released is not known , but it will likely be closer to launch , he said .
One feature that Microsoft plans to include : community features , which will help users and Microsoft nail down what does n't work , he said .
It is only by the creation of wealth that we shall ever have a prayer of recovering from this terrible economic position .
That dictates that a government , of whatever party , should not increase taxes .
All three are now agreed that it is , on the contrary , a superb idea to impose more taxes on the so - called rich .
One would expect Labour , which ( apart from Lord Mandelson , whose best friends they all are ) hates the rich , to do this on the principle of spite .
One would even expect the Lib Dems to do it , for they stupidly feel there are votes in taking money from the " rich " , whom they suppose everybody who is not " rich " hates and envies .
Yet we also get it from the Conservative Party , not , we must suppose , for reasons of spite , but certainly because the focus groups ( those nurseries of grievance and envy ) beg for it and , as usual , for reasons of sheer economic illiteracy .
Thanks to everyone who participated in the Where are all the men bloggers ?
thread , and a big “ Welcome ” to those who are new here .
I ’ve just shut down comments on that thread because a ) the humour was getting a bit tired , and b ) we were starting to see an influx of people who did n’t realise it was satire .
Here ’s what ’s going on .
Over the years , there has been a regular refrain of Where are all the women bloggers ?
coming from men bloggers , especially in the political sphere but also in tech blogging , business blogging , science blogging , and so on .
Women make up slightly more than half of all bloggers .
Starting a blog is n’t hard and we blog in all those areas .
Yet somehow , men quite often do n’t notice .
The most recent iteration of this occurred a day or so back on Pollytics , an Australian political blog run by a guy who goes by the name “ Possum Comitatus ” .
Something that has surprised me for a while on the gender balance of the Australian political net is the lack of big female political bloggers .
We have Kim and Anna over at LP as a group blog , while Tigtog and Lauredhel at Hoyden touch on politics occasionally and do it well â€ ” but where are the dedicated Australian political bloggers of the likes of Wonkette or Pandagon that we see in the US ?
Letâ€™s do our bit to find them .
Know any female political bloggers in Australia ?
If so , drop a link in comments and weâ€™ll list them here â€ ” big or small , old or new – and hopefully give them some exposure .
If youâ€™re an Australian female political blogger , donâ€™t be shy – tell us about your blog .
I for one would like to see far more female political voices in Australiaâ€™s new media .
It was quickly taken up by the Australia political blog Hoyden About Town , and a lengthy discussion ensued on both blogs , in which many of the same points were hit on as in every .
single .
iteration . of this topic before .
That there are no ( or few ) women bloggers [ in that field ] .
That the ones who exist are not “ really ” bloggers [ in that field ] .
That if men do n’t read women ’s blogs , nobody does .
That the subject matter covered by women bloggers is not important , or “ frivolous ”
That the subjects that women blog about ( eg. disability ) are “ niche ” topics not of general interest .
That mixing subject matter on a blog makes it “ not count ” towards being a blog on that subject .
That only blogging that is similar in content and style to the mainstream media is valid .
That women must crave and appreciate the attention they get when men notice their blogs .
That essential differences between genders are the cause of women ( supposedly ) not blogging .
That women do n’t have time to blog because they are busy with housework and childcare .
That women who blog on certain platforms ( eg. Livejournal ) that are not “ really ” blogging or that other modes of communication ( eg. Facebook ) are less valid than blogs .
That women [ political ] bloggers are angry , bitchy , or whining and it ’s hard to read their words because of it .
Patronising responses to women who stand up to say that they blog : “ Ainâ €™t you a treat .
More power to you . ”
Theorising — in the face of actual research — that studies would show a preponderance of male bloggers .
That there are more important things to be discussing , in any case .
All the above arguments can be found in the posts ( and their comment threads ) linked above .
They are not new .
They ’ve been heard before , countless times , by women bloggers , and you ’ll notice that for the most part we were intentionally making the same comments — often exaggerated to the point of ludicracy — in our comments about men bloggers .
From my original post :
I wonder why there seem to be so few men blogging in these subject areas .
Is it just that they arenâ€™t interested ?
Do they not have time what with all the sports and drinking and porn ?
Maybe they donâ€™t feel up to handling tough subjects , or perhaps the conversational style is offputting to them ?
Liz chips in :
I try to keep an open mind , though .
From reading a few masculist bloggers
Iâ€™ve found that something called the â€œsecond shiftâ€ means that guys at home have to bear the burden of doing extra home maintenance work , chef-ing , and just plain being daddies .
So most guys donâ€™t have time to really go in depth to understand , well , important cultural references , and contribute anything substantial .
If you look past the shrill , scolding tone of those masculist bloggers , you can really learn something .
Just watch out you donâ€™t get your head bitten off .
Azz says :
I know what you mean !
Iâ€™ve been encouraging my best friend to start blogging for years , or at least get an account on one service or another and at least start reading , but he keeps saying itâ€™s not his thing and finally he said he just wouldnâ€™t be comfortable with that level of exposure so Iâ€™ve given it a rest .
Maybe itâ€™s just not a â€œman thingâ€ ?
And gchick added :
Itâ€™s their own fault , really .
If only theyâ€™d engage with the * real * blogosphere on dreamwidth or livejournal , instead of holding on to their blogger and wordpress instances the way they do , maybe people would take their posts a little more seriously .
Some of our other comments were satirical riffs on more common myths and misconceptions , or rhetorical practices that we see so often on the Internet when women are being discussed .
I think some of us were aiming for a full bingo card , actually .
At the same time , some of our male friends like whump , Tim , zornhau , Scott , and Danny joined in , playing along with their mirror - world roles .
But quite rapidly , as the link to the article started being tweeted and dented and linked to all over the place , we started to get people coming in who… did n’t realise it was satire .
We got some helpful folks linking us to tech blogs by men , letting us know ( for instance ) that a majority of the bloggers at O’Reilly Radar happened to be of that gender .
Then finally we got a comment from someone named Jon saying :
Frankly , every tech or politics blog * I* read is authored by a male , and I often wonder why women donâ€™t blog as muchâ€¦ maybe youâ€™re just in the wrong micro-cosm of tech / politics .
You women can have your fun gossiping about how much better it is to be a woman and how all studies show you communicate better , but while you have these conversations you completely miss the actual realities : studies might show that women are * innately * better at communicating * certain * subject matter .. most specifically , emotions .
Neither politics nor tech ( and frankly not even journalism in general ) should be a discussion that emotion takes part in , so itâ€™s sort of a moot point .
That was the point where we reached the ne plus ultra of why - don ’ t - i- notice - bloggers - who - are n ’t - like me discussions : a full circle , or perhaps a Moebius strip , of invisibility and gender essentialism , satirical criticism of same , and back again to where we started .
It seemed like the right time to put the thread to rest .
Please , now everyone ’s up to speed on the background and context , feel free to drop out of character and discuss .
If this is your first discussion on the subject , I would recommend reading Where are the women bloggers ? on the Geek Feminism Wiki as background before you dive in .
( CNN ) -- Police met a wayward jet that overshot the runway by 150 miles -- while not responding to control tower communications -- and said the pilots were " cooperative , apologetic and appreciative . "
Authorities are reviewing the plane 's cockpit voice recorder as well as its flight data recorder .
The Minneapolis- St. Paul [ Minnesota ]
Airport Police report on the incident , released Friday , said officers asked flight attendants to keep passengers in their seats while they checked out the cockpit , where , they said , " the door was standing open . "
The police report identified the pilot as Timothy B. Cheney and the first officer as Richard I. Cole .
" The pilot ... indicated they had become involved in conversation and had not heard radio communications , " the report said .
" They indicated there had been no involvement from anyone in the cabin . "
" Both volunteered to a preliminary breath test with the result being .000 for both parties , " the report said .
The lead flight attendant , the report said , told officers that she was unaware there had been an incident aboard .
Northwest Flight 188 -- carrying 144 people and five crew members -- flew past the Minneapolis airport during a mysterious 78 minutes of radio silence beginning about 7:56 p.m. ET Wednesday night .
The Airbus A320 was carrying 147 passengers and an unknown number of crew members , according to the National Transportation Safety Board .
Air traffic controllers re-established radio contact after the plane had flown about 150 miles past its destination .
Watch how Flight 188 drama unfolded »
The National Transportation Safety Board , which is investigating the incident , is hoping the plane 's cockpit voice recorder will either confirm the pilot 's account or provide evidence of another possible explanation , including whether the captain and first officer had fallen asleep .
However , approached outside his home Friday , the first officer told CNN affiliate KGW that " nobody was asleep in the cockpit and no arguments took place . "
Cole was referring to NTSB 's earlier statement that said , " The crew stated they were in a heated discussion over airline policy and they lost situational awareness . "
" There 's a lot of misinterpretation going on , " Cole said , though he refused to comment further .
The voice recorder is capable of recording only 30 minutes of audio , federal accident investigators said Friday .
The plane was in the air for another 45 minutes after radio contact was restored , meaning that if the recorder was working properly , anything the pilots would have said during the time they were not answering radio calls would have been recorded over .
But a former accident investigator told CNN the voice recorder may still provide valuable information , because the pilots could have discussed the earlier events on the way back to Minneapolis .
The separate flight data recorder also could prove valuable because it would have recorded actions taken by the pilots during the 78 minutes they did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers , the former accident investigator said .
The safety board said Friday afternoon that experts were reviewing the solid - state voice recorder .
It said only that the recorder " captured a portion of the flight that is being analyzed , " and added there would be no further comment .
Watch as former NTSB official calls long silence " unacceptable " »
Meanwhile , the North American Aerospace Defense Command , which scrambled fighter jets for the wayward plane did not launch them , said it was reviewing procedures for launching the fighters to track potentially hijacked or suspicious aircraft .
At issue , according to a senior U.S. official directly familiar with the timeline of the incident , is the FAA 's apparent delay in notifying NORAD that the Northwest jet was not in contact with controllers .
The official , who declined to be identified because both the military and the FAA are reviewing the entire incident , said that the FAA 's request for military involvement came after the plane passed the Minneapolis airport .
NORAD scrambled fighter jets at two locations .
But as they approached the runway for takeoff , the FAA reported being back in contact with the Northwest flight , and the fighters stayed on the ground .
" My real question is why we did not know of the ' radio out ' situation from the FAA sooner , " the officials said .
" The FAA is also looking into that , " the official told CNN .
Since the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , NORAD has regularly launched fighter jets to track aircraft in unusual situations such as when they deviate from flight plans , lose radio contact or enter restricted airspace .
According to a second U.S. official , NORAD is in constant contact with the FAA so it can respond when situations arise .
Reported instances of two pilots falling asleep are rare .
In August , the safety board concluded its investigation into a February 13 , 2008 , incident in which two pilots aboard a Go airlines flight fell asleep and traveled 26 miles beyond the destination of Hilo , Hawaii , before waking and contacting air traffic controllers .
Northwest Airlines is part of Delta Air Lines , which issued a statement Thursday , saying it is " cooperating with the FAA and NTSB in their investigation , as well as conducting our own internal investigation .
The pilots have been relieved from active flying pending the completion of these investigations . "
It said Flight 188 landed safely in Minneapolis just after 9 p.m .
Delta suffered another major embarrassment this week when a Delta pilot landed a passenger jet on a taxiway at Atlanta - Hartsfield International Airport instead of the runway .
The NTSB is investigating that case as well .
CNN 's Mike M. Ahlers and Barbara Starr contributed to this report .

CONGRESS and President Barack Obama return to work in Washington on September 8th , after Labour Day .
But a summer of golfing has done nothing to improve the nation 's political temper .
Democrats and Republicans are in the throes of one of their periodic shouting matches about who is to blame for the gridlock on Capitol Hill and , more broadly , about the merits and flaws of bipartisanship .
“ Now more than ever , ” yelled a representative recent headline on salon.com , an online magazine , “ bipartisanship is for suckers . ”
Stoking the liberal side of this debate is Congress 's failure to make progress on health - care reform .
A cacophony of voices is urging Mr Obama to stop seeking compromise with the Republicans , which seems wasted effort , and use Democratic votes alone to ram his flagship domestic project through Congress .
It is not just the netroots who are up in arms : on August 30th an editorial in the New York Times concluded “ with considerable regret ” that the ideological split between the parties was too wide to bridge .
The White House is signalling impatience too .
Mr Obama 's press spokesman , Robert Gibbs , complained this week that Mike Enzi of Wyoming , one of the three Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee who are supposed to be hammering out a compromise on health with three Democrats in Senator Max Baucus 's “ gang of six ” , had “ turned over his cards on bipartisanship ” and walked away .
Mr Gibbs was responding to a radio broadcast in which Mr Enzi had excoriated the Democrats ' reform plans .
If Mr Gibbs is right , the outlook for bipartisan reform has indeed darkened .
The “ gang of six ” had seemed the likeliest forum to produce a bill that might attract cross-party support in the Senate .
For the moment , however , Mr Obama gives no hint of abandoning his ( stated ) preference for bipartisan lawmaking on health , climate change and other matters .
This dispirits those Democrats who yearned , after eight years of George Bush , for audacious change .
These loyalists are dismayed by Mr Obama 's recent softening of his insistence that any health reform must include a “ public option ” ( under which private insurers would face competition from a government - run scheme ) .
But Mr Obama 's retreat on this suggests that he is not yet convinced by the notion of driving through controversial legislation on Democratic votes alone , even if he could overcome the doubts of the Democrats ' own fiscal conservatives .
Weighty calculations of principle , presentation and practical politics lean the other way .
The principle at stake is not only the promise Mr Obama made at his inauguration to transcend “ petty grievances ” and “ worn - out dogmas ” .
Almost every president says something like that .
A long - established idea in American politics also holds that big laws — the sort that alter the face of the country — are likelier to endure if they collect support from both parties .
That was the thinking behind great bipartisan measures such as the creation of Social Security in 1935 and of Medicare in 1965 , the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and — in 1986 — the tax reform engineered by Ronald Reagan and his ideological opposite , Speaker Tip O'Neill .
Mr Obama says he wants to stop America from being bankrupted by health bills and the planet from frying .
Those are causes big enough to make it worth travelling the extra mile to sign up the other party , which will one day return to government .
As for presentation , America has just buried Ted Kennedy , lionised now in a thousand editorials for having been , among other virtuous things , a shining exemplar of bipartisanship .
Americans seemed to admire a senator whose firm stand on the left of the Democratic Party did not stop him from making Republican friends and cutting bargains with them in order to make laws — a talent that persuaded a veteran conservative pundit , George Will , to declare him the most consequential Kennedy brother .
After a summer of ugly tribal arguments in town - hall meetings on health care , politicians may feel the need to pay lip service , at least , to the idea of bipartisanship .
And yet in the Washington think - tanks the passing of Ted Kennedy has revived a different debate .
Is bipartisanship still feasible in today 's America ?
Is it even desirable ?
Pietro Nivola , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , has doubts on both counts .
Grand bargains are harder in an age when both parties , but especially the Republicans , have become more ideological and cohesive .
Congress no longer contains legions of conservative Democrats from the South or moderate Republicans from the north - east willing to make common cause — or laws .
The gerrymandering of electoral districts has slashed the number of swing seats , forcing candidates to nurture their wild - eyed base , rather than reach out to moderates , to win their primaries .
Religious polarisation has sharpened the gap between the parties , sucking believers into the Republican camp and driving the secular to the Democrats .
During the raucous fight over health care , Democrats have affected particular indignation over the remark in July of a Republican senator , Jim DeMint of South Carolina , that “ if we 're able to stop Obama on this , it will be his Waterloo .
It will break him . ”
How very non-bipartisan .
And yet nothing could be more natural than for an opposition to scheme to thwart the governing party .
Mr Nivola argues that rather than wringing their hands , Americans should welcome the fact that their parties have become aggressively opposed .
“ As in Europe , ” he says , “ the majority rules and the minority has to bide its time . ”
This produces clearer choices for voters and makes it easier to hold governments to account .
Nothing wrong with that .
Unless , perhaps , you are the one who is going to be held to account .
As anxious Democrats resume work next week , even his allies admit that Mr Obama has had a torrid summer .
His approval rating has fallen from about 70 % at the time of his inauguration to around 50 % .
Independents in particular seem to be losing faith .
Health - care reform has taken a bashing .
By mid-August only 46 % of Americans approved of Mr Obama 's handling of it , down from 57 % at the end of April .
Americans understandably doubt whether any of the bills before Congress can cut costs and extend coverage at the same time .
If health reform fails , energy legislation will falter too .
These are not circumstances in which Mr Obama will rush to heed the advice of those who want the Democrats to go it alone .
White House aides say only that when the president returns to work he will be “ very active ” .
He is scheduled to address a joint session of Congress on health care next Wednesday .
As for the public option , it seems that he will still not insist on it if that puts off Republicans .
Besides , if there is comfort for the president in the polls , it is last month 's finding by the Pew Research Centre that a growing proportion of Americans ( 29 % ) blame the Republican leadership rather than Mr Obama ( 17 % ) for their failure to work together .
If nothing else , bipartisanship has always been an excellent way for presidents to spread the blame in case things go wrong .
It is difficult to obtain documents if no parent can vouch for your identity Two South African officials have been suspended in connection with the suicide of Skhumbuzo Mhlongo .
The 22 year old committed suicide after being refused the identity documents he needed to start a job on Monday .
Home Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini - Zuma announced the suspensions at the man 's funeral , where she was addressing mourners .
The minister broke down in tears before journalists earlier this week when she was telling them about the case .
In his suicide note , Mr Mhlongo explained how an official had torn up his ID application , calling him a foreigner .
The minister said she suspected an official had expected a bribe .
Disciplinary hearing Ms Dlamini - Zuma 's spokesperson told the BBC that she wants the matter " to be resolved as soon as possible " .
" The officials have been suspended with immediate effect , " Ronnie Mamoepa said .
" They will be appearing before a disciplinary hearing soon , " he told the BBC .
Mrs Dlamini - Zuma said South Africans had the right to high quality service and should not be driven to such drastic acts to make their voices heard .
The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says the Department of Home Affairs has come under heavy criticism over the years for its inefficiency in issuing ID documents , birth certificates and passports , with some people claiming to have waited up to four years .
She points out it would be even more difficult to obtain the documents if you have no parents to vouch for your identity .
In response to the case , the Department of Home Affairs has set up a hotline for people to register complaints about its civil servants : 0800 - 2044 - 76 .
The line , which did not work when the BBC tried it on Monday , is now accepting calls .
Sibling carer Mr Mhlongo , who was buried in Hillcrest near Durban in Kwa - Zulu Natal Province , had been due to start the new job at a factory which manufactures bird food on Monday .
Mr Mamoepa said the Department of Social Development assisted the family with the burial arrangements .
Mr Mhlongo had been raised by his mother , who disappeared in 2000 , leaving him to care for his younger siblings .
He had apparently been trying to get an ID card for some time without any luck and had been told to bring someone who could vouch for his nationality .
But the official did not believe that the man he brought along was his father , tore up Mr Mhlongo 's papers and called him a " kwere - kwere " - a derogatory term used for foreign nationals .
He apparently left the suicide note before hanging himself .

June 2003 : Al Franken sends the following satirical letter to then Attorney General John Ashcroft and 27 other Republicans .
In the letter , written on Harvard University letterhead , Franken requests abstinence - related stories for a ( non-existent ) book he ’s writing entitled ‘ Savin ’ It ! ’ and claims to have already received responses from a selection of prominent figures .
Just a month later , Franken would send a written apology to Ashcroft .
6 years later , July 2009 , Franken would become a U.S. Senator .

Dear Attorney General Ashcroft ,
I am currently a Fellow at Harvard ’s Kennedy School of Government , where I am working on a book about abstinence programs in our public schools entitled Savin ’
It !
In this day of rampant immorality , unwanted pregnancies , and dangerous sexual diseases , Savin ’
It ! will document how the Bush Administration is championing abstinence programs and setting the right example for America ’s youth .
The book ’s fourth chapter , “ Role Modelin ’ It ! ” , will feature the personal stories of abstinence heroes for our nation ’s young people to emulate .
Is n’t it about time for our young people to have a chance to look up to leaders who truly walked the walk — instead of just talking the talk — by not having sex until they were married ?
I would very much appreciate it if you could share your abstinence story .
So far , I have received wonderful testimonies from HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson , William J. Bennett , White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer , Senator Rick Santorum , and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice .
( I ’m still hoping to hear back from the President ! )
I have found the kids respond best to total honesty .
Do n’t be afraid to share a moment when you were tempted to have sex , but were able to overcome your urges through willpower and strength of character .
Be funny !
Did a young woman ever think you were homosexual just because you would n’t have sex with her ?
Be serious !
Were you ever taunted and made to feel bad or “ uncool ” because of your choice ?
But most of all , be real .
Kids can sense a phony a mile away .
I can tell by your passionate advocacy of abstinence education that you will have a lot to offer this book .
Thank you for considering my project .
I hope you can find time to inspire the next generation of sex - free leaders .
Sincerely ,
( Signed )

Human overpopulation is an animal rights issue as well as an environmental issue and a human rights issue .
Human activities , including mining , transportation , pollution , agriculture , development , and logging , take habitat away from wild animals as well as kill animals directly .
These activities also contribute to climate change , which threatens even the most remote wild habitats on this planet and our own survival .
According to a survey of the faculty at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in April of 2009 , overpopulation is the world 's worst environmental problem .
Dr. Charles A . Hall went so far as to say , “ Overpopulation is the only problem . ”
Definition
Overpopulation occurs when a population has exceeded its carrying capacity .
Carrying capacity is the maximum number of individuals of a species that can exist in a habitat indefinitely without threatening other species in that habitat .
It would be difficult to argue that humans are not threatening other species .
Current Estimates and Projections
According to the U.S. Census , there were six billion people in the world in 1999 .
On October 31 , 2011 , we hit seven billion .
Although growth is slowing , our population continues to grow and will reach nine billion by 2048 .
Paul Ehrlich and Anne Ehrlich , authors of “ The Population Explosion , ” explain :
The entire planet and virtually every nation is already vastly overpopulated .
Africa is overpopulated now because , among other indications , its soils and forests are rapidly being depleted — and that implies that its carrying capacity for human beings will be lower in the future than it is now .
The United States is overpopulated because it is depleting its soil and water resources and contributing mightily to the destruction of global environmental systems .
Europe , Japan , the Soviet Union , and other rich nations are overpopulated because of their massive contributions to the carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere , among many other reasons .
More than 80 % of the world ’s old growth forests have been destroyed , wetlands are being drained for real estate development , and demands for biofuels take much - needed arable land away from crop production .
Life on earth is currently experiencing its sixth major extinction , and we are losing an estimated 30,000 species per year .
The most famous major extinction was the fifth one , which occurred about 65 million years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs .
The major extinction that we are now facing is the first that is caused not by an asteroid collision or other natural causes , but by a single species — humans .
Effects of Conservation
Consuming less may be a way for us to live within the carrying capacity of the planet , but as Paul Ehrlich and Anne Ehrlich explain , “ Overpopulation is defined by the animals that occupy the turf , behaving as they naturally behave , not by a hypothetical group that might be substituted for them . ”
We should not use the hope or the plan to reduce our consumption as an argument that humans are not overpopulated .
While reducing our consumption is important , worldwide , per capita energy consumption increased from 1990 to 2005 , so the trend does not look good .
Lesson from Easter Island
The effects of human overpopulation have been documented in the history of Easter Island , where a human population with finite resources was nearly wiped out when their consumption increased beyond what the island could sustain .
An island once lush with diverse plant and animal species and fertile volcanic soil became nearly uninhabitable 1,300 years later .
The population peak on the island has been estimated between 7,000 and 20,000 people .
Trees were cut down for firewood , canoes , and wooden sleds for transporting the carved stone heads for which the island is known .
Because of deforestation , the islanders lacked the resources necessary to make ropes and seaworthy canoes .
Fishing from shore was not as effective as fishing out on the ocean .
Also , without canoes , the Islanders had nowhere to go .
They wiped out sea birds , land birds , lizards , and snails .
Deforestation also led to erosion , which made it difficult to grow crops .
Without adequate food , the population crashed .
A rich and complex society that erected now - iconic stone monuments was reduced to living in caves and resorted to cannibalism .
How did they let this happen ?
Author Jared Diamond speculates
The forest the islanders depended on for rollers and rope did n't simply disappear one day - it vanished slowly , over decades ...
In the meantime , any islander who tried to warn about the dangers of progressive deforestation would have been overridden by vested interests of carvers , bureaucrats , and chiefs , whose jobs depended on continued deforestation .
Our Pacific
Northwest loggers are only the latest in a long line of loggers to cry , " Jobs over trees ! "
Potential Solutions
The situation is urgent .
Lester Brown , President of Worldwatch , stated in 1998 , " The question is not whether population growth will slow in the developing countries , but whether it will slow because societies quickly shift to smaller families or because ecological collapse and social disintegration caused death rates to rise . "
The most important thing we as individuals can do is choose to have fewer children .
While cutting back on your personal consumption of resources is laudable and may reduce your environmental footprint by 5 % , 25 % , or maybe even 50 % , having a child will double your footprint , and having two children will triple your footprint .
It is virtually impossible to compensate for reproducing by consuming less yourself .
Although most of the population growth over the next few decades will take place in Asia and Africa , global overpopulation is as much a problem for “ developed ” countries as it is for third world countries .
Americans constitute only five percent of the world ’s population , but consume 26 % of the world ’s energy .
Because we consume so much more than most people around the world , we can have the most impact when we choose to have fewer children or no children .
Internationally , the United Nations Population Fund works for gender equality , access to birth control , and the education of women .
According to the UNFPA , “ Some 200 million women who would like to use contraceptives lack access to them . ”
Women should be educated not only about family planning but also generally .
World Watch has found , “ In every society where data are available , the more education women have the fewer children they bear . ”
Similarly , the Center for Biological Diversity campaigns for " the empowerment of women , education of all people , universal access to birth control and a societal commitment to ensuring that all species are given a chance to live and thrive . "
Additionally , raising public awareness is essential .
While many environmental organizations focus on small steps with which few can disagree , the topic of human overpopulation is much more controversial .
Some claim that there is no problem , while others might see it as solely a third world problem .
As with any other animal rights issue , raising public awareness will empower individuals to make informed choices .
Potential Human Rights Violations
The solution to human overpopulation cannot include human rights violations .
China ’s one - child policy , though arguably successful in curbing population growth , has led to human rights violations ranging from forced sterilizations to forced abortions and infanticide .
Some population control proponents advocate offering financial incentives for people not to reproduce , but this incentive would target the poorest segment of society , resulting in racially and economically disproportionate population control .
These unjust results cannot be part of a viable solution to human overpopulation .
The mother of one of the two Columbine HS teen killers is publicly speaking in detail about the massacre for the first time — and says she had “ no inkling ” that her son was suicidal until she read his journals .
“ When I first saw copied pages of these writings , they broke my heart , ” Susan Klebold writes in an essay for an upcoming issue of Oprah Winfrey ’s “ O ” magazine .
“ I ’d had no inkling of the battle Dylan was waging in his mind . ”
Learning that her son was at the center of the April 1999 carnage , in which he and pal Eric Harris killed 12 students and a teacher before committing suicide , “ changed everything , ” she says .
“ For the rest of my life , I will be haunted by the horror and anguish Dylan caused , ” she writes .
“ I can not look at a child in a grocery store or on the street without thinking about how my son ’s schoolmates spent the last moments of their lives . ”
She adds that “ Dylan changed everything I believed about myself , about God , about family and about love . ”
In recalling that day , she notes that Dylan left their Littleton , Colo. , house about 20 minutes early , leaving her confused .
“ All he said was ‘ Bye , ’ ” she writes .
“ The front door slammed , and his car sped down the driveway .
“ His voice had sounded sharp .
I figured he was mad because he had to get up early to give someone a lift to class . ”

Filmmaker Michael Moore told Democrats to get on board with President Barack Obama 's call for health care reform or else .
| REUTERS
Moore : ' We will work against you '
Controversial liberal filmmaker Michael Moore on Tuesday issued a warning to Democrats who have been cool to President Barack Obama ’s call for meaningful health care reform :
Get on board or prepare to lose your seat .
“ To the Democrats in Congress who do n’t quite get it : I want to offer a personal pledge .
I – and a lot of other people – have every intention of removing you from Congress in the next election if you stand in the way of health care legislation that the people want , ” Moore told supporters of women ’s groups and unions gathered at the headquarters of the government watchdog group Public Citizen .
“ That is not a hollow or idle threat .
We will come to your district and we will work against you , first in the primary and , if we have to , in the general election . ”

Democrats have started to take for granted the support of women , unions and low - income workers , according to Moore , who is promoting “ Capitalism : A Love Story , ” a documentary about the financial collapse due for wide release Friday .
“ You think that we ’re just going to go along with you because you ’re Democrats ?
You should think again , ” he told the Tuesday crowd in a speech that was carried to members of the media dialed into a conference call .
“ Because we ’ll find Republicans who are smart enough to realize that the majority of Americans want universal healthcare .
That ’s right .
That ’s absolutely right .
Do n’t take this for granted . ”
Moore issued a not - so - veiled warning to Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and an opponent of the so - called public option , though not by name , asserting that his movie could be a rallying point for people across the country – including in Montana – to work to defeat Democrats who opposed the public option .
“ You ’ve made a serious mistake , ” he warned Baucus .
Moore also called out Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , who supports the public option , but whose role in financial regulation as chairman of the Senate banking committee comes in for criticism in “ Capitalism . ”
Speaking to Public Citizen , Moore said , “ we ’re going to lose this seat unless we run another Democrat ” and said he ’d “ already received a phone call from a well known Democrat to tell me to back off Sen. Dodd . ”
Liberal groups have already targeted conservative Democrats who oppose the public option and other Obama initiatives and it ’s unclear if Moore plans to join forces with them or launch his own effort .
He said he hoped , though , that “ Capitalism ” will prompt “ even more political participation from people who realize that they can’t just sit it out .
They ca n’t sit on the bench for this one . ”
“ When the majority use this film to organize with , get active with , get involved , ” Moore predicted , “ it will make what happened at those town hall meetings in August look like a Disney film . ”
“ Somebody – somebodies – have to light the spark .
That ’s why we ’re all here today . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
The statin drugs that so effectively lower people ’s cholesterol levels may be contributing to a social divide in the problem of high cholesterol , a new study suggests .
Using government survey data from 1976 to 2004 , researchers found that after statin drugs were introduced , wealthier Americans saw a sharp reduction in their average cholesterol levels -- double the decline among low - income Americans .
The result , the researchers say , has been a flip in the relationship between income and cholesterol .
In the late 1970s , higher - income Americans generally had higher cholesterol , whereas now poorer Americans have the highest levels .
“ Back in the day , wealthier people had higher cholesterol because they were better able to afford a higher - fat diet -- more red meat , butter , eggs , ” said lead researcher Dr. Virginia W. Chang , of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia .
But they also had better access to statins once they were introduced in the late 1980s .
Chang and colleague Diane S. Lauderdale found that the higher a person ’s income in 1988 or beyond , the greater the likelihood of being put on a statin .
The wealthiest group of Americans , for example , was 70 percent more likely to be taking one of the drugs than the poorest group .
At the same time , overall cholesterol levels in the general population dropped , but wealthier Americans saw a much greater decline .
The findings do not prove that statin use caused the shift , according to Chang .
“ But they do support the idea that statins are partly responsible , ” she said .
The results , published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior , are based on three waves of nationwide government health survey , done between 1976 and 1980 , 1988 and 1994 , and 1999 and 2004 .
From the first survey to the last , the prevalence of high cholesterol among women dropped from 28 percent to 17 percent , while men saw their rate decline from 25 percent to 17 percent .
But while average cholesterol levels tended to decline along with income in the late 1970s , the reverse was true by the latest survey .
Statins have helped people at all income levels , Chang pointed out .
“ Everyone ’s cholesterol has gone down , ” she said .
“ But in the process , we may have made economic disparities worse . ”
It ’s likely , according to Chang , that cost is a key factor , as statins are typically more expensive than , for example , blood pressure drugs .
If that ’s the case , she said , then the patterns seen in this study could change as more generic versions of statins become available , which would presumably bring costs down .
In fact , inexpensive medications have the potential to do more for lower - income people than for those with higher incomes , Chang said .
That ’s because the other major way to bring down cholesterol -- lifestyle change -- is often much more difficult for poorer Americans , who may not be able to buy more fresh fruits and vegetables , for example , or find the time or place for regular exercise .
“ Statins do have the potential to help level the playing field , ” Chang said .

NEW YORK ( AdAge.com ) -- A Delaware firm has filed a lawsuit against JWT and parent WPP , claiming the ad agency stole its patented product - placement concept to use in a campaign for Bing , the new search engine from Microsoft .
Denizen , which calls itself an " innovator in advertising " for its method of " program - integrated advertisement , " says in its suit that starting in 2002 it was in contact with London - based WPP and top executives at the holding company such as Mark Read and Peter Tortorici to discuss possible business ventures , including partnerships with WPP 's media agencies .
Those talks fell through in late 2006 , but Denizen said it had entered into a confidentiality agreement with WPP .
The company is now alleging that WPP breached the confidentiality agreement and that JWT stole Denizen 's technique of blending a TV show 's content and characters into advertising , in this case for NBC's " The Philanthropist . "
Commercials for Bing were filmed on - set using actors from the show , which made its debut this summer and stars James Purefoy and Neve Campbell .
The Bing - themed ads appeared between the TV programming and regular commercial breaks .
Microsoft called on JWT to handle the estimated $ 100 million Bing ad account earlier this year as part of the software giant 's quest to gain market share from search behemoth Google .
" WPP intends to solicit customers by continuing to use Denizen 's proprietary , trade secret information to solicit customers for WPP and its affiliates , " the company wrote in its complaint , which was filed in a Delaware court and names JWT and WPP as defendants .
Denizen says the ad agency and holding company not only stole its trade secrets for creating integrated ads -- which include strategies for obtaining Screen Actors Guild contracts , methods for gaining access or rights to TV program content and ways to shoot the ads -- but also made them publicly known due to the number of parties involved in the Bing campaign .

BEIRUT , Lebanon , Sept. 21 ( UPI ) --
Hezbollah will never reach peace with Israel or recognize its right to exist , said Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah .
Nasrallah in a speech intended for the Palestinian people said the territories do not belong to " the Zionist entity ( Israel ) , " stressing the Arab and Islamic communities should stand together in the face of the " Israeli enemy , " Hezbollah 's al - Manar news agency reports .

He went on to say that Hezbollah would never make peace with Israel , nor recognize its right to exist .
" We will never make peace with it even if the international community demands it , " he said .
" We will not recognize Israel , neither succumb to it , and we will not normalize or make peace with this malignant cell that should be terminated , even if the whole world recognizes its existence . "
His comments come on the heels of a religious edict from Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah , a leading Hezbollah - backed cleric , declaring normalization of ties with Israel runs counter to Islamic law .
" The normalization of ties with the Zionist enemy in any form is prohibited by Shariah ( Islamic law ) , " the cleric said .
Washington called on Arab states to improve their relationship with Israel , while urging the Israeli government to halt its settlement activity in the West Bank as part of an effort to kick - start the Israeli - Palestinian peace process .

Nearly 10,000 working parents will lose their health insurance this month in the wake of state budget cuts , leaving some families with nowhere to turn as they seek affordable coverage .
KidsCare Parents , a program that provides low - income families with inexpensive insurance , will end Sept. 30 .
The Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System , which administers the program , could not pay the $ 6 million annual cost following cuts by the Legislature .
The state faces a $ 3 billion budget shortfall .
The move comes as demand for government assistance is skyrocketing .
Arizona has lost an estimated 240,000 jobs since December 2007 , and AHCCCS has added 150,000 people to its rolls since January .
" It 's always difficult to make a decision like this , " said Monica Coury , an AHCCCS spokeswoman .
" But , on the other hand , there 's a broad recognition that the state is in a fiscal crisis , and difficult decisions are being made across the board . "
Families received letters last week , informing them that parents will have no insurance as of Oct.
1 . Children covered by KidsCare will keep their health insurance .
The news came as a shock to program member Don Dowling , a Gilbert resident who had surgery scheduled on Oct. 15 to remove his kidney stones .
Dowling has been scrambling to get his surgery rescheduled for this month .
Otherwise , he said , he will not be able to pay the estimated $ 10,000 cost .
" All the things they could cut out , and they 're going to cut out insurance on people who actually need it , who have pre-existing conditions that are very serious , " said Dowling , 33 .
" Are you kidding me ? "
KidsCare Parents began in 2003 as an extension of the federal State Children 's Health Insurance Program , called KidsCare in Arizona .
To be eligible for coverage , families had to make less than two times the federal poverty level , or about $ 44,000 a year for a family of four .
For a $ 6 million annual contribution , Arizona received $ 18 million in federal grants to administer the program for parents .
Patient premiums , which were set at 3 to 4 percent of monthly income , covered the rest .
The parents ' program was a boon to families like the Dowlings , who were told they made $ 40 a month too much to be eligible for AHCCCS .
Dowling moved here from Colorado with his family three years ago to take a job in the real - estate industry and later took a sales job at American Express .
The company laid him off in December as part of cost - cutting measures , and Dowling has been looking for work ever since .
The family 's sole source of income is Dowling 's wife , Danielle Smith , who works about 32 hours a week at a day - care center .
Dowling and Smith are raising two girls , ages 8 and 3 .
" When I read that letter that they were going to cancel it , I just did n't know what to do , " Smith said .
" We 're already worried about what money we have for groceries this week . "
Families affected by the program 's end will have trouble finding similar care they can afford , advocates said .
" The impact is devastation , " said Dana Naimark , president of the Children 's Action Alliance , a Phoenix non-profit that advocates for social services .
" Parents are making desperate phone calls to anywhere they can think of , and the problem is there are almost no alternatives for them . "
AHCCCS recommends that families without health insurance seek care at community health centers , which provide basic care on a sliding - fee scale .
But those centers have also lost state funding , advocates said , and some are being stretched to the breaking point .
The centers also can't provide the more specialized care needed by many people enrolled in KidsCare Parents .
Susan Stewart has a nodule on her lung that requires regular monitoring to ensure it does not become cancerous .
The Gilbert resident can't afford the limited insurance offered by her job at a company that provides legal - support services , and her pre-existing condition has prevented her from getting private coverage .
KidsCare Parents gave Stewart affordable coverage that allowed her peace of mind as she raises her 12 - year - old son , Taylor , who has a serious heart condition .
Now , she is considering taking a pay cut so that she can qualify for AHCCCS .
" I do n't want to sit at home and collect from the state , " Stewart said .
" But , sometimes , you 're forced to do things for your kids that you would n't normally do . "
Gov. Jan Brewer is " just devastated " by the end of the parents ' program , spokesman Paul Senseman said .
" We 're talking about real cuts to working families who are not looking for a handout but a hand up , " he said .
Brewer fought to protect KidsCare from cuts , Senseman said , but was unable to protect funding for the parents ' program , considering the size of the budget shortfall and legislative opposition to raising taxes .
Now , Brewer is concerned that KidsCare , which serves more than 50,000 children , could be cut in upcoming fiscal 2010 - 11 budget negotiations .
Brewer has advocated referring a temporary sales tax to the ballot to preserve funding for education , public safety and social services .
" It 's just heartbreaking to see that , without additional revenues , these kind of cuts are going to happen , " Senseman said .
Dave N. : Hoo boy .
On Fox and Friends this morning , Glenn Beck was in prime form :
Beck :
This president has exposed himself as a guy , over and over and over again , who has a deep - seated hatred for white people , or the white culture , I do n't know what it is .
Hmmm .
That must have made things real uncomfortable around his white mother , or the white grandparents who raised him .
Beck ran a similar line on his show yesterday , too , characterizing Obama as " this is a guy who has real problems with race . "

Dollar devaluation and the working class
13 October 2009
There are growing signs of a major shift in world currency alignments .
Since March , the US dollar has steadily declined , depreciating by 13.3 percent on a trade - weighted basis .
Last week the decline accelerated , driving gold prices to record levels and prompting a number of Asian central banks to intervene on currency markets to slow the dollar ’s fall .
Rather than warning of the implications of this erosion in the value of the world ’s major trading and reserve currency , prominent financial publications and economic commentators are arguing that the trend should be welcomed and the long - term value of the dollar should be allowed to fall further .
On Saturday , the Financial Times of London published an editorial entitled “ A Strong US Needs a Weakened Dollar . ”
The newspaper wrote that “ this fall in value , while large , should neither be feared nor obstructed . …
It would actually be rather helpful if the dollar were to weaken further … the effect of a cheaper dollar would be to help American exporters while making imports to the US dearer .
“ This is what America — and the world — needs .
In the medium term , as Mr. Summers [ Obama ’s top economic adviser Lawrence Summers ] put it earlier this year , ‘ the rebuilt American economy must be more export - oriented and less consumption - oriented . ’
In short , the US must start living within its means , and the rest of the world must stop relying on its profligacy . ”
Monday ’s Financial Times carries a piece by economic columnist Wolfgang Münchau headlined “ Making the Case for a Weaker Dollar . ”
He advocates a rebalancing of the world economy in which the massive US current account deficit would be sharply reduced , the Asian surplus would be pared down , and the 16 - nation eurozone deficit would grow “ somewhat larger . ”
“ In the long run , ” he writes , “ such a world would require significant reform of the international monetary system .
In the short term , a fall in the dollar ’s exchange rate would help get us there . ”
He suggests that the “ strong - dollar pledges ” by US officials are disingenuous and the US is encouraging a further decline in the dollar as part of an export - led recovery strategy .
Münchau goes on to say that the necessary long - term reform of the international monetary system involves a permanently reduced global role for the dollar .
He predicts that the world is moving toward a “ dual system in which the dollar and the euro act as the world ’s de facto reserve currencies . ”
These and similar commentaries evade the immense risks that would inevitably accompany a permanent devaluation of the dollar and dilution of its reserve currency status .
Such a project contains the seeds of a breakup of the world market .
The assumption that this change could be carried out in an orderly manner , without sparking competitive devaluations by Europe and Asia , the formation of currency and trade blocs , the eruption of trade war and , ultimately , military conflict between the major powers , is highly dubious .
Among the most shallow commentaries in favor of a weaker dollar is that provided by US economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman .
In an op - ed piece published Monday , he dismisses those who worry about the long - term implications of the decline of the dollar as little more than cranks .
Without considering the international implications of a continued fall in the dollar , or its consequences for social relations within the US , he says of the “ current uproar ” over the declining dollar : “ The truth is that the falling dollar is good news . ”
A lower dollar is “ good for US exporters , ” Krugman writes , “ helping us make a transition away from huge trade deficits to a more sustainable international position . ”
He argues for leaving the benchmark interest rate , now effectively at zero , “ on hold for the next two years or more . ”
He says nothing about the consequences of a depreciating dollar for the US currency ’s status as the world reserve currency .
What is certain is that the loss of the dollar ’s status as the unchallenged world reserve currency has devastating implications for the American working class .
A strong and stable dollar was the bedrock of the international capitalist monetary system that was established at the Bretton Woods conference at end of World War II .
The dollar has served for nearly seven decades as the world ’s supreme trading and reserve currency .
The unique and privileged position of the dollar — which brought with it immense advantages for US capital — was based on the unchallenged economic supremacy of the US at the end of the war .
That , in turn , was founded on the global dominance of American industry .
The long - term decline of American capitalism , reflected most importantly in the decay of its industrial base , resulted in the massive global imbalances between debtor nations — first and foremost , the US — and creditor nations , such as China , Japan and Germany , which led to the implosion of the world economy a year ago .
It is the transformation of the US from the industrial powerhouse of the world to the center of global financial speculation and parasitism that , in the final analysis , underlies the erosion in the international position of the dollar .
To allow the dollar to continue to fall is to acknowledge the reality of America ’s decline and the necessity for world capitalism to find a new basis for growth .
At the heart of such a global economic “ rebalancing ” is a fundamental restructuring of class relations within the United States .
The Bretton Woods framework gave the American bourgeoisie a huge advantage in managing social relations within the US .
The US ruling class could utilize deficit spending and inflationary policies to make concessions to the demands of the working class because the world accepted the dollar regardless .
Without that advantage , the US must adhere to onerous fiscal and monetary restraints , the burden of which is to be placed on the working class .
This process is already well underway .
In the name of global economic rebalancing and reform at home , the Obama administration is seeking to cut the consumption of the working class , slash production costs and drive up US exports .
This amounts to subjecting American workers to the type of economic “ shock therapy ” that the US - dominated International Monetary Fund has prescribed for a host of indebted Third World countries over the past quarter century .
Currency devaluation , accompanied by cuts in state expenditure for social services and the use of mass unemployment to drive down wages and increase exploitation — these are the methods that are now being employed against the American working class .
The process by which the US closed down its manufacturing facilities and farmed out production to cheap labor havens around the world — which produced the unsustainable reliance of the US on infusions of credit from surplus nations such as China and Japan — is to be reversed .
Industry in the US is to be revived , but on the basis of the destruction of the wages , working conditions and living standards of the working class .
The US is to become a low - cost producer of goods for the world market .
The American working class is to experience levels of exploitation which it has n’t faced in a century .
Its wages and living standards are to be brought more closely in line with those faced by the super - exploited workers of Asia .
This policy of class war underlies Obama ’s assault on the jobs and wages of auto workers , his refusal to provide aid to bankrupt states and localities , and his drive to gut health care benefits for workers and attack entitlement programs , beginning with Medicare .
America will once again set an example for world capitalism — by serving as the model for similar attacks on the workers of every country .
The working class of the United States , however , has no intention of submitting to its own impoverishment .
The stage is being set for a revival of the class struggle in the US and internationally on a colossal scale .

I attended all talks except for one ( RacerPro ) because I had to get a shot of coffee and some fresh air .
This was due to my physical state at that time and is n't meant as a slight against the talk .
AFAIK , the ECLM 2009 did n't have an official theme but if there was one recurrent theme it had to be multi-processing / distributed computing in Common Lisp .
I 'd say in at least four of the seven speeches it was an important of not the main theme of the talk while in another talk it was at least of some relevance .
Here are my impressions from memory since I do n't have my notes near me .
I will skip the lightning talks for this post .
Perhaps someone else will review them .
A good talk to start off the ECLM with .
Basically a talk about the systems they 've built at ITA Software , which CL implementations they use and why , what other languages besides CL are used there and in what systems ( and why ) and their software building practices ( code reviews , do n't leave home without them ! ) .
Also lots of information on how they 're working with the different open source CL implementations they use on fixing bugs and adding features .
One of the two talks that really stressed the importance of the Electrical Engineering ( EE ) / Erlang approach to building distributable software components and this talk , like the other talk ( David McClain's ) , also showed a visual interface for making these components and tying them together .
A story how Lisp enabled one man to build a software system that 's used by a lot ( all ? ) of the big aircraft manufacturers around the world .
It was fun to hear how he got his first big customer ( Airbus ) .
A very nice talk with a good dose of history , technicalities and advice .
The second talk about the EE / Erlang approach to building software and a little more explicit about running software on multiple processors or computers .
David McClain 's website also has some screenshots of their interface .
Visually a stunning talk but I 'm easily impressed .
I have no idea how well it works in practice , but just going by the talk Common Lisp is used at the cutting edge of technology both for its high performance as well as for its features ( multi- paradigm , macros , REPL , etc. ) .
One thing that the Free Software hippy in me regrets is that SpectroDynamics 's products are not freely downloadable from the internet .
It makes perfect business sense ofcourseand I totally respect their decision ( I would do the same ! ) but somehow it feels like a net loss for Common Lisp .
Anyway , I need to digest this for a while since I 'm probably wrong about it being a net loss for CL .
It would definitely be a net loss for SpectroDynamics to just put their products online for free :-) A nice talk about how CL is used in Japan .
Something we , or at least I , do not hear much about .
Lots of technical information and examples .
Also a nice overview of areas for improvement for CL and SBCL in particular .
Things which will no doubt be resolved in the near future .
A straighforward , but good , talk about the work that has been done on adding SMP to LispWorks .
Of the commercial implementations LispWorks was the most well represented , not only by several of their employees but also by the amount of people that gave the talks that used it .
Of the open source implementations it were SBCL and Clozure CL with SBCL having a clear lead IMHO .

Johnny - Boy , sweetie , it is too damn late !!!
Yesterday , Isksaon called Sarah Palin a NUT for calling living wills , death panels .
Well , today he was acknowledged and praised by President Obama at the New Hampshire Town Hall Meeting on health care for the actual language of the living will section of the senate bill that the GOP has tried to hi-jack as , " death panels , seniors will die , etc . "
Transcript here .
Well , I guess good ol ' boy Johnny was feeling the HEAT because he is attempting to back track it all , even to the point that he never said anything about living wills !!
U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson , R - Ga. , today denounced comments made by President Obama and his spokesman regarding Isakson ’s alleged connection to language contained in the House health care bill on “ end - of - life counseling . ”
Isakson vehemently opposes the House and Senate health care bills and he played no role in drafting language added to the House bill by House Democrats calling for the government to incentivize doctors by offering them money to conduct “ end - of - life counseling ” with Medicare patients every five years .
Isakson also strongly opposed the House bill language calling for doctors to follow a government - mandated list of topics to discuss with patients during the counseling sessions .
read it all here ...
I will talk about what we need to do in terms of Medicare eligibility .
When somebody signs up for Medicare when they are 65 years old -- you are supposed to go in 90 days before your 65th birthday ; I am getting close , so I am looking at these things -- I think you ought to be required to execute a durable power of attorney when you become eligible .
Eighty percent of the cost of health care to me , to you , and to anybody else happens in the last 60 days of life .
More often than not , people are not in a condition to make a decision for themselves .
Because of laws , and because we are a compassionate nation , the physician will keep you alive as long as he can .
If you had a chance , you might rather say if I am being hydrated and given nutrition but will never become conscious again , I give the doctors the authority to make the appropriate medical decision .
The money that would save is in the ``gazillions '' of dollars -- if there is such a number .
It would help us to manage that cost .
Well , the heat must be something , but Johnny - Boy , words do matter and these are your EXACT words on the living will matter .
See , Johnny you can not have it both ways .
Ca n't drink from both wells .
There is nothing wrong in what you stated about living wills .
More and more Americans are following your EXACT advice and preparing their end of life wishes .
Johnny , I would respect you more for standing up to what is right , as you did yesterday in calling Sarah Palin a nut , because she is .
To stretch living wills as death panels is too much of a stretch for most , and you stated so , but the heat from the Republicans , GOP , King Rush , Glenn Beck , Teabaggers , Birthers , Right Wing Extremists much be too much for you to bear .
So , you opted to attempt to denounce everything you said .
I have repeatedly wrote , These tools constantly catch you when it is too late for your to catch yourself .
It is out there Johnny - Boy and the President of the United States salute you , for standing on the right side of the aisle .
For health care .
For sale :
The backyard White House with Oval Office and Lincoln Bedroom for a bargain $ 10 m
It comes complete with an Oval Office , Lincoln Bedroom and of course the famous white facade .
But there is no sign of President Barack Obama at this White House - because it is a scaled - down replica built in a suburban backyard .
Now , owner Fred Milani - who built the impressive 16,500 sq ft structure seven years ago - has reluctantly put it up for sale following a huge downturn in the American housing market .
Famous site : The Atlanta replica of the White House has become a tourist attraction
The mini-White House , situated in Atlanta , Georgia , was placed on the market at just under $ 10 m , a snip compared with the value of the Washington D.C. original .
Mr Milani , an American - Iranian , told the Atlanta Journal : " I still do not want to sell , but I will . ”
“ Really , I am not very political .
The architect just asked , ‘ How about I build you the White House ? ’ and I said yes .
That is the whole story . ”
The ( sort - of ) Oval Office : Property developer Fred Milani has endeavoured to recreate the President 's study
Reluctant : Mr Milani was forced to sell due to the downturn in the American property market .
He is pictured in the foreground below a bizarre " God loves you " motive made from bushes
The real deal : The Washington D.C. White House , Mr Milani 's inspiration
Since its creation , the Atlanta White House has divided neighbours in the wealthy North Druid Hills district , some of whom see the replica as excessive .
Picturesque :
To the rear , the Atlanta White House has an impressive swimming pool
Elegance : Fred Milani has taken great care to recreate the opulent style of his country 's most important building
However , next - door - neighbour Keith Klugman said : “ Honestly , we are very happy to be living next door to the White House .
“ There are certain quirkinesses , but he is a very good neighbour . ”
Copying history : Mr Milani in his very own Lincoln Bedroom .
The original was created under the Truman administration and is now used a guest room for political heavyweights
Impressive interior :
The sweeping staircase which mirrors the original in the Washington D.C. White House
The 57 - year - old , a property developer , has also annoyed those living nearby because of the level of interest the property has created among tourists , who flock to the neighbourhood to take pictures .
Presidential :
The replica of the famous home of U.S. leaders is smaller but an almost - perfect copy
Spiritual : Mr Milani in one his $ 10 m home 's dining rooms , adorned with a cross
Official seal : ' President ' Milani sits on his desk in the Oval Office of his White House , with a copied presidential seal above him
The real thing : Barack Obama and Joe Biden practice their putts on a green outside the actual White House - which is not for sale
Clayton Swisher of AlJazeera English in West Jerusalem , channeling the same vibe that Max Blumenthal got to .
Nobody drinking , but one guy says he would kill Obama , and a few others say he ’s an Arab or a Muslim .
Oh , and two say he does n’t understand " the Arab mentality . "
This is Israel today .
Scary place .
Can it change ?
Yes .
Will have to .
The approach could use commercially available lasers
US military researchers are developing a method for communication that uses lasers to make sound underwater .
The approach focuses laser light to produce bubbles of steam that pop and create tiny , localised explosions .
Controlling the rate of these explosions could provide a means of communication or even acoustic imaging .
Researchers at the US Naval Research Laboratory say the approach could be used for air - to - submarine or fully underwater communication .
One of the peculiar effects of high - intensity laser beams is that they can actually focus themselves when passing through some materials , like water .
As the laser focuses , it rips electrons off water molecules , which then become superheated and create a powerful " pop " - of some 220 decibels .
Because different colours of light travel at markedly different speeds underwater , the precise location where different colours focus together could be manipulated by the suitable design of a many - coloured input pulse .
Those same focusing effects are significantly reduced in air , so that a laser " signal " could be launched from an airborne source to communicate with submarines , so that they do not need to surface .
The idea could also be used for underwater acoustic imaging , by using a moveable mirror to direct the pulses into an array of pops whose echoes can give a detailed picture of underwater terrain .
The BNP leader Nick Griffin was repeatedly pilloried and criticised on the BBC's Question Time tonight when he was dubbed the " Dr Strangelove " of British politics after attempting to claim the mantle of Winston Churchill and struggling to explain his denial of the Holocaust .
In passionate exchanges on the BBC 's flagship current affairs programme , a black member of the audience accused Griffin of " completely disgusting " behaviour as he was forced to explain why he had met a Ku Klux Klan leader and attacked Islam .
Griffin was booed when he walked into the studio for the show 's recording a few hours before it was broadcast at 10.35 pm .
A police helicopter hovered over the BBC Television Centre in west London while the recording took place , after 25 anti-fascist demonstrators had earlier broken through police lines to get into the foyer .
Up to 1,000 demonstrators protested outside as television centre was " locked down " during an operation in which three police officers were injured .
In the first question , the panel was asked whether it was fair that the BNP had hijacked Winston Churchill .
Griffin said that the wartime prime minister would have been a member of the BNP .
" I said that Churchill would belong in the BNP , because no other party would have him for what he said in the early days of mass immigration into this country , the fact that they are ' only coming for our benefits system ' , and for the fact that in his younger days he was extremely critical of the dangers of fundamentalist Islam in a way which would now be described as Islamophobic . "
In one of a series of hostile interventions from the audience , a young black Briton called Griffin disgusting , and accused him of poisoning British politics .
" For just one minute , could you not think of the benefits that my parents brought to this country ?
No .
All you 're thinking of doing is poison politics .
The vast majority of this audience find what you stand for to be completely disgusting . "
As the audience cheered , Griffin said he had been portrayed as a monster because of " outrageous lies " .
Asked by the Question Time presenter David Dimbleby what had been untrue , Griffin said : " The vast majority of them , far too many to go into . "
As the audience laughed at Griffin 's refusal to detail what he called lies , Dimbleby asked whether he had denied the Holocaust .
" I do not have a conviction for Holocaust denial , " he replied .
As Dimbleby asked why he had denied the Holocaust , Griffin smiled .
" Why are you smiling , it is not a particularly amusing issue , " the presenter asked .
Dimbleby threw some of Griffin 's quotes back at him .
" Ethnicity – ' I want to see Britain become 99 % genetically white , just as she was eleven years before I was born ' .
Right ?
You say you are misquoted .
I ca n't find the misquotations . "
Griffin did not challenge the Dimbleby quotes but denied a quote in the Daily Mail that he had said that black people walked like monkeys .
He then struggled as a young Jewish man wearing a skullcap challenged him to explain why he had likened the " orthodox opinion " that six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust to the old " orthodox opinion " that the earth was flat .
The audience member said : " Sir Winston Churchill put everything on the line so that my ancestors would n't get slaughtered in the concentration camps .
But here sits a man who says that is a myth just like a flat world was a myth . "
Griffin was jeered as he struggled to explain his stance on the Holocaust .
" I can not explain why I used to say those things , " he said as he blamed his inability to spell out his thinking on the threat of being deported under the European arrest warrant to France and Germany where Holocaust denial is illegal .
Jack Straw , the justice secretary , said there was no law preventing Griffin from explaining himself .
Griffin said he now accepted that Jews were murdered after hearing British radio intercepts of German transmissions which showed there had been a mass murder of Jews on the eastern front .
" What about Auschwitz , " Straw asked of the extermination camp in Nazi- occupied Poland .
" You do n't need a subsequent radio intercept to find out that people were gassed at Auschwitz . "
The justice secretary dubbed Griffinthe Dr Strangelove of British politics — referring to the German scientist , played by Peter Sellers , who keeps referring to the US president as Mein Fuhrer .
A British Asian man was clapped when he accused Griffin of wanting to hound him out of Britain .
" You'd be surprised how many people would have a whip - round to buy you a ticket and your supporters to go to the South Pole .
It is a colourless landscape that will suit you fine . "
In a sign of the BBC 's determination to put pressure on Griffin , Dimbleby asked why he had met Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke .
Griffin said Duke was a non-violent figure , prompting laughter .
The panel was also asked why Islam is a " wicked and vicious faith " – a reference to remarks by Griffin .
He said there were good points to Islam because it opposes usury , but added : " It [ Islam ] does n't fit in with the fundamental values of British society – free speech , democracy and equal rights for women . "
Griffin insisted he was not a Nazi .
" I have been relentlessly attacked and demonised in the last few days ... I am not a Nazi and never have been . "
Lady Warsi , shadow cohesion minister , said : " Mr Griffin is obviously a confused man .
On the one hand he says he does not believe in lots of values he attributes wrongly to Islam .
Yet it was Mr Griffin who shared a platform with Abu Hamza . "
The BBC , which has faced intense criticism , believed the tough questioning vindicated its decision .
" Members of the audience asked the kind of tough questions that mark Question Time out as the premier television programme , " the BBC deputy director general , Mark Byford , said .
Straw said : " We see here a fantasising conspiracy theorist [ who ] madly defines his politics by race rather than by moral values . "

Introduction
Great news for any business in the World , and any Web of Linked Data developer :
As of now , Yahoo will display price and offering details and other meta - data of any e-commerce Web page if the site owner uses the free GoodRelations vocabulary .
Previously , such data was only used within special applications developed in the Yahoo ecosystem .
Now , every site owner can enhance the search results of his or her offers in Yahoo !.
On this page we will show how you can augment a Web page describing your business and your products with additional data so that Yahoo ! will show those details in the results .
At the same time , this data can be used by many novel services in the Web of Linked Data , i.e. , you do not only improve your search results in Yahoo !
but also become visible for customers in novel search and recommendation engines .
We will use the following specifications :
Yahoo !
currently supports eight types of augmented search results in the standard output , of which the following two are most relevant for a business :
Local ( phone numbers , addresses , opening hours , position , etc. of your shops etc. ) Product '( prices , images , and product info ) '
We will not cover the news , video , event , documents , discussion , and games patterns in this recipe .
Important :
This document in here goes beyond the original Yahoo !
specifications at
because the recipes shown in here make your business visible for
Yahoo !
Yahoo !
SearchMonkey and Yahoo !
BOSS services , and all other novel Web of Linked Data services unrelated to Yahoo .
Getting Started
Note :
If you want that Yahoo !
displays your data in the standard search interface , you are currently limited to one type of additional information per page .
That means , you must e.g. have separate HTML pages for
your company and
one for each individual product or offer .
In the following example , we will use the two Web pages :
Let 's assume they initially look as follows :

Now , the first step is that you change the DOCTYPE in the header to " XHTML +RDFa " :
< xml > <!
DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN " " http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd " > </xml >
Also , make sure that the " head " element includes the proper content type and encoding for XHTML :
< xml > < head >
< meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content= " text / html ; charset=UTF - 8 " /> < title > Martin Hepp's Yahoo SearchMonkey Mock - up Page </ title >
</head > </xml >
Then , insert the following namespace prefix definitions into the " body " element in both files :
< xml > < body
</xml >
So the complete header should look like
< xml > < ?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " ?>
<!

Publishing the Data
Next , upload the new files to their original location :
Check with a standard browser that the layout of the page is fine .
If you want , you can use stylesheets and other standard design techniques for optimizing the rendering .
The only important thing is that the file remains a valid XHTML document .
You can use the W3C Markup Validation service at http://validator.w3.org/ to check that .
Now , validate the pages using the Yahoo !
Validation Service at the bottom of
You can also invoke it directly using the URI of your page as the respective parameter :
It should show that your mark - up is okay , but not yet included in the Yahoo ! index :
Telling Yahoo and the World
Now , the last thing that remains to be done is telling Yahoo !
and the world to consider your new data .
As for Yahoo ! , use http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/submit to submit your page .
This requires free registration with Yahoo !.
Then , enter the URIs of all pages that you changed .
If there are links between the pages , Yahoo !
will find all of them , so you wo n't have to submit hundreds of URIs .
If the page you enhanced following this recipe is not a highly ranked page itself , you should link to it from a prominent page , e.g. your main page , because it will depend on the popularity of your page how quickly the Yahoo !
crawler will stop by and index your new data .
It can be anything between a few days and several months .
As a last step , you should inform Semantic Web indexing services .
Currently , sindice.com is the only service that we know that considers RDFa data , so this should be your first choice .
Go to http://sindice.com/main/submit.
and enter the URIs of all of your enhanced pages there .
Then press " submit " .
Another popular service , Ping The Semantic Web does not yet support RDFa directly , but you can still make your data known with at trick :
Go to http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/
Paste the URI of your page in the field " URI of XHTML or SVG file "
Select " RDF / XML " as the output format , select " no " for warnings , and " strict " for the parsing type .
Click on " Go ! "
After a few seconds , your browser will display XML content without rendering .
Copy the pretty long URI from the browser 's address field in your clipboard .
It will look like http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/extract?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.heppnetz.de%2Fsearchmonkey%2Fcompany.html&format=pretty-xml&warnings=false&parser=lax&space-preserve=true&submit=Go!&text=
Paste that long URI in the field " Ping the Semantic Web ! " at http://pingthesemanticweb.com/.
Congratulations !
You are now all set - your additional data will sooner or later appear in
the Yahoo ! search results ,

http://goodrelations-search.appspot.com/
It is basically a variant of the Yahoo !
search service that displays all meta - data that is found in the Yahoo ! index .
Note :
At the time of writing , there are some problems in Yahoo's RDF export , so even though my page has been crawled by Yahoo ! , the SeachMonkey index does not return fully correct RDF .
Yahoo is aware of the bug .
If you enter
wwwurl : < your uri >
as the search parameter , the tool will list all meta - data that is currently in the Yahoo !
SearchMonkey index .
For example ,
wwwurl :
http://www.heppnetz.de/searchmonkey/company.html will show the meta -data for
http://www.heppnetz.de/searchmonkey/company.html
You can use the following links to check those pages directly
Information for Web of Linked Data Developers ( RDF , OWL , SPARQL , ...)
If you are familiar with the W3C Semantic Web technologies RDF and RDFS or use the Tabulator browser plug - in , you can look at the meta - data in your pages using the RDFa distiller ( and validator ) written by Ivan Herman ( http://www.w3.org/People/Ivan/), available at
http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/
Select - " RDF / XML " or " Turtle " as the output format , - " yes " for warnings , and - " strict " for the parsing type : - Click on " Go ! "
The result using the Turtle syntax should look as follows :

Things That Took Us A While To Learn
-)
1. Yahoo accepts images only when the URI is specified this way :
< xml >
< img src= " " height = " 1 " width= " 1 " alt =" product image " / >
</xml >
The semantically equivalent pattern does not work .
It triggers an error in the Yahoo Validator . < xml > </xml >
2 . The ordering of elements matters for Yahoo .
For example , the gr:includes Object property MUST ENCLOSE the gr:ProductOrServicesSomeInstancesPlaceholder .
Otherwise Yahoo complains about " multiple objects " in one page and will not produce the enhanced rendering .
On the remote western edge of Uganda the land suddenly drops down into the western arm of the Great Rift Valley to reveal the vast expanse of Lake Albert and the blue mountains of Congo beyond .
Hippos and marabou storks wander the shoreline near the tiny fishing villages whose hauls of Nile perch , tilapia , catfish and white herring sustain the local economy .
But now there are new , less natural features marking the landscape , ones that could change the course of the country .
" We never knew we were sitting on oil here , " said James Ocham , a 27 - year - old fisherman outside the Classic Inn Lodge and Bar as he gazed towards an oilrig erected alongside a nearby lagoon .
" In time we are all going to benefit – there will be jobs , even for the unemployed . "
The discovery of vast oil reserves in Uganda has caused excitement across the country , and more than a touch of anxiety too .
Energy companies have recently found more than 700 m barrels of commercially viable oil in the pristine Albertine Graben region , representing the first major petroleum strike in east Africa .
Tullow Oil , the FTSE 100 company leading the exploration , believes the exploitable deposits could exceed 1.5 bn barrels , reserves comparable to Equatorial Guinea and the Republic of Chad .
If managed well , the petrodollars could transform the economy of the landlocked country , potentially doubling the state 's revenues , creating thousands of jobs and help realise President Yoweri Museveni 's dream of industrialising the country .
If not , sceptics point to Nigeria , where billions of dollars of oil income has brought great wealth to the few but failed to solve widespread poverty , and whose mere mention makes Ugandan government officials bristle .
" Why must people always look at the bad examples and say we will suffer the same curse ? " said Fred Kabagambe - Kaliisa , permanent secretary in the ministry of energy and mineral development .
" Why not mention the good ones , like Norway ? "
Norway is in fact assisting the Ugandan government through its energy , finance and environmental ministries and is funding a feasibility study on building a large refinery near Lake Albert .
While the oil companies would prefer to export the petroleum to recoup investment costs quickly , Museveni is insisting on " value addition " inside Uganda to ensure a greater share of the profit remains in the country , and an end to the reliance on Kenyan ports for imported fuel .
The first oil production is expected in 2011 , though the peak flow of 150,000 barrels a day for up to 25 years may only be reached by 2015 .
Some of the oil will be used for power production , but the bulk will be sold domestically and in the region .
According to government plans , part of the revenue will be used for infrastructure and development projects and part safeguarded for future generations .
While the windfall will reduce the government 's reliance on overseas aid , which accounts for 30 % of the state budget , there are concerns that the glut of petrodollars could distort the economy – and its politics .
Godber Tumushabe , executive director of the thinktank Advocates Coalition for Development and Environment , in Kampala , said that oil discoveries typically " encourage political longevity " .
Museveni , who has ruled since 1986 and will stand for a fourth term in 2011 , would not tolerate a handover of power with oil revenues about to flow , he said .
" It could happen that the government is disciplined enough to use the resource to develop the country .
But given that we are not using existing revenues to deliver services effectively I do n't think this is the most likely scenario . "
There are also environmental challenges .
Some of the biggest oil deposits so far have been discovered in the Murchison Falls National Park – Uganda 's biggest and most visited reserve .
Wells have been sunk in the Kabwoya Wildlife Reserve , where herds of Ugandan kob antelope roam close to the site office of Tullow , which has pledged to ensure minimal environment degradation .
Within Uganda , there have been concerns that the revenue sharing agreements between the energy companies and the government have not been made public .
But Simon D'Ujanga , minister of state for energy , said the agreements were commercially confidential .
" We know this is a big opportunity and we wo n't mess it up , " he said .
The petroleum curse
The history of oil in sub-Saharan Africa does not make for happy reading .
Nigeria is the most often cited example of the petroleum curse , with billions of pounds in oil revenues siphoned off by corrupt leaders while communities in the environmentally scarred , oil - producing regions still live in poverty .
Oil windfalls – and the complicity of western energy companies – have helped corrupt and dictatorial leaders like the late Omar Bongo of Gabon and President Teodoro Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea remain in power for decades , while their countries remained underdeveloped .
In Sudan and Angola , the struggle to control oil revenues contributed to lengthy civil wars .
If you were ever hoping to see an episode of Mythbusters busting the myths behind RFID security , you might be saddened to hear it looks like that will never happen , and not due to a lack of interest either .
Adam Savage of Mythbusters , when speaking to the audience of The Last HOPE hacker conference , revealed why RFID has become a bit of a taboo topic at Discovery Channel .
In response to an audience question about revisiting RFID as an episode , Adam responds , “ Dude , the RFID thing .
I ’m sorry .
It just is not going to happen .
...
Here ’s what happened .
I ’m not sure how much of this story I ’m allowed to tell , but I ’ll tell you what I know . ”
Mythbusters did cover RFID in an episode last January , but did not focus on RFID security concerns .
After some cheers from the audience , Adam says , “ We were going to do RFID and on several levels , you know , how hackable , how reliable , how trackable , etc. , etc. , and one of our researchers called up Texas Instruments and they arranged a conference call between , I think , Tory and the head producer over there for the other team , Linda Wolkovitch , and one of the technicians at Texas Instruments .
We were supposed to have a conference call to talk about the technology on like Tuesday at 10 am and Tuesday at 10 am , Linda and Tori get on the phone and they .. uh ..
Texas Instruments comes on , along with the chief legal council for American Express , Visa , Discover , and everybody else . ”
Adam continues , “ I got chills just as I described it .
They were way way out - gunned and they absolutely made it clear to Discovery they were not going to air this episode talking about how hackable this stuff was and Discovery backed way down , being a large corporation who depends upon the revenue of the advertisers .
Uh , and now it ’s on Discovery ’s radar and they wo n’t let us go near it .
So I ’m sorry .
It ’s just one of those things , but man , that was ..
Tory still gets a little white when he describes that phone conversation . ”
On one episode of Mythbusters , biometric security is visited and attempts are made to see if fingerprint scanners , for example , could be bypassed easily .
Sure enough , the Mythbusters were able to beat the fingerprint scanners , several ways .
It is not surprising that such a popular show , attempting to publicize possible faults in RFID technology , would garner the attention of certain companies .
With RFID chips finding their way into our credit cards , passports , and many other aspects of our lives , trusting the technology with our security and privacy is becoming an everyday scenario .
As Adam stated , some of the aspects of RFID that would be covered by Mythbusters , if they had their way , would include how hackable they are , how reliable they are , and how easy they are to track .
Some security experts fear information stored on RFID chips could be read remotely by strangers , such as the personal information stored on credit cards or passports that use vulnerable RFID chips .
While typically an RFID chip used in a credit card , for example , is designed to be read from only a short distance away , some believe as far as 40 - feet away is possible .
There are also concerns that the data encryption and other means of added security given to some RFID chips may be vulnerable .
It seems RFID - related myths regarding whether a person should be worried about the having their credit cards cloned , having their identity stolen , or just having a store know who they are and what is in their wallet when they walk in will just have to remain myths on Mythbusters .
[ Update : September 3 , 2008 ]
It appears Adam Savage of Mythbusters is retracting his statements made at The Last Hope conference , according to a statement issued to CNET News on Wednesday .
Adam Savage says in the issued statement , " There ’s been a lot of talk about this RFID thing , and I have to admit that I got some of my facts wrong , as I was n’t on that story , and as I said on the video , I was n’t actually in on the call . "
He continues , " Texas Instruments ’ account of their call with Grant and our producer is factually correct .
If I went into the detail of exactly why this story did n’t get filmed , it ’s so bizarre and convoluted that no one would believe me , but suffice to say ... the decision not to continue on with the RFID story was made by our production company , Beyond Productions , and had nothing to do with Discovery , or their ad sales department . "
Adam Savage ’s statement follows a previous statement issued to CNET News the day before from Texas Instruments stating things did not go exactly as Adam Savage described at The Last Hope conference .
According to Texas Instruments , during the phone call technical questions were asked and answered , only a single legal council member was present on behalf of a contactless payment company and it sounds as if Mythbusters was not told they could not air the episode .
Does that mean it is okay to take off our tinfoil hats now ?

The 2020 Virtual Lab Design Conference Features :
Barack Obama and the ‘ Unipolar Moment ’
Noam Chomsky
In These Times , October 6 , 2009
Every powerful state relies on specialists whose task is to show that what the strong do is noble and just and , if the weak suffer , it is their fault .
In the West , these specialists are called “ intellectuals ” and , with marginal exceptions , they fulfill their task with skill and self - righteousness , however outlandish the claims , in this practice that traces back to the origins of recorded history .
With just that much background , let us turn to the so - called unipolar moment .
Symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall 20 years ago , the collapse of the Soviet Union putatively left a unipolar world , with the United States as the sole global superpower and not merely the primary superpower , as it was before .
Within months , the George H. W. Bush administration outlined Washington ’s new course : Everything will stay much the same , but with new pretexts .
We still need a huge military system , but for a new reason : the “ technological sophistication ” of Third World powers .
We have to maintain the “ defense industrial base ” — a euphemism for state - supported high - tech industry .
We must maintain intervention forces directed at the energy - rich Middle East — where the significant threats to our interests “ could not be laid at the Kremlin ’s door , ” contrary to decades of deceit .
All this was passed over quietly , barely reported .
But for those who hope to understand the world , it is quite instructive .
The George W. Bush administration went far to the extreme of aggressive militarism and arrogant contempt .
It was harshly condemned for these practices , even within the mainstream .
Bush ’s second term was more moderate .
Some of the most extreme figures were expelled : Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz , Douglas Feith and others .
Vice President Richard Cheney could not be removed because he WAS the administration .
Policy began to return toward the norm .
As Barack Obama came into office , former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice predicted he would follow the policies of Bush ’s second term , and that is pretty much what happened , apart from a different rhetorical style that seems to have charmed much of the world .
One basic difference between Bush and Obama was expressed very well in another era , by a senior adviser of the Kennedy administration at the height of the Cuban missile crisis .
Kennedy planners were making decisions that threatened Britain with obliteration , but they were not informing the British about it .
At that point the advisor defined the “ special relationship ” with Britain : “ our lieutenant — the fashionable word is `partner . ” ‘
Bush and his cohorts addressed the world as “ our lieutenants . ”
Thus , in announcing the invasion of Iraq , they informed the United Nations that it could follow U.S. orders or be “ irrelevant . ”
Such brazen arrogance naturally aroused hostility .
Obama adopts a different course .
He politely greets the leaders and people of the world as “ partners , ” and only in private does he continue to treat them as “ lieutenants . ”
Foreign leaders much prefer this stance , and the public is also sometimes mesmerized by it .
But it is wise to attend to deeds , not rhetoric and pleasant demeanor .
The current world system remains unipolar in one dimension : the arena of force .
The United States spends almost as much as the rest of the world combined on its military and it is far more advanced in the technology of destruction .
The United States is also alone in having hundreds of global military bases and in occupying two countries in the crucial energy - producing regions .
NATO is part of the Cold War apparatus that Obama can deploy .
As the unipolar moment dawned , the fate of NATO came to the fore .
The traditional justification for NATO was defense against Soviet aggression .
With the USSR gone , the pretext evaporated .
But NATO has been reshaped into a U.S. - run global intervention force , with special concern for control over energy .
Post - Cold War NATO has inexorably pushed to the east and south .
Obama apparently intends to carry forward this expansion .
In July , on the eve of Obama ’s first trip to Russia , Michael McFaul , his special assistant for national security and Russian and Eurasian affairs , informed the press , “ We ’re not going to reassure or give or trade anything with the Russians regarding NATO expansion or missile defense . ”
McFaul was referring to U.S. missile defense programs in Eastern Europe and to NATO membership for Russia ’s neighbors , Ukraine and Georgia , both steps understood by Western analysts to be serious threats to Russian security that would likely inflame international tensions .
A few weeks ago the Obama administration announced a readjustment of U.S. anti-missile systems in Eastern Europe .
That led to a great deal of commentary and debate , which , as in the past , skillfully evaded the central issue .
Those systems are advertised as defense against an Iranian attack .
But that can not be the motive .
The chance of Iran launching a missile attack , nuclear or not , is about at the level of an asteroid hitting the Earth — unless , of course , the ruling clerics have a fanatic death wish and want to see Iran instantly incinerated .
The purpose of the U.S. interception systems , if they ever work , is to prevent any retaliation to a U.S. or Israeli attack on Iran — that is , to eliminate any Iranian deterrent .
In this regard , antimissile systems are a first - strike weapon , and that is understood on all sides .
But that seems to be a fact best left in the shadows .
The Obama plan may represent less provocation to Russia but , rhetoric aside , it is irrelevant to defending Europe — except as a reaction to a U.S. or Israeli first strike against Iran .
The present nuclear standoff with Iran summons the Cold War ’s horrors — and hypocrisies .
The outcry over Iran overlooks the Obama administration ’s assurance that the Indo - U.S. nuclear agreement is exempt from the just - passed U.N. resolution on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , which India greeted by announcing that it can now build nuclear weapons with the same destructive power as those in the arsenals of the world ’s major nuclear powers , with yields up to 200 kilotons .
And , over the objections of the United States and Europe , the International Atomic Energy Agency called on Israel to join the NPT and open its nuclear facilities for inspection .
Israel announced it would not cooperate .
Though the world is unipolar militarily , since the 1970s it has become economically “ tripolar , ” with comparable centers in North America , Europe and northeast Asia .
The global economy is becoming more diverse , particularly with the growth of Asian economies .
A world becoming truly multipolar , politically as well as economically , despite the resistance of the sole superpower , marks a progressive change in history .
Snow Leopard には Grand Central Dispatch ( 以下 GCD ) という機能がある。これ は C と当然 C++ , Objective - C , Objective - C++ にクロージャのようなものを追加し、マルチコアな
CPU における計算の並列実行を簡単に書けるようにするらしい。
私は並列化には全然詳しくないのだけど、クロージャのようなものは気になるので調べてみた。
Block
Apple Developer Connection にある Introducing Blocks and Grand Central Dispatch は GCD の全体像をコードを交えつつわかりやすく説明している。この “ blocks ” というのがクロージャのようなものだ。
Blocks are similar to — but far more powerful than — traditional function pointers .
The key differences are : Blocks can be defined inline , as “ anonymous functions . ”
Blocks capture read - only copies of local variables , similar to “ closures ” in other languages
上記文章中ではこの一カ所でしか “ closures ” という語は使われていなく、あとは “ blocks ” と呼ばれている。これを使って 技術野郎の復讐 ( 書籍『ハッカーと画家』 に 「 オタク野郎の復習」として収録されている)
にあるアキュムレータを書いてみた。
#include < stdio.h > # include < Block .h > typedef int ( ^IntAccumulator ) ( int ) ; IntAccumulator foo( int n ) { __block int s = n ; int ( ^bar ) ( int ) = ^( int i ) { return s += i ; } ; return Block_copy ( bar ) ; } int main ( int argc , char* argv [ ] ) { IntAccumulator f = foo ( 1 ) ; printf ( " % dn " , f ( 1 ) ) ; printf ( " % dn " , f ( 1 ) ) ; printf ( " %dn " , f ( 2 ) ) ; Block_release(f ) ; return 0 ; }
このコードのうち、いままでの C になかった部分を簡単に説明する :
block は関数ポインタと環境をあらわすデータで実現され、文法も関数ポインタを模し * を ^ に代えたものになっている。
を に代えたものになっている。 外のローカル変数は参照できるが変更は通常できない。グローバル変数と static 変数、さらに新たに導入された __block 修飾子のつけられたローカル変数は変更できる 。
block は効率上の理由でスタックに確保される。もとのスコープから脱したい場合は明示的に
Block_copy して複製を作り Block_release で解放する必要がある 。
実行結果は当然こうなる。
% cc - Wextra 1.c && ./a.out 2 3 5 %
まだ並列化は関係がなく、個々の関数呼び出しは順に実行されている。
並列化抜きの block はこれから使われていくんだろうか 。callback として、スコープのより狭い関数ポインタとしては便利だ。実際、Apple は qsort_b , atexit_b といった block を引数にとる関数をいくつか提供している。一方、関数が関数を返すような使い方は微妙に思う。ただ
Block_copy / Block_release の「 だささ 」 は C では日常茶飯事だし 、Objective - C 上なら NSAutoreleasePool やガベージコレクタの恩恵にもあずかれるらしい。
ちなみに 、Apple は block の標準化を目指しているらしく 、ISO の C のワーキンググループに は 今 年3 月 に
Apple ’s extensions to C として提出されている。実装も 、GCC では Apple の独自拡張あつかいだけど 、LLVM のフロントエンドであ る
Clang には とりこまれて いる 。
並列化
さて、この block を並列に実行するために 、GCD は dispatch queue というキューを提供する。キューの先から取り出された block はスレッドプールのなかのスレッド上で実行される。スレッドプールがキューを提供するのは 一般的 なようだ 。
While initially inspired by the challenge of multicore computing , these actually solve a more general problem : how to efficiently schedule multiple independent chunks of work .
GCD does this using four primary abstractions : block objects
dispatch queues
synchronization
event sources
block と dispatch queue と、その同期のためのいくつかの方法、さらに非同期 IO などに block を callback として使う event とが 、GCD の提供する主な抽象とされている 。
GCD の特長は、スレッドが完全に隠蔽されることと、block の導入で、分割した処理を記述量もふくめ簡単に書けることのように思う。Apple は
OS との密な連携もあげているけど、私は OS に詳しくないのであまりうなづけなかった 。

As many of us have heard before , Isocrates is known as “ the Father of Liberal Education ” in the Western European tradition .
This is not just hearsay .
Isocrates ’ influence on experiential learning and problem - based learning has been clearly proven by historians .
Since this is true ,
Why have influential education scholars denied that the history of educational philosophy goes back earlier than 1700 , some even claiming that it originated in the 1960s in the United States ?
Why have influential education scholars erroneously attributed the origin of the Liberal Arts to the philosophical academy of Aristotle and Plato , when it was in fact Isocrates ’ competing program of study that won popular support and became the basis of liberal education for two millenia ?
Why are Liberal Arts educators still unaware of so much of their field ’s own history and unaware of Isocrates ’ insights into their art ?
In 2005 James R. Muir , Associate Professor of Philosophy from the University of Winnipeg ( Canada ) published a paper in the journal Theory and Research in Education titled “ Is our history of educational philosophy mostly wrong ?
The case of Isocrates . ”
He has summarized the arguments and historical evidence in an article that also explains the reasons why educators have forgotten Isocrates .
In this blog entry I provide an overview of his main points , and a response .
The original is a rich 25 pages and well worth the read .
Please use the link above to the journal issue .
The problem
As Muir explains , some influential scholarly thinkers in Education in the 20th century claimed that educational philosophy arose after 1700 and is largely centered on John Dewey .
They have inaccurately preferred to attribute Isocrates ’ influence on liberal education to Aristotle and Plato , who in fact had a “ rival ” school with quite a different approach to education .
As a result of this gross historical oversight , today Isocrates is conspicuously absent from histories of the field of education written by education scholars .
Isocrates ’ 2 millenia of influence on liberal education
Muir gathers the evidence that the major historical originator of “ educational philosophy ” and “ Liberal Education ” is , in fact , Isocrates .
1. Classical Greece and Rome
A major twentieth - century historian of ancient Greek education , Marrou , claimed that Isocrates ’ influence on the educational system of Greece far overwhelmed that of Plato .
Cicero , Plutarch and Quintilian ’s approaches to education were consciously based on Isocrates and were often contrasted with the educational approaches of Plato and Aristotle .
Muir has confirmed that Isocrates ’ influence then extended into the middle ages all over Europe , and in parts of North Africa and the MIddle East .
2. Middle Ages
In the 5th century , Martianus Capella named 7 liberal arts based on Isocrates , and divided them into 3 language arts and 4 mathematical arts .
Then in the 6th century , Boethius named the 4 mathematical arts the “ quadrivium . ”
By the 8th century , Alcuin ’s writing noted the naming of the “ trivium ” as well as quadrivium .
3. Renaissance
Only in the 15th century , when more of Aristotle and Plato ’s texts were ( re ) discovered , was there a brief controversy over whose educational approach was better .
Renaissance Humanism was staunchly Isocratean in its devotion to Cicero and Plutarch and Quintilian , whose ideas of education derive from Isocrates .
English renaissance humanists such as Erasmus , Elyot , Ascham and Bacon were imitators of Isocrates or his ideas and often explicitly critical of Aristotle .
Summing up generations of historical research , Hadas claimed that Isocratean education “ Kept humanism alive ” ( qtd in Muir 168 ) .
The Isocratean ideal remained preeminent in educational theory until the 18th century .
That adds up to 21 centuries of major influence , and his ideas still held sway in many schools past that point .
Truncated histories of educational philosophy
Then along came the 1960s .
Prominent educational writers followed in Dewey ’s footsteps with an ignorance of the long history of educational thought , and started to make erroneous claims about the origin of liberal education .
Hirst inaccurately pinned liberal education to Aristotle and Plato .
White claimed that educational philosophy started in the 1700s , Tibble said it started in the 1850s or even as recently as 1960s , and Kaminsky said it was born on February 24 , 1935 with the establishment of The Dewey Society in Atlantic City .
Muir explains that our contemporary textbooks in education and philosophy of education rarely mention Isocrates at all .
He discovered a firm but unsubstantiated belief among many educational philosophers that there was some good reason for leaving Isocrates out of the histories .
See Muir for all the details of their errant reasoning and faulty or lacking evidence .
Why do modern educators overlook Isocrates ?
Muir gives these as the major reasons
At some point education theorists erroneously assumed that “ educational philosophy ” was a subset of “ general philosophy ” rather than an independent branch of philosophy .
Some modern theorists seem to have been searching for a history of American departments of education and American thought on education .
However , historical records of educational philosophy go back to the ancient Sophists and predate the birth of academic philosophy with Plato and Aristotle ’s Academy .
Educational philosophy has the right to create its own canon based on who actually wrote about education in a philosophical manner .
Somewhere in the early 20th century educational theorists stopped listening to what historians were saying about the history of educational philosophy .
Their refusal to listen is puzzling because Isocrates ’ influence on educational thought was being discussed by historians in the public media and was in high school history textbooks at the time .
Dewey ’s narrow and negative view of educational history was inaccurate and based on a straw - man argument .
Dewey believed in “ progress ” and leaving traditions behind .
While claiming that his approach was better than “ traditional ” approaches , he did not represent this history accurately .
John Dewey also “ perpetuated the narrow Victorian emphasis on ( state ) schooling as the primary subject matter of philosophy of education ” ( 171 ) .
But there is more to education and its history and philosophy than formal or state - run schooling .
Because Plato and Aristotle have such high status today , people seem to think they must have had the largest effect on educational history .
But in fact , “ it was Isocrates ’ program that prevailed ” ( Hadas , qtd. in Muir , 179 ) .
Histories of Experiential Learning also flawed
In particular , contemporary theories of experiential learning often credit Dewey for originating the idea that the primary aim of education is not transmission but rather socialization .
They credit Dewey for coming up with the idea of getting students to exercise their practical judgment while engaging with real life problems .
Yet this is exactly what Isocrates vehemently claimed and explained .
To confirm Muir ’s claim that people are not looking past Dewey in regard to experiential learning , I did a Google search
Web pages that use the term “ experiential learning ” and “ Dewey ” ?
Result = 56,600 , with 508 unique sites ( Google lists the first 508 sites and claims the rest were omitted because they were very similar to the ones already shown . )

Web pages that use the term “ experiential learning ” and BOTH “ Dewey ” AND “ Isocrates ” ? = 73 , with 31 unique sites .
Is “ rhetorical history & education ” the missing link ?
I ’d like to add my own suggestion for research here .
The troubled institutional history of rhetorical history & education is wrapped up in this narrative of historical forgetfulness and sloppy reasoning .
The disconnection between education and its own history happened in the late 19th and early to mid 20th century and is largely attributable to educators ’ worship of certain branches of … philosophy .
These branches of philosophy ( allied with Plato and Aristotle ) seem to be allergic to the Isocratean study and teaching of rhetoric .
They know that they have long been rivals .
They know that they have long been rivals .
The “ ivory tower ” and “ formal academic ” approach to learning and knowing tends to be at odds with a more experiential and practical approach to learning and knowing associated with rhetoric and Isocrates and Renaissance humanism and the medieval liberal arts .
The erasure of history in the 1960s coincides with the very same period at which we also see the erasure of Rhetorical Education ( and Isocrates ) from many disciplinary histories of Communication .
Even Thomas Miller had to point out to English departments that they arose out of 18th century Belletristic approaches to the study of Rhetoric .
Even Thomas Miller had to point out to departments that they arose out of 18th century Belletristic approaches to the study of Rhetoric .
Muir ’s article quotes rhetoricians including Kennedy , Haliwell , and Poulakos as among those who keep the knowledge of Isocrates alive .
Naturally , rhetorical historians have preserved the cultural memory of Isocrates — because Isocrates is known to be a rhetorician .
Could it be that the disjunction between 20th century educational philosophy and Isocrates has something to do with the fragmentation of rhetorical education across the curriculum and its subordination to more theoretical branches of English and Communication studies ?
At very least , it seems to me that pre-1800s educational history and rhetorical history are both the casualties of the arrogant , institutional , and antihistorical elements of modernism , progressivism and scientism .
Want to read more about Isocrates and Education ?
I would highly recommend the scholarly works of Takis Poulakos and Ekaterina Haskins that present Isocrates ’ rhetorical and educational practices in the context of ancient Greece and point out their contemporary relevance to civic education and the liberal arts .
Isocrates ’ works can be read online for free in the Perseus Digital Library .

While it ’s just the season ’s first week , that does n’t mean you are n’t already looking towards the waiver wire for a little help .
Maybe an injury has opened up a void .
Maybe you ’re just unhappy with your draft results .
Whatever the reasons , here ’s a few under - the - radar offensive options to look at :
Quarterback
Mark Sanchez – New York Jets
It ’s tough to lean on a rookie in his first career start , but Sanchez steps in to a pretty good situation .
The Jets are going to lean on the running game while trying to protect Sanchez , much like the Ravens did in 2008 with Joe Flacco .
He also gets to face a team in the Houston Texans who was in the bottom third in the league in defense last season , allowing 336.6 yards per game .
They did n’t do anything significant to upgrade either , outside of adding first round draft choice Brian Cushing at LB .
They were among the leagues worst in interceptions , with just 12 , so if the Jets can wear them down on the ground there should be plenty of opportunity for him to succeed .

Runningback
Ahmad Bradshaw – New York Giants
We all know the successes of last seasons Giants # 2 RB , Derrick Ward , who managed to rush for 1,000 yards despite being the understudy to Brandon Jacobs .
The third back in that vaunted trio , Bradshaw opens the season as the new Giants # 2 man , which could lead to some huge success .
Jacobs was banged up a bit in the final preseason game , something that has become a common occurrence for him .
He did return , but you still have to wonder how healthy he ’s going to be on Opening Day .
Facing the Redskins , running on the inside may be tough going , thanks to the new $ 100 million man in the middle of the defensive line , Albert Haynesworth .
If Jacobs is getting stuffed on the inside , or is still a bit banged up , they could turn to the speed of Bradshaw on the outside to get things going .

Wide Receiver
Sidney Rice – Minnesota Vikings
Let ’s make no mistake about it , Brett Favre is going to be coming out with something to prove .
He ’s been listening to everyone doubt him and it would n’t surprise me if he steps onto the field and torches the Cleveland Browns , led by his former coach Eric Mangini .
It ’s a season full of retribution for Favre , and Mangini is likely just the first on the hit list .
Bernard Berrian is going to be on one side , but he ’s likely to draw the most interest from the defense .
That should open things up for Rice , a player who we ’ve already discussed as having the potential to have a breakout campaign in 2009 ( click here to read the article ) .

Tight End
Brandon Pettigrew – Detroit Lions
We all know that tight end is a wild card position to begin with .
You just never know which player is going to step up and have a huge week .
With Pettigrew being named the starter for the Lions , as well as Matt Stafford being handed the starting role , it makes for a good combination .
When you have a rookie QB , they are going to be looking for an outlet .
They are going to be looking to get the ball out as quickly as possible .
Pettigrew was a first round draft pick , so we all know he can perform .
Look for him to try to prove to the masses right off the bat that he was deserving of his draft selection .

SHANGHAI  On July 5 , officials from China ’s Ministry of State Security took four employees of the Anglo - Australian mining giant Rio Tinto into custody here .
Rio Tinto was not told what happened to the employees ; neither were their families .
One of the four was a high - ranking executive and an Australian citizen .
But the Australian government was also in the dark .
A few days later , only after Rio Tinto had issued a public statement that said the company did not know why the four had been detained , did an answer come from Beijing : they were being held on charges of stealing state secrets , spying on China and harming the country ’s interests .
The allegations , which may be rooted in a pricing dispute , have rocked the global iron ore industry , strained China - Australia relations and could have a chilling effect on foreign businesses doing deals in China .
Companies with operations here have been closely watching the case .

While Bernard Madoff swindled tens of millions of dollars from one of the country 's leading Jewish charities , Hadassah , he was also having an affair with its chief financial officer , Sheryl Weinstein .
Weinstein reportedly admits the affair in a book to be published later this month , " Madoff 's Other Secret : Love , Money , Bernie and Me , " to be published by St. Martin 's Press on August 24 .
The book 's subject was first reported by Bloomberg News .
Weinstein had denied a romantic relationship with Madoff to ABC News earlier in the summer .
She is scheduled to appear on Good Morning America for her first exclusive television interview Aug. 25 .
Click here to go behind the scenes of Brian Ross ' investigation into Bernie and Ruth Madoff .
And she did not acknowledge the affair with Madoff when she testified against him at his sentencing hearing on June 29 and called him a " beast . "
She told Judge Denny Chin she had met Madoff 21 years ago at a business meeting when she was the chief financial officer of the Jewish women 's charity .
" I now view that day as perhaps the unluckiest day of my life , " she said as she described how her investments with Madoff cost her family its savings and the family home .
Click here for complete Blotter coverage of Madoff and his Ponzi scheme .
Weinstein did not return calls seeking comment today and it is not known how long her affair with Madoff lasted or whether or when she told her husband of 37 years about the extra-marital relationship .
She told the judge , with her husband seated beside her , that Madoff " should not be given the opportunity to walk into our society again . "
Madoff had his back to her as she spoke in court and did not turn around to look at her .
" If she wants to announce to the world that she had an affair , that 's her business , " said Madoff 's lawyer Ira Sorkin .
" I have no comment on the truth or falsity of what she says but I hope she takes some pleasure from telling everyone that she cheated on her husband . "
Madoff 's long - time secretary , Eleanor Squillari , recalled that Weinstein would often call Madoff and that " he would roll his eyes and then they would go and meet at a hotel . "
Asked about Squillari's account in July , Weinstein said she had no recollection of any such meeting .
" I have no idea why she would say that , " Weinstein said .
Hadassah Charity
According to Hadassah , the charity had invested more than $ 40 million with Madoff as of 1997 , when it stopped adding principal .
It believed its account was valued at $ 90 million when Madoff was arrested .
A spokesperson had no immediate comment on the affair involving its former chief financial officer and Madoff or on the role of Weinstein in placing the charity 's money with Madoff .

San Francisco tilts toward wind power WIND POWER
Task force recommends turbines throughout city
The two famous windmills in Golden Gate Park could soon have a lot of company as a broad array of city officials , business leaders and environmentalists push for streamlined , modern versions to spring up at famous spots all over the city .
Wind turbines could soon be built at Twin Peaks , Treasure Island , the Civic Center , Ocean Beach , the San Francisco Zoo , city parks and the airport as demonstration sites for how urban wind farms could help power San Francisco - and to educate residents in the hopes they 'll put them on their rooftops .
The recommendations are part of a report to be released today after a yearlong study of the potential of urban wind power , The Chronicle has learned .
" We should absolutely harness the wind , " said Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , who as a city supervisor in July 2008 joined Mayor Gavin Newsom in convening the urban wind power task force , which is publishing the report .
" Now if we could just harness the hot air that comes out of City Hall and the Capitol , we 'll have an answer to global warming , " Ammiano quipped .
The ideas proposed in the San Francisco study are intended to help the city reach its goal of being carbon neutral by 2030 .
While turbines are typically associated with farms and rural areas , cities like San Francisco are increasingly interested in using what is considered a cleaner energy generator .
Boston 's Logan Airport has turbines , and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has talked of installing them on skyscrapers .
But task force members said they are n't aware of another city that 's studied the idea in such detail .
Expanding wind power
San Francisco has just a few turbines now , but the 44 - member task force - composed of leaders in the wind industry , environmentalists , business representatives and others - envisions a lot more .
To get there , it wants the city to develop a wind map of San Francisco to show where the wind 's velocity , pressure , direction and turbulence would work best for installing turbines .
In addition , the group recommended the city partially offset the permitting costs for installing wind turbines , offer incentive programs for wind startups based in San Francisco , revise its green building codes to require that future buildings have space for turbines , and look at revising zoning rules that govern height limits for the turbines .
Newsom plans to move forward quickly with many of the report 's recommendations , some of which can be done through executive order .
" We want to build turbines wherever we can , " said his spokesman , Nathan Ballard - noting an urban wind farm could someday grace City Hall itself .
Newsom , who has made his environmental initiatives as mayor a centerpiece of his run for governor , has often been criticized for his green ideas that sound intriguing , but are impractical .
For example , he held multiple press conferences to support submerging giant turbines under the Golden Gate Bridge to harness energy , even though studies say it 's financially undoable .
The idea has stalled .
But the urban wind idea seems to have more across - the - board acceptance .
Business support
" The technology needs to evolve and regulations need to evolve , but I think it 's definitely viable , " said John Rizzo , political chairman of the Sierra Club 's Bay Area chapter , who has been a critic of Newsom 's eco ideas in the past .
Todd Pelman , president of Blue Green Pacific , which manufactures wind turbines in the Bayview , served on the task force .
He said there 's a long way to go in making the technology worthwhile for the average homeowner ; right now , devices small enough to be installed on a home do n't capture enough wind power to make the cost of roughly $ 3,000 worthwhile .
" The fact that they even initiated this task force is probably the greatest value , " he said .
" It shows a desire and aptitude to progress this technology forward . "
Another unlikely wind farm could soon appear in San Francisco : atop the W Hotel .
Michael Pace , general manager of the hotel , served on the task force and is trying to get funding to help the hotel pay to install two or three rooftop turbines .
He envisions leading tours for other businesses .
" The W is such an iconic building in San Francisco , it would have a lot of power from the marketing perspective , " he said , adding that he does n't believe wind power is one of those only - in - San Francisco ideas .
" I think wind is the next big thing , and we should n't be shy to stand up and say , ' We 're going to be first , ' " he said .

Given the widespread discontent about the rate of pay , it ’s not surprising that the police force is rife with corruption and bribe - taking .
Talk with any taxi driver or farmer in Lashkar Gah , and you ’ll hear stories about police shakedowns .
One farmer from the nearby town of Gereshk , who was transporting his wheat harvest to Lashkar Gah , said that a police officer had taken 1,000 Afghanis from him the previous week .
“ They will search your pockets and take money and valuables from you , ” he said , “ and you ca n’t say anything because you know you will have to deal with them again the next day . ”

Your short - term questions will be answered .
If , like many others , however , you watched or read Michael Thomsen 's treatise on why Metroid Prime is gaming 's Citizen Kane and wanted to hear a rebuttal consisting of more than a few incredulous facial expressions and a profane outburst , then you might want to read further .
I 'm tempted to add more background or summary just to get a third paragraph of introductory gibberish in , but that 's pretty much it .
Thomsen thinks Metroid Prime is comparable to Citizen Kane , and I think such a stance is borderline idiotic .
Hit the jump for my reasoning , absolutely none of which is a direct assault on the game 's quality .
First off , I 'm going to agree with Thomsen on one particular point : it 's not entirely unreasonable to make comparisons between works from different mediums .
The whole " Citizen Kane of games " cliche may be tired and silly , but it 's not outright pointless .
When someone talks about the " Citizen Kane of games , " they 're ( hopefully ) not trying to discuss how films and games are similar , or how one genre should be like the other , or how games need to be as respected as Citizen Kane now is in order to be taken seriously .
The comparison simply deals with utilization of a medium 's strengths .
Citizen Kane used cinematography and editing ( tools specific to the medium of cinema , and cinema alone ) to convey particular ideas or emotions that complemented , enhanced , and reflected back on the narrative .
Welles did n't use deep focus or forced perspective because they looked kinda cool -- he did the things he did because they evoked specific emotional and intellectual reactions in and of themselves , in a way completely unique to cinema .
Under Welles ' direction , the filmmaker 's tools of the trade were no longer a simple means to an end , but rather became provocative rhetorical devices in their own right .
So , no , I do n't think it 's unreasonable to ask or search for a game that utilizes videogame - specific strengths to convey particular ideas or emotions .
I do think it is unreasonable to say that Metroid Prime is that game , and then back such a hefty statement up with a series of completely irrelevant examples .
Thomsen 's argument is that in the same way every aspect of Kane unites to tell the story of the protagonist and convey the film 's themes , every aspect of Metroid Prime 's design contributes toward ... well , I 'll let Thomsen speak for himself :
" In the same way that Citizen Kane harnessed every technical component in film to express its post - mortem reassembly of an irrepressible and heartbroken man , Metroid Prime uses all of its technology to recreate the experience of a woman abandoned on an alien world inhabited by the ghosts of its prelapsarian inhabitants . "
Consider that sentence .
Really consider it .
Roll it around in your head .
Read it a few more times .
Speak it aloud .
Think about the implications of what is actually being said in that single statement .
Really -- do it .
Because it is one of the single silliest sentences you will ever read .
It 's not that it 's incorrect -- far from it .
Much of Metroid Prime 's cosmetic design , and many of its mechanics , do indeed dramatize the experience of being alone on an alien world ( though , as commenter Tubatic pointed out , Thomsen 's description of Samus as being " abandoned " is n't correct ; Samus can leave whenever she wants ) .
The problem is that this comparison completely disregards the historical and artistic weight of the Citizen Kane comparison by focusing on arbitrary , irrelevant similarities between the two .
Thomsen opens his editorial by drawing arbitrary similarities between both projects ' similarities during production ( both almost got canceled a lot , both had gifted people working on them ) , then goes on to say that you care about Samus because , rather than being given info through a noninteractive cut scene , you are reminded of her humanity everytime you see her reflection in a laser blast .
Everytime she winces in pain .
Everytime drops of water bead on her visor .
So what ?
Firstly , you could make the same arguments about the irrelevant cosmetic choices in most videogames .
In the original Mario Bros , you are never allowed to forget that you are playing as an italian plumber .
Never .
His avatar is constantly on screen , and when he dies , he turns to the player with an expression of sad resignation and an equally dejected shrug .
The player is never informed of Mario 's motivations , mood , or existence through the cinematic tool of cut scenes .
But who the fuck cares ?
Seeing Charles Foster Kane infinitely reflected in a series of mirrors speaks volumes about the man , the plot , and human nature in general ; it conjures up thoughts of seeing a man fade away into the distance , yet also the powerful sense of a being whose power and pride falsely make him feel eternal and larger than life .
A single shot from Kane uses cinematography , editing , acting , and all the other film - specific tools to convey incredibly complex and deep ideas without actually using words .
Seeing Samus
Aran 's eyes reflected in her goddamn visor does n't actually say anything .
It says : you 're playing as a human woman .
It says : you just fired a particularly powerful blaster shot at something which is very close to you , and this is your visual reward .
Citizen Kane uses its cinematic conventions to express verbally inexpressable concepts of loss and pride and hate and corruption and sanity and the fractured nature of truth and reality .
Metroid Prime uses its graphical touches to express the story of Shooting Space Pirates in the Face .
I do n't want to play the snobbish art critic and claim that escapist art is somehow inferior to highbrow fare , but for Christ 's sake -- the man is likening a work of incredible thematic depth and emotional complexity to a game which is about nothing more than having fun , solving puzzles , and shooting stuff .
That 's what you 're going to show to Ebert to convince him videogames are a legitimate art form ?
You 're going to show him the morph bomb and expect him to nod repeatedly , and admit that the story of an extinct bird race and a woman with a bazooka on her arm is just as meaningful as La Dolce Vita ?
Seriously ?
If you want to really stretch and attribute completely ludicrous meaning to this aesthetic choice , I suppose you could argue that Samus is a creature of violence and death just like those she fights , and every blaster bolt attempts to frequently remind you that you , as Samus , are a reflection of that which you destroy .
But that would be idiotic , and completely unsupported by the narrative or gameplay .
And that 's not what Thomsen was saying .
Thomsen was saying that these game - specific methods of conveying intensely shallow information make Metroid Prime similar to Citizen Kane .
Even if the information the player received were not completely irrelevant , however , one single point would still prove Thomsen 's argument entirely untenable : the cosmetic touches he describes are not specific to videogames .
When Samus Aran cries out and water beads on her visor , that 's not gameplay .
It 's not even specific to the medium of videogames -- you could put those exact same visual touches in a film , or painting , or graphic novel , and nothing would be lost .
Nothing about the player 's interaction reflects , or is reflected back by , those cosmetic touches ( except in that the visual feedback is initiated by the player 's actions , which in itself is n't a good enough reason ; so are cut scenes , which are just as noninteractive as the water droplets ) .
You wanna talk about the Citizen Kane of videogames ?
Then why not talk about games where actual gameplay conveys ideas and emotions rather than pointless cosmetic crap ?
Why not talk about the mechanical metaphors at work in Braid , or the murder mechanics of Shadow of the Colossus , or a thousand other games that actually attempt to explore the aesthetic power of interactivity ?
I would never argue that any of these games represent the Citizen Kane of gaming , but they'd be infinitely better examples than a game whose artistic merits do n't extend beyond the surface - level nonsense Thomsen cites .
Yes , sure , you can infer some relatively shallow plot details from the environment , which is a completely game - specific method of conveying story .
However , a hundred games accomplish this goal with much more depth and efficiency than Metroid Prime ( Portal , BioShock ) , and , again , I 'm not sure I 'd even compare those games to Citizen Kane .
Why ?
Because games are so disrespected by the mainstream ( a group which , presumably , the viewers of ABC belong to ) that when you compare something to Citizen Kane , you 're not just saying that the two works are similar in a few different ways -- you 're saying that the work represents a watershed moment for its given medium .
You 're saying that it 's incredibly important to the canon .
You 're saying that this work , while it may not be your personal favorite , showcases the strengths of its own medium like no other work .
Whether you want to or not .
But Thomsen compares the two works , and what does he come up with ?
An argument that can be effectively boiled down to :
- The producers were both really talented and both were almost canceled a few times
- You can see water droplets on her visor
- There are n't any cut scenes
- Inferring plot stuff from checking out the environment is kind of similar to the reporters in Citizen Kane trying to infer the meaning of Rosebud by exploring Kane 's past
- Both are sort of hard to put into defined genres
- Both were n't really successful upon initial release .
Thomsen did n't call his article , " A few ways in which Metroid Prime is like Citizen Kane in certain respects . "
If he had , you would n't be reading this article .
No -- he argued that Metroid Prime is " our Citizen Kane . "
To make a statement with that degree of artistic and historical weight , and then back it up with such intensely shallow examples , is fucking ridiculous .
It would be equivalent to me arguing that Peanut Butter Crunch is the Christian Bible of breakfast cereal because both have the letter " B " in the title .
I quote Niero , our site 's founder :
" Here 's an opportunity to showcase how far storytelling in video games has come to the non-gaming general public on prime - time television .
As these people are inching towards their television to see what they 've been missing in the world of video games , they are reassured that they 've missed nothing -- it 's still just a sci - fi nerd hobby where [ a hero with ] an arm cannon blow [s ] away space bugs . "
As games writers , we 're not responsible for changing the way the rest of the world thinks about games .
I 'm not even sure if it matters that the rest of the world takes games seriously .
But I do know one thing : that Citizen Kane is Citizen Kane , and Metroid Prime is Metroid Prime , and comparing the two on the Web site for one of the major news outlets in America in the most shallow and irrelevant way possible kind of makes our most beloved art form look like kid 's stuff , and us like a bunch of idiots .
And so , I ask again : are you fucking kidding me ?
If you ’ve heard an ignorant comment like that , you ’ve probably been to any of a thousand online forums .
People love to demonize others for overspending and overeating , especially behind the anonymity of online commenting .
Nothing drives me crazier than people who ignore decades of research to judge others for their supposed lack of willpower .
This is why you ’ll see the personal - responsibility zealots who repeatedly chant , “ Ugh , let ’s talk about personal responsibility , ” as if that simplistic argument explains why people who genuinely want to spend and eat less simply cannot .
This superb New York Times article offers more evidence of ancillary factors in behavioral change :
“ I have grave concerns about how many of these television shows stigmatize overweight people by making them a spectacle , ” said Kelly D. Brownell , director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale .
“ They suggest that if you only try hard enough you can be thin .
A far better message is that it ’s hard to lose weight and that it ’s not just willpower and personal responsibility , but that both biology and the environment are players . ”
I ’ve written about the similarities between food and personal finance before .
Former FDA commissioner David Kessler has written a terrific book describing how food companies systematically engineer foods to overeaten ( including designing foods that can be swallowed quicker so we can consumer more and more in one sitting ) .
These are tested , refined , and optimized processes , not mere accidents .
Most importantly , behavioral change is not simply about trying harder .
Yes , effort is important , but whether it ’s passive barriers or the variety of other reasons that illustrate how personal finance is not about more willpower , let ’s be real : Behavioral change is incredibly complex and difficult .
Anyone who believes people overeat and overspend simply because of a lack of willpower is simplistically ignoring decades of research so they can ideologically mislead themselves .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
South Korea leads the world in providing broadband services , according to a study released on Thursday .
The United States did not make the top 10 .
South Korea dramatically improved the speed , quality and availability of its Internet service in 2009 , pushing past Japan , the former worldwide leader , according to a team of business students from the University of Oxford in England and the University of Oviedo in Spain .
The study , sponsored by Cisco ( CSCO , Fortune 500 ) , examined 66 countries and 240 cities .
Broadband leadership was measured by various factors , including the number of wired households , where South Korea scored 97 % .
Hong Kong , which was rated number three in overall broadband leadership , had an even higher penetration , at 99 % .
In terms of overall leadership , Hong Kong was followed by Sweden , Switzerland , the Netherlands , Singapore , Luxembourg , Denmark and Norway .
The United States did not make the list 's top 10 , even though it made " significant , above average improvements " in quality , the study said .
In terms of broadband Internet quality , the U.S. lags behind not only Sweden , which leads Europe , but the island nations of Malta and Iceland , and the former Soviet Bloc country of Lithuania .
The top three cities with the best overall broadband services -- Yokohama , Nagoya and Sapporo -- were all in Japan , the study said .
Japan also led the way for providing quality services outside major cities .
But the study showed that the biggest digital quality divide between urban and rural areas was in Lithuania , Russia and Latvia .
" The Broadband Quality Study shows us which countries have made real moves towards the Internet of the future , " said Professor Maria Rosalia Vicente of the University of Oviedo , in a written statement .
" It also provides fresh evidence of the urban - versus - rural quality divide .
The challenge for countries now is to bridge this quality divide . "
The study 's researchers judged broadband quality by measuring upload and download speeds , network latency and capacity .
For their benchmarking , they tested out typical applications used today such as video streaming , Web browsing and social networking .
But they also took a look at which countries have the broadband quality necessary for handling future applications , like high definition Internet television and video communications , which they expect to become common in the next three to five years .
That list features nine countries , including the leaders South Korea , Japan and Sweden , as well as former Soviet nations Lithuania , Bulgaria and Latvia .
The U.S. did n't make the cut .

( CNN ) --
The " disgusting " blob in Fred DeNegri's Diet Pepsi can was probably a frog or toad , the Food and Drug Administration said .
Amy DeNegri took pictures of the can in question right after her husband gagged on its contents .
DeNegri was grilling in his backyard tiki bar in Ormond Beach , Florida , when he popped open a can of Diet Pepsi , took a big gulp and started gagging , his wife , Amy , said .
He emptied out the can down a sink but something heavy remained inside .
He shook the can until something resembling " pink linguini " slid out , followed by " dark stuff , " Amy DeNegri said .
But the heavy object inside the can never came out , she said .
" It was disgusting , " said Amy DeNegri , 54 .
" And now , what started out as a normal afternoon in our tiki bar has blown up into this crazy thing . "
The DeNegris took pictures before calling poison control and the FDA , which showed up the next day to examine the can in question and collect it for lab testing .
The couple received a copy of the completed report last week from the Food and Drug Administration Office of Regulatory Affairs , which concluded the foreign matter appeared to be a frog or a toad .
Watch CNN 's Nicole Lapin discuss the results »
" The animal was lacking internal organs normally found in the abdominal and thoracic cavity , " the report notes .
A second , closed can from the same 36 - pack of Diet Pepsi from Sam's Club , was also submitted for testing , according to Amy DeNegri .
No abnormalities were detected , the report states .
The FDA also conducted an investigation at the local Pepsi bottling plant in Orlando from August 4 to 11 and " did not find any adverse conditions or association to this problem , " spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey said .
" We have not determined when or how the contamination occurred , " DeLancey said in an e-mail .
Pepsi says the FDA results " affirmed " the company 's confidence " in the quality of our products and the integrity of our manufacturing system , " according to spokesman Jeff Dahncke .
" The speed of our production lines and the rigor of our quality control systems make it virtually impossible for this type of thing to happen in a production environment .
In fact , there never has been even a single instance when a claim of this nature has been traced back to a manufacturing issue , " Dahncke said in an e-mail .
" The FDA conducted a thorough inspection of our Orlando facility and found no cause for concern .
In this case , the FDA simply was unable to determine when or how the specimen entered the package . "
When asked if Pepsi believed it was not responsible for the animal getting into the can , Dahncke said , " We have addressed the facts of the investigation and stated our position .
It 's not appropriate for us to comment beyond that . "
But the DeNegris say they 're hopping mad over Pepsi 's handling of the matter .
Amy DeNegri said she has n't heard from Pepsi since the day after the incident occurred , when she spoke with someone over the phone .
At first , the woman was apologetic , but DeNegri says her attitude changed after she told her that the FDA was coming to take the can for testing .
" She asked for my pictures , I sent them and never heard back , " she said .
The retired school staffer says she and her husband are seeking legal advice to examine their options .
" I want to see Pepsi fess up to it and compensate my husband for the negative publicity they have caused , " she said .
" I 'm easy , but they 're the ones that are making it hard . "
CNN 's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report .

The killer app for the iPhone / iPod Touch is the App Store .
85,000 + apps have been written and , via the App Store , 2 billion copies of those apps have been downloaded .
Apple gets 30 % of the revenue ; the developers , 70 % .
Everyone has been making a lot of money .
That gold rush is about to be over .
Who ’s talking ?
Bruce Tognazzini was hired at Apple by Steve Jobs and Jef Raskin in 1978 , where he remained for 14 years , founding the Apple Human Interface Group .
He remains a major Apple fan , which is why , when they could do better , he feels compelled to talk about it .
Apple , by all appearance , designs its hardware and software for a single user Steve Jobs .
This is , in many ways , an excellent idea .
Steve has always been and continues to be fanatical about design , usability , and salability .
It was a successful formula for the creation of the Mac , and it continues to be a successful formula .
The only problem is , there are other people in the world who are not like Steve .
For example , there are people that not only examine a product from every possible angle , but actually use it .
A lot .
Some of us have thousands of songs .
Some of us have tens of thousands of photographs .
Some of us have hundreds of apps .
We are drowning .
I ’ve discussed the general problem in my Flatland series .
In this article , I want to present a simple solution to Springboard 's current limitations , limitations that are about to plateau app sales , costing both Apple and its developers billions of dollars .
What 's wrong with today 's Springboard 1.0 ?
Springboard is the formal name of the home screen on the iPhone / iPod Touch .
Like the Mac Finder or the Windows Desktop , Springboard enables you to find the particular app you need .
Unlike the Finder or Desktop , rather than giving access to as many apps as you could possibly want , the current Springboard limits you to 180 apps .
Paradoxically , this would not be a bad upper limit on a Mac or PC , as apps tend to equal trouble and the more you have , the more trouble you ’ll encounter .
On the iPhone / iPod Touch , however , 180 apps is terribly limiting as iPhone / iPod Touch apps translate to fun , not trouble , and the more apps you have , the more fun you can have .
My favorite app is the App Store .
A particularly foolish study a few months ago discovered horrors !that most people stop using new apps after only a few days .
Wow !
These users spent 30 minutes wandering the aisles of the app store , then several hours playing with their new toy , and , after three days , abandoned it .
And here they were out a full 99 cents !
99 cents for several hours of recreation , including the initial half - hour of recreational shopping , sounds like a pretty good deal to me !
It 's kept me coming back more than 200 times .
One reason people never return to an app after three days is that , should they get interested again , they can no longer find it , hidden as it is , randomly slotted on one of eleven look - alike Springboard pages .
Yes , Apple does give you the ability to sort out your apps , but that quickly breaks down when you have , for example , one and a half pages - worth of travel apps , a quarter page of medical , 7/8ths pages of scientific instruments , etc .
With a fixed upper limit of 11 pages , with no way to label pages , and without sufficient space on pages to hold all one 's apps for that category , things begin to break down .
As one approaches the 180 - app upper limit , the pages descend into chaos , as new apps randomly place themselves in any available spaces , with nowhere logical to move them .
Once you hit the maximum number of apps , apps just start falling off the edge .
This is apparently already happening in sufficient numbers that Apple , in 3.0 , released an all - too - typical programmer hack :
They enabled users to have invisible apps they can call up using Search as long as they can remember the app ’s exact Name .
For example , if you have the American Automobile Association app , you have to type in " AAA " .
Oh , wait !
It 's not called " AAA " , it 's called " Roadside " !
What are the chances you 're going to remember that two years from now when your car breaks down ?
Note to programmers :
The only people with a good enough abstract memory to use this hack are other programmers .
A New Springboard 2.0 Design
All of the above issues brought me to this new design .
I make no legal intellectual - property claim to what follows .
Anyone can use it , preferably Apple .
I expect no recompense if for no other reason than it is obvious , so obvious Apple should have done it already , certainly by 3.0 .
I have purposely made this new design compatible with the old , both so users would n't face a sharp new learning curve and so that it might better pass the " Steve Test " :
This new iPhone Springboard , unless and until such time as a user chooses to invoke the new features , could continue to look exactly the same as the app looks now .
Springboard Improvement One : Page Labels
Remove two rows of blank pixels between each row of app icons , slide the horizontal row of dots that indicate which of the myriad pages you are on up to the top and add a user - modifiable label to the current dot , thereby labeling the currently - displayed page .
Sliding the label left or right will rapidly flip pages , with the current label temporarily mirrored large and centered on the display so the user can see what page they are going to be landing on .
( Recall they are covering the labelled button with their finger . )
Or , hold the label for a second and it will open as a fall - down , enabling the user to directly touch the label for the page of their choice .
Springboard Page with Draggable Label Apple could initially show no labels at all so that the new user would encounter no added complexity .
When the user has entered edit mode by holding down an icon until they all begin to wiggle , allow the user to enter / change the current page 's label .
Easier , batch editing might take place in the iTunes editor on the user ’s Mac or PC .
This editing could include a table of suggested labels that would mirror the categories in the app store .
Springboard Improvement Two : Vertical Scroll Right now , you can scroll horizontally to move among pages .
Users should be able to scroll vertically within pages .
I have many more apps that touch on travel , for example , than can fit on a single Springboard page .
Vertical scrolling will enable me to access two , three , four , or even more screenfulls of those apps .
There are lots more apps I would like to buy , apps that add only limited value to my life .
I no longer even consider them because there ’s nowhere to put them .
For example , I travel to London at least a couple times per year .
I ’d like several apps pertaining just to London , including maps , subway schedules , etc .
No can do .
Nowhere to put them .
Vertical scroll would set off a " silver rush , " as people bought all the apps they now want , but that are n’t so good as to displace the " gold " ones they already have .
It would also enable many of us , for the first time , to use the Safari " Add to Home Screen " feature to create fast website shortcuts .
Springboard Home Page in Mid-Scroll Vertical scrolling would not move page - at - a - time the way horizontal scrolling does .
Users , instead , could scroll row - by - row .
They could also " throw " the page vertically and have the window scroll down rapidly , in the manner of the address book .
Only when the window begins to come to a stop would it gain hysteresis and lock to a break in the icons , rather than midway across an icon .
( The illustration , above , shows the appearance during movement , not at rest . )
The suggested vertical - position dots , based on Apple 's horizontal - position dots , enable the user to tell at a glance how many screenfuls of icons there are and where in that long page they currently are .
Note that the top dot is a little over 3/ 4 lit and the second dot is a little under 1 / 4 lit , with the remaining two at neutral , indicating that we have just begun scrolling the first row .
Springboard Improvement Three : User - Controlled Icon Positioning Instead of copying the highly - flexible Mac Desktop , Springboard inadvertently ended up copying the Windows 95 Desktop , with icons auto - positioning themselves ever - upward , ever - leftward .
Users should be able to place icons anywhere they want with intervening spaces as they wish .
Such spaces act as big cues to let people know if they have hit the right page or not .
They give differing pages an instantly - recognizable “ look . ”
Forcing every page to look much like every other page , as the current scheme does , increases error and slows users down .
Each page , even viewed in this reduced size ,
has an immediately obvious , unique " look "
The current scheme also prevents users from clustering apps , making searches within a page difficult as well .
With the new iTunes Springboard editor already in place , by adding vertical scrolling with its increased space for icons , there will no longer any reason for forcing icons into being scrunched up against one another .
( Icons should still snap to grid .
That is still a good thing . )
Springboard Improvement Four : Containers Springboard needs to introduce Containers , whether they look , in their closed appearance , like traditional folders or bear some other appearance .
Touching one might open it up as a slightly - offset window that would overlay the screen behind it .
Within would be a maximum of sixteen icons visible , plus the ability to scroll .
Such containers would also offer a list view , for document storage , etc .
What would you use such a container for ?
Documents , certainly , and , if not Gold or Silver apps , perhaps your Aluminum apps , to abuse my earlier metaphor .
A couple of examples from an actual power - usermyself .
My wife and I travel more than half the year .
If we only went to London and New York , our scrolling Springboard Travel page would do the trick , but we do n’t :
We visit dozens of cities , and I ’d like to have one or more apps covering some aspect of each of those cities .
I want to have a container for each city containing tour guides , subway info , web bookmarks for favorite restaurants , etc .
I have also discovered I have a thing for compasses and compass - supported apps .
Not only do I have the Apple Compass , I have a sun compass , a vertical ball compass , Huckleberry , a compass superimposed on a camera view , and the coolest compass - dependent app ever , DishPointer AR , used for finding a spot with a clear view of the sky for satellite TV and Internet antenna placement .
( Check out the YouTube of it here . )
I ’ve recently had to dump some of my favorite compasses because there was nowhere to put them .
Give me a compass container !
" But wait ! " you say , " you 're not a typical user any more than Steve Jobs is ! "
True , I 'm on the other end of the bell - shaped curve , the end that buys buckets of apps .
I not only take great pleasure in supporting my local independent developer , I 'm also a leading indicator : I ran out of app room months ago .
That means a lot of other free - spenders are getting really close , if they are not there already , and we free - spenders " mooches " in sales parlance are not the customers you want to shut out .
Even people who do n't vacuum up every app that comes along could benefit from containers , however .
Consider all the highly - aluminum apps like a little heart that auto-dials your sweetheart or another that calls 911 .
Such clusters of apps could all be placed in a single container that would replace your phone app now , giving you really rapid access ( see my article on Fitts ' Law ) to the numbers you call most .
Of course , your phone app would be in there , too , for all the other people you need to call .
( That particular class of app would also be many - fold more useful if users were permitted to change the names of their apps .
I could buy one auto - dial widget and clone it , with each clone having a unique name and phone number .
Ability - to - rename would also solve the problem of the AAA app being called " Roadside , " discussed earlier . )
Springboard Improvement Five : Multiple Links Finally , Springboard should allow me to have the same app appear in multiple places .
The added complexity the first four changes represent to the user ’s environment will create the same need for aliases as exist on Macs or Shortcuts on the PC .
They should , however , all be first - class links to the underlying app , rather than one " real " app with multiple aliases .
The user would have the power , in iTunes , to remove the app and all its pointers simultaneously .
On the iPhone , each pointer could be removed individually , with the last causing a dialog to appear announcing that removal of the last will also remove the app .
Alias creation might take place within the Springboard app or might , particularly initially , be limited to the iTunes editor .
I 've offered the example of different containers for different cities to which I travel .
Some apps go beyond covering a single city , spanning an entire country or the whole world .
I may want to place aliases to those apps in many different containers so that , for example , everything I use for London , whether London - specific or more general - purpose , is in the London container , all available with a single icon-touch .
Conclusion
All of these changes work within the current Springboard metaphor and should not present any insurmountable programming challenges .
Certainly vertical scroll is most critical and should be implemented within the next couple of months if sales are not to be further limited .
The rest can follow .
These changes are also designed so that the new user or disinterested user will enjoy the same Springboard experience as today , while the " power - buyer " can regain control of their device .
Because iPhone / iPod
Touch apps , at least at this point , all work one - at - a - time , adding ten or even twenty times as many apps to an iPhone / iPod Touch should have no effect on its reliability , etc .
The only effect of these changes will be that both Apple and its developers make a whole bunch more money and that users will be having a whole bunch more fun , making their personal Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy that much more beloved and indispensable .
Beyond
This is not an exhaustive list of things badly needed on the iPhone .
A number of readers have raised the need for tags .
This is something that Apple has already indicated it is working on , at least for Springboard .
Tags are needed badly to make the Search function on the iPhone actually work and could act as an alternative to links within Springboard itself .
Their support is needed even more for photos and songs .
Try finding one of thousands of songs or tens of thousands of photos on an iPhone and you 'll immediately recognize the problem .

But with both men now past their 40th birthdays and no significant fights looming for either , they finally nailed down the elusive deal , signing an agreement Friday for a light heavyweight fight sometime in the first quarter of 2010 , both sides told ESPN.com .
It will be televised on HBO PPV .
" Sixteen years ago they fought each other and went on and made history in their own way , " said Golden Boy CEO Richard Schaefer , Hopkins ' promoter .
" Each one is considered today as ring royalty .
That 's why I think when those two guys are going to fight it will be to determine who will be king of the ring .
We went back and forth for so long , but we finally pulled it off .
They both signed and they will fight .
It will be a truly historic showdown .
A lot of people did n't believe it would ever happen .
But guess what ?
It 's going to happen . "
However , the deal is contingent on Jones ' first winning a Dec. 2 fight in Australia against Australian cruiserweight Danny Green , which has been planned for a couple of months .
Also as part of their deal , Hopkins is allowed to take an interim fight before the end of the year .
In an interview at Schaefer 's downtown Los Angeles office , he said Hopkins , who has n't fought since easily outpointing Kelly Pavlik 11 months ago , was inclined to fight a tune - up bout .
Schaefer said he was working on a plan under which Hopkins would fight in his hometown of Philadelphia against an opponent to be determined on the same day as Jones ' fight in Australia .
Under the terms of the agreement , Jones ( 54 - 5 , 40 KOs ) and Hopkins ( 49 - 5 - 1 , 32 KOs ) agreed to split the revenue 50 - 50 , which had always been the sticking point .
If there is a knockout or a TKO , the winner of the fight will get 60 percent and the loser 40 percent .
" I do n't like that at all , " Jones , 40 , said of the knockout provision .
" I love it .
I absolutely love it .
Love it .
That is all I can say .
I 'm definitely looking forward to this fight .
The fans have wanted to see it for a long time .
For the longest time , he would n't take it .
Now he 's taking it .
I 'm ecstatic .
I can't wait . "
Jones said he thought about pulling out of the Green fight but wo n't because he had given his word and signed a contract .
John Wirt , CEO of Jones ' promotional company , said Jones was receiving a " multimillion dollar payday " for the fight with Green .
" I'm in a very difficult situation , " said Jones , who would be 41 for the Hopkins fight .
" I respect Green .
I know we signed and I thought maybe I should just pull out .
But I can't deny Danny .
This is one of the biggest fights in the history of his country .
This is how it is .
So I 'll give him the biggest fight in his country and that will get me ready for Hopkins and the biggest fight in my country .
I 'd rather let the Green fight go , but I 'm a man of my word .
It would n't be fair to back out on him now .
" It 's time to take care of my business and then come back here and beat Bernard Hopkins . "
Before either man became a star , they met for a vacant middleweight title on May 22 , 1993 with Jones winning a clear unanimous decision .
Jones would go on to dominate the sport as the pound - for - pound king for about a decade and win titles in four divisions .
Hopkins would later claim the middleweight title after Jones left the division and go on to make a division - record 20 defenses before moving up and claiming the light heavyweight championship .
" I beat him with one hand the first time , " Jones said of their first fight , in which he fought with a damaged right hand .
" What am I worried about ? "
The sides have other smaller issues to work out , such as which fighter gets first billing , who walks to the ring first and who is announced first .
Wirt said the sides agreed to settle all of the outstanding issues with a coin flip .
" This is a straight up 50 - 50 deal , " Wirt said .
" We 'll settle everything with a coin flip .
We 're going to have a commemorative coin made with Roy 's face on one side and Bernard 's on the other and use it to decide everything .
We 'd like to get that televised on ESPN .
It would be fun . "
Schaefer and Wirt gave a lot of credit to HBO 's Mark Taffet for bringing the sides together .
Jones had been on board with a 50 - 50 deal .
Getting Hopkins , who would be 45 for the fight , was more difficult , but they made a lot of progress during a meeting in Las Vegas last week among between Schaefer , Hopkins and Taffet .
" There have been a lot of people who worked very hard , but a lot of credit goes to Mark , who shepherded this thing through and really helped make it happen , " Wirt said .
Schaefer said there is no site yet for the fight , but that he and Wirt would speak to venues in Las Vegas , New York and Atlantic City , N.J. , although they preferred Las Vegas .

OTTAWA – The Supreme Court of Canada has agreed to hear the Conservative government 's appeal of orders to seek the return from a Guantanamo prison of 22 - year - old Omar Khadr .
In addition , the high court agreed to a federal request to weigh the matter on an expedited basis , setting a date of Nov. 13 and raising the prospect of the court hearing the high - stakes case during a threatened federal election .
The Liberals have already raised Khadr 's treatment as a reason to reject the Conservative government .
" We feel very strongly that a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian , said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff in Vancouver .
He said the government never should have resisted a " range of court decisions " compelling it to act .
" We find it extraordinary that the Conservative government would take this right up to the Surpeme Court when we 're talking about a Canadian citizen , " Ignatieff said .
" Canadians have different views about Mr. Khadr 's conduct , but that 's not the issue .
This man is a Canadian citizen .
Guantanamo needs to be closed .
Canadians believe we should do our part in closing Guantanamo .
And why is the Conservative government resisting something that 's clearly in Mr. Khadr 's interest , and in the interest of global peace and security ?
Guantanamo's not exactly been a bright star in global human rights . "
NDP critic Joe Comartin said the court 's decision to hear the appeal is not a surprise and will now set out what a court 's role is in correcting the actions or inaction of government officials where they are found to violate a citizen 's Charter rights .
No one in the federal government would comment , including Justice Minister Rob Nicholson who repeatedly declined to address reporters questions at a news conference .
In response to this morning 's decision , a spokesperson for Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon released the identical talking points as were issued two weeks ago , when the Conservatives announced the decision to appeal .
Cannon 's statement stresses the Conservatives adopted the position of two previous Liberal governments : that Khadr is accused of " serious crimes . "
It said the Obama administration has not indicated whether it will proceed with Khadr 's prosecution in light of the president 's decision to close the Guantanamo detention camps .
The federal government is seeking to reverse orders this summer by a Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal .
The Justice Department argues it would be a dramatic and fundamental change to allow courts to interfere with the ability of the executive branch of government to decide how to conduct matters of foreign policy and relations .
Federal lawyers also argue that allowing the repatriation orders to stand would create a new , and undefined , positive " duty to protect " nationals imprisoned abroad that is not recognized in any international law nor under any other country 's domestic law .
Now those issues will be decided by the country 's top court in a ruling that could come within six months after the Nov. 13 hearing .
As is custom , the court 's decision on the application for leave to appeal was released without reasons .
The Supreme Court takes on cases of " national importance " or cases where the law is unclear because of dissents on key legal issues in the lower courts .
The high court had ruled in 2008 that interviews conducted by Canadian CSIS and foreign affairs officials in 2003 and 2004 breached his Charter rights .
It ordered the federal records of the interviews , which were shared with American authorities , disclosed to Khadr .
Khadr 's Canadian lawyers had argued this time that the high court should not hear the federal appeal .
They said the Khadr case was unique , and that the country 's top court had already laid out the legal principles that the lower courts relied on to order Prime Minister Stephen Harper to return the young Toronto man to his home .
Khadr is a member of a notorious family whose father , Ahmed Said Khadr , was an Osama bin Laden supporter later killed by Pakistani forces .
Omar Khadr was arrested at age 15 in Afghanistan after a deadly gunfight at an al Qaeda compound left a U.S. special forces medic , Christopher Speer , dead .
Khadr 's supporters argue he should be considered a " child soldier " who was indoctrinated by a domineering father , and should be brought back to Canada to be rehabilitated .
The Canadian government has long argued Khadr should face trial under the U.S. military justice system , which took custody of him immediately .
Khadr was jailed first at Bagram military base and later in Guantanamo Bay , where he was subjected to a " frequent flyer " program of sleep deprivation to prepare him for aggressive questioning .
That treatment was known to Canadian officials just prior to the third interview conducted by a Canadian foreign affairs official in March 2004 .
The U.S. administration is still weighing what to do with Khadr 's case , which is set to resume later this month , in light of a decision by U.S. President Barack Obama to shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison .
This piece was first published in September 2009 as part of our roundup of the 2000s .
In it , author Nitsuh Abebe traces the slow encroachment of typically " indie " cultural touchstones and sensibilities into corners of mainstream advertising , film , television , and , of course , music .
The fallout from this process -- recently evidenced by the Twilight : New Moon soundtrack to Grizzly Bear soundtracking a large Volkswagen ad campaign to Vampire Weekend hitting # 1 on the Billboard album charts -- has created tension in some circles and has been embraced in others .
As we concluded in September , this is a natural process and worth embracing -- moments of tension and doubt within nominally independent cultures often signal bursts of creative energy , inspiring new developments .

" I opened up the door , and much to my surprise *
The girls were wearing formals , and the boys were wearing ties
* And I feel that I should mention that the band was at attention
They just stood there , oh so neat , while they played their swinging beat ....
It 's been long overdue -- we 've been needing something new --
Sophisticated boom boom ! "
-- The Goodies , 1964
So have you heard ?
Indie rock is the choice of a new generation !
Allegedly !
Do n't let the exclamation points fool you into thinking I 'm being sarcastic !
Just try selling iPods or straight - leg jeans without knowing what fresh - faced guitar band is the hip new thing ; just try telegraphing to audiences that a character on your television show is quite special and interesting .
Stephenie Meyer , author of Twilight , not often accused of lacking insight into the hearts of America 's young , just told the world what her favorite records were this summer -- Grizzly Bear and Animal Collective among them .
( Do you think that 's awesome , or does it make you want to listen to nothing but rap mixtapes and noise ? )
I just read an article by a pretty likeable 57 - year - old who 'd decided indie rock was really interesting , that older people should check it out , and that Wilco were probably its godfathers .
( That makes more sense than you 'd think . )
And it 's not like charts mean what they used to , but still : they 're home to the Shins ( # 2 record ) , Wilco ( three records in the top 10 ) , Arcade Fire ( 17 weeks ) , Interpol ( 24 weeks ) , and Death Cab for Cutie , who went to # 1-- as in , knocking off Neil Diamond and being replaced at the top by 3 Doors Down , that # 1 -- without even much changing their sound from a decade ago .
Toward the end of the 1990s the Flaming Lips were the kinds of weirdos who released an album you had to play on four different stereos at once , and now they get considered for Oklahoma 's state song and soundtrack moving funeral scenes in Mandy Moore movies .
Let 's not even start on movies : Natalie Portman said the Shins would change your life , and she was in Star Wars .
It 's not just music , either .
I do n't know quite when it happened , but at some point a certain vague strain of " indie " dropped its last vestiges of seeming weird and became a commonplace -- sort of like in Britain , where " indie " has long been synonymous with the normal guitar bands people find fashionable .
When those I 'm - a - Mac , I 'm - a - PC commercials came out , I even saw some ad critic describe Justin Long 's Mac guy as an " indie type . "
Why ?
He 's just a young middle - class - looking white guy with a haircut .
( I 'd be more aghast , except it 's actually not hard to imagine him telling you about the New Pornographers . )
And soon enough any film , book , or cultural product that came anywhere near a certain sensibility -- anything anyone would describe as " quirky " or cleverish or tender -- fell in the indie bucket , too : Garden State with its hilarious Shins scene , Wes Anderson movies , Dave Eggers ( ?? ) , Juno , Zooey Deschanel 's general existence , private colleges , button shirts , the Internet , IKEA , Miracle Whip , literacy , you tell me .
The sensibility used to seem rarer , and then , I suppose , half the people attracted to it grew up and got creative jobs and now it floats everywhere .
So huge swathes of twentysomethings , like anyone with a college education or a Mac or a strummy guitar record : indie , apparently ?
Which is allegedly quite the thing these days .
I 'm actually not mocking or complaining .
I have an ulterior motive .
I mention all this because I 'm positive that some of you read the above in a neutral , casual way , while others of you , having gotten through it , are right now actively gagging and fuming and experiencing some very visceral squirming , and if you check your reflection in the computer screen you will look approximately like Homer Simpson when he 's choking Bart .
Because you hate this stuff .
And what I want to tell you today is why that split -- the neutral reading versus the visceral tooth - grinding hate - that - stuff feeling -- is precisely why I 'm really , really excited about what might happen to indie over the next decade .
Here 's the thing : " indie " has always been a baggy , contingent word , and the whole loose umbrella of stuff that gets considered " indie " has usually included huge splits and tensions .
Back in the 1980s , for instance , there was a major difference between hardcore punks and what kids in my hometown would continue to refer to as " wavers , " as in new wave : fans of stylish British bands and synthesizers , drama - club Morrissey types .
But by the end of the 80s , as it happened , there had emerged this crop of bands that seemed to resolve some of that punks - versus - wavers tension , bringing together parts of both camps -- a little thrash / trash / noise and a little arty / stylish / pop -- under one big tent .
I do n't think it 's an accident that some of those bands , like Sonic Youth or Pixies , are still big tentpoles of what we now think of as indie :
They 're part of what brought together that audience , that category , in the first place .
This is a big simplification , just one way of wrapping a narrative around what 's ultimately only a bunch of individuals buying records .
But there 's truth in it .
When different people are standing under the same umbrella , there 's bound to be some elbowing , some argument about who 's taking up too much space and what direction everyone 's walking .
There 's tension and then things shuffle and rearrange .
So if you want to know where today 's popular indie comes from , I can offer you a similar narrative about that .
Consider that in the early 1990s , " alternative rock " became very popular , very suddenly .
It was n't like indie 's slow creep toward normality this decade :
Alt - rock more or less party - crashed the mainstream , and mainstream audiences party - crashed it right back , and that sent everyone under the indie umbrella elbowing and shoving for new space .
The kinds of alt - rock that got popular tended to be very straightforward : fuzzy , glossy rock songs ; brash , masculine grunge ; blocky , bright , and ironic pop .
It could , and did , get old .
Again :
It 's probably no accident that if you look at the things the " indie " world turned toward over the following years , a lot of them can be read as straight - up reactions to those qualities .
I mean , if you happened to be tired of that stuff , or object to where it was headed , then something like post - rock -- sedate , studious , un - macho -- was a lot more likely to smell like fresh air , right ?
Same with trippy electronic pop , scrappy homemade lo-fi , twee , slowcore , IDM , lounge - record reissues , or a lot of other things people got into in the late 1990s .
A lot of the people making this fresh - air music were peoplewho used to play loud , simple punk and were shooting for something fresh .
And after a while of that , as everyone settled from the shake - up of the alt - rock boom , this whole " indie " audience really did regroup around liking certain types of things : think , for example , of Elliott Smith , Belle & Sebastian , Air , Cat Power , latter - day Flaming Lips .
This music was pleasant , accessible , and aesthetically interesting , but without making a whole lot of noise or sudden moves about it .
There were things about the songs that were comfortable and traditional , which was how consensus got built around them :
They were easy to like .
But there were also things about them that , in the context of their time , seemed rare and special and worth getting behind .
Some acts were soft - spoken and wry , which was a big contrast not only from pop but from buzzy , earnest alternative .
Some , like Belle & Sebastian or Cat Power , had a sense of privacy and withdrawal to them , like they lived in your bedroom instead of blaring everywhere -- like there was something precious about them .
There was a level of fantasy and whimsy around a lot of records , a light psychedelia , that had n't been heard in a while and could n't be gotten elsewhere -- this sense , when listening to the Lips or Stereolab or Elephant 6 bands , that the artists were picking up different aspects of pop music and painting swoony little dreams out of them .
It felt thoughtful , a quality that 's hard to define but a very big part of what made it appeal .
Thoughtful and , of course , different .
Music your parents could like , but probably found strange :
This could feel subversive , somehow , in a world where youth culture was presumed to be aggressively loud .
This stuff wanted to be nice ; it wanted -- rather unusually -- to be subtle , maybe even a bit quaint .
You can see this reflected in the new influences and heroes it took up and began lionizing : Nick Drake ( patron saint of quietude , privacy , and obscurity ) , Brian Wilson ( big- eyed innocence and lush imagination ) , Antonio Carlos Jobim ( effortless , breezy cool ) , Serge Gainsbourg ( louche , but suave , aloof ) . . .
Quiet , wry , quaint , imaginative , thoughtful , nice -- all of these are qualities that seem like part of whatever vague , ambient " indie " sensibility is attached to movies and advertisements and t- shirts now , right ?
I 'm not writing to argue that you should like it , only to explain what shaped it .
I know that a lot of you , in today 's context , wo n't see those qualities or that music as at all a positive thing ; hell , I liked a lot of those records , and sometimes I can't see those qualities as positive anymore .
But I 'm also sure that plenty of you in this decade had a very similar experience -- chafing at the nu-metal or buzzy alt / emo on the radio , and then experiencing something like the dorky , semi- fantastical Decemberists as fresh air .
The first cracks in this arrangement started to show at the turn of the millennium .
The status quo accumulated discontents .
Suddenly the big rap on indie was that it was po-faced and insular and lacking in passion , a self - congratulatory system of people in plaid shirts playing to audiences with their arms crossed .
The songs were tasteful , polite , and predictable , and no one , allegedly , danced .
No noise , no sudden moves , just a comfy , private bubble where everything tried to be so clever and cerebral and nice .
The Internet only furthered this complaint .
The amount of online chatter about music was on a huge upswing , and the sheer variety of viewpoints made it pretty hard not to feel insular and over - comfortable .
The sudden availability of mp3s , of just about any sort , also meant there was a lot less excuse for not looking outside your own bubble .
And besides , why should " indie " -- which had , at various points , been a joyously weird dumping ground for loads of misfit sounds -- suddenly become codified and narrow ?
Why should it camp out around music that , increasingly , looked rather settled , timid , and polite ?
Why should it be so damned nice ?
You heard that complaint a lot back then , and at the start of the decade , certain trends seemed to present as antidotes .
Personally , I was totally taken with new electro , which felt like everything mainstream indie was not -- trashy , party - focused , danceable , dumb and simple , vibrant and exciting .
So was greasy garage rock , for some people , even in its least greasy , most popular incarnations ; I can still remember a summer in Chicago where the nearest cafés all switched from playing post - rock to non-stop White Stripes .
The Strokes seemed like a breath of fresh air , and people started leaping at snappy , upbeat , big - tent guitar bands as some kind of Return of Rock moment .
This should tell you something :
The Strokes were not exactly hard rockers , but in indie 's 2001 they somehow came off as surly !
Even the Hives presented , in indie-world , as a burst of potential excitement -- nothing against the Hives , who kicked out some killer singles , but this seems like evidence of some kind of very deep psychic need .
This was the other kind of indie that got really popular :
The snappy guitar bands extroverted enough to shoot for excitement and fans -- Interpol , Strokes , Yeah Yeah Yeahs , Franz Ferdinand , Bloc Party .
More importantly , those years saw indie types paying more attention to things outside the indie world -- this website 's coverage , for instance , widened significantly -- and indie , in its thieving magpie way , started seizing at things , assimilating them .
People embraced house acts , got excited about the possibility of " dance punk , " dabbled with underground rap .
At first , plenty of folks derided these trends as faddish , embarrassing , or somehow even elitist , like the people who went for them were trying to fool someone .
But as far as I can tell , things changed .
You can see it just visually : Neon t- shirts and skinny pants and fashion and " hipster " ism -- the stuff some indie kids recoiled from when new electro came along -- won out .
Daft Punk and M.I.A. have big old parking spots reserved for them in the indie world .
All sorts of new things wound up getting absorbed into indie 's sensibility , because indie is a superb thief :
It gets into things and then picks up their trappings .
Electro , minimal techno , French house , the production on hip - hop and R&B singles -- at this point you probably do n't think twice when an indie act grabs something from these genres ; you do n't think twice about whether the result is " indie " or not .
It 's assimilated , just another option .
It 's funny how umbrellas work , though .
Because the more some people wanted to dig down toward something fresher and rowdier -- noise , metal , club music , weirdo back - shed clangers -- the more they left that other indie sensibility , the allegedly polite and earnest and po-faced one , to sail its course .
And its course was to get really , really popular .
It became the kind of thing an average American teenager might casually listen to without feeling there was too much meaningful or different about that choice :
It 's just guitar - pop , right ?
People who 'd always followed it got older and kept listening .
The combination of sounds in it -- the blend of strong , accessible songwriting with aesthetics just stylized enough to be head - turning -- brought more listeners into its fold .
Eventually you could hear about it on National Public Radio , read about it in The New York Times ; if you followed a certain variety of " middlebrow " media , or even just watched the bands showing up on late - night shows , you 'd quite possibly hear more about indie acts than platinum - selling rappers or country acts .
" Indie " got ever more widely adopted as pop music for the " thoughtful " person -- the sophisticated boom - boom .
And be honest :
Why would n't loads of everyday non-music - geek people hear a good Iron & Wine song and think not just " hey , that 's really pleasant , " but also " hey , that 's kinda different and interesting ? "
Why not , if you put it in front of them ?
The sheer fact that it was available made a huge difference .
I 'll spare you a long , old - mannish digression about the things I had to do , pre-Internet , to engage with the music I wanted to hear ; it was a constant and hilariously archaic scramble .
But these days , these things float past you everywhere , and I 'm hard - pressed to think of many acts I 'd recommend that you could n't very casually , within two minutes of web - searching , check out right on your computer .
More and more , we define ourselves -- or pride ourselves , or at least " express " ourselves -- via our skills in picking interesting things out of that cloud of options .
We probably should n't be surprised that somewhere in this process , " indie " completed its trip from being the province of freaks and geeks to something with cachet -- something that appeals to people 's sense of themselves as discerning .
Something that is , in some quarters , enough of a staple of " cool " that people begin to feel oppressed by it , to the point where some people 's defense of liking it is no longer a defense against being weird , but a defense against being trendy .
Well .
There are major issues and tensions involved in one variety of indie being that popular .
Big ones .
This website experiences some of them .
Pitchfork has spent most of its existence covering both categories : both mainstream , populist indie records and weirder , rowdier sounds .
Most of the time , those things have gone together really well ; the sense has been that the average " indie " listener would like a bit of both , some pop records to sing along to and some stranger ones to be wowed by , plus plenty in between .
That 's probably still true of most of you !
But now , more than ever , there 's also this tension between the two , and a feeling of sides - taking .
On one side , there 's a pleasingly large audience who listens to popular indie as a matter of course , looking more for solid records and strong songs than any huge feeling of strangeness or experiment .
On the other side , there 's a pleasingly large group who feel like the " indie " umbrella is lookingbeige and boring , and crave more mystery , strangeness , and noise ; who lament that some of its punk energy is gone , now the province of a whole other teenage realm of screamo , emo , and white - belt metal ; who miss indie 's being defined by a weird risky energy , and not being too " nice " or " thoughtful . "
This website can get a writer angry mail from both positions , sometimes over the same piece :
One message that says you 're an elitist hipster snob for enjoying a noise band or " pretending " to like a pop single ; another message that says you 're a corny , predictable lamer for liking a conventional indie band .
So long as you get a few of each , things seem okay .
Both impulses can coexist just fine .
We can listen to both and neither .
But when that tension 's felt -- when it starts to feel like something 's at stake -- it affects what people want to like , what they feel like giving a chance ; it affects where they go to learn and talk about music ; it affects the music that gets made .
People situate themselves in relation to what 's at stake .
What 's great is that there 's loads of real love and passion around this split , and the arguments I see about it indicate that people still care a ton about what they think indie should be like .
I was pretty charmed with Vampire Weekend 's debut , but I was also charmed by the way that some people who hated it did n't just dislike the music : some of them objected , viscerally , to the very idea that indie bands would even be like that .
I liked the way a lot of people heard No Age and remembered that they enjoyed indie rock being a little slack and thrashy -- a quality that used to be everywhere and had somehow fallen out of earshot -- and I liked the way other people sat sneering and pointing out that there was far more slack and thrashy stuff beyond that .
I like that people can rally around Animal Collective as something honestly interesting and forward - facing , and I like that other people can still complain that they 've become too mainstream .
Indie still does the thing I care about most , which is providing a reasonably open - minded audience and space for people -- like Antony Hegarty or Max Tundra or the Tough Alliance -- who make popular music that 's just a bit odd and stylized ; all you magpies pick and choose from everywhere .
But I like that now , more than ever , I keep seeing that old punks - versus - wavers type of tension surrounding things -- a real tension , a real desire for things to go in opposite directions .
I 'm not here to make predictions :
The last thing I want is for the music I follow to be predictable .
But what this adds up to is a feeling that something is coming -- some kind of spasm , some rearrangements of where things stand .
Yet another big shuffle of who stands where under indie 's umbrella , and where indie 's umbrella stands in the first place .
Maybe that sounds improbable , but it seems right .
Maybe it'll involve sounds we think of as " indie " lapsing over into mainstream taste -- the mainstream is even more of a magpie assimilator than indie !-- and an underground digging more and more for new fresh - air directions to travel .
Maybe some kids who grew up on screamo and Animal Collective both with come around and mix up audiences in bizarre new ways .
Maybe something game - changing will crawl out of a Hot Topic somewhere ; I do n't know if you follow these things , but there are weirdnesses and genre collisions coming out of those scenes that make indie look kinda square .
I do n't know what , precisely , to expect , but I can't think of another time in my life this " indie " world has looked quite so ripe for shaking itself up .
I 'm excited for it -- I think we 'll all enjoy it .
It 'll be awesome .
I promise .
You 'll be there .
The following questions , some multi-part - and most totally ignored by the 9/11 Commission - are just the tip of the immense 9/11 iceberg .
A hat tip goes to the indefatigable work of 911truth.org ; whatreallyhappened.com ; architects and engineers for 9/11 truth ; the Italian documentary Zero : an investigation into 9/11 ; and Asia Times Online readers ' e-mails .
None of these questions has been convincingly answered - according to the official narrative .
It 's up to US civil society to keep up the pressure .
Eight years after the fact , one fundamental conclusion is imperative .
The official narrative edifice of 9/11 is simply not acceptable .

RMP Landschaftsarchitekten :
The Schlosspark , which has taken shape slowly over time , “ meets ” a modern landscape garden with Chinese silver grass – we have created a green space that is simultaneously respectful and innovative , one that points the way for the future .
The centre for garden craft and landscape culture / decentralised regional garden show began life on this 24 - hectare former arable land site in 2002 .
The park is entirely and explicitly created from references to the site ’s previous use and its surroundings .
Rectangular areas planted with Miscanthus dominate the site ’s visual profile and provide it with a spatial structure .
Between these three - dimensional masses of Miscanthus are wide expanses of lawn .
Together with the radiating anthracite - coloured paths , the green strips created by these elements provide the central lines of sight and connective elements for the site .
The backbone for the Dycker Feld is provided by a historic avenue of sweet chestnut trees .
There are 24 garden spaces located among the Chinese silver grass ; in the spring , these can be seen clearly , but as the year progresses they “ sink ” amid the burgeoning Miscanthus .
The park – like the plant itself – changes with the seasons , constantly presenting visitors with a new world to experience .
The use of Miscanthus is the core element of our aesthetic strategy .
This grass variety is also a renewable energy source .
Burned in a biomass power plant , the harvested grass supplies the energy needs of the Schloss complex for a whole year .

Warning :
The pictures you are about to see are graphic — and may result in you swearing off vodka ( and other varieties of hard liquor ) permanently .
The Project on Government Oversight provided me with a series of photographs — a dozen in all — that depict the bacchanalian goings on at Camp Sullivan , home to the ArmorGroup personnel who guard the nearby US embassy compound in Kabul .
On Tuesday , POGO sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton detailing a host of explosive charges relating to ArmorGroup ’s management of the embassy contract , including evidence of “ near - weekly deviant hazing and humiliation of subordinates . ”
According to POGO , “ witnesses report that the highest levels of AGNA management in Kabul are aware of and have personally observed — or even engaged in — these activities , but have done nothing to stop them . ”
As you ’ll see below , POGO really was n’t exaggerating when it spoke of the “ Lord of the Flies environment . ”
Here ’s the jaw - dropping proof :
The cover shot for a soon - to - be- released Contractors Gone Wild : The Asses of Afghanistan video ?
Did these guys send away for coconut bikinis and grass skirts ?
I can imagine these items are readily available in a conservative Muslim country like Afghanistan .
Apparently this guy is urinating on himself , and smiling about it too .
And here ’s the infamous butt - shot shot — wrong on so many levels .
If you can stomach more — and I do n’t blame you if you ’ve seen enough — you can find the rest of the photos here .
So far ArmorGroup , North America ’s parent comany , Wackenhut , is declining to comment .
Wise , perhaps , since I can’t imagine there ’s a good way to spin this .
Meanwhile , the State Department , which has harbored internal concerns about ArmorGroup ’s performance for years but still renewed its embassy contract this summer , says it is taking POGO ’s allegations very seriously .
State Department spokesman Ian Kelly told reporters yesterday that the matter has been referred to the agency ’s inspector general .
In the coming weeks , the agency is going to have some serious explaining to do .
Not only concerning its contractor oversight , but about why a top State Department official told Congress in June that ArmorGroup ’s “ performance on the ground … has been and is sound . ”

In your career as a geek , there ’s a list of essential career intangibles .
These are the things you need to do in order to be successful , which are also maddeningly difficult to measure .
There is no direct correlation between completing these activities and a raise .
It ’s unlikely that accomplishing these indefinite tasks will end up in your review , but via organizational and social osmosis , you ’ve learned these intangibles are essential in order to grow .
I want to talk about one : networking .
There are two types of networking .
Basic networking is what you do at work .
It ’s a target rich environment with co-workers , your boss , and those of interest in close proximity .
It ’s work , but it ’s easy work because your day is full of those you depend on and you ’ve learned that professionally befriending these people keeps you comfortably in the know .
The other type of networking I ’m going to call people networking and it ’s harder work .
This is when you put yourself out there .
It ’s attending a conference where you know no one .
It ’s driving to the city to sit in a coffee shop with ten strangers bonded by a programming language .
It ’s a leap for the socially awkward , but the infrequent reward is that you discover Your People .
I do n’t have a good definition for these people , so I made a list .
My hope is that as you read this list you ’ll think of at least one person you know who is already Your People :
Your connection with Your People instant and obvious ; it transcends age and experience .
The best way to discover if someone is Your People is absence .
If , when they return , it ’s as if they never left , they are Your People .
There are more of them than you expect , but their number is disguised by the ebb and flow of their presence in your life .
An investment of time with them will be repaid , but not in a way you can predict or expect .
That is the point .
Your People will piss you off because the relationship is genuine .
They do not coddle and they do not spin .
Consequently , Your People error - correct you in ways that others cannot .
You may call on each other without reason , randomly .
During these random visits , hours of time will vanish and neither you nor Your People will notice .
Conversely , long silences are also acceptable and comfortable .
Your People have a knack for showing up when you need them , even if you did n’t know you needed them prior to their arrival .
I do n’t know how they do this , but the more People you have , the more likely it is that this will happen .
Your People rarely demand anything .
But when either you or they make a request , neither the request nor the agreement to do it is ever in question .
Your People keep in you in balance .
Their presence reminds you first that that you ’re never flying solo and , second , that there are two sides to every story .
Your People instinctively know who you are and are able to say accurate and valuable things to you and about you with stunningly little data .
You get mail all day from everyone , but you always stop to read mail from Your People .
Your People will always be Your People — even if they leave and never return .
When I ’m talking about Your People , I am not thinking of your best friend .
Sure , your best friend might be Your People , but I ’m talking about a larger population who are n’t necessarily your friends and who is n’t your family .
These are a strange lot of people you ’ve discovered in a motley array of places because you were searching for them .
Furthermore , I am not suggesting that those who are not Your People are somehow less valuable .
In fact , the majority of the folks in your life are going to be extraordinarily more work than those who are instantly familiar .
The work in bridging the gap between you and those who are harder to know is also an essential intangible skill .
Lastly , while Your People may be less work , they are harder people to have in your life .

If they did not do these things , they would not be Your People .
You Tell Stories
All day .
It ’s a constant story being composed in your head .
You ’re doing it right now .
You think you ’re reading this paragraph that I ’ve written , but what you ’re actually doing is telling yourself the story of reading this paragraph .
It ’s your inner dialogue and it ’s often full of shit .
I ’m not saying you deliberately lie to yourself .
Ok , maybe I am , but we ’re all doing it .
We ’re all gathering data through the course of the day and creating a story based on that data , our experience , and our moods .
It ’s a perfectly natural phenomenon to guide the narrative in our favor .
We see the world how we want .

The dollar ’s position as the world ’s leading reserve currency faces increased pressure as the financial crisis allows emerging economies greater influence on the world stage , analysts said .
A report last week in The Independent claiming that China , Russia and Gulf States are among nations prepared to ditch the dollar for oil trades has heightened the uncertainty surrounding the US currency ’s future .

The dollar slumped against rivals last week in the wake of the British daily ’s controversial report .
“ The US dollar is being hurt by the continued talk of a shift away from a dollar - centric world , ” said Kit Juckes , an analyst at currency traders ECU Group .
“ Three conclusions stand out very clearly .
Firstly , the shift in economic power away from the G7 economies is continuing .
“ Secondly , there is a growing acceptance amongst those winners that one consequence of this power shift will be to strengthen their currencies .
“ And finally , as long as the US economy is not strong enough for any rise in interest rates to be conceivable for a long time , the dollar ’s underlying downtrend will remain in place , ” added Juckes .
The Independent , under the front - page headline “ The Demise of the Dollar ” , reported last Tuesday that Gulf states , together with China , Russia , Japan and France , were considering replacing the dollar as the currency for oil deals .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ In the most profound financial change in recent Middle East history , Gulf Arabs are planning — along with China , Russia , Japan and France — to end dollar dealings for oil , ” wrote The Independent ’s Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk .
They would switch “ to a basket of currencies including the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan , the euro , gold and a new , unified currency planned for nations in the Gulf Co-operation Council , including Saudi Arabia , Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and Qatar , ” added Fisk , citing Gulf Arab and Chinese banking sources .
The report was denied by a host of countries , including Kuwait , Qatar and Russia , while France dismissed it as “ pure speculation . ”

Even so , the United Nations itself last week called for a new global reserve currency to end dollar supremacy , which had allowed the United States the “ privilege ” of building up a huge trade deficit .
UN undersecretary - general for economic and social affairs , Sha Zukang , said “ important progress in managing imbalances can be made by reducing the ( dollar ) reserve currency country ’s ‘ privilege ’ to run external deficits in order to provide international liquidity . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Zukang was speaking at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank , whose President Robert Zoellick recently warned that the United States should not “ take for granted ” the dollar ’s role as preeminent global reserve currency .
Meanwhile at a G20 summit in Pittsburgh last month , world leaders unveiled a new vision for economic governance , with bold plans to fix global imbalances and give more clout to emerging giants such as China and India .
Following the summit , US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner repeated Washington ’s commitment to a strong dollar .

But last week the finance chief was left to watch as traders used The Independent ’s report as an opportunity to push lower the troubled US unit .
The report “ has helped concentrate the minds of traders and investors alike , and has given them another excuse to take the dollar lower , ” GFT Global Markets analyst David Morrison told AFP .
“ Despite what the Fed and other central bankers say , a weaker dollar is desirable because it is necessary to rebalance the global economy .
“ As long as the decline is gentle and orderly , then they ’re happy .
But aggressive selling would spook the markets , ” he added .
ADVERTISEMENT
Commerzbank currency analyst Antje Praefcke agreed that the market ’s reaction was significant because it showed that the dollar was on a downward trajectory .
“ The questionable article in the Independent was of course disclaimed , ” Praefcke said .
“ It is nonetheless an interesting study of the pscychological factors which are currently putting pressure on the dollar .
Even if conspiracy theories turn out to be nonsense , the dollar is subsequently able to retrace only some of its losses . ”
In the spirit of the What Are The Resolved Debates in General Purpose Language Design ?
topic , I would be interested in hearing your opinion on the specific Syntax Design problem .
In designing a new syntax for a programming language , what are the decisions that are objectively good ( or bad ) ?
Most syntaxic questions are rather subjective ( for example , ' CamelCase ' or ' with_underscores ' identifiers ? ) , but I think that some can be answered definitely with a convincing argumentation .
Here is one example : recursive scoping should always be optional and explicit .
Recursive scoping is when a defined identifier scope is active at the definition site as well as at the usage site .
In Haskell , term definitions have recursive scoping by default , while OCaml does n't ( there is a let .. and a let rec ... syntax ) .
It allows for useful programming idioms such as let x = sanitize x in ... or let ( token , i ) = parse i .
Haskell programmers would sometimes benefit from such a possibility , as can be seen here and here .
type definitions are implicitely recursive in OCaml and this is also a pain .
Example of debates that are probably not resolved ( yet ? ) :
identation - sensitive syntax
open ( if .. else .. ) or closed ( if .. elif .. else .. end ) conditional statements
Do you know of ressources discussing such syntaxic issues in a general way applicable to numerous / all ( textual ) programming languages ?
Like the embattled resistance against Skynet , fans of Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles have refused to surrender .
They 've rented a mobile billboard for the canceled Fox show this week .
And now producer James Middleton tells io9 there 's reason for hope .

The Sarah Connor Chronicles went off the air last May , and seems unlikely to come back to television .
But fans have become increasingly focused on the idea that the show could have a direct - to - DVD movie sequel .
The show 's creator and showrunner , Josh Friedman , told us back in May that the show was over , and unlikely to be revived .

But fans have kept clamoring for a direct - to - DVD continuation .
So we decided to ask producer James Middleton ( who also produced Terminator Salvation ) if there was any hope whatsoever that fans might get their wish .
Have there been any meetings about a direct - to - DVD sequel , or other continuation ?
Middleton responded via email :
The quick answer is , yes , there have been many discussions .
I can't go into more detail about the subject until I have something truly substantial to report .
What the fans should know is that I hear them and I too would love to see T:SCC come back in some form .

So it sounds like there 's reason to hope after all .
At least , the reference to " many discussions " sounds encouraging , as does the notion that Middleton may actually have something " substantial " to report at some point .
So fingers crossed !

Luca di Montezemolo believes FOTA 's planned seminar at the end of this season must result in changes that make Formula 1 more appealing to spectators .
The Ferrari president and Formula 1 Teams ' Association chairman believes the reduced attendances this season highlights the need for more work to be done .
" The reduction of spectators , at Monza [ which was reported to have 16 per cent fewer spectators this year than in 2008 ] too , indicates a need to change - no more boring grands prix and polemics , " di Montezemolo said at the Frankfurt Motorshow .
" At the end of the year we 'll have a work day with the media , organisers and sponsors in order to make this extraordinary sport more interesting . "
He also reiterated his desire for the bigger teams in F1 to be allowed to run three cars .
" The Schumacher effect over ticket sales , when it seemed like he could make a comeback , shows how much top drivers and teams attract , " he said .
" The future of F1 wo n't be about small teams who do n't raise enthusiasm .
" We need the possibility for top teams to field a third car for famous or young drivers . "
Di Montezemolo also called for a rethink of the current testing regulations .
" We must also think of testing .
We are the only sport that does n't train .
I see many possible adjustments , with no polemics .
I hope everyone agrees with the position of Ferrari , which has been in grand prix racing for ever . "
He also says Ferrari is now working towards 2010 , despite the team 's recent upturn in performance .
" I regret the start of the season - there are many things I could say but I wo n't .
In the second half of the season we are among the teams who scored the most points , and we are third in the constructors despite having just one car in the points for the last four races , " he said .
" We 'll try to finish welll , even though our limits are clear - we are working towards 2010 .
" I am happy to see [ Felipe ] Massa psychologically ready to drive - I 've already bet with him that he 'll be quicker . "

More controversy is expected when Ms Sandioriva takes part in Miss Universe
Clerics in Indonesia 's conservative Muslim province of Aceh say they are outraged that an Acehnese woman has won the title of Miss Indonesia .
Qori Sandioriva , 18 , won the Miss Indonesia title on Friday , beating 37 other contestants for the crown .
The clerics say that by failing to wear a veil during the competition she has betrayed her Acehnese roots and brought shame to the province .
Aceh has special autonomy in Indonesia and has implemented partial Sharia law .
It is the only province in Indonesia , the world 's largest Muslim country , that follows these laws .
Qori Sandioriva was born in Jakarta but has an Acehnese mother .
Thanks to her mother 's connection to the province she was able to enter the competition as Miss Aceh .
But Islamic clerics in Aceh say she has misrepresented her region .
They say she should have worn a veil during the competition , in keeping with the traditions of her mother 's province .
Teung - ku Faisal Ali , the secretary general of Aceh 's Ulama Association , told the BBC that anyone who represents
Aceh must uphold the province 's values .
He said Qori Sandioriva did not wear a veil during the competition and therefore did not represent the Acehnese people , who have strong Islamic faith and values .
When asked about not wearing a veil during the competition , Ms Sandiorova said she believed hair is beauty , and that she is proud of beauty .
The controversy is likely to return next year when she goes on to compete in the Miss Universe contest where she will have to don a swimsuit as part of the pageant .

PETITION : " Enough is enough .

Rep. Joe Wilson went way over the line by yelling ' You lie ' during President Obama 's speech , and Congress should censure him immediately . "
It is known as the graveyard of ships , a place where ageing vessels are torn apart by unskilled labourers and the metal then sold on as scrap .
In recent years these often deadly and dangerous ship breakers ' yards , which stretch a full seven miles along the coastline of the Indian state of Gujarat , have themselves been a little on their uppers .
Booming demand for freight meant that it made sound economic sense to keep even older ships in operation , and many of the labourers in the Gujarati yards were laid off .
But now , by no small irony , these workers in the world 's largest ship - breaking yard have been saved by the global recession .
The economic downturn and a subsequent fall in demand for cargo ships has meant that for many ship owners it makes better sense to send an ageing ship to the scrapyard rather than to keep her maintained but idle .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But while the recession may have been good news for the owners of the ship - breaking firms , it is very bad news for the environment .
The scrapping of ships in South Asia – Bangladesh and Pakistan are also major scrappers – is a rudimentary , almost medieval affair .
Ships are allowed to beach on the sands and then armies of men with little or no training pull apart the ships with hand - tools .
Toxic substances such as mercury and asbestos are allowed to seep into the environment .
One of the attractions to the ship owners of having their vessels dismantled here is that the ship breakers in this part of the world receive little of the regulatory oversight that takes place in Europe or the US .
For the ship owners , it means they can dispose of their ships more cheaply , while for the scrappers it means bonanza - time .
Over the last 10 months , the scrappers at Alang in Gujarat have received and dismantled around 280 ships , up from 163 during the same period a year earlier .
Some breakers believe that over a 12 - month period from January , they might reach a total of 400 ships .
" The costs of a laid - up vessel are considerable .
It costs a lot to keep it empty .
If there is no cargo , it is better to lose them , " said Nikhil Gupta , owner of the Hare Krishna Steel Corporation and a senior official with the breaker 's trade organisation , the Ship Recycling Industries Association of India .
Speaking by telephone , he added : " After 35 or 40 years these ships are not as safe , and the insurance premiums go up .
In the past there was a lot of trade and it made sense to keep them . "
Pat Swayne of the Baltic Exchange , the London - based maritime trading house , said there is no question that increasing numbers of older ships are being scrapped .
" Previously many ships that were able to make a lot of money [ for the owner ] , are now facing rising costs , " he said .
" If you decide to lay up a ship then you have to find somewhere to lay it up and the question is where do you lay it up ?
The older a ship is , the more costs are associated with it .
Scrapping becomes a very viable option . "
Since the mid-1980s , the vast breakers ' yards at Alang have developed , under only loose regulation , along a stretch of coast that enjoys a tidal range of around 13 metres , making it easier to beach a condemned vessel directly onto the shoreline .

Previously the industry was based in Mumbai , but gradually it moved to Alang and continued to expand .
Now , Alang accounts for than half of all the ships scrapped worldwide , followed by Pakistan and Bangladesh , which each scrap almost a quarter of the remainder .
Mr Gupta said that as a result of upturn in scrapping , up to 40,000 workers are now directly employed by the breakers at around 170 plots along the coast .
Around 130 plots are in use today , up from just 25 in 2006 .
For those directly and indirectly involved in breaking , the cash tills are jingling and many breakers have recently been tempted back into the industry .
In the surrounding area there has already been a visible impact on the area .
New homes are sprouting along the 35 - mile stretch of road that links
Alang to the city of Bhavnagar , and the local roads are awash in what some call " snazzy sedans " .
On the edge of Alang a huge flea market has sprung up , selling multifarious equipment and fittings taken from the ships .
Locals say that when an owner decides to scrap a vessel , they rarely have the time or opportunity to make a full assessment of the value of such things .
As a result , the flea market sells everything from ships motors and cutlery sets to fridges and lifeboats at bargain prices .
" Last year I bought a torque wrench here for about 3,500 rupees ( £ 44 ) , which would have cost me 50,000 on the open market , " Vasant Pachal , an engineering workshop owner from the city of Vadodara , recently told The Hindustan Times while browsing at the market .
" Apart from the great deals , I get to see the latest in technology every time I come here . "
Yet for environmentalists and labour campaigners , the upturn in business means something else .
Campaigners point out that the working conditions for the often undocumented migrant labourers from India 's poorest states , can be highly dangerous and there are regular reports of injuries and fatalities .
Earlier this month , six workers died when a fire broke out at one of the plots .
Activists say the impoverished workers have no bargaining power .
Dwarika Nath Rath , a Gujarat - based activist and member of the Socialist Unity Centre of India , a small Communist party , has for many years been monitoring the human toll of the operations .
" These workers , coming from places like Orissa and Bihar , say that if they want to save their families they have to die themselves , " he said .
" The main problem is that there is no regulation , there is no law .
These people need to be given ID cards and registered as workers .
When an accident happens these people are not in the log - book . "
Ingrid Christiansen , a Delhi - based official with the International Labour Organisation , the UN body that oversees working conditions , said that there had been some advances in working conditions at the breakers ' yards but that there was " room for improvement " .
In May , an international convention meeting in Hong Kong agreed new rules that sought to regulate the worst of the industry 's excesses , but campaigners say it has made little difference .
Indeed , the convention rejected a proposal supported by over 100 human rights and environment protection organisations to phase out beaching operations – where ships are dumped at high tide and then drift to beaches to be taken apart .
" Beach breaking would never be allowed in Europe , " said Ingvild Jenssen , director of the Belgium - based campaign group Platform on Shipbreaking .
" When a vessel is broken without containment on a tidal beach there is bound to be pollution of the coastal zone .
Experience with ship repair pollution in Europe and the US , and consequent rules for how these activities must be dealt with in contained environments , illustrates the problems . "
The booming market on the Gujarat coast has brought back an old customer – to the consternation of campaigners .
They claim that among the ships that will be hauled onto the beaches and pulled apart in the coming weeks are two US vessels , MV Pvt James Anderson and MV 1st Lt Alex Bonnyman .
They will be the first such US ships scrapped in south Asia since 1998 , when the Clinton administration – under pressure from campaigners – ordered a moratorium on the scrapping of US government - owned ships in south Asia .
" This is really shocking , " said Jim Puckett , of the Basel Action Network , another campaign group .
" Now we have elected an environmental President , and his administration for the first time in 10 years is willing to ignore the law and dump toxic waste from US flagged ships on developing countries . "

Russell Mokhiber leads picketers outside a Whole Foods store
It 's the shop where wealthy American liberals buy their groceries .
But the American supermarket chain Whole Foods Market has found itself at the centre of a storm of controversy after its chief executive , John Mackey , wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal presenting a free market alternative to President Obama 's proposed healthcare reforms .
Mr Mackey began his article with a quote from Margaret Thatcher and went on to add that Americans do not have an intrinsic right to healthcare - an idea strongly at odds with the views of a large proportion of Whole Foods ' customer base .
The company , which has 270 stores in North America and the UK , sells organic vegetables , biodegradable washing powder and sustainable seafood to a well - heeled clientele and champions its liberal credentials .
Customer protests
It is hypocritical and disingenuous and it really cheapens the brand
Emily Goulding , customer Former Whole Foods devotees responded to Mr Mackey 's article by picketing outside branches of the store in Washington DC , Maryland , New York and Austin , Texas .
Others stormed Twitter and Facebook to vent their rage and called on shoppers to boycott the store .
Russell Mokhiber led picketers outside Whole Foods ' P Street store in Washington DC .
He said , " I have been a Whole Foods customer for many years but I , like many former customers , am disgusted by John Mackey 's stance on healthcare . "
Representatives from the United Food and Commercial Workers ( UFCW ) labour union also picketed outside the Washington store .
Protesters said they were disgusted by John Mackey 's views on healthcare " Mackey 's views are totally at odds with those of the company - he has to go , " said UFCW spokesperson Mark Federici .
Outside the store , customers Emily Goulding and Ileana Abreu said the controversy had made them think twice about shopping there .
" It is hypocritical and disingenuous and it really cheapens the brand , " said Ms Goulding .
" Whole Foods is expensive but people shop here because they identify with the social conscience of the company - now it turns out that ethos was just a marketing exercise , " added Ms Abreu .
Response criticised Seemingly caught off - guard by the unfolding PR crisis , Whole Foods sought to distance itself from its chief executive 's comments .
" We 've had a lot of emails and phone calls and people coming into our stores to talk about it , " said Libba Letton , spokeswoman for Whole Foods .
" Our top priority is addressing their concerns . "
Mark Rosenthal has set up a " Boycott Whole Foods " page on Facebook But public relations experts criticised the store for bungling its response .
" You have two choices : you either take a proactive approach and wade right in and sort it out or you sit back and wait , " said Erica Iacono , executive editor of industry magazine PR Week .
" The company seems to be taking a wait and see approach and hoping it goes away .
It 's a mistake . "
Massachusetts - based playwright Mark Rosenthal 's " Boycott Whole Foods " Facebook page has so far attracted 24,738 fans , including supporters in the UK and Canada .
Rosenthal said , " I read the article and it stunned me , the hubris of this man who has made his millions selling his products to progressives in America based on an image of caring for the community . "
Damage limitation John Mackey , who started with a single store in Texas in 1980 and has built a company worth $ 3.8 bn ( £ 2.3bn ) on the Nasdaq stock exchange , has previously described himself as a free market libertarian .
Experts say the Whole Foods brand is strong enough to weather the storm Responding to the healthcare controversy in his Whole Foods blog , Mr Mackey said , " I gave my personal opinions ... [ the ] company has no official position on the issue . "
As part of their damage limitation strategy , Whole Foods ' in - house public relations division has created a forum on its website for customers to discuss the issue .
There are nearly 17,000 posts , compared with 63 posts on the dairy - free forum .
Some posts were scathing in their criticism of Mr Mackey but others defended the right of the controversial boss to express his views .
One respondent said , " Bravo John Mackey !
Finally we hear the voice of reason .
I plan to start shopping in your store in protest at this liberal lunacy . "
I would urge customers to keep the big picture in mind when they are deciding whether or not to boycott the store
Libba Letton , Whole Foods spokeswoman
The controversy has come at a bad time for Whole Foods which is struggling to grow its sales during the recession .
Dubbed " whole paycheque " by customers on account of high prices in - store , Whole Foods ' share price is currently $ 28 , more than 60 % below its all - time high at the end of 2005 .
Strong brand Mr Mackey is known for his directness .
He was recently quoted in a newspaper saying that as well as healthy , organic produce , " we sell a bunch of junk " , a remark reminiscent of Gerald Ratner 's 1992 comment that an item sold in his British jewellery chain was " total crap " .
The brand is strong enough to bounce back , predicted Iain Ellwood , head of consulting at global branding consultancy Interbrand .
" They need to focus the public 's attention back on the company 's core principles as a community - based brand , " he said .
Carol Kramer drove from Virginia to Washington DC to join the protests Whole Foods ' Libba Letton attempted to do just that , calling on customers to remember the grocer 's long history in supporting sustainability and organic farming , food and nutritional labelling , and ethical treatment of animals .
" I would urge customers to keep the big picture in mind when they are deciding whether or not to boycott the store , " she said .
Opinion was divided outside the P Street branch in Washington .
While many customers entered the store undeterred by the controversy , some left empty - handed , vowing to shop elsewhere .
Teacher Carol Kramer had driven from Virginia to take part in the protest .
She said , " There are a lot of people out there who really invested in the Whole Foods brand , emotionally and financially .
We are feeling really betrayed . "

The author Allan Sloan with his Social Security card .
No , that 's not his real number .
Crunching the numbers
See how we did the math behind this story Whither Medicare ?
Its problems dwarf Social Security's , but President Obama expects to fix the government 's medical plan as part of the health - care overhaul .
When it comes to problems , Medicare makes Social Security look like a walk in the park , even though at about $ 510 billion this year , it 's far smaller .
Not only are Medicare 's financial woes much larger than Social Security 's , but they 're also much more complicated .
You solve Social Security 's problems by reducing future payments below where they 'd otherwise be ( which is what raising the retirement age does ) , or you bring more revenue into the system than it would otherwise have , or some combination of the two .
Medicare is more convoluted , because the health - care system is much more complex than Social Security .
Which , when you think about it , involves only money .
Medicare presents several touchy issues , one of which is what to do about horrendously costly end - of - life problems , which account for a huge proportion of our national medical bill .
Do you ration end - of - life care ?
Do you decide that the cost of having a comatose patient live another few weeks is too high and order care discontinued ?
Who wants to be responsible for making those decisions ?
Certainly not me .
The Obama folks say they 'll solve Medicare 's problems as part of fixing the health - care system .
Then it will be Social Security 's turn .
-- A.S. More from Fortune Will Mmmhops be a hit ?
NBA confirms L.A. Clippers sale to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer
FBI and SEC probe into Carl Icahn and golfer Phil Mickelson
( Fortune Magazine ) --
In Washington these days , the only topics of discussion seem to be how many trillions to throw at health care and the recession , and whom on Wall Street to pillory next .
But watch out .
Lurking just below the surface is a bailout candidate that may soon emerge like the great white shark in Jaws : Social Security .
Perhaps as early as this year , Social Security , at $ 680 billion the nation 's biggest social program , will be transformed from an operation that 's helped finance the rest of the government for 25 years into a cash drain that will need money from the Treasury .
In other words , a bailout .
I 've been writing about Social Security 's problems for more than a decade , arguing that having the government borrow several trillion dollars to bail out Social Security so that it can pay its promised benefits would impose an intolerable burden on our public finances .
However , I 've changed my mind about what " intolerable " means .
With the government spending untold trillions to bail out incompetent banks , faddish mortgage borrowers , General Motors , Chrysler , AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , GMAC ( GJM ) , and Wall Street , it should damn well bail out Social Security recipients too .
But in a smart way .
Unlike the pigs feeding at Uncle Sam 's trough , the people who qualify for Social Security old - age benefits -- the ones who'll benefit from the bailout -- have played by the rules and paid Social Security taxes for decades .
It would be immoral to tell them , " Sorry , we have to trim your cost - of - living adjustment because we can't afford it , " while expecting them to continue footing the bill for bailing out imprudent people and institutions .
Why am I talking about Social Security when health care is sucking up virtually all the oxygen in Our Nation 's Capital ?
Because Social Security is a really big deal , providing a majority of the income for more than half the people 65 and up , and also supporting millions of disabled people and survivors of deceased workers ; because the collapse of stock prices and home values makes Social Security retirement benefits far more important even to upscale baby boomers than they were during the stock market and home - price highs of a few years ago ; and because the problems are n't that hard to solve if we look at Social Security realistically instead of treating it as a sacred , untouchable program ( liberals ) or a demonic plot to make people dependent on government ( conservatives ) .
Finally , this is a good time to discuss Social Security because the Obama folks say it 's next on the agenda , after health care .
No one at the White House , Treasury , or Social Security Administration would discuss specific Social Security proposals , however .
It ought to tell you something that Peter Orszag , director of the White House Office of Management and Budget , is a noted Social Security scholar .
He 's co-author of an influential 2004 book , Saving Social Security : A Balanced Approach , that advocated substantial tax increases ( and a few benefit trims ) to preserve the program .
Alas , he would n't tell me what he plans to propose this time around .
" Health care first " was all he'd say .
Meanwhile in Congress , Rep. Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) , the House majority leader , says he intends to deal with Social Security as soon as possible .
But he also declined to be specific .
" I 've been more inclined toward a commission " than to introduce legislation , he said .
That makes this a good time -- and maybe our last chance -- to have a rational conversation about Social Security .
After proposals start getting leaked and the game - playing and finger - pointing start , it wo n't be possible .
So I 'd like to show you that Social Security has a real and growing cash problem even as its trust fund is getting bigger than ever , explain how the program really works , and -- immodest though it may seem -- propose a few simple solutions to fix it , restore it to its roots , and make its finances less incomprehensible .
Social Security 's cash - flow problem
How can Social Security possibly need a bailout when by Washington rules it's " solvent " for another 26 years ?
To understand the problem , all you have to do is look at me .
I 'm the distinguished -- okay , old -- guy above and to the right , holding an ancient ( but real ) Social Security card that Fortune 's photo mavens have doctored to display an invalid number ( so do n't try using it ) .
I 'll turn 66 near the end of next year , making my wife and me eligible for full Social Security benefits .
They 'll be about $ 42,000 a year starting on Jan. 1 , 2011 , and are scheduled to rise as the consumer price index rises .
Social Security , which analyzed my situation at Fortune 's request , values those promised ( but not legally binding ) benefits at a bit more than $ 600,000 .
In other words , that 's how much Social Security would have to set aside today to pay benefits to my wife and me , assuming that we live out statistically average lives , and that the current benefit formula stays in place .
Even though 600 grand is a lot of money , Social Security is way ahead on my wife and me because the value of our benefits is far less than the Social Security taxes we and our employers will have paid by the end of next year , plus the interest Social Security will have earned on that money in the decades since we started working .
Those taxes and interest will have totaled more than $ 800,000 by Dec. 31 , 2010 .
For example , the $ 5.18 my employer and I paid in 1961 -- the year I got that card I 'm holding -- will have grown to $ 140 by the end of next year .
I do n't have a problem with this $ 600,000 - to - $ 800,000 disparity , by the way .
One of the principles of Social Security is that higher - paid folks like me -- I 'll get the maximum old - age benefit because I earned the maximum Social Security - covered wage ( currently $ 106,800 a year ) for 35 years -- support the lower paid .
That 's as it should be , given that the Social Security tax ( 12.4 % of covered wages , split equally between employer and employee ) is regressive , far more costly as a percent of income to a $ 40,000 - a- year person than it is to me .
According to the Tax Policy Institute , five out of six U.S. workers pay more in Social Security tax ( including the employer 's portion ) than in federal income tax -- something that makes it especially important ( and only fair ) to preserve the program for lower earners , who get old - age benefits of up to 90 % of their covered wages , while I get only 28 % .
How can my wife and I pose a problem to Social Security when our benefits are valued at $ 600,293 , while our tax payments ( $ 271,508 through next year ) plus interest will total $ 804,686 ?
Answer : because the obligation is real , but the $ 800,000 - plus asset is illusory , consisting solely of government IOUs to itself .
Now let 's step back a bit -- to 1935 , actually -- to see how we got into this mess .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt set up Social Security to look like an insurance company and a funded - benefit program , even though it 's neither ( a point , by the way , that Fortune made almost 75 years ago , in our December 1935 issue ) .
No , it 's not a Ponzi scheme as some folks claim .
A Ponzi uses money from today 's investors to pay yesterday 's investors and -- the key element -- lies about it .
Social Security , in contrast , does n't lie about what it is : an intergenerational social - insurance plan , with today 's workers supporting their parents ( and disabled and survivors ) in the hope that their children will support them .
It 's not a pension fund .
It 's not an insurance company .
Social Security exists in its own world .
In this world taxes are called " contributions , " though they 're certainly not voluntary .
" Trust funds , " which in the outside world connote real wealth bestowed on beneficiaries , are nothing but IOUs from one arm of the government ( the Treasury ) to another ( the Social Security Administration ) .
And " solvency , " which in the real world means that assets are greater than liabilities , means only that the Social Security trust fund has a positive balance .
Alas , the trust fund is a mere accounting entry , albeit one with a moral and political claim on taxpayers .
It 's Social Security 's cash flows , not its trust fund , that will determine what the system can actually pay .
It 's really a pay - as - you - go system , its trust fund notwithstanding .
To understand why I say that Social Security will soon need a bailout while most people say everything 's fine through 2035 , we have to examine the trust fund .
It currently holds about $ 2.5 trillion of Treasury securities and is projected to grow to more than $ 4 trillion , even as Social Security begins to take in far less cash in taxes than it spends in benefits .
For instance , in 2023 it projects a cash deficit of $ 234 billion .
However , the trust fund will grow because it will get $ 245 billion of Treasury IOUs as interest -- the Treasury pays its interest tab with paper , not cash .
" The trust fund has no financial significance , " says David Walker , former head of the General Accountability Office and now president of the Peterson Foundation , which advocates fiscal responsibility .
" If you did [ bookkeeping like ] that in the private sector , you 'd go to jail . "
Let me show you why the Social Security trust fund is n't social or secure , has no funds , and can't be trusted , by returning to my favorite subject : myself .
The cash that Social Security has collected from my wife and me and our employers is n't sitting at Social Security .
It 's gone .
Some went to pay benefits , some to fund the rest of the government .
Since 1983 , when it suffered a cash crisis , Social Security has been collecting more in taxes each year than it has paid out in benefits .
It has used the excess to buy the Treasury securities that go into the trust fund , reducing the Treasury 's need to raise money from investors .
What happens if Social Security takes in less cash than it needs to pay benefits ?
Watch .
Let 's say that late next year Social Security realizes that it's short the $ 3,486 it needs to pay my wife and me our Jan. 1 , 2011 , benefit .
It gets that money by having the Treasury redeem $ 3,486 of trust fund Treasury securities .
The Treasury would get the necessary cash by selling $ 3,486 of new Treasury securities to investors .
That means that $ 3,486 has been moved from the national debt that the government owes itself , which almost no one cares about , to the national debt it owes investors , which almost everyone -- and certainly the bond market -- takes very seriously .
Think about this for a second .
The Treasury has to borrow money to make good on the Social Security trust fund 's obligations .
Remember that the Treasury and Social Security are both part of the government .
This example shows you that the trust fund is of no economic value to the government as a whole ( which is what really matters ) , because the government has to borrow from private investors the money it needs to redeem the securities .
It would be the same if the trust fund sold its Treasury securities directly to investors -- the government would be adding to the publicly held national debt to fund Social Security checks .
See ?
The trust fund is n't a savings vehicle -- it 's nothing but a bookkeeping entry .
If you look at the " Social Security cash flow " chart , above and to the right , you 'll see that Social Security 's projected annual cash - flow deficit starts small but grows quickly to 12 digits .
It 's like having an AIG every year , then two AIGs , then more .
It 's simply unsupportable .
You wo n't find anything like our chart in Social Security 's annual trustees report -- we used information from a special online version of a table buried on page 196 of this year 's 222 - page report .
Social Security 's " solvency " calculations -- and the insistence by the status quo supporters that there 's " no problem " until 2036 because the trust fund will have assets until then -- assume that the Treasury can and will borrow the necessary money to redeem the trust fund 's Treasury securities .
They also assume that our children , who by then will be running the country , will allow all this money to be diverted from other needs .
I sure would n't assume that .
This whole problem of Social Security posting huge surpluses for years , using proceeds from a regressive tax to fund the rest of the government , and then needing a Treasury bailout to pay its bills is an unanticipated consequence of the 1983 legislation that supposedly fixed Social Security .
In order to show 75 years of " solvency , " as required by law -- a law that should be changed -- Congress , using the bipartisan 1983 Greenspan Commission report as political cover , raised Social Security taxes sharply , cut future benefits , and boosted the retirement age ( then 65 , currently 66 , rising to 67 ) .
That was the first such step - up in retirement age , even though life spans have increased greatly since Social Security was founded in 1935 , when someone who reached 65 really was old .
The changes transformed Social Security from an explicitly pay - as - you - go program into one that produced huge cash surpluses for years , followed by huge cash deficits .
No one in authority seems to have realized that the only way to really save the temporary surpluses was to let the trust fund invest in non-Treasury debt securities , such as high - grade mortgages ( yes , such things exist ) or corporate bonds .
That way , interest and principal repayments from homeowners and corporations would have been covering Social Security 's future cash shortfalls , rather than the Treasury 's having to borrow money to cover them .
This problem has been metastasizing for 25 years .
Now I 'll show you why the day of reckoning may finally be here , using numbers to back up my earlier assertion that Social Security could go cash - negative this year .

Design Note : PUT EXTRA EASE IN THE SEAT ANGLE ( CB seam )
Most easy fitting trousers require extra ease in the back crotch line , especially pleated pants .
Trace off back section of trouser template and add more ease .
Begin by , cutting along the hipline and spread open a wedge as desired , approximately 1 ½ ” [ 40 mm ] wide at the back CB line .
( The more rounded the behind , the greater the seat angle . )
Re -draw the back seam curve as shown .
Style Adaptation
Pleated “ zoot ” trousers are full at the waistline and shaped in at the hem .
Trace round basic easy - fit trouser template onto additional paper .
Back Section *
Add additional ease in CB seam if necessary ( see above ) .
Mark points ( a ) and ( b ) on hemline ¾ ” [ 20 mm ] inward from leg seam .
Draw straight line from ( a ) to kneeline .
Draw in a bowed outseam ( curve ) from hipline tapering to ( b ) .
Shape the bottom hemline with a slight curve outward ⅜ ” [ 10 m m ] .
***
Divide line 21 - 22 into 3 equal parts .
At each point , draw in a waist suppression dart .
( 2 in total ) .
Dart = 1 ⅛ ” wide x 4 ” long [ 30 mm x 100 mm ] .
Front Section *
Trace round front trouser template onto additional paper .
Cut across kneeline ; then cut top section dividing along the crease ( grainline ) .
Spread open at waistline for desired amount of pleating and extend waistline at side seam to blend smoothly with outseam of leg .
( For instance , open 2 ” [ 50 mm ] at waist and extend 1 ⅜ ” [ 35 mm ] at side seam .
With dart allowance this gives 4 ⅛ ” [ 10.5 cm ] fullness ) .
Divide fullness into 3 equal pleats .
Design Note :
More fullness can be added at the waistline by opening the grainline further at the waist and making deeper pleats .
Mark points ( c ) and ( d ) on hemline ¾ ” [ 20 mm ] inward from leg seam .
Draw straight line from ( d ) to kneeline .
Draw in a bowed outseam ( curve ) from hipline tapering to ( c ) .
Shape the bottom hemline with a straight line .

Do you ever wonder whether all those security - awareness posters , coffee mugs , pens , mouse pads , and sandwich - bag clips are having any effect at all to improve security ?
Do you ever wonder whether all those security - awareness posters , coffee mugs , pens , mouse pads and sandwich - bag clips are having any effect at all to improve security ?
Actually , they may be making things worse – if they violate the principles established by psychologists .
My good friend and colleague , security - awareness guru K Rudolph of Native Intelligence describes how to use the science of persuasion to improve security awareness messages .
Everything that follows is entirely K's work with minor edits .
* * *
Robert B. Cialdini , Regents ' Professor of Psychology and Marketing at Arizona State University , is considered an expert on influence .
He studies and writes about the science of persuasion .
He 's one of the authors of Yes ! : 50 Scientifically Proven Ways to Be Persuasive – my favorite book about social - psychological research on persuasion .
Yes has a chapter about a common mistake that causes messages to self - destruct .
The authors tell the story of former graduate student who had visited the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona with his fiancée .
At the park 's entrance a sign stated , " Your heritage is being vandalized every day by theft losses of petrified wood of 14 tons a year , mostly a small piece at a time . "
The student was shocked when after reading the sign , his normally ultra - honest fiancée whispered , " We 'd better get ours now . "
This incident inspired the authors to design an experiment where they posted two different signs .
One used the concept of " negative social proof . "
It read , " Many past visitors have removed the petrified wood from the park , changing the natural state of the Petrified Forest . "
That sign also showed a picture of several visitors taking pieces of wood .
The experiments placed a second sign to simply convey that stealing wood was not appropriate .
The second sign said , " Please do n't remove the petrified wood from the park , in order to preserve the natural state of the Petrified Forest . "
The accompanying image showed a lone visitor stealing a piece of wood , covered by the universal " No " symbol of a red circle with a slash through it .
The experimenters placed marked pieces of wood along various pathways and observed how the signs affected the rate of theft .
They switched the signs at the entrance to the pathways , and they also used pathways with no signs posted as a control condition .
The results and analysis ?
• Where there was no sign , 2.92 % of the wood pieces were stolen .
Where the social proof sign ( stating that many visitors had removed wood ) was posted , the theft rate increased to 7.92 % .
Where the sign asked people not to steal the wood and depicted a single thief , the theft rate decreased to 1.67 % .
• Put simply , social proof refers to our tendency to go along with the crowd and follow the most popular course of action .
We do things that we see other people like us doing .
• Using negative social proof , e.g. , communicating the popularity of an undesirable behavior , focuses the audience on the prevalence , rather than the undesirability , of the behavior .
• The authors recommended that the park management reframe the statistics to focus attention on the number of people who respect the park 's rules , which turned out to be more than 97 % .
Here 's an example of how I applied this lesson to security awareness .
To catch peoples ' attention , I like to introduce each awareness topic with something unexpected – a humorous quote , an unusual image , or a statement designed to elicit an audience reaction of surprise , " I did n't know that , " or , " I never thought of it that way . "
Todd Snapp , president of RocketReady , frequently speaks to audiences about the human side of security .
He often asks the audience to guess the most common passwords that his team of penetration testers finds in organizations where the passwords requirements include using characters from at least three sets ( e.g. , uppercase , lowercase and numbers ) and the passwords had to be changed every 90 days .
Audience members usually call out with guesses , but they rarely guess the answer .
When Todd tells them , there is usually a collective groan and head slap as audience wonders why such a simple and retrospectively obvious answer did n't occur to them .
The answer ?
The season and the year : Fall2008 , Winter2008 or Winter2009 .
Based on the audience reaction , I decided that this tidbit of information would be a good way to introduce the topic of passwords .
In the next e-learning course module for passwords , I worked on , I placed a " Did You Know ? " graphic followed by a quote from Todd 's presentation starting with , " The most common passwords we find … " .
About a week later , the light bulb came on when I read Yes !
I realized that by presenting the information as I had , I was conveying the wrong message – despite the implied disapproval of choosing passwords that are easy - to - guess – that such behavior is common .
The quote acted as strong social proof that many people just like the audience choose these easily - guessed passwords .
This realization made me wonder how often we misunderstand the impact of our messages .
I immediately changed the introduction to advise people not to choose the season and year for passwords and to focus their attention on a positive behavior .
I used an image showing people who had chosen strong passwords speaking disapprovingly of a single person in the organization who used the season and year .
This made it clear that people who use weak passwords are in the minority and are disapproved of by their co-workers .
So remember : emphasize the deviance , not the popularity , of insecure behavior .

In my last post I ’ve mentioned my way through VIM .
Quiting TextMate cold turkey was n’t easy .
But fear not : there are a bunch of plugins that will make it a breeze .
Bellow a list of the best ones to fill the gap :
DelimitMate
When in insert mode , will auto balance paired delimiters ( parenthesis , brackets , quotes , angle brackets ) .
This is a default in TextMate , when you type a balanced delimiter it inserts the closing one and puts the cursor in the middle .
This is a pretty new plugin , I do n’t think it has received the attention it deserves .
NerdTree
A file explorer thing , similar to the project drawer in TextMate .
NerdCommenter : A plugin that makes commenting source code dead easy .
Supports many languages , and has smart settings ( toggle , visual mode , etc ) .
Fuzzy Finder TextMate .
This was the feature that I missed the most : a quick way to navigate through files ( aka command T ) also through tags in a source file ( aka command shift T ) .
Just brilliant , and also adds some nifty features such searching from the most recently used files .
This plugin required ruby support .
SnipMate : snippets support , much like TextMate’s .
YankRing implements a kill ring for the yank buffer .
Pretty much like TextMate ’s copy and paste history , but more configurable and powerful : VIM style .
With those plugins in place , there are n’t any major features missing .
Having those plugins for VIM is a testimony of how TextMate has really brought good ideas into the editor scene .
It also corroborates VIM ’s extensibility .
Even under primitive constrains ( no GUI , terminal only ) , VIM is able to mimic those features .
Also , other plugins that I ’ve found essential :
Surround : smartly inserts , changes and removes balanced delimiters including XML tags .
Taglist : parses and helps you to navigate through structured source code .
Align : makes source code alignment a breeze ( hard to explain , give it a shot ) .
All in all , with the right plugins , VIM can match most of TextMate ’s features .
Are there any other plugins I should know about ?
I ’m here because I decided to start blogging after reading several posts from feminist blogs , including this one ( Schrödinger ’s Rapist ) .
My goal on this blog is to try to approach the idea of gender equality and issues from a point of logical discourse .
With that in mind , I ask that that anyone commenting please keep your comments in a context of logic and rationality .
While emotion can fuel a desired goal , only logical thought will see us through to a successful conclusion .
Regarding the blogpost that I listed above , I approached this page with the genuine intention of finding out what the poster put out and understanding what was written .
But I came to a realization ; most of the commenting readers on the page and ( apparently the blog owner , as I was banned after a few pointed comments and questions ) , do not want men to understand .
From what I got , a large number of the female posters wanted to revel in being “ victims of male privilege . ”
I have to say that the guest blogger , Ms. Starling demonstrated a genuine desire to have a open and meaningful dialogue about the topic and I complement her on both her blog post and her professionalism in her replies .
Nearly all the others had nothing but scorn for any male who posted anything other than a total and complete self - effacing admission that they were part and parcel contributors to rape culture .
They did n’t want involved dialog , nor did they want open discussion .
All that they wanted were high - fives from the women commenters and any men who wanted to comment on the page were expected grovel and own up to their being complicit in the evil patriarchy .
I ’m quite fracking tired of feminists who feel entitled to barge into male internet ( and real - life ) spaces as it is their feminist - mandated right to do so , but raise hell and throw around ban hammers on men who likewise come into their spaces ( or flat out refuse to let men post ) .
Ladies … you get what you give .
Feel free to shoot down the trolls who just show up to start shit , but learn to tell the difference between those who troll and those who want to ask real questions .
( It goes both ways , ladies … troll is a gender - neutral term . )
In fact , more than a couple of men who were victims of rape by women aggressors were at best casually patronized , and at worst , blatantly ridiculed .
I have no sympathy for these people and the fact that they want sympathy but are unwilling to give it themselves sickens me .
Rape is a horrible crime and anyone who commits it is deserving of punishment and / or help as they are sick individuals .
( By the way , this last belief was argued by feminists on that page too .
I guess that feminists feel that the crime of rape is not the act of a sick mind but an act of diabolic evil .
That is a topic for another blog post . )
Finally , to any of the feminists ( especially the ones who commented on Ms. Starling ’s post ) who may read this blog , allow me to say this ; there are far more men who are at best ignorant about what you believe rape culture consists of and belittling them on a website will not get them to see your point of view ; it just makes you an internet troll just like the trolls who purposely go on web sites to cause grief .
Furthermore , any man who is willing to hold a dialog with you about an feminist issue most likely is willing to be “ converted to your cause . ”
And yes , “ he is doing you a favor ” because he is willing to try to let go of some of his preconceptions about gender relations in order to try to be more understanding about your point of view .
Vilifying such a man will most likely convert him to misogyny as your vitriol in belittling him will only prove the other misogynists right in his eyes .
And before anyone posts that I do n’t understand what “ rape culture ” is , I ’m rather versed in it and I ’ve even read up on it .
There are facets of “ rape culture ” that tie into African American history that directly impacted our ethnic outlook .
Furthermore , I ’ve even read the post about Shakesville regarding the subject .
With that being said , my agreement or disagreement on each of the individual items in Ms. McEwan ’s blog listed under the collective connotation of rape culture are not relevant to my ability ( or lack thereof ) of being able to constructively have an intelligent opinion regarding gender equality .
Furthermore , the fact that I do recognize that overall that there are facets of human civilization and society which are harmful toward the well - being of women , men , and children in particular and humanity in general , is relevant .
Finally , the fact that I want to address and help in addressing the current social disconnect between women and men , should end any further debate about my motives or ability to contribute constructively to this issue .
But I was instead bombarded with digs and attacks as responses to logically focused requests as to how to better work with this issue .
All that I and the other men who asked the question as to how would a guy try to approach a woman and how to figure out whether she wanted to be approached , were given the answer :
“ Assume that all women do not want to be approached unless she lets you know that she wants to be approached . ”
Well , according to logic , then the only way that would be is if a woman decided to make first contact in some nebulous manner ( a wave , a wink , a cardboard sign ) , that could or could not be construed as an unwanted contact ( okay , except for the cardboard sign ) .
One commenter said that anyone who bothered could just read the woman ’s body language to see if she was amenable to a cold contact or not by the male .
Body language , eh ?
The poster gave examples of “ nervous smiling , ” “ twisting of the hair , ” and other things of that nature .
Here ’s a question ; is she nervous because she is afraid of me , or is she nervous because she likes me and is uncertain as to how this first talk will go ?
This idea would be especially problematic for the socially - inept male who has no knowledge as how to read women ’s body language
I can see how that first encounter will end .
“ Officer , I do n’t understand !
I read her body language and she seemed kind of shy , but she was smiling so I figured that she was still interested … why am I being arrested ?
I ’m no masher ! ”
Despite the fact that many of the men posting agreed that if a woman did not want to talk to a guy who approached her cold , she had the right to not be bothered , most of the male questions and requests for further clarification were met with ridicule and scorn from the assembled feminist commenters and some of the blog moderators .
Then I learned from one of the blog mods something that clued me in to a way how most guys could tell .
Are you ready ?
Here we go .
Guys , if you see a woman in public , especially traveling on a form of public transportation reading a book or wearing a pair of headphones , do n’t approach her .
In fact , one of the regular bloggers / moderators stated that many women wear headphones in public because they do n’t want men to talk to them .
Whenever a man brought up the idea of the uninterested woman politely but firmly telling the intruding guy that she was n’t interested in a contact , we told that we could n’t understand the issue .
And when we insisted in saying that if the guy was a problem , then make a scene and let people around you know that he was a bother , we were again told that we did n’t understand .
Women , could you please confirm or deny this datum ?
I ’m puzzled ; I wear headphones because I want to listen to music or pass the time while I ’m traveling or waiting for something .
Could you please try to make an explanation that is not couched in derision and condescension .
A lot of women posted words to the effect of : “ We have a right to not be hit upon by guys . ”
Agreed .
But at the same time , the drive for romantic companionship or sexual intimacy are two of human civilization ’s most fervent drives .
There should be rules and conventions regarding inter - gender contact .
But right now as the prevailing social dynamic stands , the male of the species is the designated initiator of this type of contact .
Yes , more women are adopting a willingness to initiate contacts with males for the purpose of romantic or sexual liaisons and fewer of them are being ostracized for doing so ( thank whatever deity you believe in for that ) .
But again , nobody on that blog page could come up with a reasonable alternative that could be clearly conveyed to men who were interested in resolution other than just “ leave women alone . ”
The only problems with that idea is :
Until our social gender conventions are completely changed , it runs the risk of further causing social problems for women who have no problem with approaching men for romantic or sexual liaisons .
The only people who will be disadvantaged by this convention will be the socially - inept men who for whatever reason cannot read between the lines .
These men will continue to bother women because they will have no idea as how to time or schedule their approaches as not to offend or violate a woman ’s personal space .
I suggested that we adopt the Victorian usage of the “ calling card . ”
Rather than try to initiate a total cold contact with a woman on the street .
A fellow could use a calling card with his name , a polite statement and me , ans of contact printed on it .
The woman had the option to either accept the card or reject it and if she did accept it , then she still had the option to either follow up on the contact or simply discreetly dispose of the card , thereby ending the situation .
In addition , with this convention , it would be assumed that the offering party ( male in this case ) , bore the burden of dealing with rejection as it would be deemed “ unseemly ” for him ( or her ) to focus it on the potential recipient of your calling card .
The advantage of the card was that rather than a woman having deal with a lengthy interruption of her previous activity , she just either took the card or not at her choice .
While that was not a perfect alternative , nobody could offer one better .
But the replies ( except from Ms. Starling ) were couched in words to the effect of : “ Yeah , but why should we have to even bother with that ? ”
I do n’t have an answer .
Ladies , guys are going to hit on you .
Humanity has not evolved yet beyond being able to approach a person of the opposite gender ( or preference ) without some level of sexual evaluation .
( Except for the number of “ asexual ” humans who seem to be popping up as of late . )
I ’m sure that some feminist will accuse me of advocating rape culture by making that statement .
No .
That .
Is. Not. Rape . Culture .
That .
Is. Human .
Social .
Biology .
Men and women evaluate each other as potential mates or sexual partners .
All of this debate is simply how can we be polite about it .
On a side note to Kate Harding , the owner of the “ Shapely Prose ” blog :
People base a great deal of their personal knowledge on personal experience .
While this does not define the entire body of our available and collective knowledge , personal experience often shapes our individual and to some degree our collective viewpoints .
Dismissing another person ’s experiences offhandedly is in of itself , a rather dangerous form of hubris as you risk placing your personal experiences above someone elses and thereby denying yourself of information that would not have otherwise been available .
Furthermore Ms. Harding , there is a debate , if no longer on your site , at least on the rest of the web because feminist theory has been steadily shaping national policy and social convention .
I , for one , will do my damnedest to see that the future will be shaped in the interests of neither men or women , but in the interests of humanity .
There are men and women who are genuinely interested in pursuing an informed and hospitable dialog regarding equality in gender relations .
I ’m sorry to see that your page does not support that ideal .

Bad Sci-Fi , No Cookie !
I do n’t exactly keep it a secret that I love fantasy and science fiction : Star Wars , Star Trek , Doctor Who , Harry Potter , His Dark Materials , just to name a few .
I grew up on Amazing Stories , The Twilight Zone , and The Outer Limits .
I have no problem with blending science fiction with fantasy .
I love Piers Anthony for the way he combines the two .
But as with anything , it needs to be done well .
I recently discovered that Hulu has the original Outer Limits , not just the remade series , and had a bit of a geek - gasm over it .
So I sat down to watch the legendary show from its beginnings , and I was enjoying the trip back to 1963 until I hit the episode called “ The Sixth Finger ” ( season 1 , episode 5 ) That was when it struck me , perhaps rather belatedly , that TV writers just do n’t know science .
You see , while it ’s true that any good story is about people and how they respond to situations they ’re in , perhaps highlighting important issues in the process , what makes science fiction what it is is the science .
Radical concept , I know .
Magic makes fantasy , cowboys make westerns , and science makes science fiction .
And bad science makes bad science fiction .
“ The Sixth Finger ” deals with a man who has been artificially evolved tens of thousands of years into humanity ’s future , and later is reverted to his original state .
Now certainly , we often wonder what Homo sapiens will look like in that far distant time , and there have been science fiction stories written where we get to see what we might look like then , through the vehicle of either time travel or simply setting the story in that time period .
This is fine because time travel has not been definitively disproved , and conjecture is the backbone of all speculative fiction .
But showing evolution in one person is plain old bad science fiction , because it is grounded in bad science .
Evolution is not a force unto itself and has no ultimate or inevitable goal .
Also , individuals do n’t evolve : a species as a whole does over the course of generations .
Evolution starts with a random mutation , an accident in the DNA copying process in the earliest stages of conception , sometimes as a result of a faulty sperm or egg .
Some mutations are minor and end up making little or no difference .
Others can cause or lead to disfiguration , disability , or disease .
Others yet can end up being useful .
When organisms procreate , they pass on their mutations good , bad , and indifferent .
Once enough people with a particular mutation pass it on to enough offspring , it becomes the norm , whatever that trait happens to be .
Evolution has happened and the mutation is no longer considered to be such .
Evolution is “ directed , ” for lack of a better term , by natural selection and sexual selection .
Natural selection means that if a mutation ends up being useful and gives those who have it an advantage over those who do n’t , then in time it is likely that more organisms will have it than not and they will be said to have evolved in that direction .
Sexual selection is a matter of organisms choosing mates based on characteristics they have .
If a given set of characteristics is more desirable than others , then those who have it will be more successful in finding mates and those genes will be more likely to be passed on .
In time , again , more organisms will have it than not and they will be said to have evolved in that direction .
The important aspect is that an overwhelming majority have , for whatever reasons , passed on a certain trait that began as a lowly chance mutation .
Evolution does n’t always happen in a necessarily positive direction , either .
Peacocks are a great example of sexual selection driving evolution into questionable territory .
Peahens are attracted to the grand and brightly colored plumage , but so are predators .
Forcing evolutionary change in an individual with no selective pressures to guide it , not to mention the assumption that any given individual possesses within him the full “ potential ” that mankind can become , is a nice mythology , an imaginative fantasy , but it is profoundly bad science .
And this episode makes it clear that we are dealing with straight science fiction , not fantasy .
We ’ve known the basic mechanics of evolution for a while , so I ’m not entirely sure we can chalk it up to 1963 .
Either way , it fails to stand the test of time .
The sad part is that in 1996 , Star Trek : Voyager aired an episode named “ Threshold ” ( season 2 , episode 15 ) that dealt with Paris and Janeway evolving forward and back again .
Here ’s the deal :
If science fiction deals with something not well understood at the time , but later is proved to be quite different from how it ’s portrayed , that simply makes that story dated .
If , however , science fiction deals with something that is reasonably understood , but portrays it in a significantly different way , that makes very bad science fiction because it ’s based on very bad science .
Independent Cinema .
A once byword for daring , independent filmmaking has been co-opted by the studios into what now means a quirky , feel - good turd wrapped in a soundtrack by the likes of Smog , Ween and any other number of lo - fi bands that play coffee - houses across America .
Indie cinema is studio - backed and financed fluff that does nothing different to major releases other than have a smaller marketing budget and smaller name actors desperately grubbing for credibility amongst their Mac-using peers .
They want to appear at Sundance and be nominated for Oscars , whilst maintaining an indie - ethos and a smug , " Yeah we 're different to Will Smith movies " air .
No you 're not , Away We Go , 500 Days of Summer , Peter & Vanya , Love In Paris and any other number of forgettable lightweight films that refuse to take advantage of having the freedom that a lesser - budget film provides .
You 're the same shit that Jennifer Aniston makes , you just wear a scruffy jumper you bought from a second hand store .
Truly independent cinema takes risks , does n't follow the safe formulaic path of studio releases and tries to do something different .
And right now , the biggest indie director and self - proclaimed " Best Director in the World " Lars Von Trier is busy defending his latest , Antichrist , from the boos at Cannes , the outrage from Daily Mail critic Chris Tookey and shrugging at the howls of outrage from middle America magazines like Variety and Hollywood Reporter .
If you 're familiar with Von Trier , you know what to expect from Antichrist and you can't complain about being upset and offended : because that 's precisely what he sets out to do .
He creates wilfully cynical , dark and difficult films that defy categorisation and force you to confront emotions you probably do n't really feel like dealing with on a sunny afternoon in September .
Dancer in The Dark ?
A Death - Row musical that ended with Bjork running away mid-shoot and trying to eat her costume because of her treatment by Von Trier .
Dogville ?
Nicole Kidman subjected to repeated sexual abuse and dragging an iron weight around a set comprised of outlines drawn on the stage and nothing else .
Breaking The Waves ?
Emily Watson degrading herself sexually at the behest of her crippled husband .
The Idiots ?
People pretending to be retarded to see what they can get away with .
Antichrist ?
Genital mutilation , an infant child falling to his death with no cut- away before hitting the pavement , a talking fox , a crow that wo n't die and a deer in mid stillbirth running away with the dead baby literally hanging from its rear .
And those are some of the more cheerful moments .
Von Trier offends and upsets .
He delights in doing so and relishes confronting moral codes and pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable to be shown and thought about .
Antichrist has penetrative sex , clitoral castration , rotting animals and graphic masturbation ending in blood ejaculatory .
Is it a good film ?
I do n't know .
Is it art ?
Absolutely .
Is it entertaining ?
That 's the wrong word , I 'd use powerful .
Is it for everybody ?
Not at all .
But that 's what indie cinema should be about ; using the freedom from the studio system to attempt to explore ideas and emotions that you 'd never get away with within the system .
And I 'm sorry , but Away We Go - a film about two people trying to decide where to have their baby - is labelled ' indie ' ?
The fuck it is .
That could star Eric Bana and Rachel Weisz with a soundtrack by The Goo Goo Dolls and tie - in novella reviewed by Richard & Judy .
Whether you like Von Trier or not , it is vital that directors such as him and Todd Solondz exist and make challenging films with ideas you may not agree with or like .
Because otherwise we are left with a landscape that offers such directors as Spike Jonze ( Being John Malkovich was indie , but he's now making Where The Wild Things Are with reshoots after studio suggestions ) or Michel Gondry ( Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind was indie but he's now doing The Green Hornet ) .
Tarantino was indie ( well , Reservoir Dogs was , but his every film since has been a star bloated floater ... discuss ) but now directs episodes of ER and has become a parody .
Former directors that once proclaimed their indie-cred but have been swallowed into the system and now make major - budget summer release movies - their individualism hammered into a more palatable style and given multi-million dollar budgets and release dates ahead of filming .
Hollywood loves quirky idiosyncratic voices and seeks them out , whereupon they dilute what they originally liked and make it into a Happy Meal version that wo n't upset or offend or puzzle the audience in Kansas .
Because it 's all about the $ $ $ $ $ at the end of the day .
And then stands somebody like Lars Von Trier .
He 's been accused of many many things with his films - misogyny , emotional aloofness , mindless shock tactics , cynicism , cruelty towards his actresses and so on .
But not once has he been accused of making a generic film that could be made by anybody else .
Like him or love him , Von Trier makes films for himself that happen to find an audience .
As does David Lynch , another independent director .
He flirted with mainstream offerings like The Elephant Man and The Straight Story , but retreated back into making films exactly how he wants , on his own terms - audiences and Hollywood be damned .
His TV series Twin Peaks was a monster hit for the first series , but then audience figures fell away when it got stranger and stranger .
Lynch has since confessed that he made it deliberately more " Lynch - ian " when he became uncomfortable with the success .
Inland Empire was his most recent .
Did I watch and love it ?
Yep .
Did I understand what the fuck was going on at any point ?
Nope .
But I love Lynch 's films and can't explain why ; I just surrender to his vision and world and let him take me on the ride .
Did I enjoy " Inland Empire " ?
Maybe , but it challenged me , it made me angry and made me happy , confused and confounded me , offended and upset me .
This is what I expect and demand from independent cinema .
Darren Aronofsky is another .
Pi ?
Black and white , obscure and intelligent .
Requiem For a Dream ?
Horrible , horrible film , but in a good way - the best anti-drugs advert ever made .
The Fountain ?
Still not sure about that but I enjoy it more each time I watch it - and the fact the movie still got made after Brad Pitt pulled out speaks volumes .
The Wrestler ?
Mickey Rourke as an ex-WWF star down on his luck ... okay , this should n't have worked but we all know how that turned out .
He 's a director that has remained outside of the system and makes personal films with no eye towards an audience .
That is what independent cinema should be .
Films made with no real eye towards box office or reviews or appearing on Letterman to whore your product before release .
Films that tell a personal story , offer a vision unique to that director without a ready - made soundtrack ; films that require you to work at .
Not films that offer everything on a plate and are neatly resolved within 90 mins with an option for a sequel .
Challenging , difficult , obscure , personal , infuriating , delightful , and offensive .
Indie films should be anything other than forgettable McMovies made with no real passion or involvement , telling bullshit stories that Hollywood could produce a million times better .
Which brings me back to Lars Von Trier and Antichrist .
Idiots will watch this solely on the outrage and disgust heaped upon it , and will walk away saying it was rubbish because it does n't conform to traditional movie constructs .
These are the same whooping bozos who buy Hostel and Hostel : Part II on DVD and sit guffawing at the violence and dismemberment meted out to women without questioning themselves for doing so .
There is horrific violence in Antichrist , graphic and sickening sexual violence .
But with a purpose , not for entertainment .
When female character ' She ' mutilates herself ( in extreme close - up ) it is punishment for enjoying sex , which resulted in the death of her child .
So what better way to punish herself than remove that which drove her to neglect her duties as a mother ( her words ) , coupled with a flashback that suggests she saw her child climbing out the window but did nothing to prevent it , climaxing as he fell .
Yes , Von Trier 's underlying theme of misogyny is present in Antichrist , but it is confronted and dealt with .
The entire film is an exploration of being a woman , the mix of mother and sexual being , the strength of being female , the fear of males to a sexually aggressive female , the treatment of women throughout the years by men .
All themes & emotions that perhaps the average cinema - goer does n't want to be forced to dig up and deal with , hence the outrage and genuine anger at Von Trier .
I get the feeling the reaction is n't so much towards the film but anger at not understanding the emotions and feelings brought up by watching .
So love him or hate him , Von Trier will continue to make his confrontational films and I 'll continue to seek them out because I like to be challenged , prodded and goaded by a film .
Anything beats sitting back munching snacks and watching quirky indie - type characters in yet another safe , non-participatory film masquerading as independent cinema .
So , in conclusion .
Sam Mendes ?
Michel Gondry ?
Spike Jonze ?
Spike Lee? Diablo Cody ?
Wes Anderson ?
Quentin Tarantino ?
Your Indie Film is Shit .
Follow us on Twitter @ The_Shiznit for more fun features , film reviews and occasional commentary on what the best type of crisps are .
This is the fourth in a series of blog posts I ’m doing on the upcoming VS 2010 and .NET 4 release .
Today ’s post covers one of the general IDE improvements that I know a lot of people are already eagerly looking forward to with VS 2010 – multiple - monitor support .
Using Multiple Monitors
VS 2008 hosts all documents / files / designers within a single top - level window – which unfortunately means that you can’t partition the IDE across multiple monitors .
VS 2010 addresses this by now allowing editors , designers and tool - windows to be moved outside the top - level window and positioned anywhere you want , and on any monitor on your system .
This allows you to significantly improve your use of screen real - estate , and optimize your overall development workflow .
Taking advantage of the multi- monitor feature is really easy to - do .
Simply click on a document tab or tool - window and drag it to either a new location within the top - level IDE window – or outside of the IDE to any location on any monitor you want :
You can later drag the document / window back into the main window if you want to re-dock it ( or right click and choose the re-dock option ) .
Visual Studio remembers the last screen position of documents when saved – which means that you can close projects and re-open them and have the layout automatically startup where you last saved it .
Some Multi-Monitor Scenarios
Below are some screen - shots of a few of the scenarios multi-monitor enables ( obviously there are many more I ’m not covering ) .
Pretend each window in the screenshots below is on a different monitor to get the full idea …
Code source file support :
Demonstrates how code files can be split up across multiple monitors .
Below I ’ve kept a .aspx file in the main IDE window and then moved a code - behind file and a separate class file to a separate screen :
Tool window support :
Demonstrates how any tool window / pane within VS10 can be split across multiple monitors .
Below I ’ve moved the test runner tool windows to a separate screen :
Designer support :
Demonstrates how a designer within VS can be split across multiple monitors .
Below I ’ve moved the WPF / Silverlight WYSWIYG designer and the property grid to a separate screen ( the code behind file is still in the main window ) .
Note how the VS10 property grid now supports inline color editors , databinding , styles , brushes , and a whole bunch more for WPF and Silverlight applications ( I ’ll cover this in later blog posts ) :
Summary
If you work on a system that has multiple monitors connected to it , I think you are going to find the new multi-monitor support within VS10 a big productivity boost .
If you do n’t already have multiple monitors connected to your computer , this might be a good excuse to get some … :-)
Hope this helps ,
Scott

There is an unconfirmed report that Calvin Coolidge visited MIT and drank tea at Walker Memorial , but no information about when this might have taken place .
President Barack Obama 's visit to MIT this week will be only the second time a sitting U.S. president has appeared at the Institute , and the first such visit that is not for a Commencement speech .
Presidentwas the Commencement speaker in 1998 .
MIT has also hosted these other visits by past or future presidents :
1 . The European Union has already created massive pockets of unemployment , with countries such as Spain – who have ratified Lisbon – suffering with unemployment rates of 18 % .
Why should Ireland sign up to a failing European Union ?
2 . About 450,000 people are unemployed , crushed by cuts , taxes , mortgage payments , on top of public bank - bail - outs and yet , the politicians who brought this upon Ireland are also asking for trust over the Lisbon treaty .
3. MEPs claim up to € 1,000,000 in expenses each term , while massive job losses continue on an everyday basis .
4. Ireland remains a full member of the EU without the Lisbon treaty , and is in fact economically and politically better off without the treaty .
5 . If Ireland votes
No , she will continue to have access to Europe ’s single market – the Lisbon treaty is concerned more with intensifying European government , using a constitutional document , which will crush trade , jobs and industry in Ireland .
6. Foreign investment has actually increased since Ireland voted No last year .
7 . Under the Lisbon treaty , the EU can levy taxes on Ireland for the first time .
8. 150,000 Irish jobs , at least , are under threat through direct employment in multinational companies .
Since Lisbon will interfere in taxation and the low corporate tax rate , those multinationals will simply leave for lands with lower corporate tax rates .
9. Lisbon will not aid the recession – to the contrary , it will make it worse .
10 . The Lisbon treaty allows big business to import cheap labour and undercut Irish workers , in much the same way as it has done in labour disputes in the UK and the Nordic countries .
11 . The EU has created a programme for Ireland to cut public spending , enforcing tough cuts on ordinary people who are trying to make a living wage in difficult times .
12 . As Minister Brian Lenihan has said , massive and uncontrolled immigration of EU labour into Ireland helped to c au se the crash .
Overseas workers now make up almost 20 % of Ireland ’s unemployed .
13 . Lisbon hands full control over immigration and asylum policy to the EU , under Article 79 , for workers inside and outside the EU – from England to India .
14 . EU politicians have falsely assured people that on Lisbon , they are protected from EU changes to the law on abortion , taxation and defence , but those assurances are not part of the Lisbon treaty ( Judge Frank Clark , Chairman of the Referendum Commission ) and are not EU law – so Lisbon would in fact lead to changes on abortion , taxation and defence .
15 . Under the Charter of Fundamental Rights , attached to the treaty , the EU Court will decide on laws relating to abortion , raising children , marriage and euthanasia .
It removes the voice of the Irish people on those issues .
16 . Lisbon weakens Ireland in the European Union : while countries such as Germany double their voting power to 17 % , Ireland ’s voting power will be reduced from 2 % to 0.8 % .
It means Ireland will have no say over key issues .
17 . Lisbon would drastically reduce Ireland ’s place in the European Union .
It would reduce Ireland ’s representation leaving her completely isolated .
There are new provisions to put EU law - making on a pure population size basis , just as in any unitary or federal state .
At present , big states have 29 votes each in making EU laws and Ireland has 7 – a ratio of 4 to 1 .
Under Lisbon , EU laws would be made by a majority of the EU member states as long as they have 65 % of the total EU population between them .
Instead of the big states having 4 times Ireland ’s voting weight , as it is now , this change to a pure population basis would give Germany 20 times Ireland ’s weight and France , Britain and Italy 15 times each .
18 . Lisbon means that Ireland loses the right to veto harmful measures in over 60 areas .
If a proposal comes up that Ireland cannot abide by , it will not have the power to block it , as she will have given up her veto .
19 .
The treaty is a new European Constitution , which by law , will have superiority over the Irish Constitution .
If it is accepted , the Irish people will give up their constitutional rights under the Irish Constitution and be subject to very different constitutional arrangements under the European Constitution .
20 . Under Lisbon , Europe assumes a new position over Irish national security : Article 61 F pushes for the development of Super - Union cooperative arrangements , under which , the drive towards federalist cooperation is first supported actively by the Union for measures going beyond EU law , and second that such super - Union cooperative agreements will in turn become EU law .
21 . Ireland will abandon its traditional criminal justice procedures , since the Lisbon treaty will establish a massive and “ fundamental change ” to the structure of the European Union : it will abolish the pillar structure and move police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters to the EC treaty , thus enabling Ireland ’s police and justice system to be fully subject to Union interference .
This will have serious implications bec au se decision - making on police and judicial cooperation would no longer be intergovernmental and it will be subjected to European decisions .
22 . European Commission proposals on inheritance law would prevent farmers passing on family farms as a single working unit .
If the Lisbon treaty is ratified , that will come into effect .
23 .
The loss of the state ’s veto on trade and services such as health and education in the Lisbon treaty would lead to a significant weakening of the protection for public services .
24 . Ireland ’s EU Commissioner Charlie McCreevy claimed that that 95 % of EU member states would have voted No like Ireland did , had the treaty been put to a vote in other countries .
25 . A Yes vote would not only jeopardise farm succession rights but would also lead to a massive influx of Turkish farmers into the European Union .
26 . The Lisbon vote is also a vote on Turkish accession .
It allows for a country of 75 million people to enter the EU , which would in fact double the number of farmers Ireland has , while also retaining the Common Agricultural Policy budget at existing levels .
27 . The Secretary - General of the Commission , who is an Irishwoman , Catherine Day , was instrumental in concealing from the general public the intention of the European Commission to harmonise inheritance and succession law .
28 . The European Commission interfered directly throughout Irelands ’ referendum process and even through the use of a web - site , particularly with critical comments on the ‘ Farmers for No ’ , a group breaking away from the Irish Farmers ’ Association , which is backing a Yes vote .
29 .
Is a Yes vote not merely a reflection of big finance from companies such as US multinational , Intel , spending several hundred thousand euros backing the Yes campaign ?
30 .
Irish fishermen will continue to having to struggle to survive financially while being forced to dump their catches at sea bec au se of fishing quotas , and have higher operating costs bec au se of the rules under the Common Fisheries Policy .
31 . Brussels ’ fishery policies blatantly favour non-EU imports and fleets of larger EU member states .
32 . The Lisbon vote is not about being at the heart of Europe or about being good Europeans .
It is about the kind of Europe that Ireland wants .
33 . Lisbon will be implemented to limit Ireland ’s right to encourage Foreign Direct Investment , interfering in both tax advantages offered to foreign companies as well as conditions on state aid .
Given the substantial number of Irish people employed by foreign companies in Ireland , handing over all this power to the EU is a dangerous step for Ireland .
34 . Declaration 17 on Primacy , attached to the Lisbon treaty , makes transparent that EU law succeeds Irish law in all existing and new areas covered by the Treaties , giving away and transferring Ireland ’s historic and democratic constitutional rights and freedoms .
35 .
The increased militarisation of Europe is of great concern to many people who would prefer to see Ireland retain neutrality .
In the referendums on Nice , Ireland was assured that a European Army would never happen , but now the basis for a common defence policy and EU battlegroups are in place .
Lisbon looks toward a ‘ progressive framing of a common Union defence policy ’ .
36 . Pro-life laws will be overruled if Lisbon is passed , as it will only take one court case ( such as the D case , funded by the Irish Family Planning Association ) to come before the European Court of Justice .
The ECJ will overrule on this .
The Irish Government will have its hands tied since there would be absolutely nothing it could do to reverse the European decision , or indeed reverse Lisbon .
37 . Ireland already has the the Maastricht protocol , drafted to protect Ireland ’s pro-life amendment ( Article 40.3.3 ) , but this would be knocked down in the European Court , whose heightened powers under the Lisbon treaty would rule over that , or other , protocols , once the Charter of Rights attached to Lisbon came into effect .
38 . Lisbon threatens the freedom of conscience , expression and worship .
The Bishops of England , Wales and Scotland have already denounced the European Commission ’s planned Equal Treatment Directive as “ wholly unacceptable ” bec au se they said it would force Christians to act against their consciences .
The Catholic Bishops say the Directive will result in sharply curtailing the rights of religious liberty and freedom of expression .
39 .
Voters should reaffirm the decision they had made in the first referendum in June last year bec au se “ nothing had changed ” in the treaty .
People voted for a better deal for Ireland and Europe .
Almost 1,000,000 people or 53 % of the electorate rejected the Lisbon treaty on June 12th 2008 .
The Treaty was itself already abandoned by Europe , as the EU Constitution , in 2005 , when both France and the Netherlands rejected it in referendums .
It is entirely undemocratic .
40 . Lisbon expands the range of political situations in which European military forces can intervene .
Under Article 28B , Lisbon will represent another grave step towards the federalist vision of a European fighting force .
41 . The European Commission ’s trade agenda promotes free trade , yet irrespective of the costs to European family farms and rural communities , or the world poorest communities and countries .
Lisbon gives the EU exclusive competence over commercial policy , including the negotiating of international trade agreements .
42 . Ryanair Chief , Michael O’Leary , provided comments in support of the Lisbon treaty , but Irish voters need to ask themselves , does Ireland really want a Ryanair Europe ?
43 . A second
No vote would strengthen the hand of any Irish government seeking to negotiate a better deal for Ireland and the EU .
44 . The Lisbon treaty is the work of Bertie Ahern and Charlie McCreevy , along with Silvio Berlusconi , Jose Manuel Barroso and Nicolas Sarkozy .
45 .
What would happen to employees of companies such as Waterford Glass or SR Technics , given that the Lisbon treaty imposes restrictions on state aid which might supposedly ‘ distort ’ the market ?
46 . Since concerns over Irish neutrality and European militarisation were a key reason for voting
No in the first referendum , according to the Irish Times and TNS surveys in May and June 2008 , why should the Irish people accept the Lisbon treaty take two ?
47 . Ireland is voting , in reality , on behalf of 500 million Europeans .
Ireland is the only state , out of the 27 EU member states , to have a referendum .
48 . The reason why Ireland has a referendum is important : if the treaty is ratified it would transfer powers from the Irish Constitution to the EU and Irish law requires that any changes to the Constitution must be subject to a referendum .
The Irish people gained this right bec au se an ordinary Irish citizen , Raymond Crotty , took his case to the Supreme Court in 1986 to guarantee this right , in the case of EU treaties .
49 . The Charter rolls back workers ’ rights by failing to include a cl au se requiring the recognitions of trade unions .
50 . Ordinary Irish people would be denied their basic rights in the workplace .
The ECJ , basing its judgements on the Charter , has recently ruled against Swedish workers ’ rights .
In the Vaxholm case , the Latvian company Laval wanted to use Latvian workers in Sweden but would not agree to Swedish pay and conditions .
Swedish unions opposed this treatment .
The Euoprean Court ruled that the union could only act to ensure the Swedish minimum wage was paid and go no further .
Other Swedish employment agreements could not be imposed .
It puts pressure on Irish workers to move towards minimum wage levels or risk losing their jobs .
A
No vote to Lisbon can be used to obtain a social Protocol which would outlaw these unjust verdicts of the EU Court .
51 . Under the terms of Lisbon , the European judicial body , Eurojust has now had its remits and powers hugely increased , affecting Ireland ’s own power over judicial investigations .
The Lisbon treaty introduces an Article which increases Eurojust ’s remit and powers .
The body ’s mandate is also extended into the types of crime it can investigate .
52 . Lisbon expressly provides that the European judicial body , Eurojust may have the power and the responsibility to initiate criminal investigations and also the power to initiate prosecutions , even though the prosecution would be conducted by the Irish national au thorities , under the supervision of the European Public Prosecutor .
53 .
The Lisbon treaty provides for the creation of a super - prosecutor , a European Public Prosecutor ’s Office ( EPPO ) , to combat crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union .
It will have the power to order national police forces to initiate investigations .
It will assemble all the evidence in favour or against the accused and will be responsible for conducting and coordinating prosecutions .
It will have jurisdiction over the Irish enforcement au thorities .
54 .
The treaty stresses that national parliaments will be under a definite European legal obligation to ensure that they comply with proposals and legislative initiatives in judicial cooperation in criminal policy and police .
Is this the future of Irish justice ?
55 .
A new Article under Lisbon proves that whilst the European Union is willing to freely pass on the personal crime - related data of Irish citizens around the 27 member states , it will not allow for sufficient data protection safeguards .
56 .
A new provision allows the Union to establish super cooperation involving all the member states ’ competent au thorities , including police , customs and other specialised law enforcement services in relation to the prevention , detection and investigation of criminal offences ( Article 69f ) , above and beyond Irish control over law enforcement .
57 . Lisbon confirms the EU commitment to the development of common asylum policy expressly stating on Article 63 that “ The Union shall develop a common policy on asylum … ” .
Since there is no veto power and the measures are adopted through the co-decision procedure , the Irish suffer a reduced influence in not only having a say in the development of an EU common asylum policy , but in being barred from developing its own independent asylum procedures .
58 . Lisbon weakens Parliament as it formalises the fact that Irish legislators will be unable to act in a particular area once the European Union has already acted .
Since that is the case , Irish parliamentarians will not be able to legislate under key areas specified under Article 2C , such as internal market practices , social policy , economic , social and territorial cohesion , agriculture and fisheries , environment , consumer protection , transport , trans - European networks , energy , areas of freedom , security and justice , common safety concerns in public health matters , research & technological development , international development cooperation and humanitarian aid .
What voice will Ireland have to change those polices after Lisbon ?
A vast range of activity , which should be under the remit of the Irish Government , will be handed over to EU control .
59 .
Lisbon threatens higher energy bills , since the basic control of national energy policy is actively transferred from member states to the EU .
The new Article 176A specifies the European Union ’s massive push toward a harmonised common energy policy .
Such a move is bad for Ireland and bad for Europe , and the global marketplace of energy resources .
It does nothing to serve in the interests of further liberalisation of the energy market – in fact , anti-competitive measures have been shown to have an obvious effect on increased business costs and consumer bills .
60 . Lisbon will threaten Ireland ’s energy security given that Lisbon will have a huge impact on the ability for Ireland to determine its own competitive energy policy .
This will prevent it from being able to guarantee flexibility to US contracts and interests in the UK , as it will for any other member state .
This will lead to huge instability in ( rather than guaranteeing ) the security of supply and also insecurities in the foreign policies of both the EU and the US in terms of their cooperation and agreements with oil - rich Middle Eastern countries .
61 . The detailed entitlement of rights – embodied in the Articles of the Lisbon treaty and the new Charter of Fundamental Rights – will represent a massive change in the way in which the Irish people are governed and who they are governed by .
62 . There is a new definition of European citizenship in the Lisbon treaty which will provide each citizen with a real dual citizenship : Union citizens and citizens of their national states .
However , Irish citizens do not trust the European institutions , there is no European demos , nor could the Irish people have loyalty to it , or identify with the creation of a European - wide demos .
A
Yes vote is a vote against democracy .
63 . Irish policy on Iraq , Afghanistan and Kosovo will be transferred to a new European foreign minister .
Ireland will not have a say on key foreign policy issues .
The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy represents a severe danger to an independent Irish foreign policy .
He or she will be appointed by the European Council , acting by a qualified majority vote and with the agreement of the President of the Commission .
It is an immense threat to the independence of Ireland in determining its own foreign policy , since this treaty essentially creates a European Foreign Minister , claiming to work on Ireland ’s behalf throughout the European Union .
Negotations on behalf of the Irish people will be held on the other side of Europe without the slightest involvement of an Irish representative or official .
64 .
The major role played by the Union itself in the international arena has now been consolidated with the Lisbon treaty , in contrast to Ireland and other member states , whose power on foreign policy is now reduced to a secondary au thority of a subsidiary province .
65 . The Lisbon treaty establishes the post of a new EU Foreign Minister , the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy .
The new post changes the nature of the relationship between Ireland , the other member states and the EU .
Heads of State and Government will no longer represent their countries on the international stage .
66 .
There will be a new President of Europe , sitting in the European Council – such a substantial transfer of more political power to EU level , through the new President of the European Council eliminates the ability of member states to conduct their own independent foreign policy .
67 . Lisbon places an obligation on member states that they uphold EU “ common positions ” in UN forums .
Ireland will be obliged to present the common foreign policy position as its own position , when attending the UN Security Council .
Ireland would be on the UN Security Council primarily to represent the EU ’s position , not its own interests .
68 . The intention of the European Union to develop a common European army is obvious .
69 . Lisbon turns the EU into a global political actor in its own right .
It transfers Ireland ’s powers to sign treaties with other states over to the Union .
It will allow the Union to increase the role it plays on the international stage and to promote its interests above Ireland ’s values .
The Union acquires the right to conclude international agreements .
The Union will gain the rights to conclude treaties , to submit claims or to act before an international court , to become a member of an international organisation , and to enjoy certain immunities .
70 .
Ireland will in fact sign a blank cheque if it gives the go - ahead to the treaty .
Lisbon introduces “ simplified revision procedures ” , meaning that the treaty is self - amending .
Ireland will no longer have referendums bec au se amendments will be made without any further need for treaties or ratification procedures .
Article 48 ( 6 ) has been called the “ ratchet cl au se ” and allows treaty amendments to be made without the necessity of a new , amending treaty and ratification .
The supposed intention of this provision is to simplify the revision of the treaties .
It will completely remove the Irish people from their say over Europe .
The simplified but wholly undemocratic revision procedures represent a significant increase in the power of the Union , at the expense of Ireland .
71 . The Union will further interfere with Irish employment and social policies .
It is not a surprise that Ireland records low ( and stagnated ) growth , since Europe already coordinates a number of economic and employment policies .
The agreement to certain provisions in this treaty is to put the opportunities and jobs ( now and in the long term ) of the Irish people at great risk .
72 . The EU will gain powers over controlling Irish industry , health , education , sport , culture , civil protection and tourism .
This is an intolerable state of affairs for the Irish people , which will cost the Irish economy billions .
73 . Lisbon reduces the meaning of a green passport to a mere symbol .
Under the EU ’s freedom of movement legislation , Lisbon provides the right for Ireland to adopt provisions concerning passports , identity cards , residence permits and other documents applying to the movement of EU citizens .
74 . Lisbon is entirely contrary to Ireland ’s wishes , given that in economic turmoil , when Ireland may have difficulty implementing one - size - fits - all EU legislation , the European Commission now gains the power to immediately impose penalty payments .
The European Court of Justice will impose a lump sum on Ireland when she has not implemented a Directive .
75 .
If Ireland does sign up to Lisbon , it will not then be able to opt - out of super - Union policies which have been developed between a select number of member states .
Lisbon demands that a number of member states can work ever - closer in “ enhanced cooperation ” on a particular policy ( based largely on existing Article 10 TEU ) .
If Ireland is not involved in the enhanced cooperation , she will be compelled to adopt the measures as if they were normal Union measures – Ireland will have had no say in the binding nature or the content of the measure .
76 . Lisbon really is a blank cheque in more ways than one – one provision allows the Union to create its own powers ( beyond the Treaties ) in order to pursue Union objectives , under Article 308 , so that if the Treaties have not provided the necessary powers for a certain action , the Council , acting on a proposal from the Commission can adopt any appropriate measures it feels necessary .
Quiet often , they will not be in Ireland ’s interest .
Lisbon states that the Commission only has “ to draw national Parliaments ’ attention to proposals based on this Article ” , rather than requiring any form of proper national agreement or consent .
Ireland will be writing a blank cheque on policies , it can ill afford to sign up to .
77 . How can Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and Foreign Minister Brian Cowen have agreed to such a bad deal when they signed up to the EU Constitution in 2004 , now repackaged as the Lisbon treaty ?
78 . Instead of the Irish Government deciding who Ireland ’s Commissioner is , under Lisbon , it will be Germany , France and the United Kingdom deciding .
Lisbon results in a shift from a bottom - up process for appointing EU Commissioners to a top - down one that benefits other and larger EU states .
The Irish Government ’s White Paper ignored that fact .
The promise of EU Prime Minister ’s or Presidents that every member state will continue to have its own national Commissioner after Lisbon is false .
79 . Lisbon , by law , would give the European Union a Constitution in the order of a supranational European federal state .
It would be superior to the Irish Constitution and laws in all the areas covered by the Treaties .
80 . Lisbon puts the competition rules of the EU market above the right of Irish trade unions to enforce pay standards higher than the minimum for migrant workers – so whilst it reduces the power of Irish labour , it reinforces the power of migrant workers .
81 . Those who vote Yes for Lisbon often warn of Ireland ’s isolation in Europe .
This is false on every count .
The political reality is that if Ireland votes No , the Czech Republic and Poland will , in turn , halt ratification of the treaty , since they are waiting to see what Ireland does .
Given the status of legal challenges , Germany may not have ratified the treaty either .
The next UK Government , which must be elected by next May , will also introduce a Bill on its first day in office to hold a referendum on Lisbon in the UK and recommend a No vote to it .
That will give Ireland ’s fellow neighbours in Northern Ireland the chance to vote on Lisbon too .
82 . A No vote on Lisbon would open to a new and genuinely more democratic EU , to be embodied in a new set of arrangements which would repatriate powers back to the member states , as Europe ’s original 2003 Laeken Declaration envisaged , along democratic lines .
83 . A No vote would stop the march towards an EU federal superstate that would be run on most undemocratic lines , under the total dominance of the elites of the larger EU states , namely Germany , in tandem with their officials in the Brussels Commission .
84 . The European Commission is spending some 1.5 million euros on a spurious information campaign in Ireland , supposedly aimed at giving Irish people more information on the EU , but in fact swaying their votes in the Lisbon referendum re-run on Friday 2 October toward a Yes vote .
85 . The European Commission has created a massive bill - board advertising campaign across Ireland , cinema advertising that is directed especially at Irish women and young voters , the holding of meetings and seminars and the use of web - sites .
Does Ireland , a free county , support the indoctrination of its youth with political messages ?
86 . The European Commission ’s supposed “ information campaign ” is programmed to go on into 2010 , as if it were an everyday exercise , but its l au nch in Ireland recently was set up to taint and influence the outcome of the Lisbon referendum in Ireland .
87 . Those involved in the Yes campaign , such as the Commission itself and Irish Foreign Minister Michael Martin writing in the Irish Independent , seem to have given advice under the mistaken impression that a “ double majority ” of number of member states plus a qualified majority of votes does not exist already for making EC / EU laws , when it actually does .
Their statements have thereby concealed the reduction of Ireland ’s voting weight .
88 . The European Commission , in supporting the Yes campaign in Ireland , has been wrong to suggest that human rights matters such as inheritance rights for Irish farmers would or could not be affected in a European Union , after it signed up to Lisbon .
Farmers ’ inheritance rights would be affected .
89 .
On human rights in general , the Irish people will have their rights set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights , which along with the treaty , will be made legally binding for EU citizens .
This means that all human rights issues would in principle fall within the remit of the European Court of Justice in the immediate future .
90 .
Ireland ’s ratification of the Lisbon treaty would give the 27 judges of the EU Court of Justice the power to decide sensitive matters over human rights , property rights and inheritance rights for the first time , as a consequence of new EU citizenship , entailing EU citizens ’ rights and duties within the new European Union after Lisbon .
91 . Czech President Vaclav
Kl au s has stated that the treaty would undermine Czech sovereignty , and so refuses to sign it .
The same is true of Irish sovereignty .
Kl au s later said , in respect of the Irish people , “ … the Lisbon treaty is dead , bec au se it was rejected in a referendum in one of the member states . ”
Irish democracy and sovereignty are paramount .
Are the Irish people prepared to give it away ?
92 . Ireland would have great support if it does say No .
For example , Poland ’s President Lech Kaczynski says he will not sign the treaty until it is passed in Ireland .
93 .
The Government has wrongly claimed it has assurances on important Irish concerns – they are not assured at all and will be pushed through in the distant future without any treaty ratification now .
The Irish Government is claiming that the Decision of the European Council on 19 June 2009 and the promised Protocol incorporating that Decision which is to be attached at some future date , will significantly limit the effect of the treaty of Lisbon on certain provisions of the Irish Constitution and will define what the effects of that treaty are on future Union competence in relation to key Irish assurances .
The Decision does not change the Lisbon treaty , as it stands , and it imposes such a restriction on the European Court of Justice in the future without proper treaty ratification now .
94 . The Irish Decision of the European Council on 19 June 2009 states that the future Protocol “ will clarify but not change either the content or the application of the treaty of Lisbon ” , but the Lisbon treaty is not yet in force and if the treaty of Lisbon does comes into force , the European Court of Justice would be free to interpret the Irish Decision in the opposite sense – for example , it would insist that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights can affect the articles relating to the right to life , the rights of the family and rights in respect of education set out in the Irish Constitution .
A Protocol , even if it is to be attached to some future treaty , indicates that a substantive treaty change is intended ( in contrast to say a Declaration , which does not ) .
This dishonesty must be met with a No vote .
95 .
The Irish Decision of the European Council on 19 June 2009 is not a real or legal assurance as the European Court of Justice will rule over the terms of this Decision , that the treaty makes no changes on taxation , for example , unless the member states have agreed to that by a normal treaty ratification process .
The Irish Decision is a substantive treaty change requiring re-ratification of the Lisbon treaty .
96 .
The Irish Decision of the European Council on 19 June 2009 falsely claims to be in Ireland ’s interest by limiting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in relation to specific aspects of the Lisbon treaty , even though the Court is the only legal body competent to decide on the interpretation and application of the Treaties .
The Irish people have been deceived on this and should vote
No on the basis of this disturbing but substantial confusion .
97 . Despite Ireland ’s economic turmoil , the Irish people will be subject to changes and notable increases in direct and indirect taxation , even though false assurances have been made to the contrary .
Under Lisbon , Article 311 TFEU would allow the EU to impose its own taxes by unanimous agreement .
Article 113 TFEU requires harmonisation of legislation on indirect taxation for a new purpose , “ to avoid distortion of competition ” , and would enable the European Court of Justice to rule on tax matters accordingly .
Any assurances made by the Irish Government on taxation are false and have no legal effect .
98 .
The Irish Government will be limited in its power over tax measures in difficult economic times bec au se of Lisbon .
The treaty asserts , under Protocol No 27 ( On the Internal Market and Competition ) , that the EU could vote down national tax measures if they can be regarded as c au sing distortion of competition on the internal market .
99 .
Ireland needs obvious constitutional safeguards from Lisbon and cannot sign up until it has achieved them .
For example , on 30 June , the German Constitutional Court in judging concerns over the Lisbon treaty has forbidden the German President from signing the treaty until the German Parliament adopted a law which would safeguard the involvement of their Parliament in future EU decision - making .
Other EU countries have sought constitutional safeguards .
Should Ireland not also reject Lisbon until it can insist upon the protection of its own Parliament , the voice of the Irish people ?

With Congress and regulators looming , and another populist bonfire threatening to jump the lines , San Francisco 's Wells Fargo & Co. joined Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday in addressing overdraft fees .
On a date to be determined , Wells Fargo and its Wachovia subsidiary will eliminate fees on customer overdrafts of $ 5 or less and will limit such charges to a maximum of four per day .
It will also allow customers to opt out of automatic overdraft coverage , meaning their debit card and ATM transactions wo n't go through if the account is overdrawn .
Wells Fargo 's changes are similar to those announced by BofA , which wo n't charge fees on overdrafts of less than $ 10 per day , beginning Oct. 19 , and Chase , which will limit its charges to overdrafts of $ 5 or more , and on no more than three overdrafts per day .
Both BofA and Chase will allow their customers to opt out of automatic overdraft protection .
" Most of our customers do n't need overdraft coverage in any given month , but for those that do we hope these changes , along with the tools we already provide , will help them minimize overdraft fees , " Wells Fargo 's senior executive VP Carrie Tolstedt said in a statement .
The changes may also mitigate the growing fury engendered by overdraft fees that , in Wells ' case , start at $ 25 for the first in a 12 - month period , and $ 35 thereafter .
In the meantime , Wells Fargo and the other banks have to figure out how to fill the holes in the estimated $ 29 billion or more per year they 've been making from the current system .
Perhaps that 's why Wells said its customers will get more information on the changes " over the coming months . "

Stepping up for schools : Before Wells ' major announcement , we received an earlier one that we 're happy to pass along .
The bank says its local branches , including Wachovia's , have donated $ 1,000 to each of more than 500 Bay Area schools hit by recent budget shortfalls .
The money is designed to help fund much - needed school supplies and education programs .
Fleet Week needs you !
San Francisco's 28 - year tradition of honoring America 's troops is the latest victim of the Great Recession .
The private funding , which organizers have never before had a problem raising , has fallen way short this year .
Steaming to the rescue is a Support Fleet Week cruise , due to set sail around the bay this evening from Pier 3 .
A dockside cocktail party will send you on your merry way , and there 'll be more cocktails and nibblies on board , along with dibs on a host of travel , hotel and other goodies , including a trip to Dollywood in Pigeon Forge , Tenn .
The cruise is $ 200 a pop , which its hosts , including the San Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau , the mayor 's office and a number of business organizations , hope will contribute greatly to the $ 100,000 needed to get the fleet into port next month .
" This is the first time we 've had to do this , " said Laurie Armstrong , vice president of public affairs at the Convention & Visitors Bureau .
" Hopefully , it 's the last . "

Life imitating science fiction : Redwood City 's Proteus Biomedical is partnering with Swiss pharma giant Novartis AG to produce a " chip on a pill " that not only treats the patient but follows up with a text message reminding him or her to keep taking the pill .
As reported in The Chronicle in December , the microchip transmits information on the pill 's digestion to a tiny transmitter affixed to the patient 's shoulder , then to the patient 's cell phone and doctor 's electronic records .
It 's all in aid of the push for patient " compliance " with prescribed medication , one of the next big things in " intelligent medicine . "
We wondered what other reminders Proteus might have in its kit bag if the chips do n't have the desired effect .
Have n't heard back yet .

SOUTH AFRICAN burglars pay close attention to electricity .
A moratorium in the early 1990s stopped new power stations from being built , and by 2007 demand was overwhelming the country 's electricity grid .
So Eskom , the national power company , began cutting supplies to specific suburbs for hours at a time .
One side - effect of the rolling blackouts that afflicted Cape Town and Johannesburg was that they disabled the electric fences , spotlights and alarms that adorn richer people 's houses , making them easy pickings for thieves .
At first the blackouts were announced in advance ; later , aware of the risks , Eskom imposed them without notice .
Fortunately for South Africans , the economic slump has trimmed demand ( and a huge , rushed building programme boosted supply ) , but it will be 2013 before order is properly restored .
Britain is running short of power too — so quickly that some economists claim , only just tongue - in - cheek , that the economic slowdown is useful .
“ A recession is the best demand - reduction policy ever invented , ” says Dieter Helm , an energy economist at Oxford University .
Many power stations are due to close over the coming decade ( see chart 1 ) , and supplies are getting tight .
The government reckons that , of a total of around 75 GW in generating capacity , 20GW will disappear by 2015 .
The private sector is less optimistic .
EDF ( a state - owned French firm that wants to build nuclear plants in Britain ) puts the size of the hole at 32GW , and E.ON , a German competitor , reckons it will be 26GW .
One survey of experts before the recession ( conducted by Mitsui - Babcock , another power - station builder ) found that three - quarters expected blackouts by the time of the London Olympics in 2012 .
When the BBC did a similar poll in 2008 , the downturn had pushed the date back to 2015 .
“ There 's a risk of blackouts somewhere between 2013 and 2016 , depending on how fast the economy recovers , ” says Mr Helm .
“ It may not happen , ” says an engineer , “ but we 'd be lucky ” .
Indeed , Britain 's energy grids are already showing signs of stress .
A cold snap in the winter of 2005 - 06 led to a spike in demand for natural gas , which is used both as a heating fuel and to generate electricity .
Prices shot up but , despite several pipelines linking Britain to Europe , no extra gas was forthcoming from the continent .
Big factories were instructed to stop work , and National Grid , the firm that runs the electricity network , came close to cutting supplies to homes as well .
Last year two power stations — one nuclear , one coal - fired — failed within minutes of each other , causing blackouts across the country .
Officially , this was a one - off stroke of bad luck , but privately some think that a system with more spare capacity could have kept the lights on .
Less obvious but just as worrying , says John Constable of the Renewable Energy Foundation , a think - tank , is that electricity prices are becoming more unstable .
“ Volatility is a sign of a system under stress , ” he notes .
Acid rain and old age explain the shortage of capacity .
Britain 's coal and nuclear plants together account for just under 45 % of all power generation ( see chart 2 ) .
But most of the nuclear plants , and around half of the coal plants , are due to close in the near future .
The nuclear stations are simply too ancient to carry on : most are over a quarter of a century old .
Around half have already shut down and are being decommissioned .
Those that remain are increasingly doddery .
British Energy , which runs most of the remaining reactors , had to shut two of its eight power stations last year after engineers discovered cracks in components .
By 2023 only one nuclear plant will be left , a modern reactor at Sizewell in Suffolk .
Some of the power plants may be patched up a bit and granted life extensions ( one on Anglesey was recently given a nine - month reprieve ) , but not for long .
New nuclear plants are on the way , but there are worries about how much they cost and how uncertain returns on them are for investors .
Even the most optimistic atom - splitters think that 2017 is the earliest date by which the first one can be built .
They will come too late to help with the supply crunch .
Pollution controls will doom the coal - fired power plants .
New European Union rules in the Large Combustion Plant Directive impose tough limits on emissions of nasty oxides of sulphur and nitrogen , which cause acid rain , as well as of carcinogenic particulates .
To stay within those limits , coal - power stations will have to fit expensive scrubbing equipment .
Because the facilities are comparatively old , many owners will not bother .
Unscrubbed stations are allowed to operate for only a limited number of hours , and must close in any case by 2015 .
Those hours are being used up faster than expected , as recent high oil prices dragged up gas prices , making coal more attractive as a fuel .
Going for broke
In theory Britain 's liberalised energy market ( which leaves private firms to make big investment decisions , with the occasional nudge from an independent regulator ) , should bring investors flocking to a once - in - a - decade opportunity to rebuild huge chunks of a developed nation 's electricity system .
But there are concerns beyond simple economics , chief among them global warming and politics .
Britain has committed itself to meeting punishing climate - change targets .
Its carbon emissions in 2020 must be 34 % lower than their level in 1990 , and that is only a stepping stone en route to an eventual cut of 80 % by 2050 .
These targets would seem to rule out rebuilding coal - fired power stations , because coal is the most planet - warming of the fossil fuels .

Safely out of anyone 's backyard
Instead , ministers want to see a big expansion in the amount of energy Britain gets from the waves , the sun and the wind — especially offshore wind .
They are hoping to see 33GW - worth of maritime windmills ( somewhere around 5,000 turbines in all ) built over the next 11 years .
That is quite an ambition , and many doubt whether it can be realised .
Britain 's entire offshore capacity in 2008 was only 0.6GW , although admittedly this was the biggest in the world .
History is not reassuring : a combination of nimbyism and poorly - designed state subsidies means that Britain 's previous , less - ambitious renewable targets have all been missed .
Even if the windmills are built , they will not in themselves plug the generation gap because they do not generate power on a calm day .
National Grid reckons that compensating for that uncertainty of supply will require a huge amount of over - engineering .
25 GW of wind power , it reckons , would be worth only around 5GW of fossil - fired generation .
Since coal is too dirty , nuclear plants are too slow to build and renewables are of only limited use , investors are turning towards more gas plants , encouraged by rollercoaster power prices that make planning long - term and expensive projects difficult .
Gas plants are cheap to build ( though expensive to run ) , so they seem ideal for a market with a murky future , like Britain's .
The first sizeable new power station in Britain for half a decade — built in 2008 at Langage , near Plymouth , by Centrica , a big energy firm — is gas - fired , and there are plenty of others on the drawing board .
The Department of Energy and Climate Change reckons that three - quarters of the fossil - fired power stations already planned are to run on gas .
The trouble is that Britain already gets 46 % of its electricity from gas ; over half of its houses use it for heating and cooking .
That is a legacy of Britain 's North Sea wealth , which for three decades provided all the energy the country could possibly consume .
But the golden goose is showing its age : North Sea production peaked in 1999 and has since been falling faster than all but the gloomiest foresaw ( see chart 3 ) .
That leads to worries about security of supply .
“ The best way to have a secure energy system is to have lots of different fuels , ” says Mr Constable .
“ It 's hard to see how a system that 's two - thirds gas - fired fits that definition . ”
In a gas - dominated system , power providers would be unable to hedge easily against changes in the gas price , which tends to shadow the notoriously volatile oil price .
Firms can simply pass on price increases to their customers , but voters are unlikely to appreciate unpredictably gyrating bills .
That nice Mr Putin
Other worries are political .
Britain currently imports around a quarter of its natural gas , much of it from Norway ; by 2015 , according to one estimate from Centrica , that could rise to three - quarters .
It is an open question how well Britain 's laissez - faire approach will cope with the distinctly illiberal world of cross - border energy politics , but early signs are not encouraging .
The reason that so little gas flowed through the pipelines connecting Britain with mainland Europe during the cold snap in 2005 , when prices quadrupled overnight , is that continental firms prefer long - term contracts that make it difficult to shunt gas around quickly .
Other sources are becoming available , particularly liquefied gas shipped from the Middle East , but the worldwide market is — for now at least — immature and thinly traded , and Britain 's storage capacity is limited .
The more gas plants Britain builds , the likelier it becomes that , like much of the rest of Europe , it will be reliant on Russia for a lot of its gas , either directly or indirectly through agreements with continental energy firms .
That is a worry : under Vladimir Putin Russia has proved itself an unreliable supplier , cutting gas to countries such as Ukraine and Belarus that have incurred the ire of the Kremlin .
All this leaves Britain in a hole .
The lights are dimming , but green targets are an argument against new coal plants , security - of - supply concerns make gas dicey , lack of time rules out nuclear , and worries about practicality dog renewables .
The situation is so bad that many former fans are openly questioning Britain 's hands - off approach to energy , which it has spent the past decade trying to export , particularly to Europe .
Lord Browne , a well - regarded former boss of BP who now heads the Royal Academy of Engineering , wants to see state - owned banks forced to invest in renewables and has spoken warmly of the dirigiste policies of Tony Benn , the hard - left minister who ran Britain 's energy department in the 1970s .
Malcolm Wicks , who has twice been energy minister , warned Gordon Brown on August 5th that the reliance on “ companies , competition and liberalisation ” should be reassessed , and counselled state intervention to boost nuclear power .
It is unlikely that Britain 's energy situation will ever be as dire as South Africa's , but that this should even need saying shows how disastrous things are .
Something has to give , and it will probably be environmental targets .
The government can simply ignore the European pollution rules and its own climate - change targets and keep coal plants open .
“ A decision between building a new coal plant and letting the lights go out — that 's a no- brainer , ” admits one official .
But the risk that Britain will simply run out of juice is real .
Even if it does n't , the liberal energy model for which it has proselytised long and hard is misfiring , and is in urgent need of a tune - up .

Snehal Shingavi looks at the political calculations behind the Pakistani military 's massive assault on the Taliban in Waziristan province .
UNDER GROWING pressure from the U.S. , the Pakistani Army launched a major incursion into Waziristan October 17 with air strikes and the entry of 30,000 soldiers into the region in the hopes of mounting a final offensive against the Pakistani Taliban ( Tehrik - e - Taliban , or TeT ) .
The army 's targets also include Hakimullah Mehsud , the brother of Beitullah Mehsud , the former leader of the Pakistani Taliban who was killed by U.S. drones last August .
Until recently , the Pakistani establishment had taken some comfort in the thought that Hakimullah had been killed a few weeks ago .
This would n't be the first nor the most serious mistake Pakistani intelligence has made .
The military offensive was precipitated by recent attacks by the Pakistani Taliban on military headquarters and police stations in major cities , including Peshawar , Lahore and Islamabad .
More than 175 people were killed in attacks by the Taliban and other Islamist outfits during the past two weeks .
The Pakistani military and police were highly embarrassed by the attacks .
Debates have emerged inside Pakistan about whether or not the state is actually capable of , or even interested in , curbing the threat of terrorism .
Few of the voices are from progressive quarters .
Pakistan 's military is carrying out an assault against Taliban fighters in the country 's northwest ( Al - Jazeera English )
The debate inside the Pakistani military about whether or not to launch the offensive in Waziristan has been ongoing for quite some time .
Waziristan is home to the Mehsud tribe , a group of Pashtun warriors from which the TeT draws many of its recruits and most of its leadership .
Aside from being the headquarters of the TeT , Waziristan is also believed to be the place where the leadership of al - Qaeda is holed up , along with Qari Hussain , believed to be the mastermind behind the series of suicide bombing operations inside Pakistan .
While some have argued that Pakistan 's military offensive was made necessary by these attacks , the reasons for the move are more complex .
Pakistani military chiefs and politicians have already thoroughly debated whether or not to launch an all - out invasion of Waziristan , and the outcome of past incursions into the region have been negative .
Thus , the military 's strategy in its previous interventions in Waziristan has been to negotiate settlements and ceasefires .
The Pakistan military 's preference to negotiate with the Taliban rather than crush them in part reflects an unwillingness to part with what has been a strategic asset -- past support for the Taliban has given Pakistani military and intelligence services a sphere of influence in Afghanistan .
But the reluctance to conduct an all - out war on the Taliban also highlights the fact that the military has no strategy to win the ground war .
As winter approaches in the mountainous border region of Pakistan and Afghanistan , it 's unlikely that the Pakistani military will win a confrontation with the Mehsud 's TeT .
There are too many places for TeT fighters to hide -- and too many TeT supporters in Waziristan -- for a clear military victory for government troops .
Thus , the Pakistani military is unlikely to repeat the bloody success it achieved in the province of Swat , where just a few months ago government forces handily routed the TeT .
They could do so because the population was fairly evenly divided between allies and enemies of the Pakistani Taliban .
This allowed the Pakistani military to draw on local support for its operations .
In Waziristan , however , the population has a longstanding tradition of resisting direct rule and interference from the Pakistani state .
Fiercely independent , the people of Waziristan are likely to put up major resistance to the military incursion .
And the indiscriminate fire of American drones and Pakistani jets has only enflamed passions .
MOREOVER , THE Pakistani establishment has been for a long time caught between two opposite camps .
On the one hand , large sections of the civilian bureaucracy have wanted a more aggressive posture against the Pakistani Taliban , not the least because they know that American aid is contingent on delivering results .
President Asif Ali Zardari , widower of the assassinated political leader Benazir Bhutto , also has a personal stake in the fight .
Beitullah Mehsud claimed credit for organizing Bhutto's assassination .
But the Pakistani civilian bureaucracy has faced challenges from large parts of the military , which opposed any aggressive push against the Pakistani Taliban .
Growing numbers inside the Pakistani military elite suspect that the American war in Afghanistan will not end well for the U.S.
And as the current Afghanistan election scandal shows , Afghan President Hamid Karzai has been unable to deliver a state capable of replacing the Taliban .
As a result , the pragmatists inside the military and the intelligence are banking on their erstwhile allies , the Afghan Taliban , to come out on top .
The schism between these two wings of the Pakistani ruling class has become deeper in the past several weeks with the debate over whether to accept U.S. aid under the proposed Kerry - Lugar legislation ( recently renamed the " Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan " bill ) .
The military perceives Kerry - Lugar as a U.S. effort to force Pakistan to give up control over its decision - making to the Americans .
In this , they are not entirely wrong .
Language in the bill demands that the Pakistani government exercise " effective civilian control over the military " and commit itself to " ceasing support " for terrorist groups and " dismantling terrorist bases . "
The opposition party led by Nawaz Sharif , the Pakistani Muslim League ( Nawaz ) , has argued that such language , coupled with the enormous embassy that Washington has already begun constructing , basically amount to an attack on Pakistani sovereignty .
In fact , the Kerry - Lugar bill reserves its strongest language for the Pakistani military and the Inter - Services Intelligence , both of which have been accused of giving material support to the Islamists and waging a half - hearted campaign against them .
This is , after all , the reason that America is waging a war in " Af - Pak . "
There is a growing tendency in Washington to see Pakistan as the largest obstacle to what the Pentagon calls " full - spectrum dominance . "
Sharif 's party has also had little trouble circulating rumors that Kerry - Lugar is the product of the 152 - member Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans , which it sees as supporters of Pakistan 's main rival .
So deep was suspicion of the bill that the Pakistani ambassador was forced to obtain an extraordinary " joint explanatory statement " from Sen.
John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Rep. Howard Berman , and even ask Kerry and Gen. David Petraeus to fly to Pakistan and allay the fears of the opposition .
Still , the $ 7.5 billion package is proving too lucrative for the Pakistani establishment to brook disagreement for a government bankrupt and surviving on a massive $ 11.3 billion dollar loan from the International Monetary Fund .
Moreover , the passage of the U.S. bill is critical to convincing European and Arab donors to give more aid to Pakistan .
Indeed , Pakistan 's economic aspirations are driving the Pakistani elite 's optimism about the Waziristan offensive .
The Pakistanis hope to have things wrapped up in a nearly impossible two - month campaign .
These hopes are based on dangerously precarious calculations , however .
In the lead - up to the current assault on Waziristan , Pakistan played a card from its old deck , attempting to cozy up to certain militant groups in order to go after others .
As Syed Saleem Shahzad explained in Asia Times :
In preparation for the assault , the army made ceasefire deals with several influential Taliban warlords who run large networks against coalition troops in Afghanistan .
They include Mullah Nazir , the chief of the Taliban in Wana , South Waziristan , who operates the largest Taliban network in the Afghan province of Paktika .
Mullah Nazir is neutral in this Pakistani conflict and agreed to allow passage to the army to enter Mehsud territory .
In North Waziristan , two top Taliban commanders , Hafiz Gul Bahadur and Moulvi Sadiq Noor , also agreed to remain neutral .
They are members of the Shura of the Mujahideen and a main component of the Taliban 's insurgency in the Afghan province of Khost .
Yet the more the Pakistani elite sidle up to the Americans , the less likely these " neutral " Taliban groups are to believe that their interests will be preserved in remaining out of the fight .
Thus , Pakistani troops may find that they are the ones caught in a crossfire .
The current military campaign involves sending troops into the mountains that border Waziristan in advance of air strikes .
The aim is to force the fighters to retreat to the hills , where they will be ambushed .
The problem is that such a pincer action will invariably mean that hundreds of civilians will also be killed , since the hills are the only realistic escape route for them as well .
With the roads blocked and little infrastructure in place to absorb the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have already fled their homes , those unable to flee will face the same fate as the Islamists .
People who have already fled to Dera Ismail Khan found that there were no camps , no food and no aid -- and this having already learned that their homes were being flattened by air strikes .
At the same time , even if the army is able to rout the TeT and al - Qaeda in South Waziristan , it still has to find a way to integrate Waziristan into the national government .
Long underdeveloped , Waziristan has been all but abandoned by the central government , leaving the locals little choice but to rely on the TeT for some kind of legal apparatus .
The vacuum created by the ouster of the TeT will take decades to replace .
Moreover , the general strategy of collective punishment and decades of neglect will undoubtedly transform much of the local population into hardened rebels .
THE U.S. bears responsibility for the suffering in Waziristan and other parts of Pakistan .
In an attempt to create a little more maneuverability for itself in Afghanistan , the U.S. government has literally put a down payment on permanent Pakistani instability .
Comparisons to expansion of the Vietnam War notwithstanding , the U.S. has forced the hand of the Pakistani military into a campaign that , only a few months ago , it confessed an inability to accomplish .
In fact , it has been a long - held piety in Pakistani military circles that offensives in the tribal region are more trouble than they 're worth .
Rush deliveries of American night - vision goggles are hardly likely to make up the difference .
The other problem is that the Pakistani offensive in Waziristan is more likely to galvanize support for the Islamists in Pakistan than it is to help weaken the Taliban in Afghanistan .
For one thing , there have been deep divisions between the TeT and the Afghan Taliban , and the military offensive in Waziristan is designed in part to go after the threat to the Pakistani state rather than supply networks to the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Secondly , there is a real concern that Pakistani madrassas are sending fighters from the seminaries into the region to support the Taliban .
The Pakistani police conducted raids on several madrassas over the past weekend in order to cut the growing connections between the TeT and radical Punjabi groups .
Moreover , the TeT already has cells in some of Pakistan 's major cities , as the spectacular recent attacks demonstrated .
And it 's likely that most of the TeT membership that was holed up in Waziristan has already fled , either toward Afghanistan or into the cities .
So even as the Pakistani military announces success in Waziristan , the TeT will continue to wreak havoc in other ways .
There are even reports that that the TeT is joining forces with two other Islamist outfits , Lashkar - e - Taiba and Jaish - e - Muhammad , the former of which was implicated in the November 26 attack on Mumbai .
To make things even more daunting , Waziristan is in some of the most treacherous terrain in Pakistan .
There 's a high probability that the fighting could drag on for quite some time .
And the longer the battles continue , the less likely the fragile truces with the warlords will remain intact .
The Pakistani military has never been able to defeat the militants in this region .
And if the operation can't be completed within a few weeks , snowfall may cover the TeT 's retreat and limit the army 's movements .
Furthermore , since Waziristan is underdeveloped , military convoys carrying troops and supplies are easy targets for ambushes on the area 's few roads .
The Pakistani military has already pulled resources away from Swat , where it is rumored that the TeT have already regrouped .
DETAILS ABOUT the actual operations are fairly hard to come by , with contradictory reports coming from both the military and the Islamists .
Pakistani authorities have restricted journalists from traveling into the region , and as a result , most of the reports appearing on television and in print parrot the military 's version of the events .
The consequence has been quick popular support for the offensive .
The problem is that if the military 's optimism turns out to be fanciful , that support is capable of turning against Zardari's Pakistan People Party , too .
The military incursion is also likely to double the already large population of refugees from Waziristan .
Between 90,000 and 150,000 people have already fled the region , and some predict that the refugee population could swell by a quarter of a million .
Their plight has been made worse by the fact that the Pakistani military has closed most of the roads that lead out of Waziristan in an attempt to surround the Pakistani Taliban and al - Qaeda , forcing refugees to take longer , more dangerous routes .
It 's unlikely that these people will be grateful .
In fact , some members of the Pakistani establishment have gone so far as to say that the people of the Mehsud tribe have brought collective punishment on themselves because they refused to support the military offensive , and because they have refused to recruit and train their own local militias against the Islamists .
As Interior Minister Rehman Malik warned :
I want to give a message to the Taliban that what we did with you in Swat , we will do the same to you there [ Waziristan ] , too ... The enemy has started a guerrilla war .
These attacks are a moment of reflection for us -- but you will soon see these Taliban , these hired guns , fleeing .
The whole nation should be united against these handful of terrorists , and , God willing , we will defeat them .
Needless to say , the situation in Pakistan is quite unstable .
The more President Barack Obama draws Pakistan into his military plans for " Af - Pak , " the more likely he is to set off old grievances against the Pakistani state .
Zardari is widely believed to be corrupt , and it was only a year ago that the lawyers ' democracy movement brought the state to its knees .
And the economic crisis has hit Pakistan quite hard .
The Karachi Stock Exchange took a serious hit in recent days , and unemployment figures are going up .
As one Islamabad resident , Hasan Zaman , told the BBC : " The popular opinion is that we are being sold to America piece by piece .
Our national integrity is at risk .
I am scared of the fact that I might see the end of Pakistan in my lifetime . "
There are big debates inside of the Pakistani establishment that are finding expression in popular consciousness .
If the operation in Waziristan goes badly or sets off more terror attacks in the rest of the country -- both of which are likely -- there will be massive discontent inside of Pakistan .
And then Pakistan will become a much larger problem for the American empire .
As of 10 minutes ago , Larry Kudlow would like you to believe that Q2 earnings are so much better than Q1 .
That is a flat out lie .
The chart below , straight out of Bloomberg which we demand all readers with a BBERG terminal replicate using SPX Index EA < go > , demonstrates that Q2 earnings are now in fact worse than Q1 .
While in Q1 the YoY EPS drop was - 31.49 % , as of right now the drop is - 32.41 % .
And the drop in revenues is much worse .
Larry Kudlow , please put this chart up on your show and advise people you are misrepresenting the truth .
And while Earnings are bad , here is the revenue comparison : the quarterly drop is in fact accelerating !
And here is the projected earnings growth rate over the next two quarters , needed to justify the rosy perspective on the economy : the bottom line : over 110 % in projected EPS growth in 6 months .
A jobless , revenueless doubling in earnings !
And this is what Larry Kudlow , Wall Street and Corporate America would like you to believe is achievable in order to justify an S&P at 1,000 and billions in Wall Street bonus payments .
The Kool Aid is served in the ranch toward the back .
Eliminating defensive medicine could save upwards of $ 200 billion in health - care costs annually , according to estimates by the American Medical Association and others .
The cure is a reliable medical malpractice system that patients , doctors and the general public can trust .
But this is the one reform Washington will not seriously consider .
That 's because the trial lawyers , among the largest contributors to the Democratic Party , thrive on the unreliable justice system we have now ....
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Patrick Swayze , whose good looks and sympathetic performances in films such as " Dirty Dancing " and " Ghost " made him a romantic idol to millions , died Monday .
He was 57 .
Patrick Swayze 's doctor said in March 2008 that Swayze was suffering from pancreatic cancer .
Swayze died of pancreatic cancer , his publicist , Annett Wolf , told CNN .
Swayze 's doctor , Dr. George Fisher , revealed in early March 2008 that Swayze was suffering from the disease .
" Patrick Swayze passed away peacefully today with family at his side after facing the challenges of his illness for the last 20 months , " Wolf said in a statement Monday .
Most recently , Swayze starred in A&E Network 's " The Beast , " which debuted in January .
He agreed to take the starring role of an undercover FBI agent before his diagnosis .
The network agreed to shoot an entire season of the show after Swayze responded well to his cancer treatment .

In an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters in January , Swayze said his work on that show was exhausting , requiring 12 - hour workdays in Chicago , Illinois , doing his own stunts .
But he said the show 's character " just felt right for my soul . "

" If I leave this Earth , I want to leave this Earth just knowing I 've tried to give something back and tried to do something worthwhile with myself , " Swayze told Walters , when asked why he decided to do the show .
" And that keeps me going , that gets me up in the morning .
My work ... is my legacy . "
" The Beast " was canceled in June because of Swayze 's illness , after doctors told him the cancer had spread to his liver .
" We are saddened by the loss of one of our generation 's greatest talents and a member of the A&E family , " a statement from the network said .
" Patrick 's work on ' The Beast ' was an inspiration to us all .
He will be greatly missed and our thoughts are with his wife , Lisa , and his entire family during this difficult time . "
Swayze was mostly known for a handful of supporting roles when he broke through with his performance as dance instructor Johnny Castle in 1987 's " Dirty Dancing . "
Co-star Jennifer Grey , who played his young lover , Baby Houseman , in the film , described Swayze as " gorgeous and strong . "

" Patrick was a rare and beautiful combination of raw masculinity and amazing grace .
...
He was a real cowboy with a tender heart .
He was fearless and insisted on always doing his own stunts , so it was not surprising to me that the war he waged on his cancer was so courageous and dignified , " Grey said in a statement Monday .
" When I think of him , I think of being in his arms when we were kids , dancing , practicing the lift in the freezing lake , having a blast doing this tiny little movie we thought no one would ever see .
My heart goes out to his wife and childhood sweetheart , Lisa Niemi , to his mom , Patsy , and to the rest of their family . "
Three years after " Dirty Dancing , " he became an even bigger star with " Ghost , " in which he played an investment banker who dies and learns to tap into his unspoken feelings for his partner ( Demi Moore ) .
The film won Whoopi Goldberg an Oscar and helped make him People magazine 's " Sexiest Man Alive " in 1991 .
" Patrick was a really good man , a funny man and one to whom I owe much that I can't ever repay , " Goldberg said in a statement .
" I believe in ' Ghost 's ' message , so he 'll always be near . "

Swayze told Entertainment Weekly in 1990 that " the movies that have had the most powerful effects on my life have been about romantic characters . "
He expanded on the effort he put into love scenes for People in 1991 .
" It 's possibly the scariest thing I do , " he said , " doing something so personal and giving people out there the opportunity to see if you 're a good kisser or not . "
Patrick Wayne Swayze was born on August 18 , 1952 , in Houston , Texas .
His father was an engineering draftsman ; his mother was a ballet dancer and later the director of the Houston Ballet Dance Company .
She led her son into the dancing world , which was n't always easy for a Texas male .
Indeed , the young Swayze played football , practiced martial arts and was an accomplished diver and track star while growing up , though he was good enough at dance to earn a college scholarship .
After an early professional job playing Prince Charming in an early ' 70s version of " Disney on Ice , " Swayze returned to Houston , where he met Lisa Niemi , a student of his mother's .
The two were married in 1975 and moved to New York to pursue their careers .
See timeline of Swayze 's life »
Swayze seemed set on a dance career :
He studied with the prestigious Joffrey Ballet and joined another company , the Eliot Feld Ballet Company .
But surgery for an old football injury ended his ballet career and he turned to acting , nabbing the lead role of Danny Zuko in the long - running Broadway production of " Grease " in 1978 , around the time the movie starring John Travolta was hitting theaters .
" Grease " earned him some Hollywood attention , and he and Niemi moved West .
After a couple of bit parts , including one in a 1981 episode of " M * A * S*H , " Swayze picked up the role of Darrel Curtis in Francis Ford Coppola 's 1983 film of " The Outsiders , " which also included future stars Matt Dillon , Rob Lowe , Ralph Macchio , Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise .
Swayze was also one of the leads in 1984's " Red Dawn , " about teenagers defending their town from a Soviet attack on America .
" Not only did we lose a fine actor today , I lost my older ' Outsiders ' brother , " said actor C. Thomas Howell , who also starred with Swayze in " Red Dawn " and " Grandview , U.S.A . "
But it was with " Dirty Dancing " that Swayze hit it big .
The film about a girl 's coming of age at a Catskills resort in the early ' 60s was intended for a limited release but became one of the decade 's biggest sleeper hits and made Swayze and Grey household names .
The film gave birth to a catchphrase -- " Nobody puts Baby in a corner , " spoken by Swayze 's character to Grey 's domineering father ( Jerry Orbach ) -- and eventually led to a follow - up , 2004 's " Dirty Dancing : Havana Nights . "
Swayze even sang a Top 10 hit , " She 's Like the Wind , " on the film 's soundtrack .
Swayze , known as a down - to - earth , nice - guy actor , was determined not to follow a predictable career path .
He followed " Dirty Dancing " with " Road House " ( 1989 ) in which he played a manager at a rough - and - tumble bar ( the film was particularly popular on late - night cable ) .
He succeeded " Ghost " with " Point Break " ( 1991 ) , about a group of thieves ; " City of Joy " ( 1992 ) , in which he played a doctor in a poverty - stricken Indian village ; and " To Wong Foo , Thanks for Everything , Julie Newmar " ( 1995 ) , in which he starred as a drag queen .
' ' I do n't want to be Mr. Romantic Leading Man .
I do n't want to be the Dance Dude .
I do n't want to be the Action Guy .
If I had to do any one of those all my life , it 'd drive me crazy , '' he told Entertainment Weekly in the 1990 interview .
Swayze 's career diminished in the late '90s .
He broke both legs in 1997 while making a film , " Letters From a Killer , " and went into rehab to overcome an admitted drinking problem .
In 2000 , he was flying in his own twin - engine plane when the plane depressurized ; Swayze landed in a housing development in Arizona .
Though some witnesses say he appeared intoxicated , he was later revealed to have been suffering from hypoxia , related to the depressurization and his three - pack - a - day cigarette habit .
Swayze re-established his knack for picking sleepers with " Donnie Darko " ( 2001 ) , the dark film about a troubled student that became a sensation on video .
Swayze played a creepy motivational speaker and won raves for his performance .
Swayze 's more recent films included a TV version of " King Solomon 's Mines " and 2007's " Christmas in Wonderland . "
Though he still had the power to make women 's hearts flutter -- 22 - year - old Scarlett Johansson , upon receiving Harvard 's Hasty Pudding Award in February 2007 , said her dream date was " probably Patrick Swayze , my dream come true " --
Swayze was n't too impressed with himself .
" Good - looking people turn me off , " he once said .
" Myself included . "
Swayze is survived by his wife , Lisa , of over 30 years and his mother , Patsy .

The Russia of Nicholas II on the eve of World War I was a land of striking ethnic diversity .
Comprising all of the republics of what later was to become the Soviet Union , as well as present - day Finland and much of Poland , Russia was home to more than 150 million people — of which only about half were ethnic Russians .
In his travels throughout the empire , Prokudin - Gorskii captured this diversity .
His color photographs of peasants from rural Russia , the nomadic peoples of Central Asia , and the mountain peoples of the Caucasus predate the forced Russification and the rapid modernization of the Soviet period and document traditional costumes and ways of life .
Netflix yesterday passed out a $ 1 million check to the stats geeks of " BellKor 's Pragmatic Chaos , " the team which won the Netflix Prize by improving on the company 's algorithms for picking the movies that Netflix subscribers might like to watch next .
Chief Product Officer Neil
Hunt then announced a sequel , the Netflix Prize 2 , but one law professor is already calling the new contest a " multi-million dollar privacy blunder . "
The Netflix data set released for use with the first prize was supposedly " anonymized , " but security researchers found a way to link the anonymous movie recommendations with data from other sites in order to identify individual Netflix users .
If your information appeared in the first data set , someone knowing a bit about your movie preferences could figure out the complete set of movies that you rated on Netflix — an information leak that would certainly not please all users .
For the Netflix Prize 2 , the company is releasing even more information , despite the security weaknesses of the first data set .
Gender , ZIP Codes , ages , genre ratings , and more will be released in a data set with more than 100 million entries .
That has law professor Paul Ohm seeing a bright Netflix red .
Ohm has worried for years about privacy breaches , and his newest paper argues that " anonymizing " data does n't actually keep data anonymous .
Given the tremendous advances in " reidentification " technology over the last few years ,
Ohm argues that the release of so much new data should actually constitute a " privacy breach . "
" Researchers have known for more than a decade that gender plus ZIP code plus birthdate uniquely identifies a significant percentage of Americans , " he wrote in a blog entry .
" True , Netflix plans to release age not birthdate , but simple arithmetic shows that for many people in the country , gender plus ZIP code plus age will narrow their private movie preferences down to at most a few hundred people .
Netflix needs to understand the concept of ' information entropy ' : even if it is not revealing information tied to a single person , it is revealing information tied to so few that we should consider this a privacy breach . "
Because Netflix already knows about the privacy implications of its data releases , it can't simply claim ignorance , and in Ohm 's view the company might well be liable for damages .
" The Video Privacy Protection Act ( VPPA ) , 18 USC 2710 prohibits a ' video tape service provider ' ( a broadly defined term ) from revealing ' personally identifiable information ' about its customers .
Aggrieved customers can sue providers under the VPPA and courts can order ' not less than $ 2,500 ' in damages for each violation .
If somebody brings a class action lawsuit under this statute , Netflix might face millions of dollars in damages . "
Netflix claims , " As with the first Netflix Prize , all data provided is anonymous and cannot be associated with a specific Netflix member . "
It 's an odd thing to say , as the first data set was already de-anonymized , but the company is going ahead with it .
This time , the " Netflix Prize 2 focuses on the much harder problem of predicting movie enjoyment by members who do n't rate movies often , or at all , by taking advantage of demographic and behavioral data carrying implicit signals about the individuals ' taste profiles . "
Rather than wait for years before awarding a prize this time around , Netflix has decided to give $ 500,000 to the team in front after six months , and another $ 500,000 to whichever team is in the lead after a year and a half .

BMW Sauber is making a fresh push to get the approval it needs to become the 14th team in Formula 1 next year - despite rival Williams blocking plans to allow the grid to expand .
The Hinwil - based team , which will have new owners next year following the withdrawal of BMW from F1 , does not yet have a guaranteed slot for 2010 .
Its hopes of remaining in F1 rest on either one of the new teams failing to make the grade or on the unanimous approval of other outfits to expand the field to 28 cars .
The latter scenario appeared to have been ruled out at the Japanese Grand Prix when Frank Williams made it clear he would not support any move to allow an extra team in F1 .
Despite that blow , BMW motorsport director Mario Theissen revealed in Brazil that negotiations are still ongoing with the FIA and Formula One Management about finding a deal - and he is hopeful Williams ' position can be turned around .
" We are in discussions now - we means the future owner , plus Peter Sauber is involved , with the FIA and FOM in order to get a place on the grid , " said Theissen at Interlagos .
" That is all I can say at the moment .
" Currently we are talking about the 14th position ... and the regulations say it needs unanimous support . "
When asked by AUTOSPORT if he believes the team could convince Williams to stop its veto on the plans , Theissen said : " Let 's say , I would not understand if Frank really keeps his position as the only opponent .
" F1 needs to get back to proper business and every team sometimes needs support from the other teams , and it will be the other way around as well . "
Although there is no firm deadline for BMW Sauber to resolve the issues relating to the extra grid slot , Theissen confessed that the situation was making planning for the future hard .
" There is no strict deadline but apparently it makes life difficult not to have the grid position because the team has to talk to drivers , to sponsors , and without a grid position you cannot really do a deal , " he said .
" We expect to be on the grid one way or the other .
Plan A would be as a 13th team and Plan B as a 14th team . "
To the outside world , and to many people in Iran , the post-election demonstrations and ensuing violence have damaged the legitimacy of the ruling regime in Tehran , both domestically and externally .
In fact , judging by the number of demonstrations planned to be held against him in New York , the Iranian President stands to receive the most unfriendly welcome he has ever received abroad .
But Mahmoud Ahmadinejad does n't see it that way .
As far as Ahmadinejad and his supporters are concerned , on Sept. 23 he will be addressing the United Nations General Assembly as the President of a Super Power .
Such thinking was reflected by Mojtaba Hashemi Samare , Ahmadinejad 's right - hand man and most senior advisor , who compared Iran 's latest proposal to the U.S to Obama 's proposal for a new arms reduction treaty .
The current Iranian administration truly and honestly sees itself as a power that can address and challenge global issues with the world 's one remaining super power .
Some people may dismiss such thinking .
Others may compare it to delusions of grandeur by an administration presiding over a country facing one of its worst crises in the last three decades .
However , if we look back at Ahmadinejad 's life , especially during his childhood and early twenties , we can see why he does not see things this way .
Persistence is one of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's strongest attributes .
He has always seen himself as a person who can push the boundaries of reality to achieve what he wants .
This has been shown on a number of occasions .
A famous example took place 30 years ago , prior to the takeover of the U.S embassy in Tehran , where Ahmadinejad was one of the planners .
Although he was anti-American , Ahmadinejad 's hatred for the Soviets was even more intense .
He saw the communist ideology as heretical and the Soviets as a colonizing power which stood against the Islamic world .
Relations between Ahmadinejad and his colleagues soon deteriorated , as the young and zealous Ahmadinejad pushed his colleagues to take over the Soviet Embassy as well .
In fact , he wanted the takeover at both embassies to be simultaneous .
His colleagues refused profusely .
They thought that unlike the U.S , the Soviets shared a border with Iran .
This would make it much easier for them to exact a military revenge .
Moscow , already at war in neighboring Afghanistan , was n't afraid to flex its regional muscle .
But Ahmadinejad would not have any of it .
He saw Iran as a super power in its own right .
His thinking was that the Soviets would not dare attack Iran , and if they did , his country would be able to take on the aggressors .
Despite repeated opposition , the persistent Ahmadinejad would not give up his protests , even after he had lost the argument .
This is why he did not take part in the takeover of the U.S embassy .
His refusal was his method of protestation against those who did not back his idea of invading the Soviet embassy .
In terms of his outlook , Ahmadinejad has not changed over the last 30 years .
He still stubbornly believes in revolutionary Iran as a super power , and as a force to stand up against the U.S. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei - a staunch supporter of Ahmadinejad in both 2005 and 2009 - shares the President 's world vision .
And Khamenei has more reason to back Ahmadinejad this year than ever before .
With trouble brewing at home , the Supreme Leader feels vulnerable .
Throughout the years , Khamenei has believed that offense is the best defense .
His protégé Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is carrying out his own thinking through his verbal attacks against the Holocaust .
Meanwhile , his subordinates at the Revolutionary Guard provide support to groups such as Hezbollah , Hamas and according to a recent report , the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Not since the Iran - Iraq
War has there been a time when the Iranian government has had to so defend itself internally .
Khamenei's hope is that by having a president who acts and believes that Iran is a super power , Barack Obama may back off .
Ahmadinejad 's words at the United Nations this week should therefore not be dismissed too quickly .
They are a valuable reflection into the thinking of a regime that could soon become a nuclear power .
On the contrary , President Ahmadinejad 's words should serve as a blueprint for how a nuclear Iran might behave .
GAZA ( Reuters ) - Palestinian Islamists who run the Gaza Strip find themselves in the odd position these days of bailing out speculators who went from boom to bust when Israeli warplanes blew up their smuggling tunnels into Egypt .

Profits from hundreds of tunnels burrowed into the neighbor state to get around an Israeli embargo skyrocketed after the Islamist Hamas movement seized control of Gaza from Western - backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007 .
Israel tightened its blockade sharply , fearing Hamas would import arms , and profits from the smuggling operation multiplied even faster , fuelling a hot market in tunnel shares .
But when Israel launched a major offensive in late December to stop Hamas forces firing rockets at its southern towns , the tunnel network was designated a prime target and fortunes were lost , some real , some on paper .
Now , Hamas is trying to deflect criticism of its handling of the millions of dollars Palestinians sank into the business that literally collapsed under their feet .
Economy Minister Zeyad al - Zaza estimates some $ 60 million was lost by thousands among Gaza ’s 1.5 million population , from housewives to wealthy merchants , who plowed cash through middlemen into expanding the tunnel network .
Two key middlemen are among several people arrested over the losses , Zaza added .
He said $ 10 million recovered had gone back to investors who lost , rescuing 16.5 percent of their capital .
“ We are close to returning another $ 20 million , which will be handed over to the government .
Hopefully the people will be receiving another payment , ” Zaza said .
The pain , however , remains great for investors who say they made massive profits on their original investments , only to see those evaporate along with their capital when tunnels were destroyed in Israeli air raids .
One Gaza economist estimated paper fortunes worth between a quarter and half a billion dollars may have gone up in smoke , though accurate figures are hard to come by in an economy cut off from the world and dominated by clandestine dealings .
CAUTIONARY TALES
University teacher Jad Sabri recounted how he won -- and lost -- undreamt of sums in the tunnel trade after investing a substantial chunk of savings in early 2008 .
“ I put $ 60,000 into the tunnel business .
In a few months the man came to me with $ 500,000 saying that ’s what my money had become , ” Sabri told Reuters .
“ It was unbelievable . ”
“ I was so happy , I gave it back to him and asked him to invest it for me , hoping for bigger profits . ”
Unfortunately , Israel pounded the warren of tunnels under the sandy border between the town of Rafah and Egypt ’s Sinai peninsula in December and January , and its airforce continues to hit them every time a rocket from Gaza explodes in Israel .
The tunnels bring in everything from calves to sewing - machines and soap powder .
Israel says Hamas also imports arms , including missiles .
“ I lost it all , ” Sabri said of his investment .
“ They fooled us .
They knew that if they tell somebody your $ 10 has grown fivefold in two months they ’ll insist on putting more in . ”
Abu Ali , who trades in clothing in Gaza , said he lost about $ 200,000 but others lost even more : “ Some were greedy and others just could not help themselves , looking for an easy profit . ”
Gaza economist Omar Shaban estimated possible losses at $ 250 - $ 500 million .
“ It ’s a world of mystery , ” he said .
“ No one really knows the reality of this business .
Those who took people ’s money had no business background and their methods of investment were vague .
“ Hundreds of millions of dollars disappeared and that can only be a disaster in the general economic conditions in Gaza . ”
Economy minister Zaza , a member of the unrecognized Hamas government , rejected criticism of the Islamists ’ mismanagement , saying those who lost out had taken private initiatives to invest without due precautions .
Hamas itself is widely assumed to benefit from the tunnels , hundreds of which are still operating .
Aside from financial gains , Hamas benefits by the way the tunnels blunt the impact on Gaza ’s population of the Israeli blockade , which permits only the most essential goods to pass over authorized crossing points from Israel .
Health officials say more than 100 people have died digging and operating tunnels in the past year alone .
“ The tunnels harm our national interests and harm our economy , ” Zaza said .
“ But people have been forced to build them because of the blockade .
Once the blockade is lifted and crossings are reopened there will be no need for tunnels . ”
As for his fellow hunters in the Bloxwich Research and Metal Detecting Club , he said , “ I dread to think what they ’ll say when they hear about this . ”
He said that on the day of his discovery he reworked a mantra that he regularly used for good luck .
“ I have this phrase that I say sometimes  ‘ Spirits of yesterday , take me where the coins appear ’  but on that day I changed ‘ coins ’ to ‘ gold . ’
I do n’t know why I said it that day , but I think somebody was listening . ”
From the Birmingham museum , the Staffordshire treasure , much of it still encrusted with dirt , will go to the British Museum in London , where the artifacts will undergo months , possibly years , of study by archaeologists and historians .
A court ruling this week declared the finds to be treasure , meaning that they belong to the British crown , which is expected to offer them for sale .
The crown ’s practice , established in part by the many shipwrecks recovered off Britain ’s shores , is that a reward equal to the value of the items  likely to be set in a bidding war among British museums  will be divided between Mr. Herbert as the finder and the farmer who owns the field where the discovery was made .
His name and the location of the farm  beyond the fact that it is around Lichfield , north of Birmingham  have not been disclosed , to allow archaeologists to continue searching the area for more treasure .

The artifacts  like a hilt fitting , top , and a piece from a scabbard  are mostly items used in battle .

At the news conference , experts said that Mr. Herbert ’s initial discovery , which he reported to a Staffordshire County official responsible for archaeological discoveries , was followed by a dig that was strictly supervised by professional archaeologists .
They were assisted , the experts said , by a team from Britain ’s Home Office that normally works on crime scene forensics .
The experts said that a painstaking search of the area had turned up no trace of a grave , a building or anything else that suggested a careful plan to bury the objects for later recovery .
They said that information , and the fact that none of the discoveries appeared to be jewelry or other feminine items , added to the likelihood that the treasure was war bounty .
It may have been seized by one of the seventh - century Mercian kings  men like Penda , Wulfhere and Aethelred  who pursued an aggressive , plundering policy toward neighboring kingdoms .
ALBANY -- Lorna Patterson is willing to take on New York 's top health official for her right to be flu vaccine - free .
The registered nurse in Albany Medical Center 's emergency room is among a group of nurses who plan to file a lawsuit against state Health Commissioner Dr. Richard Daines to prevent the mandatory vaccination of New York 's health care workers with the H1N1 flu virus .
" It takes away our freedom of choice , " Patterson told reporters during a news conference Monday .
" Our health is being affected . "
The deadline for the state 's health care workers to receive the swine flu vaccination is at the end of next month , though some employers have moved that up to the end of this month .
The four nurses will file a lawsuit against the state this week to prevent the forced vaccination , said their attorney , Terence L. Kindlon .
" This is a significant civil rights issue , " Kindlon said .
" We think people are being forced to do something by the government . "
If Patterson and Kathryn Dupuis do not receive their shots within the next two weeks , they will likely lose their jobs in the emergency room at Albany Medical Center .
Patterson said the vaccination was rushed into production in a matter of months and that its effect has not yet been properly studied .

Patterson said the vaccination could be dangerous for people , including pregnant women , and that more time is needed to understand its effectiveness .
She said she is not willing to risk her health and does not think it is fair that she should lose her job .
Outside of New York City , 91,000 FluMist doses -- the inhalant form of the vaccine -- were delivered by the end of last week .
Health care workers are at the front of the line for those to receive the first round .
A similar suit filed last week in New York City names Commissioner Daines and Jeffrey Kraut , chairman of the state Hospital Planning and Review Council , and contends it is beyond the state 's authority to mandate getting the vaccines .
Kindlon said the New York Civil Liberties Union and other groups may file similar legal action in the coming weeks .
Daines has said that vulnerable people and those who have n't been immunized come to hospitals and that they need to be protected from the possibility that medical workers carry the virus .
The commissioner has said health workers in hospitals , clinics and other settings must be vaccinated by Nov. 30 or risk losing their jobs .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates it will have provided states with 186 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine by January .
New York officials expect the state to receive 6.7 million doses for upstate and 5 million doses for the city .
New York is the first state to mandate flu vaccinations for health care workers .
The nurses preparing to file the lawsuit have already collected more than 400 signatures of health care workers against the forced vaccinations and are helping plan at rally scheduled for this Wednesday at the Capitol .

" But whether the Constitution really be one thing , or another , this much is certain — that it has either authorized such a government as we have had , or has been powerless to prevent it .
In either case , it is unfit to exist . "
~ Lysander Spooner
Today , 17 September 2009 , is Constitution Day .
There will be paeans , abundant commentary and church - like observances of the glories of this document in making us the most blessed nation on planet earth .
This essay suggests a contrarian thesis .
The Constitution is an enabling document for big government .
Much like the Wizard of Oz , the man behind the curtain is a fraud .
In this case , for all the sanctimonious handwringing and the obsequious idolatry of the parchment , it sealed the fate of our liberties and freedoms and has operated for more than 200 years as a cover for massive expansion of the tools and infrastructure of statist expansion and oppression .
Among the many intellectual travels I have undertaken , this is one of the most heart - breaking I have ventured on .
I want to acknowledge the compass - bearers who sent me on this journey : Kenneth W. Royce ( aka Boston T. Party ) and his seminal book , The Hologram of Liberty and Kevin Gutzman ’s Politically Incorrect Guide to the Constitution .
For most of the political spectrum in America , the document represents their interpretation of how to make this mortal coil paradise .
Even in libertarian circles , it is taken as an article of faith the Constitution is a brilliant mechanism to enlarge liberty and keep government at bay .
That is a lie .
The document was drafted in the summer of 1787 behind closed doors in tremendous secrecy because if word leaked out of the actual contents and intent , the revolution that had just concluded would have been set ablaze again .
They were in a race against time and did everything in their power to ensure that the adoption took place as quickly as possible to avoid reflection and contemplation in the public square that would kill the proposal once the consequences of its agenda became apparent .
They were insisting that the states ratify first and then propose amendments later .
It was a political coup d’état .
It was nothing less than an oligarchical coup to ensure that the moneyed interests , banksters and aristocrats could cement their positions and mimic the United Kingdom from which they had been recently divorced .

The original charter of the drafters was to pen improvements to the existing Articles of Confederation .
Instead , they chose to hijack the process and create a document which enslaved the nation .
Federalist in the old parlance meant states rights and subsidiarity but the three authors of the fabled Federalist Papers supported everything but that .
Their intent and commitment was to create a National government with the ability to make war on its constituent parts if these states failed to submit themselves to the central government .
As Austrian economists have discovered , bigger is not necessarily better .
The brilliant and oft - dismissed Articles of Confederation ( AoC ) and Perpetual Union are a testament to voluntarism and cooperation through persuasion that the Constitution disposed of with its adoption .
Penned in 1776 and ratified in 1781 , the spirit and context of the Articles live on in the Swiss canton system and are everywhere evident in the marketplace where confederationist sentiments are practiced daily .
The confederation ’s design divines its mechanism from what an unfettered market does every day : voluntary cooperation , spontaneous information signals and the parts always being smarter than the sum A. confederation according to the Webster ’s 1828 dictionary is :
The act of confederating ; a league ; a compact for mutual support ; alliance ; particularly of princes , nations or states .
I would advise the readership to use the 1828 Webster ’s dictionary to accompany any primary source research you may undertake to understand American ( & British ) letters in the eighteenth century .
It is the source for the contemporary lexicon .
It is even available online now .
Here is a simple comparison of the two organizing documents :
`
Articles of Confederation
Constitution
Levying taxes
Congress could request states to pay taxes
Congress has right to levy taxes on individuals
Federal courts
No system of federal courts
Court system created to deal with issues between citizens , states
Regulation of trade
No provision to regulate interstate trade
Congress has right to regulate trade between states
Executive
No executive with power .
President of U.S. merely presided over Congress
Executive branch headed by President who chooses Cabinet and has checks on power of judiciary and legislature
Amending document
13/13 needed to amend Articles
2/3 of both houses of Congress plus 3/ 4 of state legislatures or national convention
Representation of states
Each state received 1 vote regardless of size
Upper house ( Senate ) with 2 votes ; lower house ( House of Representatives ) based on population
Raising an army
Congress could not draft troops , dependent on states to contribute forces
Congress can raise an army to deal with military situations
Interstate commerce
No control of trade between states
Interstate commerce controlled by Congress
Disputes between states
Complicated system of arbitration
Federal court system to handle disputes
Sovereignty
Sovereignty resides in states
Constitution the supreme law of the land
Passing laws
9/13 needed to approve legislation
50%+1 of both houses plus signature of President
Note that the precept of individual taxation was an end - run against state sovereignty from the very beginning .
If the Congress does not wish to violate state sovereignty , then they will simply prey on the individuals in the states .
It should be obvious that the AoC was not a recipe for government employees from top to bottom to use the office to enrich themselves so a scheme was afoot to precipitate and manufacture dissent over the present configuration of the central government apparatus which for all intents and purposes barely existed .
The AoC was intolerable to a narrow panoply of interests and the Federalist Papers appeared between October 1787 and August 1788 to plead the case for a newer form of " Republic " authored by three individuals : James Madison , John Jay , and Alexander Hamilton .
The British had sued for peace in 1783 and the AoC were still in effect until 1790 .
Time was ticking to erect the new government apparatus that would strengthen the central government to eventually mimic the very tyranny which caused British North America to put the English Crown in the hazard .
The Anti-Federalists rose up in response and provided what I consider one of the most splendid and eloquent defenses of small government penned in our history .

When the Constitutional Convention convened on 1787 , 55 delegates came but 14 later quit as the Convention eventually abused its mandate and scrapped the AoC instead of revising it .
The notes and proceedings of the cloistered meeting were to be secret as long as 53 years later when Madison ’s edited notes were published in 1840 .
The Anti-Federalist Brutus avers in Essay I in October 1787 :
" But what is meant is , that the legislature of the United States are vested with the great and uncontroulable powers , of laying and collecting taxes , duties , imposts , and excises ; of regulating trade , raising and supporting armies , organizing , arming , and disciplining the militia , instituting courts , and other general powers .
And are by this clause invested with the power of making all laws , proper and necessary , for carrying all these into execution ; and they may so exercise this power as entirely to annihilate all the state governments , and reduce this country to one single government .
And if they may do it , it is pretty certain they will ; for it will be found that the power retained by individual states , small as it is , will be a clog upon the wheels of the government of the United States ; the latter therefore will be naturally inclined to remove it out of the way .
Besides , it is a truth confirmed by the unerring experience of ages , that every man , and every body of men , invested with power , are ever disposed to increase it , and to acquire a superiority over every thing that stands in their way . "
The conflict was brewing between the Jeffersonians among the individualists and the Hamiltonian collectivists .
The rhetorical lines were drawn and the fate of the nation eventually slid into the camp of the Nationalists .
George Washington wrote to John Jay on 1 August 1786 :
" Many are of opinion that Congress have too frequently made use of the suppliant humble tone of requisition , in applications to the States , when they had a right to assume their imperial dignity and command obedience .
Be that as it may , requisitions are a perfect nihility , where thirteen sovereign , independent [ , ] disunited States are in the habit of discussing & refusing compliance with them at their option .
Requisitions are actually little better than a jest and a bye word through out the Land .
If you tell the Legislatures they have violated the treaty of peace and invaded the prerogatives of the confederacy they will laugh in your face .
What then is to be done ?
Things can not go on in the same train forever .
It is much to be feared , as you observe , that the better kind of people being disgusted with the circumstances will have their minds prepared for any revolution whatever .
We are apt to run from one extreme into another .
To anticipate & prevent disasterous contingencies would be the part of wisdom & patriotism . "

It appears even the much admired Washington was having none of the talk of independence and wanted a firm hand on the yoke of the states to make them obey their masters on high .
Washington ’s behavior in the Whiskey Rebellion cast away any doubts of the imperious behavior of the central government a mere four year after the adoption of the Constitution .
Patrick
Henry gave the firmest defense of the skeptical posture when he questioned the precarious position the Constitution put to the state ’s sovereignty on 5 June 1788 at the Virginia Ratifying Convention ( the savvy Founding Lawyers ensured that the process of ratification was sped along by bypassing the bicameral house requirements and simply asking the states to conduct ratifying conventions ) :
" How were the Congressional rights defined when the people of America united by a confederacy to defend their liberties and rights against the tyrannical attempts of Great - Britain ?
The States were not then contented with implied reservation .
No , Mr. Chairman .
It was expressly declared in our Confederation that every right was retained by the States respectively , which was not given up to the Government of the United States .
But there is no such thing here .
You therefore by a natural and unavoidable implication , give up your rights to the General Government .
Your own example furnishes an argument against it .
If you give up these powers , without a Bill of Rights , you will exhibit the most absurd thing to mankind that ever the world saw — A Government that has abandoned all its powers —
The powers of direct taxation , the sword , and the purse .
You have disposed of them to Congress , without a Bill of Rights — without check , limitation , or controul .
And still you have checks and guards — still you keep barriers — pointed where ?
Pointed against your weakened , prostrated , enervated State Government !
You have a Bill of Rights to defend you against the State Government , which is bereaved of all power ; and yet you have none against Congress , though in full and exclusive possession of all power !
You arm youselves against the weak and defenceless , and expose yourselves naked to the armed and powerful .
Is not this a conduct of unexampled absurdity ?
What barriers have you to oppose to this most strong energetic Government ?
To that Government you have nothing to oppose .
All your defence is given up .
This is a real actual defect . . . "
The Bill of Rights as we know them today were first introduced by James Madison in 1789 in response to the fears the emerging Constitution caused among the free men in these united States .
They eventually came into effect on December 15 , 1791 .
The Federalists were desperately opposed to the adoption of the Bill of Rights being insisted upon by Patrick Henry , Thomas Jefferson and other skeptics of central governance .
As Brutus again so cleverly pointed out in the Anti-Federalist papers # 84 :
" This will appear the more necessary , when it is considered , that not only the Constitution and laws made in pursuance thereof , but all treaties made , under the authority of the United States , are the supreme law of the land , and supersede the Constitutions of all the States .
The power to make treaties , is vested in the president , by and with the advice and consent of two - thirds of the senate .
I do not find any limitation or restriction to the exercise of this power .
The most important article in any Constitution may therefore be repealed , even without a legislative act .
Ought not a government , vested with such extensive and indefinite authority , to have been restricted by a declaration of rights ?
It certainly ought .
So clear a point is this , that I cannot help suspecting that persons who attempt to persuade people that such reservations were less necessary under this Constitution than under those of the States , are wilfully endeavoring to deceive , and to lead you into an absolute state of vassalage ( emphasis mine ) . "
The Bill of Rights nominations from the respective sovereign states originally numbered near 200 and the Founding Lawyers saw fit to include twelve ( the two concerning apportionment and Congressional pay failed to pass ) after much bickering especially by the most monstrous worthy of the time , Alexander Hamilton .
A brilliant mind coupled with all the political knife - fighting skills needed to dominate the proceedings , Hamilton made sure that the tools of oppression and a financial yoke would be decorating our necks in perpetuity .
Small solace can be taken in the aftermath of the duel between Hamilton and Burr on 11 July 1804 in that it took him close to a day to die .
Alexander Hamilton tipped his intellectual hand in a speech to the Constitutional Convention concerning the United States Senate , 06/18/1787 ( quoted in the notes of Judge Yates ) :
“ All communities divide themselves into the few and the many .
The first are the rich and the well - born ; the other the mass of the people … turbulent and changing , they seldom judge or determine right .
Give therefore to the first class a distinct , permanent share in the Government … Nothing but a permanent body can check the imprudence of democracy . ”

I am no fan of democracy as I see it as nothing more than a transformational accommodation to tyranny over time but one can infer from this quote that Hamilton fancied a class of people more equal than others who would have a disproportionate access to the levers of power over the great unwashed .
Again , I am suggesting that the Constitution was a document designed from the beginning as a means to rob constituent and subsidiary parts of sovereignty and subject these subordinate elements to a national framework which made their position subservient to the Federal government .
The desire of the Federalists was to install a national framework and cement the structure through the machinations of national banking , franking of a currency and debt creation .
Keep in mind that all of the nattering on about the Federal Reserve today is a complaint against a Constitutional Frankenstein monster in its fourth iteration since the other attempts at national banks failed .
You can guess who picked up the tab .
The Bill of Rights was finally passed on 15 December 1791 but it was much diluted and purposefully weaker and more ambiguous about the central government ’s implied and explicit powers .
The Constitution took effect on 4 March 1789 with 11 states under it and two states not submitting ratification .
North Carolina did ratify it when a promise of a future Bill of Rights was assured .
Rhode Island refused and was the only state to put the Constitution to a popular vote where it failed on 24 March 1788 by an 11 — 1 margin .
They eventually ratified it .
Hamilton now had the ways and means to make real his storied dream : " A national debt , if it is not excessive , will be to us a national blessing . "
The moneyed interests saw the advantage of monetizing the debt .
By assuming the state ’s debts at the national government level , a means of controlling commerce and taxation became an implied task of the central government .
This may have been the first incident of the debtors from the Revolutionary War convincing their Hamiltonian allies that if they had the national government bear the debt and relieve them of responsibility , this could be used as the means to establish the coveted national bank to start the issuance of government currency not to mention the driver for increased taxation .
All the puzzle pieces had finally locked into place .
Royce eloquently explains what has transpired in Hologram of Liberty : " To put a u2018 gun ’ in the hands of the new national government was the primary object , the great sine qua non , of the Constitution .
A comprehensive de jure authority of Congress backed with de facto guns . "
The Confederation is defeated and the long train of usurpation , centralization and tyranny leaves the station for what has become American history .
Hamilton ’s machinations and influence probably single - handedly turned the product of this secret confab into one of the most successful instruments of political oppression before even the creation of the USSR .
What makes it even more sublime as a tool of big government is the sophisticated propaganda and hagiographic enterprise which has both spontaneously and through careful planning suborned the public ’s skepticism of the nature of the machine erected to control their behavior , which has resulted in an almost religious observance of all things Constitutional .
Carefully cultivated over two hundred years , this religious idolatry had certainly fogged the thinking of this writer for most of his adult life .
This sleeper has awakened .
Ask yourself this question : have the robed government employees who read the Constitutional tea leaves for the most part defended individual liberty or have they rubber - stamped the exponential growth of power and control of the colossus that sits astride the Potomac ?
“ Our constitutions purport to be established by ‘ the people , ’ and , in theory , ‘ all the people ’ consent to such government as the constitutions authorize .
But this consent of ‘ the people ’ exists only in theory .
It has no existence in fact .
Government is in reality established by the few ; and these few assume the consent of all the rest , without any such consent being actually given . ”

The Best of William Buppert

A new result by Princeton computer scientists and economists shows a striking application of computer science theory to the field of financial derivative design .
The paper is Computational Complexity and Information Asymmetry in Financial Products by Sanjeev Arora , Boaz Barak , Markus Brunnermeier , and Rong Ge. Although computation has long been used in the financial industry for program trading and “ the thermodynamics of money ” , this new paper applies an entirely different kind of computer science : Intractability Theory .
A financial derivative is a contract specifying a payoff calculated by some formula based on the yields or prices of a specific collection of underlying assets .
Consider the securitization of debt : a CDO ( collateralized debt obligation ) is a security formed by packaging together hundreds of home mortgages .
The CDO is supposedly safer than the individual mortgages , since it spreads the risk ( not every mortgage is supposed to default at once ) .
Furthermore , a CDO is usually divided into “ senior tranches ” which are guaranteed not to drop in value as long as the total defaults in the pool does not exceed some threshhold ; and “ junior tranches ” that are supposed to bear all the risk .
Trading in derivatives brought down Lehman Brothers , AIG , and many other buyers , based on mistaken assumptions about the independence of the underlying asset prices ; they underestimated the danger that many mortgages would all default at the same time .
But the new paper shows that in addition to that kind of danger , risks can arise because a seller can deliberately construct a derivative with a booby trap hiding in plain sight .
It ’s like encryption : it ’s easy to construct an encrypted message ( your browser does this all the time ) , but it ’s hard to decrypt without knowing the key ( we believe even the NSA does n’t have the computational power to do it ) .
Similarly , the new result shows that the seller can construct the CDO with a booby trap , but even Goldman Sachs wo n’t have enough computational power to analyze whether a trap is present .
The paper shows the example of a high - volume seller who builds 1000 CDOs from 1000 asset - classes of home mortages .
Suppose the seller knows that a few of those asset classes are “ lemons ” that wo n’t pay off .
The seller is supposed to randomly distribute the asset classes into the CDOs ; this minimizes the risk for the buyer , because there ’s only a small chance that any one CDO has more than a few lemons .
But the seller can “ tamper ” with the CDOs by putting most of the lemons in just a few of the CDOs .
This has an enormous effect on the senior tranches of those tampered CDOs .
In principle , an alert buyer can detect tampering even if he does n’t know which asset classes are the lemons : he simply examines all 1000 CDOs and looks for a suspicious overrepresentation of some of the asset classes in some of the CDOs .
What Arora et al. show is that is an NP - complete problem ( “ densest subgraph ” ) .
This problem is believed to be computationally intractable ; thus , even the most alert buyer can’t have enough computational power to do the analysis .
Arora et al .
show it ’s even worse than that : even after the buyer has lost a lot of money ( because enough mortgages defaulted to devalue his “ senior tranche ” ) , he ca n’t prove that that tampering occurred : he ca n’t prove that the distribution of lemons was n’t random .
This makes it hard to get recourse in court ; it also makes it hard to regulate CDOs .
Intractability
Theory forms the basis for several of the technologies discussed on Freedom - to - Tinker : cryptography , digital - rights management , watermarking , and others .
Perhaps now financial policy is now another one .
I ’m a big fan of nmap ‘s -- top - ports option , which gives you the ability to leverage Fyodor ’s latest Internet research on open ports on the Internet .
Basically , he scanned most of the Internet and determined which ports are usually open , and he built lists of the top ports for use within nmap .
So now instead of saying :
nmap -p 1-10000 $ target
… to hopefully get “ most ” of the ports you ’re looking for , you can instead say :
nmap -- top - ports 1000 $ target
… which yields dramatically faster and more accurate results .
From the website :
The –top - ports option lets you specify the number of ports you wish to scan in each protocol , and will pick the most popular ports for you based on the new frequency data .
For both TCP and UDP , the top 10 ports gets you roughly half of the open ports .
The top 1,000 ( out of 65,536 possible ) finds roughly 93 % of the open TCP ports and more than 95 % of the open UDP ports .
93 % in just 1,000 ports .
Nice .
Anyway , the - - top - ports option by default launches a TCP scan , and figuring out how to do both a TCP and a UDP scan at the same time is n’t intuitive for everyone .
All you do is preceed your scan with the -s option , combined with the type of scans you want to do .
So , for both TCP and UDP , it ’d be :
nmap - sTU -- top- ports
That ’s it .
Here are the options I like to use for a basic scan :
nmap -vv - O - P0 - sTUV –top- ports 1000 - oA target $ target
Which does all of the following :
very verbose
get the operating system
tcp , udp , and version information
top 1,000 TCP and UDP ports
output in nmap , greppable , and XML format
As a special bonus for those wanting to use tcpdump to capture your scan traffic , you can just add -- packet - trace to your scan to see the actual packets that leave and exit your box from right within nmap .

THE BIRTHERS ….
I call them “ conversation enders . ”
These are comments that lead you to know , the moment you hear them , that the writer / speaker is either clueless or intellectually dishonest , and there ’s really no reason to engage the person in a serious dialog .
I suspect we all have them .
When I hear , “ Tax cuts are fiscally responsible because they pay for themselves , ” it ’s a conversation ender .
When I hear , “ Evolution is just a theory , ” it ’s a conversation ender .
When someone says , “ Global warming ca n’t be real because it ’s cold outside , ” it ’s a conversation ender .
And when someone questions whether Barack Obama is a natural - born citizen of the United States , it ’s definitely a conversation ender .
With that in mind , Ben Smith has a good piece today describing the odd little movement behind this argument , making up a group apparently known as the “ Birthers . ”
Out of the gaze of the mainstream and even the conservative media is a flourishing culture of advocates , theorists and lawyers , all devoted to proving that Barack Obama is n’t eligible to be president of the United States .
Viewed as irrelevant by the White House , and as embarrassing by much of the Republican Party , the subculture still thrives from the conservative website WorldNetDaily , which claims that some 300,000 people have signed a petition demanding more information on Obama ’s birth , to Cullman , Alabama , where Sen .
Richard Shelby took a question on the subject at a town hall meeting last week .
Their confinement to the fringe has n’t cooled the passion of believers ; the obscure New York preacher James Manning turned up at a National Press Club session in December to declare the president “ the most notorious criminal in the history not just of America , but of this entire planet . ”
Smith wisely notes that , in our reality , the claim itself is transparently ridiculous .
But the fact that these strange people are out there , aggressively pushing their argument , is a dynamic with multiple angles .
For example , the nuttiness in some ways helps the White House because it makes the president ’s detractors look ridiculous .
Former Clinton
White House press secretary Jake Siewert said , “ At some level , they ’re not that bad to have around because it reminds people that under the mainstream conservative press there ’s this bubbling up of really irrational hatred for the guy . ”
And that ’s precisely what worries some conservatives who want their attacks against the White House to be taken seriously .
Michael Medved referred to the Birthers as “ crazy , nutburger , demagogue , money - hungry , exploitative , irresponsible , filthy conservative imposters ” who are “ the worst enemy of the conservative movement . ”
He added , “ It makes us look weird .
It makes us look crazy .
It makes us look demented .
It makes us look sick , troubled , and not suitable for civilized company . ”
So , the “ mainstream ” right is debating whether they should actively root for Obama ’s policies to fail , and the “ fringe ” right is debating whether Obama is even eligible for the presidency .
Just keep on talking , guys .

The ashes of a woman who became the last survivor of the Titanic have been scattered following a memorial service .
Millvina Dean was nine weeks old when the liner sank after hitting an iceberg in the Atlantic on its maiden voyage from Southampton on 15 April 1912 .
Miss Dean died in a care home in Hampshire on 31 May at the age of 97 .
Miss Dean 's ashes were scattered from a small launch on the water of berth 43 / 44 at Southampton Docks , the terminal from which the ship set sail .
Miss Dean 's partner Bruno Nordmanis scattered the ashes accompanied by a small group of friends and relatives and the port 's chaplain , the Reverend Andrew Huckett .
It followed a service at St Mary 's Church in Copythorne , Hampshire , on Saturday morning .
Youngest passenger
The disaster resulted in the deaths of 1,517 people , largely due to the lack of lifeboats on board .
Millvina Dean was nine weeks old when the Titanic sank
Miss Dean had been travelling with her family in third class from Southampton to America where they hoped to start a new life and open a tobacconist 's shop in Kansas City .
Miss Dean 's mother , Georgetta , and two - year - old brother , Bert , also survived but her father , Bertram , was among those who perished when the vessel sank .
Elizabeth Gladys Dean , better known as Millvina , was the Titanic 's youngest passenger when her family boarded the liner .
Another baby on board , Barbara Joyce West , was nearly 11 months old when the vessel sank .
She also survived .
Barbara Joyce Dainton , as she became when she married , died in October 2007 , leaving Miss Dean the last Titanic survivor .
An Alice Springs man who offered " white power " merchandise for sale has been ordered to complete 120 hours of community work .
The man cannot be named because the Alice Springs Magistrates Court has suppressed his identity .
He pleaded guilty to offensive behaviour for having t- shirts and hats made with the slogan " white power Alice Springs " and offering them for sale from his car last month .
The man , fearing attacks , then removed his personalised number plates and falsely reported them stolen .
For that he was fined $ 1,500 and ordered to pay $ 2,100 restitution for wasting police time .
Magistrate John Birch says the man received a lighter sentence for offensive behaviour because he had pleaded guilty and was obviously remorseful .
Lattice Effect
When I initially viewed the 256 - byte intro Puls by Řrřola that took first place at Riverwash 2009 , I think I shared a common sentiment with many other developers out there :
That s impossible !
Řrřola was kind enough to release his x86 assembly language source code , revealing that the effect is computed without the aid of 3D libraries or hardware acceleration .
It s mind - blowing .
Check out the start of the source :
org 100h ; assume ah=bx=0 cx=255 sp=di= - 2 si=100h mov al , 13h ;> 8 = 0.6875 push bx ; ( word ) [ 100h ] >> 16 = 0.0769 mov dx,3C8h ; ( float ) [ 100h ] = - 0.0008052 int 10h
The interrupt call changes the video mode to 13h ( 320×200 resolution with 256 colors ) .
3c8h is one of the ports involves in changing the palette , which is used later .
Simple enough so far no wait !
What are those comments to the right ?
To understand them , I fired up debug :

The important part is those first 4 bytes : B0 13 53 BA .
Based on the comments , I punched those values into some test Java code :
System.out.format ( " % f %n " , 0xB0 / 256.0 ) ;
System.out.format ( " % f %n " , 0x13B0 / ( 256.0 * 256.0 ) ) ;
System.out.format ( " % f %n " , Float.intBitsToFloat ( 0xBA5313B0 ) ) ;
Which outputs :
0.687500 0.076904 - 0.000805
Push BX maps to 53 .
The calls only purpose appears to be to contribute to these constants .
This kind of trick reminds me of how some biological viruses compress their genome by overlapping genes ( e.g. HepatitisB virus ( HBV ) genome ) .
This truly is sick coding .
The compression tricks certainly dont end there , but I really wasnt that interested in how Řrřola packed the effect into 256 bytes .
I just wanted to understand the mathematics behind it and what algorithm enabled it to animate in real - time .
I wanted to know how fast something like it could run in Java .
According to Řrřolas web site , he originally developed the concept in C and he later crunched it down to assembly , and in so doing , he obfuscated the details .
At the time of this writing , Řrřola has yet to release the C code .
If and when he does , Ill probably attempt a direct Java port .
Until then , I decided to explore a similar lattice effect .
The code is obfuscated , but well commented .
A cursory analysis of the comments suggests that ray casting is used or more specifically ray marching using some kind of distance field to speed it up .
Since I wasnt inhibited by the 256 - byte size constraint , I decided to go for something that may run a tad faster .
I created a ray caster that intersects spheres and cylinders .

ray [ 2 ] = rz * inverseMag ;
}
}
}
The code starts out by pre-computing normalized ray vectors for every pixel on the screen .
The fisheye lens version scans the surface of a hemisphere using the spherical coordinates formulas .
The pinhole camera version computes rays from a point observer sitting a distance Z0 away from the center of a virtual screen .
while ( true ) {
float cosPhi = ( float ) Math.cos ( phi ) ;
float sinPhi = ( float ) Math.sin ( phi ) ;
float cosTheta = ( float ) Math.cos ( theta ) ;
float sinTheta = ( float ) Math.sin ( theta ) ;
float ux = cosPhi * sinTheta ;
float uy = sinPhi * sinTheta ;
float uz = cosTheta ;
float vx = cosPhi * cosTheta ;
float vy = sinPhi * cosTheta ;
float vz = - sinTheta ;
float wx = uy * vz - uz * vy ;
float wy = uz * vx - ux * vz ;
float wz = ux * vy - uy * vx ;
The main part of the code is an infinite loop .
At the top of the loop , I apply the spherical coordinates formulas again to establish an orthonormal basis for modifying the virtual camera direction .
Using 2 angles for a virtual camera is less than desirable , but all I need to do for this application is spin the camera .
The application renders an infinite lattice consisting of cube - shaped cells .
At the center of each cell is a red sphere .
Three cylinders pierce the sphere in the direction of each axis .
Below is a rendering of only a few cells close to the camera , revealing how each cell contains three cylinders and a sphere .
The program borrows an optimization technique from ray tracing called regular grids .
An excellent discussion of regular grids can be found in Ray Tracing from the Ground Up , but Ill briefly discuss it here .
Rays are cast from the virtual camera out into the scene .
The algorithm performs ray intersection tests for all of the objects in the cell containing the virtual camera .
If the ray fails to hit anything , it advances to one of the neighboring cell and so on .
In this way , a minimal number of cells need to be processed .
In the code below , the location of the observer is converted into grid cell coordinates :
int GX = ( int ) Math.floor ( ox * INVERSE_GRID_SIZE ) ;
int GY = ( int ) Math.floor ( oy * INVERSE_GRID_SIZE ) ;
int GZ = ( int ) Math.floor ( oz * INVERSE_GRID_SIZE ) ;
In case you are wondering why I bothered to use the floor function , this should clear it up :
System.out.format ( " %d %d %n " ,
( int ) ( 123 / GRID_SIZE ) , ( int ) Math.floor ( 123 / GRID_SIZE ) ) ;
System.out.format ( " %d %d %n " ,
( int ) ( - 123 / GRID_SIZE ) , ( int ) Math.floor ( - 123 / GRID_SIZE ) ) ;
Which outputs :
0 0 0 -1
Next , the orthnormal basis is applied to one of the pre-calculated rays ( i.e. the pre-calculated ray is rotated appropriately as the camera direction demands ) .
float rx = ux * Rx + vx * Ry + wx * Rz ;
float ry = uy * Rx + vy * Ry + wy * Rz ;
float rz = uz * Rx + vz * Ry + wz * Rz ;
The regular grid algorithm advances between cells similar to Bresenham 's line algorithm .
It considers the evenly - spaced , infinite planes that separates cells .
You can think of a ray like a particle traveling at constant rate away from the observer .
The components of the particles velocity vector are independent of each other .
Meaning , the time required for the particle to traverse the space between two neighboring , parallel planes is always constant .
There is a constant time for each axial direction .
The algorithm starts out by computing the times in each axial direction required to intersect the nearest infinite plane .
Then it successively adds to those times the constant times required to cross the boundary between neighboring parallel planes .
To advance the particle in the right order , it always compares all 3 times , uses the smallest and then only adjusts that time .
Below , the code uses the direction of the ray to find the times to the nearest infinite planes .
It also stores the independent cell advancement direction steps ( +1 or - 1 ) .
if ( rx > 0 ) {
dgx = 1 ;
tx = (( GRID_SIZE * ( gx + 1 ) ) - ox ) * irx ;
} else {
dgx = - 1 ;
tx = (( GRID_SIZE * gx ) - ox ) * irx ;
}
if ( ry > 0 ) {
dgy = 1 ;
ty = (( GRID_SIZE * ( gy + 1 ) ) - oy ) * iry ;
} else {
dgy = - 1 ;
ty = ( GRID_SIZE * gy - oy ) * iry ;
}
if ( rz > 0 ) {
dgz = 1 ;
tz = (( GRID_SIZE * ( gz + 1 ) ) - oz ) * irz ;
} else {
dgz = - 1 ;
tz = (( GRID_SIZE * gz ) - oz ) * irz ;
}
The time required to traverse the space between two neighboring , parallel planes is computing by using the distance between the planes .
float dtx = Math.abs ( GRID_SIZE * irx ) ;
float dty = Math.abs ( GRID_SIZE * iry ) ;
float dtz = Math.abs ( GRID_SIZE * irz ) ;
At the bottom of the loop , it figures out which of the 3 times is the smallest .
It advances the cell coordinates in the associated direction and adds the constant intra-plane time to the time .
if ( tx < ty ) {
if ( tx < tz ) {
tx += dtx ;
gx += dgx ;
} else {
tz += dtz ;
gz += dgz ;
}
} else if ( ty < tz ) {
ty += dty ;
gy += dgy ;
} else {
tz += dtz ;
gz += dgz ;
}
An inner-loop steps through the grid using this technique up to a specified number of iterations .
During each iteration , it performs the four intersection tests .
First , it tries to hit each cylinder and then it tests the sphere .
Detecting a hit is not sufficient ; all four intersection tests must be performed to find the object closest to the observer .
A discussion of the math behind the intersection tests can be found here .
Most of the code is redundant in an attempt to speed it up .
Coloring the objects is based on the Phong shading model .
Ambient and diffuse shading is used .
The light direction is parallel to one of the axes of the orthonormal basis , moving with the camera and providing a consistent shading .
I cant determine if the regular grid optimization is used in the Puls intro , but the comments reveal a lot .
Here are some key comments :
; " ambient occlusion " strength ( default 86 : - 1 byte ) ; fisheye projection : z = C - x * x - y*y ; intersect ray with scene , count number of bounding volume misses ; raycasting using unbounded binary search ; start with the smallest step size ; last probe was inside : halve step and go back ; outside : double step and go forward ; bounding volumes : " blow up " the scene by the current step size ; green octahedra : ( |x | + |y| + |z | ) /2 - 0.1445 + r < blowup ; orange octahedra : ( |x+0.5 | + |y + 0.5 | +|z+0.5 | )/2 - 0.1445 - r < blowup ; bars : ( | |x| - |z|| + | |y| - |x|| + | |z| - |y
|
| ) /2 - 0.0676 < blowup ; bolts : ( | |x| - |z|| + | |y| - |x| | + | |z| - |y
|
| ) /2 - 0.1445 < blowup ; adjust step size according to the hit result
I like how ambient occlusion is in quotes .
Real ambient occlusion is a computationally expensive technique used in ray tracing .
It casts secondary rays out from the surfaces of objects to estimate how much open space there is between the object and its neighbors .
If there is not a lot of open space , then not that much light can enter and the surface is shaded darker .
I know there are tricks to approximate something like it in real - time , but the quotes hint that it is faked .
To learn more about the inequalities in the comments , I plotted 2D versions of them .
WolframAlpha to the rescue :
As the comment suggests , in 3D , |x| + |y| + |z| < R confines an octahedron with bounds of ±R in each axis .
This was very surprising .
I originally thought that the image was a distorted view of a simple cubic lattice .
The vertices in such a lattice would be connected to 6 edges , each parallel to an axis .
And , since the struts representing the edges connect perpendicularly to the faces of the volume representing the vertex , each vertex volume would be a cube .
But , the vertex volumes are actually octahedrons , meaning 8 edges connect to each vertex .
In 2D , only 4 edges :
To visualize an octahedral lattice , check out the structure of cesium chloride :
The structure is known as a body - centered cubic system because it has one vertex in the center of each cubic cell in addition to the corner vertices .
Each corner vertex is shared by 8 cubic cells .
Hence , each corner vertex has edges to 8 body - centered vertices .
If you remove the horizontal and vertical edges , what remains is an octahedral lattice .
Click here for a second visualization .
The 0.5 offset in the inequality for the orange octahedron suggests that lattice consists of repeated unit cubes .
The size of the octahedrons and the thickness of the bars are easy to control by changing the values on the right - side of the inequalities .
The moving nuts ( Řrřola inadvertently called them bolts ) are a little more complicated .
A nut is essentially a thicker bar bound between 2 octahedrons .
As the sizes of those 2 octahedrons change together , the nut appears to slide on the bar .
Below , you can see 4 nuts in the 2D versions of the inequalities .
The nuts consists of bars of size 3 trapped between octahedrons of sizes 4 and 6 .
To render these shapes in 3D , I modified the inner-loop of my program a bit .
It still uses the regular grid optimization , but instead of intersecting spheres and cylinders , it performs ray marching .
The algorithm is based on my interpretation of Řrřolas comments .
The inequalities above , can be written as :
f(x , y , z ) < R
As you change R , the size of the bounded volume changes in the direction of the surface gradient .
For example , to move a point on the surface of the volume by a distance equal to the magnitude of the gradient at that point , you can do this :
f(x , y , z ) < R + 1
Or , if you know the magnitude of the gradient at that point , call it M , then you can a move point on the surface by some distance S :
f(x , y , z ) < R + S/M
The algorithm works by setting S to a small value and then it iteratively doubles S until the location of the ( stationary ) marching particle satisfies the inequality .
Once it does , it halves S. Now , there is a distance of at least S between the particle and a point on the surface .
The particle makes a step along the ray by that distance and then the process is repeated , starting again with the smallest value of S .
It stops when the inequality is satisfied for S below some threshold .
Oddly , shading is a function of the total number of doubling - S iterations required before the marching particle intersects an object .
That is the ambient occlusion . 
Unfortunately , when I plug all that in , the frame - rate is dismal .
It can probably run excellently in Java if I reduce those shapes to triangles and perform ray - triangle intersection tests instead .

By taking multiple saliva samples from 183 young men and women on election night , researchers found that the testosterone levels of men who voted for John McCain or Robert Barr dropped sharply 40 minutes after Obama was announced the winner .
It ’s already a medical commonplace that male testosterone levels go down when they experience serious disappointment , especially a tough athletic loss .
From ABC , we learn that Republicans had a drop in testosterone levels on a certain November evening of last year :
This tells us why so many angry Republican men ca n’t put a name to their rage .
The lost election left them feeling unmanly ; it ’s compensation .
We know all about that by now :
What a weasel :
In The Test of Our Times : America Under Siege , Ridge wrote that although Rumsfeld and Ashcroft wanted to raise the alert level , " There was absolutely no support for that position within our department .
None .
I wondered , ' Is this about security or politics ? ' "
As we reported yesterday , Ridge is now scrambling to recast that statement .
On Rachel Maddow 's MSNBC show last night , Ridge continued to contradict himself .
" At no time , at no time , at no time did politics enter , in my judgment , anybody 's equation , " Ridge said .
Ridge went on to say that " politics was not involved " and that " I was not pressured . "
Maddow then read to Ridge directly from his book 's jacket : " ' He recounts episodes such as the pressure that the DHS received to raise the security alert on the eve of of the ' 04 presidential election . '
That 's wrong ? "
" Those are n't my words , " Ridge said .
" Read the book . "
But not the book 's jacket .
That stuff just can't be trusted .
A new study that looks at data on three generations of Oregon families shows that " positive parenting " – including factors such as warmth , monitoring children 's activities , involvement , and consistency of discipline – not only has positive impacts on adolescents , but on the way they parent their own children .
In the first study of its kind , David Kerr , assistant professor of psychology at Oregon State University , and project director Deborah Capaldi , and co-authors Katherine Pears and Lee Owen of the Eugene - based Oregon Social Learning Center , examined surveys from 206 boys who were considered " at - risk " for juvenile delinquency .
The boys , then in elementary school , and their parents were interviewed and observed , which gave Kerr and colleagues information about how the boys were parented .
Starting in 1984 , the boys met with researchers every year from age 9 to 33 .
As the boys grew up and started their own families , their partners and children began participating in the study .
In this way , the researchers learned how the men's childhood experiences influenced their own parenting .
" This study is especially exciting because we had already identified processes by which risk behaviors and poor parenting may be carried across generations , " Capaldi said .
" Professor Kerr has now demonstrated that there is an additional pathway of intergenerational influence via positive parenting and development . "
The study will be published in the September issue of the journal Developmental Psychology in a special issue devoted to findings of some of the few long - term studies of intergenerational family processes .
The journal is published by the American Psychological Association .
Kerr said there is often an assumption that people learn parenting methods from their own parents .
In fact , he said most research shows that a direct link between what a person experiences as a child and what she or he does as a parent is fairly weak .

" Instead , what we find is that ' negative ' parenting such as hostility and lack of follow - through leads to ' negative ' parenting in the next generation not through observation , but by allowing problem behavior to take hold in adolescence , " Kerr said .
" For instance , if you try to control your child with anger and threats , he learns to deal in this way with peers , teachers , and eventually his own children .
If you do not track where your child is , others will take over your job of teaching him about the world .
" But those lessons may involve delinquency and a lifestyle that is not compatible with becoming a positive parent , " Kerr pointed out .
The researchers ' prior work showed that children who experienced high levels of negative parenting were more likely to be antisocial and delinquent as adolescents .
Boys who had these negative characteristics in adolescence more often grew up to be inconsistent and ineffective parents , and to have children with more negative and challenging behaviors .
" We knew that these negative pathways can be very strong , " Kerr said .
" What surprised us is how strong positive parenting pathways are as well .
Positive parenting is not just the absence of negative influences , but involves taking an active role in a child 's life . "
The researchers found that children who had parents who monitored their behavior , were consistent with rules and were warm and affectionate were more likely to have close relationships with their peers , be more engaged in school , and have better self - esteem .
" So part of what good parenting does is not only protect you against negative behaviors but instill positive connections with others during adolescence that then impact how you relate with your partner and your own child as an adult , " Kerr said
" This research shows that when we think about the value of prevention , we should consider an even wider lens than is typical , " he added .
" We see now that changes in parenting can have an effect not just on children but even on grandchildren . "
The study was funded by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .

The future of the boot system in Debian =======================================
Over the last few years , the boot system in Debian has progressively deteriorated due to changes in the Linux kernel which make the kernel more and more event based .
For example , the kernel and its drivers no longer block all processing while detecting disks , network interfaces and other hardware , making the once trusty old boot system in Debian increasingly fragile .
During the current boot sequence device files in / dev / are often missing when fsck or mount are looking for them , or the network is not available when the boot system tries to mount NFS entries because network interfaces were slow to initialise , or audio devices are missing when audio settings should be set .
The problem is fundamental to the way we boot Debian today - sequentially , and a solution needs to address this fundamental problem .
We believe the solution is to migrate to an event based boot system .
In addition to this , there are long lasting problems with the boot sequence of the existing init.d scripts , for some combination of packages .
The boot sequence is wrong in these cases , and to solve it one needs to change the sequence numbers of all the immediate forward and reverse dependencies of the init.d script in question - and their forward and reverse dependencies and so forth until the boot sequence is correct .
In some cases the change needs to happen to several scripts in different packages at the same time , which is impossible with the old way of ordering init.d scripts .
Previously the ordering was done by asking the package maintainers to guess on and update sequence numbers , a process that tended to introduce new problems and took a long time to be solved properly .
The solution to this problem is to change how we order boot scripts .
Change it from static sequence numbers to calculate the boot sequence using dependency information provided in the init.d scripts themselves .
Since 2009 - 07 - 27 this is the default in Debian unstable , and it will be the way init.d scripts are ordered in Squeeze .
Switching to a dependency based boot sequencing allows us to ensure its correctness , detect and fix dependency loops , and in general fix a set of bugs in the distribution that have been very hard to fix before .
Other solved problems with the new system are incorrect stop sequences ( the default should have been S20 / K80 , not S20 / K20 ) , and the misleading runlevels 0 and 6 , where start symlinks are called with ' stop ' as the argument to the scripts .
All of these problems are solved when Debian now moves to dependency based boot sequencing .
It will take longer to solve the fundamental problem .
It requires a rewrite of how we handle the boot , and can not be done by just modifying the boot sequence framework .
Before explaining the current plan , some background information .
The current boot system can be seen as consisting of three different parts : 1 . The implementation of / sbin / init , reading /etc / inittab and starting the script implementing part 2 ( /etc/init.d/rc ) .
This is normally done using the sysvinit package , but other replacements are available , like initng and upstart .
2 . The implementation of / etc / init.d/rc , which is responsible for calling the init.d scripts in the correct sequence .
This is normally done using the sysv-rc package .
An alternative is the file - rc package , which uses a file /etc/runlevel.conf instead of symlinks in /etc / rc ?.d/ to decide what to execute and in which order .
3 . The individual init.d scripts , taking care of the tasks that need to be done during boot .
The basic framework is provided by the initscripts package , and the rest is handled by individual packages like udev , netbase , ifupdown , apache , etc. :)
There are approximately 850 packages with init.d scripts in Debian unstable .
Part 2 ( sysv-rc ) and 3 have been changed to use dependency based boot sequencing .
This was a release goal for Lenny and the continued work is a release goal for Squeeze .
The init.d scripts have seen review with regard to dependency based ordering for more than 3 years .
New installs will use dependency based boot sequencing .
For upgrades , a critical debconf question will give the default option to migrate if testing find no issues with the existing scripts or for now keep the legacy boot ordering .
To solve the fundamental problem , the plan is to replace / sbin / init with an implementation that is able to handle kernel events .
It will allow us to modify the boot system for the early boot to become event based , while keeping the existing boot stuff working .
We could rewrite sysvinit to become event based , or have a look at the existing boot systems that handle kernel events .
After checking the options and the systems used in other distributions , upstart seems like the most promising candidate .
It is used by Ubuntu and Fedora at the moment , and solves the problem in a backwards compatible way .
The plan is to change upstart to actually use / etc / inittab , to ease the switch between sysvinit and upstart .
We will also change the init.d script handling to treat upstart jobs as init.d scripts , to provide an alternative for architectures lacking upstart support .
These changes should make it transparent for the users which package provides / sbin / init , and thus make it easier to migrate from sysvinit to upstart .
When / sbin / init is changed to an event based framework , the next step is to rewrite the early boot system to use these events when available , and behave the traditional way when there are no events .
When this step is finished the fundamental problem will be solved , and the boot will be robust and should work correctly even in edge cases with slow device buses .
The planned time frame for this is to replace / sbin / init with upstart for Squeeze , and see if we manage to change the very early boot to become event based in time for Squeeze too , fixing the most pressing of the current boot problems ( failing fsck and mount with USB disks ) .
For Squeeze +1 , more of the early boot system will be converted , to handle more of the existing problems .
According to the Linux Software Base specification , all LSB compliant distributions must handle packages with init.d scripts .
As Debian plans to continue to follow the LSB , this mean the boot system needs to continue to handle init.d scripts .
Because of this , we need a boot system in debian that is both event based for the early boot , and which also calls init.d scripts at the appropriate time .

Orly Taitz is the crazy blond lawyer who has been popping up on both serious and comedic media all over the place , presenting the birther case why Obama is not a valid citizen , but did you ever wonder where Taitz and the birthers get their info ?
Here is a look at the “ logic ” behind the birthers .
Now , apparently the Birther followers failed to take the usual Civics classes that I would hope the rest of us have passed .
It does not matter where Obama was born , although clearly he has documented to a fare - thee - well that he was born in Hawaii .
It does not matter WHERE Obama was born ; because no one is disputing that his MOTHER was born in the United States , and was a valid U.S. citizen at the time of Obama ’s birth ; or his maternal grandparents .
Our laws require ONLY one parent be a citizen for their offspring to be citizens , and in most instances , acquisition of natural born citizenship is also available through either set of grandparents who are citizens .
Article I of the Constitution , Section 8 , gives the Congress the right to establish and define who is a citizen , and naturalization , 4th item down on the list :
Advertisements
“ Article 1 – The Legislative Branch
Section 8 – Powers of Congress
To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization , “
For those who slept through American History , the Constitution was ratified in 1788 , effective in 1789 , with the various amendments expanding it over a number of years .
The subject of who is and who is not eligible to be a citizen came promptly under the Naturalization Act of 1790 ; they were n’t wasting any time defining who was and was not a citizen .
( No surprise , it was pretty much white immigrants of European origins ; people of other races and ethnicities , indigenous Americans , and so on were ‘ tagged in ’ later , in some cases , surprisingly later than you might expect . )
Here is one of the places where Orly Taitz has something ; the Naturalization Act of 1790 defined citizenship as automatic at birth if born abroad rather than inside the U.S. for the children of FATHERS , but NOT MOTHERS , who were U. S. citizens .
EXCEPT that this has been amended in 1934 legislation to give equal acquisition of citizenship through a child ’s mother ; and was further specified in 1952 legislation , well before Obama was born .
That legislation was the Immigration and Nationality Act .
Title III addresses acquisition of citizenship – the correct term for what is under discussion .
Title III also addresses the issue raised about John McCain ’s legal right to be President , as he was born in the Panama Canal Zone .
CHAPTER 1-NATIONALITY AT BIRTH AND BY COLLECTIVE NATURALIZATION
301 NATIONALS AND CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES AT BIRTH
for Obama :
( g ) a person born outside the geographical limits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien , and the other a citizen of the United States who , prior to the birth of such person , was physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than five years , at least two of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years : Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed Forces of the United States , or periods of employment with the United States Government or with an international organization as that term is defined in section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act ( 59 Stat .
669 ; 22 U.S.C. 288 ) by such citizen parent , or any periods during which such citizen parent is physically present abroad as the dependent unmarried son or daughter and a member of the household of a person ( A ) honorably serving with the Armed Forces of the United States , or20 ( B ) employed by the United States Government or an international organization as defined in section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities
Act , may be included in order to satisfy the physical - presence requirement of this paragraph .
This proviso shall be applicable to persons born on or after December 24 , 1952 , to the same extent as if it had become effective in its present form on that date ; and
( h ) a person born before noon ( Eastern Standard Time ) May 24 , 1934 , outside the limits and jurisdiction of the United States of an alien father and a mother who is a citizen of the United States who , prior to the birth of such person , had resided in the United States .
The section applicable to McCain :
303 PERSONS BORN IN THE CANAL ZONE OR REPUBLIC OF PANAMA ON OR AFTER FEBRUARY 26 , 1904
SEC . 303 . [ 8 U.S.C. 1403 ]
( a) Any person born in the Canal Zone on or after February 26 , 1904 , and whether before or after the effective date of this Act , whose father or mother or both at the time of the birth of such person was or is a citizen of the United States , is declared to be a citizen of the United States .
( b) Any person born in the Republic of Panama on or after February 26 , 1904 , and whether before or after the effective date of this Act , whose father or mother or both at the 20time of the birth of such person was or is a citizen of the United States employed by the Government of the United States or by the Panama Railroad Company , or its successor in title , is declared to be a citizen of the United States .
McCain is old , but he is not pre-1904 old ; he comes from a family of famous admirals on his father ’s side , and his mother was born in Oklahoma .
Had he been elected , he would have been ‘ legal ’ for the office of president , under these provisions .
Interestingly , this is not a new topic ; other presidents , notably Chester Arthur , also have faced the issue of presidential natural citizenship qualification .
So … why would Orly Taitz , herself from a foreign country , keep insisting that Obama is not eligible to be President ?
I decided to do a bit of research into that , since my own civics class days were a while ago .
There are two conflicting legal premises involved , “ jus soli ” , which roughly translates as “ law of ground ” and “ jus sanguinous ” , the concept of “ law of blood ” which requires both parents to be considered for citizenship purposes .
In Europe , different countries opted for either jus soli , or jus sanguinous , in determining citizenship ; in the U.S. , we have more of a hybrid citizenship by birth .
It is fairly obvious that those in the House and Senate who have not taken a firm stand in support of President Obama in response to the Birther movement are not sincere .
None of them appear to genuinely believe this is an issue .
Others seem equally disingenuous in their statements .
However , there are those who are perhaps more gullible , certainly misguided individuals who seem to sincerely believe that Obama is not our legal president .
These people have the frantic kind of fear that is unique to ignorance .
They are desperate to believe that however unlikely , it makes some kind of sense that we do not have a bi-racial black man legitimately occupying the oval office .
We cannot any of us know what their motivation is , although racism seems the most likely explanation .
In watching the news footage , I have yet to see anyone who appears to be a person of color who is in terror of the results of the 2008 election .
It is possible that fact and reason might succeed with these frightened birthers , but not probable .
There are few options to resolve the divide other than to try .
The alternative is to laugh at them , but that does n’t solve the problem of segments of our political whole breaking off into little extremist shards .
That process , the fragmenting of our political spectrum , ultimately weakens the whole , the opposite of unifying divergent views .
Education is the only possible solution , beginning with our own information , our own education .
These two quotations from very different occupants of the White House rather sum up the opposing world views , one which would exclude anyone perceived to be too different to be accepted as eq ual citizens among us :
“ No , I do n’t know that atheists should be considered as citizens , nor should they be considered as patriots .
This is one nation under God . ”
– George H.W. Bush
American 41st US President ( 1989 -93 ) ,
Or inclusive of all of us :
“ I think if the people of this country can be reached with the truth , their judgment will be in favor of the many , as against the privileged few ”
– Eleanor Roosevelt
American United Nations Diplomat , Humanitarian and First Lady ( 1933 - 45 ) , wife of Franklin D. Roosevelt , 32nd US president .
1884 -1962
Two World War II cargo ships moored among Benicia 's fabled " ghost fleet " since the late 1940s will be towed out of Suisun Bay next month , scrubbed clean in dry dock and ultimately sent to Texas to be broken up and sold for scrap .
The move will kick off a new federal effort to dispose of the hulking ships that are leaching toxic paint and other chemicals into the waterway .
The initiative , announced Thursday in Benicia by U.S. Deputy Secretary of Transportation John Porcari , marked a thawing of relations between federal officials and state water quality regulators involved in a long - running dispute over the maintenance and dismantling of the fleet , which numbers 72 ships .
Under the plan , the federal government will hire outside contractors to remove fuel from the ships ' tanks , scour invasive species from hulls , and blast away peeling paint and metals .
The work - which will single out 25 of the worst offenders - will occur in dry dock , initially in San Francisco .
Three - year wait
That pleased San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board officials , who for the last three years argued that the Bush administration 's push to clean the ships in Suisun Bay would have further contaminated the waterway and imperiled important fish populations .
" This is the beginning of a very long process , but it 's a fantastic start , " said Bruce Wolfe , executive officer of the water board .
Last year , Wolfe 's agency joined three environmental groups in suing the U.S. Maritime Administration for violating the federal Clean Water Act .
The lawsuit alleges the decaying ships have dumped asbestos , used oil and as much as 19 tons of mercury , lead and copper into Suisun Bay .
Maritime officials said at the time they were caught in a dilemma : U.S. Coast Guard codes required the ships be stripped of invasive species before moving out into the Pacific Ocean , and the regional water board said moving the rotting ships would release more noxious chemicals into the water .
Millions in costs
While the dry dock work will add millions to the costs to clean the ships , Porcari said President Obama is committed to recycling the behemoths and restoring water quality to the site of the largest " mothball fleet " in the nation .
" We take this issue very seriously , and we wo n't rest until it 's rectified , " Porcari said .
The road is likely to be long and costly , given the dearth of dry dock and disposal centers nationwide and lower steel prices .
Federal officials said that during the days of high - flying steel prices , recycling companies would pay to cut the ships apart for the valuable metal they contained .
With the reversal in the economy , the government instead is paying a Brownsville , Texas , firm more than $ 2 million to recycle the first two ships .
The Suisun Bay mothball fleet - which is arranged in clumps across a 4.5 - nautical - mile stretch of Suisun Bay visible from Highway 680 - dates to the late 1940s .
After the end of World War II , the U.S. Maritime Commission anchored thousands of cargo ships , tankers and battleships at sites around the United States where they could be preserved until needed for further military or civilian operations .
At its peak around 1960 , the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet held more than 350 ships .
Ships move around
In the decades since , ships have been added and removed from the fleet .
Within the past month , one ship left Suisun Bay for Galveston , Texas , where it is being used for training by the Texas Maritime Academy .
The other two remaining reserve fleets , located in Texas and Virginia , contain about 70 ships total .
The first two ships scheduled for recycling are the Pan American Victory and the Earlham Victory , both World War II cargo ships built by Permanente Metals in 1945 in nearby Richmond .
While many of the defunct ships will be sold off and melted down , maritime enthusiasts hope to preserve the fleet 's most famous vessel .
The battleship Iowa - which shuttled President Franklin Roosevelt to important talks in Tehran during World War II - may become a floating museum similar to the battleship Missouri museum in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii .
Whether the ships find new homes or their parts find new uses through recycling , Wolfe said his agency will fight to eliminate all ships from Suisun Bay .
" We know it 's not going to happen overnight , but we support getting all the ships out of here , " he said .
The banking regulator says it has enough money to cover all failed banks
The number of US bank failures this year has topped more than 100 after US federal regulators shut down a trio of small Florida banks .
Bank failures have cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) fund that insures deposits an estimated $ 25 bn this year .
More US banks have now failed this year than in any year since 1992 .
The number is expected to rise as banks continue to suffer from the bad loans that precipitated the financial crisis .
Savers ' money is not in danger , as the FDIC , which is backed by the US government , insures deposits at failed banks for up to $ 250,000 per account .
Many of the banks that have failed have been small community banks , which were badly hit when loans to individuals and small businesses were not repaid after the onset of the crisis .
These were primarily deposit - taking banks , rather than investment banks that deal in complicated derivative products .
But these investment banks have also been hit hard , with the most high profile victim being Lehman Brothers , which collapsed in September last year .
Days later , another of Wall Street 's most famous banks , Merrill Lynch , was saved from collapse when it was bought out by Bank of America .
That exceptionally high government mileage rating could give the Volt a major boost .
For the first time , car buyers will easily be able to compare electric cars with ordinary gas - powered cars .
The Chevrolet Volt , GM 's electric car that 's expected to go on sale in late 2010 , is projected to get an estimated 230 miles per gallon , the automaker announced Tuesday .
Calculating the gas mileage of the Volt is tricky .
You get 40 miles of driving gas - free on the electric charge .
Beyond that the Volt gets 50 mpg .
So the actual mpg is :
mpg=Miles Driven /(( Miles Driven -40 ) /50mpg )
Simplifying , the equation for calculating the mpg for the Volt is :
mpg=( 50 * miles driven ) / ( miles driven - 40 ) .
This holds for trips greater than 40 miles .
At 40 miles driven or less , the mpg is infinite since no gas is being used .
Beyond 40 miles , the mpg decreases the more miles driven .
For a trip of 50 miles , the Volt gets 250 miles per gallon .
But , for a trip of 200 miles , the Volt gets 62.5 mpg .
Based on the EPA decision to rate the Volt at 230 mpg , they are assuming a trip of 51.11 miles .
Left unanswered : what is the EPA mppc ( miles per pound of coal ) for the Volt when running off the electric engine ?
The Chevy web - site notes that the EPA will rate the Volt as using 25 KwH of electricity / 100 miles driven for an average price of $.75 to $ 2.50 per 100 miles driven on electricity .
At $ 2.50 per gallon and 50 mpg , the same 100 miles would cost the driver $ 5 driving on gas .
The UK government already has a " considerable " number of attackers and defenders that make it a " major world power " in cyberwarfare , according to a leading US expert .
Scott Borg of the Washington DC - based US Cyber Consequences Unit , a well - connected research group , told The Register that the British military and security services were on the lookout for talented amateur hackers , but this was just " good recruiting practice " .
Borg 's sober assessment follows excited press reports of an MI5 teenage hacker army and suggestions from the colourful security minister Lord West that a cadre of " naughty boys " could be hired to defend UK networks .
In fact , the UK 's first national cyber security strategy , launched in June , mostly involves reorganisation of existing capabilities .
GCHQ , the government 's 5,000 - strong electronic spy station in Cheltenham , will now house the new Cyber Security Operations Centre to coordinate efforts .
Borg said : " When it comes to cyber warfare , the UK is clearly a major world power . "
However , he added , as more countries develop cyber war capabilities , recruiters will need to adapt .
" The British government will need a steady stream of new talent and new ideas to maintain the UK 's status in this rapidly changing field .
It will not be able to do this if it relies exclusively on conventional recruitment techniques .
" Information technology remains an area where many of the most talented and innovative people have extremely unconventional backgrounds .
" Among the top cyber security experts I personally know , there are people who are or have been punk rockers , special operations soldiers , goths with lots of piercings , motorcycle gang members , ageing flower children , serious athletes , total societal drop - outs and ultra-nerds . "
He said there are early signs government security authorities are now recognising the value of an unconventional CV .
While cyber warfare isssues have historically enjoyed a higher profile in Washington than in Whitehall , Borg said the British had better appreciation of their shortcomings .
" One special virtue of British politicians and senior civil servants , when it comes to cyber security , is that they seem more aware of how much they do n't know than their American counterparts , " he said . ®

Have you ever wanted to make your MacBook or MacBook Pro ’s keyboard lights dance to the music you are listening to ?
Has the thought never crossed your mind ?
Well me neither , but once I saw someone using this iTunes plugin on their MacBook Pro I was instantly hooked on the novelty .
iSpazz is the name of the iTunes Visualizer Plugin and it works exactly as advertised , the keyboard lights will flash in sync to the music you ’re listening to !
It also has a feature to allow the screen ’s backlight to flash too , but that just about sent me into a seizure like a bad Japanese cartoon so I ’ll opt just for the keyboard lights .
File this one under the ‘ cool useless eye candy ’ category !
Download the iSpazz iTunes plugin and drop it in ~/ Library / iTunes / iTunes Plug-ins / and from there you can select it as a visualizer option within iTunes .

A few days ago on this site , John Allsopp argued passionately that HTML 5 is a mess .
In response to HTML 5 activity leader Ian Hickson ’s comment here that , “ We do n’t need to predict the future .
When the future comes , we can just fix HTML again , ” Allsopp said “ This is the only shot for a generation ” to get the next version of markup right .
Now Bruce Lawson explains just why HTML 5 is “ several different kind of messes : ”
It ’s a mess , Lawson says , because the process is a mess .
The process is a mess , he claims , because “ [ s ] pecifying HTML 5 is probably the most open process the W3C has ever had , ” and when you throw open the windows and doors to let in the fresh air of community opinion , you also invite sub - groups with different agendas to create competing variant specs .
Lawson lists and links to the various groups and their concerns .
It ’s a “ spec mess , ” Lawson continues , citing complaints by Allsopp and Matt Wilcox that many elements suffer from imprecise or ambiguous specification or from seemingly needless restrictions .
( Methinks ambiguities can be resolved , and needless restrictions lifted , if the Working Group is open to honest , accurate community feedback .
Lawson tells how to contact the Working Group to express your concerns . )
Most importantly , Lawson explains , HTML 5 is a backward compatibility mess because it builds on HTML 4 :
[ I ] f you were building a mark - up language from scratch you would include elements like footer , header and nav ( actually , HTML 2 had a menu element for navigation that was deprecated in 4.01 ) .
You probably would n’t have loads of computer science oriented elements like kbd , var , samp in preference to the structural elements that people “ fake ” with classes .
Things like tabindex would n’t be there , as we all know that if you use properly structured code you do n’t need to change the tab order , and accesskey would n’t make it because it ’s undiscoverable to a user and may conflict with assistive technology .
Accessibility would have been part of the design rather than bolted on .
But we know that now ; we did n’t know that then .
And HTML 5 aims to be compatible with legacy browsers and legacy pages . …
There was a cartoon in the ancient satirical magazine Punch showing a city slicker asking an old rural gentleman for directions to his destination .
The rustic says “ To get there , I would n’t start from here ” .
That ’s where we are with HTML .
If we were designing a spec from scratch , it would look much like XHTML 2 , which I described elsewhere as “ a beautiful specification of philosophical purity that had absolutely no resemblance to the real world ” , and which was aborted by the W3C last week .
Damned if you do
The third point is Lawson ’s key insight , for it illuminates the dilemma faced by HTML 5 or any other honest effort to move markup forward .
Neither semantic purity nor fault - tolerance will do , and neither approach can hope to satisfy all of today ’s developers .
A markup based on what we now know , and can now do thanks to CSS ’s power to disconnect source order from viewing experience , will be semantic and accessible , but it will not be backward compatible .
That was precisely the problem with XHTML 2 , and it ’s why most people who build websites for a living , if they knew enough to pay attention to XHTML 2 , soon changed the channel .
XHTML 2 was conceived as an effort to start over and get it right .
And this doomed it , because right - wing Nativists will speak Esperanto before developers adopt a markup language that breaks all existing websites .
It did n’t take a Mark Pilgrim to see that XHTML 2 was a dead - end that would eventually terminate XHTML activity ( although Mr Pilgrim was the first developer I know to raise this point , and he certainly looks prescient in hindsight ) .
It was in reaction to XHTML 2’s otherworldliness that the HTML 5 activity began , and if XHTML suffered from detachment from reality , HTML 5 is too real .
It accepts sloppiness many of us have learned to do without ( thereby indirectly and inadvertently encouraging those who do n’t develop with standards and accessibility in mind not to learn about these things ) .
It is a hodgepodge of semantics and tag soup , of good and bad markup practices .
It embraces ideas that logically cancel each other out .
It does this in the name of realism , and it is as admirable and logical for so doing as XHTML 2 was admirable and logical in its purity .
Neither ethereal purity nor benign tolerance seems right , so what ’s a spec developer to do ?
They ’re damned either way — which almost suggests that the web will be built with XHTML 1.0 and HTML 4.01 forever .
Most importantly for our purposes , what are we to do ?
Forward , compatibly
As the conversation about HTML 5 and XHTML has played out this week , I ’ve felt like Regan in The Exorcist , my head snapping around in 360 degree arcs as one great comment cancels out another .
In a private Basecamp discussion a friend said ,
Maybe I ’m just confused by all the competing viewpoints , but the twisted knots of claim and counterclaim are getting borderline Lovecraftian in shape .
Another said ,
[ I ] did n’t realize that WHATWG and the W3C ’s HTML WG were in fact two separate bodies , working in parallel on what effectively amounts to two different specs [ 1 , 2 — the entire thread is actually worth reading ] .
So as far as I can tell , if Ian Hickson removes something from the WHATWG spec , the HTML WG can apparently reinsert it , and vice versa .
[ T ] his … seems impossibly broken .
( I originally used a different word here , but , well , propriety and all that . )
Such conversations are taking place in rooms and chatrooms everywhere .
The man in charge of HTML 5 appears confident in its rightness .
His adherents proclaim a new era of loaves and fishes before the oven has even finished preheating .
His articulate critics convey a palpable feeling of crisis .
All our hopes now hang on one little Hobbit .
What do we do ?
As confused as I have continually felt while surfing this whirlwind , I have never stopped being certain of two things :
XHTML 1.0 — and for that matter , HTML 4.01 — will continue to work long after I and my websites are gone .
For the web ’s present and for any future you or I are likely to see , there is no reason to stop using these languages to craft lean , semantic markup .
The combination of CSS , JavaScript , and XHTML 1.0/ HTML 4.01 is here to stay , and while the web 10 years from now may offer features not supported by this combination of technologies , we need not fear that these technologies or sites built on them will go away in the decades to come .
That said , the creation of a new markup language concerns us all , and an informed community will only help the framers of HTML 5 navigate the sharp rocks of tricky shoals .
Whether we influence HTML 5 greatly or not at all , it behooves us to learn as much as we can , and to practice using it on real websites .

Teenager invents £ 23 solar panel that could be solution to developing world 's energy needs ... made from human hair
A new type of solar panel using human hair could provide the world with cheap , green electricity , believes its teenage inventor .
Milan Karki , 18 , who comes from a village in rural Nepal , believes he has found the solution to the developing world 's energy needs .
The young inventor says hair is easy to use as a conductor in solar panels and could revolutionise renewable energy .
Hair - raising : Science student Milan Karki with his innovative solar panel made with human hair while a friend holds a light bulb above his head
' First I wanted to provide electricity for my home , then my village .
Now I am thinking for the whole world , ' said Milan , who attends school in the capital , Kathmandu .
The hair replaces silicon , a pricey component typically used in solar panels , and means the panels can be produced at a low cost for those with no access to power , he explained .
In Nepal , one of the poorest countries in the world , many rural areas lack access to electricity and even in areas connected to power lines , users face shortages of up to 16 hours a day .
Milan and four classmates initially made the solar panel as an experiment but the teens are convinced it has wide applicability and commercial viability .
Close shave : Milan ( second from right ) demonstrates his solar panel in a tiny barber shop in Kathmandu
' I'm trying to produce commercially and distribute to the districts .
We 've already sent a couple out to the districts to test for feasibility , ' he said .
The solar panel , which produces 9 V ( 18 W ) of energy , costs around £ 23 to make from raw materials .
But if they were mass - produced , Milan says they could be sold for less than half that price , which could make them a quarter of the price of those already on the market .
Melanin , a pigment that gives hair its colour , is light sensitive and also acts as a type of conductor .
Because hair is far cheaper than silicon the appliance is less costly .
Hair today : A detailed shot shows the human hair used as an alternative to silicon
The solar panel can charge a mobile phone or a pack of batteries capable of providing light all evening .
Milan began his quest to create electricity when he was a boy living in Khotang , a remote district of Nepal completely unconnected to electricity .
According to him , villagers were skeptical of his invention at first .
' They believe in superstitions , they do n't believe in science .
But now they believe , ' he said .
Cost effective :
The solar - hair panel is estimated to be four times cheaper than an industrial made solar panel of comparable capacity
He first tried to use water currents hydro power on a small scale , but said the experiment became too expensive .
' I searched for new , other renewable , affordable sources .
People in these places are living the life of the stone age even in the 21st century , ' he said .
Milan , whose hero is the inventor Thomas Eddison , describes himself as lucky because his family could afford for him to receive a proper education while many other villagers are forced to work from an early age .
Most of those from his village are illiterate .
He was originally inspired after reading a book by physicist Stephen Hawking , which discussed ways of creating static energy from hair .
It 's got the power : A digital multimeter shows the voltage generated by the innovative panel
' I realised that Melanin was one of the factors in conversion of energy , ' he said .
Half a kilo of hair can be bought for only 16 p in Nepal and lasts a few months , whereas a pack of batteries would cost 50 p and last a few nights .
People can replace the hair easily themselves , says Milan , meaning his solar panels need little servicing .
Three years after first coming up with the idea , Milan says the idea is more important than ever because of the crucial need for renewable energies in the face of finite power sources and global warming .
' Slowly , natural resources are degrading so it is necessary to think about the future , " he said .
' One day we will be in a great crisis regarding this fuel so it is a good thing to do today .
' This is an easy solution for the crisis we are having today .
We have begun the long walk to save the planet . '
MOSCOW 
With an ambitious new pipeline planned to run along the bed of the Baltic Sea , the Russian natural gas giant Gazprom is driving a political wedge between Eastern and Western Europe .
While the Russian - German pipeline offers clear energy benefits to Western Europe , Central and Eastern European leaders fear it could lead to a new era of gas - leveraged Russian domination of the former Soviet bloc .
With its gas wealth and eyebrow - raising network of personal ties , Russia has divided members of the European Union that have vowed to act collectively to protect their security .
Currently , Russian gas has to be piped through Eastern Europe to reach Western Europe .
If Russia shuts off the gas to pressure a neighbor in the east , it is felt in the more powerful , wealthier countries to the west , where it touches off loud protests .
The new Nord Stream pipeline will change that equation .
By traveling more than 750 miles underwater , from Vyborg , Russia , to Greifswald , Germany , bypassing the former Soviet and satellite states , it will give Russia a separate supply line to the west .
Lingerie for the less endowed FASHION

Shing wants you to know that in a society where bigger is flaunted as better , at least where the bustline is concerned , there are plenty of small - chested women who beg to differ .
Shing 's Lula Lu lingerie in San Mateo specializes in bras whose cups are so small and shallow they are not quite cups , and almost not even saucers .
And yet there is so much demand for sizes from 30AAA to 38A that Shing has done what any entrepreneur would do : failing to find as much as she needed at trade shows , she 's begun designing and selling her own line of lingerie to supplement the 14 lines she stocks .
Shing said that her best - selling size is 34AAA and that many women do not - repeat , do not - want padding .
Are you listening , Hugh Hefner ?
" T - shirt bras are usually heavily padded , if they 're geared toward smaller - busted women , based on the assumption that anyone who is small - busted wants to become big - busted , and that 's really not always the case , " said Shing , 41 and a 36A herself .
" A lot of our customers are happy with their bodies .
They find the bra shopping experience wrong because nothing fits . "
Lula Lu's new line includes plain - Jane , smooth cotton styles in nude and white , coquettish styles in bubblegum pink with white polka dots , and racier styles in black lace with blue or fuchsia satin underneath .
Some have underwires ; bralets do not .
There are corsets , too .
They supplement the national brands she carries : Wacoal petite , L.Z. , Spank , Mary Green and Timpa .
She stocks full cups , demi cups , push - ups , racer backs , sports bras , strapless bras , T - shirt bras and lace bras , as well as underpants , camisoles , pajamas and swimsuits .
The store also carries interchangeable beaded , bejeweled bra straps that are meant to be seen , not hidden ; water - resistant pads for swimsuit tops ; and jewelry by local artisans .
Customers of all ages
Shing 's customers range in age from their late 20s to their 50s .
Many have tried boutiques , chain stores , department stores and online stores , with varying degrees of success .
One customer , Trina Enriquez , 30 , a copy editor in Menlo Park , has purchased two of Shing 's designs .
She notes that fashion magazines and department stores rarely celebrate the small - chested woman .
" When you 've lived for so long without something , you sometimes just become subconsciously resigned to the idea that that something either just does n't exist or is n't for you , until a place like Lula Lu comes along and basically says , ' Um , honey , let me show you what you 've been missing ... , ' " she said in an e-mail .
Shing worked in marketing for the NBA in Hong Kong and in San Francisco as a buyer for Duty Free Stores before opening shop in 2005 .
Store clerks can measure incorrectly .
One customer , she said , was 36AA , but had been told at a department store she was 32B and was urged to buy a bra that did n't fit .
It was squeezing her back so badly that it hurt , the customer said .
" She bought the bra anyway , thinking that was the way it was supposed to be , " Shing said .
Attitude adjustment
Other store clerks tell them they do n't need to wear bras , or send them to the kids ' department .
But some small - busted women want coverage while at work ; others want a little padding for gowns and sexy dresses ; still others do n't want to go braless just because they 're smaller .
" I get a lot of women telling me the bra fitter sighed and said , ' Oh , how sad , ' " Shing said .
" One woman said , ' No , sad is starving children in Africa .
I just need a bra . ' "
" Satisfaction is one thing that definitely keeps me going , " she continued .
" Emotionally , for a lot of women , it cheers them up and makes them feel better . "

A rather presumptuous analogy from a church that taught that black people have dark skin because God is punishing their entire race for being evil .
A church that , for this reason , did n’t permit full membership to blacks until 1978 , and only then after a national campaign beat the crap out of the Mormons for their racism .
Now we ’re to believe that Mormon is the new black .
The anti-Mormon backlash after California voters overturned gay marriage last fall is similar to the intimidation of Southern blacks during the civil rights movement , a high - ranking Mormon says in a speech to be delivered Tuesday .
Elder Dallin H. Oaks refers to gay marriage as an “ alleged civil right ” in remarks prepared for delivery at Brigham Young University - Idaho , a speech church officials describe as a significant commentary on current threats to religious freedom .
In an advance copy provided to The Associated Press , Oaks suggests that atheists and others are seeking to intimidate people of faith and silence their voices in the public square .
The Mormons might have something in common with one group of people during the civil rights era .
But it ’s not the minority that was oppressed by people who tried to impose their own small - minded views on a group of people they did n’t like .
And by the way , does this accusation , that anyone who disagrees with the Mormon church ’s jihad against civil rights is akin to the southern segregationists , apply to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as well ?
After all , earlier today we learned that Senator Reid blasted his own church for their involvement in Prop 8 .
Is Harry Reid now an anti-Mormon bigot too ?
If the Mormons ca n’t handle the repercussions from their own actions , if they can’t face the consequences from their involvement in Prop 8 , their campaign to rip civil rights from gay people , and their ongoing efforts to force Americans to live according to the rules in the Book of Mormon – if Americans are becoming a little bit queasy about the fact that they do n’t like being told how to live their lives by someone else – then perhaps the Mormons should stop sticking their nose where it does n’t belong .
It really is the height of arrogance , and rather un-American to boot , for the Mormons to spend their money freely , in state after state , in an effort to force Americans to live under Mormon law , and then suggest that no one in America is permitted to even disagree with what the Mormons are doing , lest we oppress their efforts to oppress .
Last time I checked , the Mormons had n’t yet succeeded in repealing the US Constitution .

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has been cleared of affray after punching a man in a Merseyside bar .
The England midfielder admitted hitting Marcus McGee , 34 , in the Lounge Inn , Southport , in December last year but denied the charge of affray .
A jury at Liverpool Crown Court agreed with Mr Gerrard 's assertion that he was acting in self - defence .
Speaking after the hearing , the player said he had put it behind him and was looking forward to the season ahead .
Six friends of the 29 - year - old footballer , of Formby , admitted charges connected with the brawl and will be sentenced on 7 August .
Mr Gerrard emerged from court to applause from waiting Liverpool fans and said he was pleased with the verdict .
The verdict is a credible verdict on the full facts of this case , and you walk away from this court with your reputation intact
Judge Henry Globe " I 'm glad to put this case behind me .
I 'm really looking forward to the season ahead and concentrating on football , " he said .
" I 'd like to say a big thank you to my legal team , my friends and family and everyone at Liverpool Football Club for supporting me . "
Members of the jury took just over 70 minutes to find the Reds ' captain not guilty .
Judge Henry Globe told him : " The verdict is a credible verdict on the full facts of this case , and you walk away from this court with your reputation intact .
" You did not start the violence , it was started by the violent elbowing of Marcus McGee in the face by one of your friends John Doran .
Trouble flared at the club in a row over music
Celebration that ended in brawl Steven Gerrard profile " At all times you insisted that you only ever acted in what you believed was reasonable self - defence to what you understandably , albeit you accept mistakenly , believed was an attempted attack upon you by Marcus McGee .
" What at first sight to the casual observer may seem to have been a clear - cut case against you of unlawful violence , has been nowhere near as clear - cut upon careful analysis of the evidence . "
Liverpool manager , Rafa Benitez , who is in Singapore ahead of the team 's game against the national side there on Sunday , said : " We are really pleased .
" He is very important for us and he can now focus just on football .
" We are all pleased at the club and over here at the training camp .
We have been supporting him all the time and were just waiting for the decision .
" Now he can concentrate just on football and hopefully play at the same level as last year . "
Mr Gerrard had been drinking with friends in the early hours of 29 December last year to celebrate Liverpool 's 5 - 1 win over Newcastle United .
CCTV footage from the bar showed the group drinking beer , downing shots and dancing round while chanting football songs .
But the trouble flared at around 0200 GMT when Mr Gerrard wanted to change the music on the CD player , but was refused access by the man holding the control , Marcus McGee .
Pulled away Mr Gerrard told the court he had been trying to ask Mr McGee why he had a problem with him when the businessman " very quickly " got off his bar stool .
He said he " firmly believed " he was about to be punched , and swung out in self - defence .
Mr Gerrard was quickly pulled away by friends and told the court he was " sorry about the whole incident " .
The victim lost a tooth and suffered cuts to his face in the ensuing violence .
Five of Mr Gerrard 's friends admitted affray .
They are Ian Gerrard Smith , 19 , of Hilary Avenue ; John Doran , 29 , of Woodlands Road ; and Paul McGrattan , 31 , of Linden Drive , all Huyton ; and Accrington Stanley footballers Robert Grant , 19 , of Enstone Avenue , Litherland ; and Ian Dunbavin , 28 , of Guildford Road , Southport .
Another friend , John McGrattan , 34 , of Rimmer Avenue , Huyton , admitted threatening behaviour .
The six men are due to be sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court on 7 August .

The most pervasive misinformation underpinning the demonization of the uninsured and the drive to push insurance as the solution has hardly been challenged at all .
Special interests that stand to benefit from reform have been so successful in framing the debate that most people do n't realize they 've been manipulated .
The claim that the uninsured increase the premiums of the insured by $ 922 or $ 1,000 [ senat1 ] is false .
According to the official congressional factsheet , uncompensated care incurred by the uninsured is $ 56 billion [ house1 ] , of which 75 % is paid by government [ house1 ] leaving $ 14 billion , which comes out to $ 70 per privately insured person [ cens1 ] .
The claim that the uninsured cost each of the insured $ 1,000 in total [ obam a1 ] is also false .
$ 56 billion in uninsured uncompensated care [ house1 ] comes out to $ 224 per insured person [ cens1 ] .
This number is a red herring , since it 's unlikely to change much with reform .
By definition it's what they can't afford to pay .
If they can't afford the doctor or hospital , they wo n't be able to pay both that and insurance administrative costs , so it would be subsidized by taxes rather than premiums [ hahca Sec. 243 p135 ] .
Since the cost - shift will still happen , it 's not a valid reason for insurance .
But actually , not only is the $ 56 billion figure most likely wrong , the true number may be zero .
The uninsured have been charged 3 , 4 , 5 , and even 10 times as much as the insured for the same treatment [ critc ] .
For example a provider prices a service at $ 10,000 but cuts a deal with insurers to pay $ 2,500 .
Then an uninsured person walks in and is treated and billed $ 10,000 but can't afford that , ending up paying $ 6,000 .
So the provider profited by $ 6,000 - 2,500 = $ 3,500 from gouging the uninsured but then claims they lost $ 10,000 - 6,000 = $ 4,000 in " uncompensated care " .
The Families USA study that made the $ 922 claim says their data is from asking providers to use insured rates , but gives no indication that any auditing was done to verify they did that , much less whether they did it accurately .
This phenomenon is so prevalent that an analysis of actual payment records - a more authoritative source than the voluntary survey used by Families USA - found that excess revenue doctors made from the uninsured who could pay more than made up for losses from those who could n't [ nber1 ] .
In other words , it may be that not only are the uninsured not costing the insured , but they could be subsidizing the insured .
Moreover , the tax deductibility of insurance only benefits the insured , so the uninsured pay higher taxes , and thus another subsidy .
Many who are uninsured do pay their bills and thus do not impose a burden on anyone .
Forcing them to buy insurance creates a new cost - shift that did n't exist before .
It 's nonsensical and unfair to penalize them for the actions of others they have no control over .
Trying to pin the blame on the uninsured is a clever trick to distract attention from the fact that insurance shifts costs from one group to another on a vastly grander scale .
One half of the population consumes 97 % of healthcare costs ; the other half consumes the remaining 3 % [ haff a2 Exhibit 1 ] .
Thus if everyone is required to pay the same amount through insurance toward the total $ 2.5 trillion healthcare bill , then this constitutes a $ 2.5 x 47 % = $ 1.2 trillion cost - shift from one group to another .
This is 21 times bigger than the alleged $ 56 billion uninsured cost - shift [ house1 ] .
Thus it 's absurd to use cost - shifting as a reason to impose insurance .
If cost - shifting is wrong , then insurance must be outlawed .
The insurance and medical industries have spent millions on this kind of PR to fool us into accepting policies that would give them billions in additional revenue per year .
Another ploy is the line that medical insurance should be required because car insurance is .
But the reason for needing car insurance is that driving can maim or kill others .
Being a living human being is no threat to anyone else , and medical insurance is about what happens to yourself not others , so the analogy is another trick non-sequitur .
It 's unjust to cost - shift through taxes , including the de facto tax of forcing people to buy insurance , because that violates the rights of those who do not subscribe to orthodox medicine .
There are hundreds of alternative healing systems , including indigenous , herbal , ayurvedic , naturopathic , clinical ecology , orthomolecular , Christian Scientist , and faith healers .
It 's unfair to force those who may never use orthodox medicine to pay for what they do not believe in .
It 's much fairer for the cost - shift to be done through provider fees and premiums , so it only affects those who subscribe to the same system of medicine .
Among the uninsured , half of them only incur 1 % of total uninsured healthcare spending [ haff a2 Exhibit 3 ] , so it 's irrational to impose on all uninsured ; to reduce costs , or cost - shifting , only those in the half that account for 99 % of costs are relevant .
Note that this is a more skewed distribution than for the insured - in other words , putting the uninsured into insurance increases the amount of cost - shifting from one group to another - the diametric opposite of what proponents of universal coverage claim as their rationale .
The top 5 % of privately insured healthcare spenders averaged $ 17,871 ; the top 5 % of uninsured averaged $ 6,651 [ haff a2 Exhibit 3 ] .
Since the uninsured are 15 % of the population , this means that there is 85x17871 / 15x6651 = 15 times more cost - saving potential in addressing cost reduction of the sickest insured than going after the sickest uninsured .
This would do more to reduce cost - shifting than targeting the uninsured .
A frequently repeated reason for insurance is the claim that the uninsured do n't get screenings .
This is a fallacy .
The truth is that 65 % of uninsured american women over 40 had a mammogram within the last 5 years , the same rate as women under Canada 's universal health coverage , and uninsured american men had twice as many PSA tests as canadian men [ oneil p21 ] .
This begs the question of whether universal mammogram screening is desirable .
The apparent benefit of mammography disappears when corrected for bias in lead time and in ductal carcinoma in situ which is usually benign , so most would probably have been better off without mammograms anyway , which would have freed the money for something else that provided a greater benefit [ lee ] [ lancet1 ] .
It is often stated that the uninsured do n't get primary care but rely on hospital emergency rooms , the most expensive care of all , so we are told to believe that insuring everyone will cut costs .
But evidently the insured do this much more than the uninsured : the truth is that communities with high levels of uninsured have half the rate of hospital emergency department use per person than communities with few uninsured [ haff a1 ] [ hsch1 ] .
It 's the insured who drive hospital demand .

Dear Friends of Dr. Clark ,
As you probably know by now , Dr. Clark passed away September 3 , 2009 .
She was 80 years old .

New York ( CNN ) --
Authorities have identified a teenager believed to be suffering from amnesia who was found on the streets of New York two weeks ago .
Police say a CNN viewer in Maryland identified the young woman , who mysteriously turned up in Manhattan two weeks ago , claiming to have no memory of her family , her home or even her own name .
The 18 year old whose name is not yet being released , is in the process of being reunited with her family .
They are from Washington state and are on their way to New York , New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said on Saturday .
A photo of the woman , who has been referred to as Jane Doe , was circulated by police and aired on CNN this week .
The viewer in Maryland was familiar with her situation and knew she had been missing from her family earlier this month .
The girl was found in Midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m.
October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter , although the organization said that she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility .
" I just want to know who I am , " the girl said in a statement from the New York City Administration for Children 's Services .
" I want to know who I am and what happened to me . "
According to its
Web site , " Covenant House New York is the nation 's largest adolescent care agency serving homeless , runaway and at - risk youth . "
Nearly 7,000 youths reportedly seek shelter there per year .
A security guard for the shelter noticed the girl walking on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her .
Finding her unresponsive , he called the New York City Police Department .
Police officers interviewed the young woman , but it became clear that she could n't provide authorities with any information about herself .
The police said she was wearing military green camouflage pants , a black shirt and a pair of black sneakers when she was discovered .
The children 's services agency said the girl recently wrote down the name " Amber " and has responded to it on one occasion , but she has no idea whether it is her true name .
On another occasion she is said to have recalled certain words , which turned out to be an excerpt from the fantasy novel " Fool 's Fate " by Robin Hobb .
The girl also is apparently writing a fantasy story of her own that features a heroine named Rian , " who 's been raised by the commander of the guard post on the edge of a fantasy kingdom , " the young woman said .
Judging from her poor dental hygiene , said Lt. Christopher Zimmerman , she appeared to have been living on the streets for some time .
Evan Buxbaum , Susan Candiotti and Vanessa Juarez contributed to the report .

A German man mooning at railway staff in a departing train got his trousers caught in a carriage door and ended up being dragged half - naked along the platform , out of the station and onto the tracks .
The 22 - year - old journalism student shoved his backside against the window of a low - slung double - decker train when staff forced him off in Lauenbrueck for travelling without a ticket , a spokesman for police in the northern city of Bremen said .
" It 's a miracle he was n't badly hurt , " the spokesman said .
" This sort of thing can end up killing you . "
Instead , dangling by his trousers , the man got pulled along for about 200 metres , all the while managing to keep his legs away from the wheels of the train .
The ordeal ended when a passenger pulled the emergency brake .
Rescue services were called in , causing rail services between Bremen and Hamburg to be suspended for more than an hour , delaying 23 trains .
The man - unharmed except for cuts and bruises - now faces charges of dangerous interference in rail transport , insulting the train staff , and may face a sizeable compensation claim for the delays he caused , police said .
" He was full of remorse when I talked to him , " the spokesman said .
" And he advised others not to try the same thing . "

With most species of tigers about to become extinct , cat breeders are trying to help their cause by creating a tiny tiger replica , called Toyger .
Jennifer Santee has always had a thing for tigers and dreamed of having one as a pet .
But knowing that was n’t ever going to happen , she decided to make a tiger of her own , one that she could keep in her house .
Together with a small group of cat breeders , she managed to create the Toyger ( for toy tiger ) , a breed designed “ specifically to preserve the beauty of an exotic animal ” .
Although Toygers do n’t actually have any tiger genes , their rusty color and dark stripes closely resemble those of the Bengal tiger .
But they are friendly and playful animals that will go for walks , play fetch and come when they are called .
Unlike the Margay , they are perfect human companions .
Santee says 25 breeders all around the world are working on perfecting the Toyger breed , to make the cats resemble tigers even more .
The new species is already in demand and , although each specimen costs over $ 3,000 , they have all been sold .
Part of the profits go towards the conservation of wild tigers , the inspiration behind the Toygers .
The breeder estimates will truly be tiger replicas by 2010 , when the last tigers will disappear from zoos .

The US secretary of state has said that a militant attack on Pakistan 's army HQ is evidence of an increasing threat against the authority of the state .
Speaking in London , Hillary Clinton said that despite the attack , the US remained confident about Pakistan 's control over its nuclear weapons .
The attack , which began on Saturday and turned into a siege , ended hours ago after hostages were released .
Correspondents say the attack is highly embarrassing for Pakistan 's leaders .
" Yesterday was another reminder that extremists ... are increasingly threatening the authority of the state , but we see no evidence they are going to take over the state , " Mrs Clinton said .
Security forces freed more than 40 hostages at the Rawalpindi base " We have confidence in the Pakistani government and military 's control over its nuclear weapons , " she added .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Pakistan faced a " mortal threat " , but there was no risk of its nuclear weapons falling into terrorist hands .
The two officials also stressed other shared aspects of foreign policy : Mrs Clinton warned that the international community would not wait " indefinitely " for Tehran to meet its obligations on its nuclear programme , while Mr Miliband said Iran would never have a better opportunity to establish normal ties with the rest of the world
The US secretary of state said Washington was committed to implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and a " lasting peace that brings the benefits of peace to the people " .
She said Republican dissidents were " out of step " with the peace process
Mrs Clinton said that their joint resolve in the fight against the Taliban was " strong and clear " , and that they were determined to work with the new Afghan government Mrs Clinton also held talks with UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown , before flying to Dublin for the next stage of her tour .
Major operation
On Sunday morning Pakistani security forces freed more than 40 hostages held at the base , in the city of Rawalpindi .
Military officials said three hostages and two soldiers died in the operation along with at least four militants .
Four militants and six soldiers died in the initial attack .
The sound of blasts and gunfire rang out as Pakistani special forces entered the compound for the pre-dawn raid .
Army spokesman Maj Gen Athar Abbas said the forces had met resistance in what he described as a " very skilled " operation .
They found the hostages being held in a room " with a terrorist who was wearing a suicide jacket " , he said .
Gen Abbas said the commandos had " acted promptly " and shot the suspected hostage taker " before he could pull the trigger " .
The attack came as the army was preparing for a major operation against the Taliban , which officials say have claimed responsibility .
The Taliban had been threatening to carry out attacks unless operations against it were stopped .

asdf - install is a very useful package manager for lisp code .
like rubygems .
The idea is that you load up your lisp REPL , and then punch in ( asdf - install : install ' some - package ) to install whatever lisp library you might want .
It ’s then fetched from the internet , compiled and loaded into your running lisp .
peachy .
I ’m not sure about the specifics , but I think asdf - install looks for the software you ’re trying to find on cliki , which is a public lisp wiki to which anyone can edit , or upload files .
asdf - install is smart about this sort of thing though , it expects any software you download from the internet to have an accompanying signature file .
This means the author of the software package needs to sign it with his or her private key and put the signature in the same place as the package .
asdf - install will then check that :
a ) you have that author ’s public key
b ) you trust the key comes from who it says it does
c ) you have given asdf - install permission to install software from that author
This is all well and good .
Except it ’s a bit of a headache in practice , and if the user so chooses , asdf - install will allow you to bypass these security checks .
My goal for this post was to run through an install without ever using the dubious 0 : [ SKIP - GPG - CHECK ]
Do n't check GPG signature for this package restart .
Before I get in too deep , these following 3 links were a tremendous help in figuring what the hell was going on .
I love Common Lisp , but the learning curve is very , very steep .
I ’ve been struggling off and on with these issues for 3 years and these pages go into a bit more depth than I do here :
http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf-install/tutorial/install.html
http://www.cliki.net/ASDF-Install%20and%20GPG
http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/pgp-validating.html
First thing I do is create my own public / private keypair :
gpg -- gen-key
and download and import the cliki common - lisp .
net developer keyring , which has the public keys of all developers publishing software on cliki :
wget http://common-lisp.net/keyring.asc gpg -- import keyring.asc
Next , start up a fresh sbcl 1.0.30 image :
$ sbcl * ( require ' asdf - install ) * ( asdf- install : install ' drakma )
and …we run into our first problem , GPG warns that the key id 0x595FF045057958C6 ( Dr. Edmund Weitz ) is not fully trusted .
Simple enough to fix :
gpg -- edit edi@weitz.de > lsign > save
and …it blows up again , saying Dr. Edmund Weitz ( key id 595FF045057958C6 ) is not on your package supplier list .
This time , the restart is fine , as asdf - install does n’t recommend editing the package suppliers list by hand , so choose the 0 : [ ADD - KEY ]
Add to package supplier list restart .
Next up , cl+ssl , a dependency of drakma , does n’t have a signature file to be found .
You can sneak a peak at the project ’s releases here : http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-plus-ssl/download/
and see that although some of the older ones have signature files , there is , indeed , no signature for the latest release that asdf - install is trying to install .
So download to your local machine , crack it open and take a quick look at the source , to be sure that it ’s not malicious software .
Then :
( asdf-install:install " cl+ssl.tar.gz " )
Except even though you are now installing from a local file and asdf - install wo n’t check for a signature , the installation blows up again , because it depends on the trivial - gray - streams package , which it tries to fetch from the internet and is also missing a signature file .
In fact , trivial - gray streams can be downloaded from the same directory as cl+ssl , and you can see for yourself that trivial - gray - streams does n’t have a signature file either .
So we download , peek inside and repeat the local asdf - install for trivial - gray - streams , then cl+ssl :
( asdf-install:install " trivial - gray - streams.tar.gz " ) ( asdf-install: install " cl+ssl.tar.gz " )
This should result in stopping to alert you that the cffi and rt library authors are not trusted .
Sign them with gpg , then hit the restarts to add them to the package suppliers list .
And things finally finish .
So that ’s one kind of problem .
Going through the process with cl- ppcre presents a somewhat different problem .
( asdf - install : install ' cl - ppcre )
When checking the signature of cl-unicode , you get the error
No key found for key id 0x595FF045057958C6 .
This is a misleading error message .
We know it ’s not true , since that ’s Edi Weitz ’s key and we ’ve successfully installed software signed by him before .
So , quit out of sbcl and let ’s check that signature by hand :
wget http://weitz.de/files/cl-unicode.tar.gz wget http://weitz.de/files/cl-unicode.tar.gz.asc gpg cl-unicode.tar.gz.asc
and we see :
gpg : Signature made Wed 23 Jul 2008 05:28:42 PM
CDT using DSA key ID 057958C6 gpg : BAD signature from " Dr. Edmund Weitz < edi@weitz.de > "
Dun dun duunnn .
Here ’s an example of exactly why asdf - install does these security checks .
The signature provided could n’t have come from the file we were about to download , nevermind the fact that asdf - install does a terrible job of letting us know this .
However , I have trouble believing this is malicious code since it did come from Edi Weitz ’s server ( which could have been hacked ) .
Since we ’ve downloaded the tarball to check it ’s signature anyway , we can take a look inside and see that it ’s not terribly obviously malicious .
So the source was probably modified and just was n’t re-signed , so we go through the procedure to install from a local file .
So there you have a rather long - winded tour of just about everything that could go wrong when installing lisp code from wild west internet wikis .
asdf - install needs some polish for sure and the packaging practices of the software on common - lisp .
net is lacking .
I hear clbuild is a good alternative , but I do n’t know much about it .
I ’d like to look into it and try this same excercise with it and post back .
This is from the congressman who said this about Republicans and health care , " " Do n't Get Sick !
And if You Do Get Sick , Die Quickly ! " "
Last night here in this chamber I gave a speech .
I ’m not going to recount every single thing that I said , but I will point out that immediately after that speech , several Republicans asked me to apologize .
Well , I would like to apologize .
I would like to apologize to the dead .
And here ’s why .
According to this study , " Health Insurance and Mortality in U.S. Adults " which was published two weeks ago , 44,789 Americans die every year because they have no health insurance .
That ’s right , 44,789 Americans die every year , according to this Harvard study called " Health Insurance and Mortality in U.S. Adults . "
You can see it by going to our website , grayson.house.gov .
That is more than ten times the number of Americans who have died in the war in Iraq .
It ’s more than ten times the number of Americans who died in 9/11 .
But that was just once : this is every single year .
That ’s right : every single year .
Take a look at this .
Read it and weep .
And I mean that – read it and weep because of all these Americans who are dying because they do n’t have health insurance .
Now I think we should do something about that , and the Democratic healthcare plan does do something about that .
It makes healthcare affordable for those who ca n’t afford insurance , and it saves these peoples ’ lives .
Let ’s remember that we should care about people even after they ’re born .
So I call upon the Democratic members of the House , I call upon the Republican members of the House , I call upon all of us to do our jobs for the sake of America – for the sake of those dying people and their families .
I apologize to the dead and their families that we have n’t voted sooner to end this holocaust in America .
The Federal Reserve Banks are broken up into 12 regional banks across the country by geographic location .
Some excellent data has been provided from certain divisions including the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank .
Yet as we have found with the over 8,000 FDIC insured banks , the real power is held by roughly 100 banks .
When we examine the actual assets the Fed currently holds , the only one powerful regional bank of all the 12 is the New York Fed .
The Federal Reserve Banks are divided up into 12 regional banks with 25 branches .
These institutions supposedly monitor the economy and financial institutions which should make you question how this massive recession occurred .
If there goal is to monitor then clearly someone dropped the ball .
First , let us examine how the Fed is divided :
Source : Wikipedia
Now the above breakdown seems rather fair to the untrained eye .
The Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury are designed to give this fair and balanced layout .
Yet if we look at the assets held by individual regional Federal Reserve Banks we clearly see where the power is held :
Without question , it is clear that only one of the 12 Regional Banks actually holds the powerbase of the Federal Reserve System .
In fact , all other 11 divisions can disappear and the Fed would still hold the vast majority of its current assets .
The New York Fed virtually dominates the entire system .
Now why is this problematic ?
The issues of many of the other regional areas are largely lost in the pursuit to appease Wall Street .
You need to remember that what is called “ assets ” on the Fed books is largely toxic asset swaps given to participating member banks .
We really have no idea the quality of the assets on the books at the New York Fed because we have yet to audit the $ 2 trillion that the public is now fighting to reveal .
The Fed is fighting back because it realizes that once the data is released , the public is going to have to contend with a major bait and switch .
While the Fed is giving out high quality goods to banks the banks in turn are off loading toxic debt on the books of the Fed .
And the balance sheet is not as clear as it would appear :
$ 2.1 trillion is on the balance sheet at the Fed Banks and you would think that by looking at the above , things are pretty clear .
They are not .
Because in reality , the Fed can be giving out liquid clean paper in U.S. Treasuries while holding massive amounts of toxic mortgages at face value .
When we look at some of the notes for above , you can understand why an audit is vital :
“ 1. Includes securities lent to dealers under the overnight and term securities lending facilities ; refer to table 1A .
2 . Face value of the securities .
3. Compensation that adjusts for the effect of inflation on the original face value of inflation - indexed securities .
4. Guaranteed by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and Ginnie Mae. Current face value of the securities , which is the remaining principal balance of the underlying mortgages .
5. Cash value of agreements . ”
Face value .
We should all know by now that anything with “ face value ” and the current housing market should be taken with a grain of salt .
Now why is the New York Fed the biggest of the entire bunch ?
Just ask yourself which central Regional Bank of the Fed is closest to Wall Street and all the investment banks that converted Wall Street into a casino .
When you break the assets out , this is why Wall Street is rallying while Main Street is dealing with over 26 million unemployed and underemployed Americans .
According to Wall Street and the 1 mega powerful New York Fed , everything is looking dandy now .
We may have too big to fail with the large banks but what about too big of a central bank ?
I am certain that many of the regional Fed divisions would have something to say about best protecting their own regional interests .
Why is one region that much more dominant than others ?
If you look at the U.S. Treasury it looks like Wall Street is a revolving door for a certain crew .
Timothy Geithner was former president of the New York Fed and Henry Paulson was a former CEO of Goldman Sachs .
They know banking ( the east coast variety ) .
So while things may appear to look better for Wall Street , average Americans are seeing the middle class dream evaporate .
The Fed is merely serving its banking masters .
When push comes to shove , if you look at the details of the Fed and their actions their main mission is to protect the banking sector , not the American public .
That is the unsettling myth floating around .
I think many Americans are now waking up to this with the majority of Americans favoring an audit of the Fed .
Since the Fed is risking the value of the U.S. dollar and is using tax money to back the system , the public does have a right to know what is being put up as collateral .
There is a false dichotomy that if we did n’t give the Fed and Wall Street everything it asked for then we would be worse off .
This is simply not true .
We had multiple roads to follow at the heart of the crisis .
The Fed chose to protect the banks and throw the average American under the bus with the U.S. dollar .
It also decided to ignore the trillions in toxic debt , much of it still sitting on the balance sheet of banks .
What we realize with the New York Fed is during economic panic , power starts to concentrate in fewer and fewer hands .
This occurred during the Great Depression .
This time it is a wealth transfer from the middle class to the banking elite .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are designed to protect the banking and financial sectors of the economy .
To think otherwise is to ignore the facts .

You would normally find a story about one of our favourite apps on App Friday but today we uncovered something rather disturbing .
At 8 am this morning we received an email from Atomic Antelope , a UK - based iPhone app company , asking us if we had heard about iPhone app name squatting ( disclosure : one of the Atomic Antelope developers is a personal friend of ours ) .
Having spent months developing an app called ‘ Twitch ’ , when it came to Atomic Antelope registering the app ’s name , it could n’t .
Someone else had registered the name ‘ Twitch ’ but when Atomic Antelope looked to see if it could find it on the app store , it could n’t .
Worse still , unlike domain names , Atomic Antelope had no way of contacting the person who had registered the name .
From the Atomic Antelope site : “ It turns out that squatters have moved into the app store .
They ’re worse than domain name squatters though , because you ca n’t even enter into negotiation with them .
You do n’t know who they are , or where they are .
They take advantage of the fact that a developer can pretend to submit an app , but abandon their submission at the last moment , avoiding the need to actually create an application , but keeping hold of the app ’s name .
In limbo .
Forever . ”
We are not saying that whoever registered the ‘ Twitch ’ app name is an underhanded squatter , we are just using Atomic Antelope ’s experience to highlight that squatting is possible .
Surely , tonnes of tech sites would have picked up on this issue , and yet when we checked to see if we could find any previous stories about it , we did n’t find much .
In fact , most of the information we found online was from other annoyed developers who had encountered the same issue .
Justin Williams explains on his blog , “ What I ’ve learned from this ordeal is that iTunes Connect allows you to partially register your application name at any time during the development process .
As long as you enter the name and fill in all the relevant fields with any sort of data , you can stake your claim on any given name .
The key is the “ Upload binary later ” field . ”
JMathews highlights why app name squatting not only promotes developers to squat but it also does n’t allow for negotiation , “ This realization has lead me to grab dozens and dozens of good sounding applications names .
Especially the ones for the two or three dozen application ideas we ’ve kicked around .
The problem with name squatting is that there is no visibility , the squatters , myself included , ca n’t be propositioned for the access to the names . ”
So there you have it , it seems that the Apple iPhone app store is open to abuse from app name squatters and encourages developers to squat in fear of losing out .
We have sent an email to Apple asking for a comment and are awaiting a reply .
We hope this system is changed soon , otherwise iPhone developers will find it difficult to get good names for their apps .
This one ’s on Pete .
The USC players trudged away with shoulders hunched against a chilly wind and obscene screams , but it was n’t about them .
The Washington players and fans filled the field with twirling , bouncing , purple - stained glee , but it also was n’t about them .
This one ’s on Pete .

For several long minutes after USC ’s 16 - 13 loss to Washington on Saturday , Trojans Coach Pete Carroll stood at the edge of the Husky Stadium tunnel , staring ashen - faced back into the swarming mob as if peering into the smoking wreckage of a car he totaled .
Which he did .
A luxury car .
Smashed it to bits .
“ It goes right to me , ” he said later .
Best call he made all day .
Advertisement
“ I ’m not doing a good enough job making points on how we win , ” he said .
Not nearly .
“ It starts right with me and this is where it stops , right here , ” he said .
Preaching to the choir .
Advertisement
After another one of those avoidable upset losses that now threaten to overtake his sparkling resume like a giant mustard stain , Carroll ’s accountability was admirable .
Everything else he did -- or did n’t do -- plain stunk .
The Trojans lost to a 21 - point underdog after leading by 10 points after two possessions .
The Trojans lost to a team with a rookie head coach that had just finished losing 15 straight games .
Advertisement
The Trojans lost their focus , their common sense and their cool in a game that seemed to strip Carroll of even his suntan .
“ It ’s amazing , just amazing , ” said Huskies linebacker Donald Butler .
Do n’t blame this on the fact that USC was playing without starting quarterback Matt Barkley , because it still out - gained Washington .
Do n’t blame this on a defense that was missing star Taylor Mays , because it still held Washington to barely 200 yards before its final drive .
Advertisement
Like the man said , blame it on Pete .
It has been written here for several years that Carroll is the best coach in college football , but for several hours Saturday he was inexplicably out - coached by a former pupil , Steve Sarkisian , while allowing his team to be outplayed by a former national joke .
Just two weeks ago , Washington had the nation ’s worst losing streak .
Today , that title belongs to the man who has at least one national - title costing egg laid per season in each of the last four years , from UCLA to Stanford to Oregon State to this .
This was bad .
This was really bad .
This was an unprepared USC team racking up nearly as many penalty yards ( 75 ) as passing yards ( 110 ) , with three times as many turnovers as touchdowns , with zero third - down conversions in 10 attempts , and with no clue during a possible game - changing drive .
Advertisement
End of the first half , Trojans on the Washington 29 - yard line , less than 20 seconds left , no timeouts , and what do they do ?
They run the ball .
They run the ball ?
Stanley Havili is tackled for a loss , the clock keeps ticking , and a 47 - yard field - goal attempt occurs after time expires .
The kick , by the way , was good .
“ It was hard to get that done in that time frame , ” said Carroll , shaking his head .
Advertisement
It was just one horrible call in a game full of them .
Offensively , the lack of confidence shown backup quarterback Aaron Corp by the Barkley - enamored coaching staff allowed the Huskies to load up the defensive line and finally stop a Trojans attack that gained 111 yards on the first two possessions .
When asked when he was told he was starting , Corp said , “ They never really did . ”
Carroll is famous for tapping into the collegian psyche and endorsing each week ’s starting quarterback as the team leader , but he never really told the kid he was even starting ?
Advertisement
Corp played as tentatively as the expectations , forcing passes that were uncharacteristic of the guy who won this job last spring .
Just as tentative was the defense , particularly a linebacker group that has struggled to replace last year ’s future pros .
Witness the Huskies ’ game - winning drive , when Jake Locker beat the Trojans with two long passes on plays that were either broken or drawn up on the sidelines .
“ Hard work beats athleticism any day , ” said Joe McKnight , who ran great but who also , again , fumbled , this time maybe costing the Trojans a touchdown at the end of a long run , USC eventually settling for a field goal .
Advertisement
Oh , yeah , Stafon Johnson and Stanley Havili lost fumbles deep in Washington territory , the same place Corp threw an interception .
“ This was all my fault , ” said Johnson , who will have to stand in line .
Hard work beats Hollywood too , and the Trojans were all that , playing up to the ugliest of stereotypes , the image that never bothers Carroll as long as they win .
It should bother him now .
Advertisement
In the second quarter , a Washington field - goal drive was kept alive by a late hit on Locker by Everson Griffen , one of several cheap - shot penalties that hurt the Trojans .
Then there was this behavior on one of the game ’s final plays , when the Trojans ’ Luthur Brown tackled Chris Polk after a four - yard run , then jumped up and danced around as if he had just won a heavyweight fight .
Somebody should have reminded him that the Huskies had just stuffed the ball 65 yards down USC ’s throat .
On the next play , Erik Folk kicked a 22 - yard , game - winning field goal .
“ Right now , we ’ve got a long way to go , ” Carroll said .
Advertisement
The path got longer afterward , when several USC players were seen loudly examining stat sheets in the locker room , never a good sign after a team loss .
I asked Havili what he was feeling , and McKnight became angry .
“ No disrespect intended , but what kind of question is that ? ” he said .
“ We just lost a game , how do you think we feel ? ”
We know how Carroll feels , which is exactly how he should feel .

Everyone else , I guess we ’ll find out .

The number of uninsured U.S. residents has grown to over 45 million ( although this number includes illegal immigrants , etc. ) .
Health care has become increasingly unaffordable for businesses and individuals .
We can eliminate wasteful inefficiencies such as duplicate paper work , claim approval , insurance submission , etc .
We can develop a centralized national database which makes diagnosis and treatment easier for doctors .
Medical professionals can concentrate on healing the patient rather than on insurance procedures , malpractice liability , etc .
Free medical services would encourage patients to practice preventive medicine and inquire about problems early when treatment will be light ; currently , patients often avoid physicals and other preventive measures because of the costs .
People will have an easier time starting their own business or working part - time if health insurance is covered .
Patients with pre-existing conditions can still get health coverage .
There is n't a single government agency or division that runs efficiently ; do we really want an organization that developed the U.S. Tax Code handling something as complex as health care ?
" Free " health care is n't really free since we must pay for it with taxes ; expenses for health care would have to be paid for with higher taxes or spending cuts in other areas such as defense , education , etc .
Profit motives , competition , and individual ingenuity have always led to greater cost control and effectiveness .
Government - controlled health care would lead to a decrease in patient flexibility .
The health - care industry likely will become infused with the same kind of corruption , back - room dealing , and special - interest - dominated sleaze that is already prevalent in other areas of government .
Patients are n't likely to curb their drug costs and doctor visits if health care is free ; thus , total costs will be several times what they are now .
Just because Americans are uninsured does n't mean they can't receive health care ; nonprofits and government - run hospitals provide services to those who do n't have insurance , and it is illegal to refuse emergency medical service because of a lack of insurance .
Government - mandated procedures will likely reduce doctor flexibility and lead to poor patient care .
Healthy people who take care of themselves will have to pay for the burden of those who smoke , are obese , etc .
In an effort to cut costs , price & salary controls on drugs , medical equipment , and medical services are likely to be put in place , meaning there is less incentive to pursue medical - related research , development , and investment , nor pursue medical careers in general .
A long , painful transition will have to take place involving lost insurance industry jobs , business closures , and new patient record creation .
Loss of private practice options and possible reduced pay may dissuade many would - be doctors from pursuing the profession .
Malpractice lawsuit costs , which are already sky - high , could further explode since universal care may expose the government to legal liability , and the possibility to sue someone with deep pockets usually invites more lawsuits .
Government is more likely to pass additional restrictions or increase taxes on smoking , fast food , etc. , leading to a further loss of personal freedoms .
Patient confidentiality is likely to be compromised since centralized health information will likely be maintained by the government .
Health care equipment , drugs , and services may end up being rationed by the government .
In other words , politics , lifestyle of patients , and philosophical differences of those in power , could determine who gets what .
Patients may be subjected to extremely long waits for treatment .
Like social security , any government benefit eventually is taken as a " right " by the public , meaning that it 's politically near impossible to remove or curtail it later on when costs get out of control .
Who ever would have thought that on a planet covered in ice humanity would find the most ornery group of insects this side of the galaxy ?
This time , someone has left the planet out to thaw and the bugs have been let loose .
Or something .
But enough of the story .
If you played the first game then you know this is the last reason to play this game .
For those wondering why you play it at all – I hate you .
The previous title might not have been deep , fair , or even balanced in terms of combat , ( let ’s forget about the online for n0w ) but deep down you know it was fun .
Multiply whatever level of fun you had with the last game by four because that ’s exactly where this one is headed .
We take a look at the online co-op demo on Xbox Live and give a run down on what you can expect from Starship Troopers Hoth Edition .
Reiner Wolfcastle : “ That ’s the joke . ”
I loved the first game ’s demo to bits .
Granted , this was back in mid 2006 when there was jack squat to play on the Xbox 360 , and game demos on Xbox Live was a rare treat .
Still , I loved it .
It was n’t so much the infantry controls that hooked me , but the being able to take down these awesome foes in Vital Suit ( big mech ) or sticking it out with your shotgun and assault rifle .
Naturally the VS was always the most fun .
But having a large Akrid ambush you just as soon as you ’d gotten settled having to scurry to your mech was an adrenaline rush .
That few seconds it took to power up gave you all the time you needed to figure out how best to take it down .
Sure the combat was n’t deep – the weak points glowed !
But it was fun regardless .
Each encounter ’s experience heightened all the more by the incredible graphics .
The original Lost Planet was the first game to make me love Capcom ’s graphics engine .
Sorry Dead Rising , I liked you too , but the explosions in LP were killer .
Now seeing where I come from on the first you can better gauge my impressions of the latest venture into planet E.D.N. III .
Without hesitation I rounded up a few buddies and stepped directly into the online co-op mode .
From there on it was a little jarring getting used to everything again , but after a few minutes I got the hang of things .
I was unprepared for how challenging the new bosses would be .
The one featured in this one is nothing less than a beast .
Scale is everything this time around .
You will not only tackle this monster from the outside , but from within .
Damaging the enormous creature to the point of exhaustion will cause it to lie down with its mouth agape .
Also for the unfortunate soul , it is possible to be swallowed whole by the creature in trying to avoid it .
Once inside the player must contend with a horde of smaller Akrid from the first game as well as attempt to strike the core of the beast .
You will have a limited amount of time to do this before you meet a “ dark ending . ”
That ’s right .
You are n’t going out the way you came in .
It ’s important to keep an eye on your team ’s Battle Gauge .
Dying will reduce the amount of points your team has , and when that runs out you have no more respawns to attack the creature .
The best way to increase your Battle Gauge is to activate key markers around the map .
Doing so will also restore and add to your individual T - ENG supply that will heal you and power your Vital Suit .
I recommend getting in one of those by the way .
This thing has a lot of legs , and getting stepped on is easy whilst on foot .
Plus when on the ground its easier to be damaged by its EMP attack which will cause you to dump your T - ENG reserves in order to save your life .
It took us a little while to get the concept of how best to take on this thing but we eventually got a handle on things .
Team work is n’t quite as important as in other games , but it is very rewarding .
Just because your buddy is at the head of the creature doing damage to it and you ’re behind it does n’t mean you ’re safe from harm .
It will thrash it ’s tail at you with razor sharp spikes capable of taking you out instantly .
There really is no safe spot from this thing as it is the size of at least a tenth of the entire map and is capable of climbing or attacking you from any surface or nook and cranny you might find to hide .
The best approach being to remove its legs and then forming a boarding party into its colon .
The four of you can then manage the Akrid inside as well as bombard its intestines with as much firepower as you see fit .
A few minor details seemed to have been improved from the first game .
You do n’t seem to get knocked down as much , leaving you defenseless as in in the first game .
But until you ’re up against snow pirates that ’s hard to tell .
The aiming is still the same so if that was a bother for you in the first ( not sure why it would be ) you ’re out of luck .
There ’s a sprint feature now that sort of screws up the whole point of roadie running .
You view your main character ’s butt the entire time while he just kind of runs .
It really feels awkward and it looks just as bad .
It gets the job done but it could be improved .
Other than that there is nothing that will stop me from picking this game up when it ’s released in 2010 .
I liked the first game a lot , flaws and all , and co-op just makes it a much more enjoyable experience .
My first time being censored
I ’m not terribly active on the “ public ” Internet .
I have my blog , which I suspect is mostly read by my friends and a few seekers of Python knowledge .
I belong to a forum here or comment on a favorite blog there .
I use Facebook quite a bit to keep up with friends and pass things I ’ve found among my social circle .
I just do n’t bother much with public discussions since they seem to devolve into nonsense and I just do n’t see the point in playing that game .
I do n’t even allow comments on this blog since I do n’t see the need to host other people ’s idiocy or vitriol .
About the only place you ’d find me with any sort of regularity is reddit , but even that is sporadic .
I ’m even a fairly quiet skeptic , preferring to share what I ’m learning with those around me rather than engaging in public text - based shouting matches .
The events of this past weekend started out that way : an old friend of mine from massage school , Sam , posted a link to Examiner.com that erroniously claimed that home birth was proven as safe as hospital birth .
Since many medical studies are badly reported , I checked the article .
I immediately recognized the study from the University of BC in Canada .
I ’d already read it , and it had been similarly misrepresented elsewhere .
It ’s not that the study ’s conclusions are false , it ’s that they are narrow .
Home birth has similar infant mortality rates only in Canada where a single type of certification exists : the Nurse Midwife .
This is a college - educated position with clinic hours , lots of training , and a great deal of time spent doing both hospital and home births .
They ’re full - on nurses .
That ’s not the case in the US where we have several different types of midwives , some with surprisingly little training ( and potentially zero clinic hours ) .
The Skeptical OB is where I ’d seen the study before , and she covers it well .
The bottom line is that these lesser trained midwives have an infant mortality rate triple that of the highly trained Canadian midwives .
So it ’s fair to say that the result is n’t intended to be assumed in the general case , right ?
I recognized the over - zealous rhetoric of someone who really wants to believe that all things natural are automatically better .
The author on Examiner.com was calling herself the “ natural parenting examiner ” , so that ’s to be expected .
But it does n’t excuse misreporting a study , especially since the original authors specifically warn against over - generalizing the result beyond its intended scope .
So I commented .
I asked her to cite her sources ( she had not linked , a clue that she might be getting her information third - hand ) .
I provided a link to the Skeptical OB coverage .
I was polite and brief .
But then curiosity got the best of me .
Having spent a considerable amount of time reading all sides of various health issues , I suspected I was reading the work of another enthusiastic but careless advocate .
So I clicked on her bio and found this :
Katie Drinkard is a self - proclaimed natural parenting guru who has done extensive research on natural pregnancy and parenting .
Katie presents vital information in a personal manner while providing the latest research on natural parenting topics - ranging from birth through the childhood years .
Right .
Well , that ’s not exactly a stellar CV .
Lack of formal training certainly does n’t make one wrong ( remember , I ’m a software engineer commenting on health issues ) , but dropping words like “ guru ” has always unnerved me .
I already suspected what I was going to find when I clicked on her other articles , but I had to be sure .
Naturally , one title that jumped out at me was “ Swine Flu vaccine contains diseased flesh of African Monkeys ” .
No , I ’m not kidding , she actually wrote this .
Surely she was just being hyperbolic !
Nope .
Another predictive sense was tingling in my brain as I read this gem of a final paragraph :
Scientists create the Swine Flu vaccine ( and other vaccines ) by injecting monkeys with the virus and allowing the disease to take over .
Later , the monkey is then killed and its diseased organs are used to make the ingredients of vaccines given to the public .
Oh , the stupid , it burns !
I just knew this sort of wrong - headed nonsense could only come from a single source : Mike Adams at Natural News .
Sure enough , in seconds I ’d found his article making the same bogus claim .
What makes it bogus ?
In the process of seeking the “ truth ” in the text of a vaccine patent , Mr. Adams ( not a doctor in any sense ) inferred from the line “ producing said virus using a cell line isolated from the kidney of an African Green Monkey ” that there must exist a warehouse of angry , sick monkeys being fed into a meat grinder .
Well , that ’s not the case .
Anyone who has spent more than an hour actually trying to understand vaccines will key on the words “ cell line ” and know that they ’re referring to some laboratory - grade line of perpetually grown cells that can be used as a growth medium .
Sure enough , again within seconds , I ’d found that there is a widely used line named “ Vero ” that was isolated from African Green Monkey kidney epithelial cells way back in 1962 .
So I made my way back to the Examiner.com article and assured the author that there was no monkey holocaust .
I quickly pointed out how she was in error , and provided an explanation of cell lines and how they ’re used .
Four or five sentences and I was done .
A day later , both of my comments were gone .
They appear to have been deleted .
Granted , there is no way I can prove this to anyone since I do n’t have access to the site ’s history or databases .
I can , however , say that Ms. Drinkard did update her birthing post using the link I provided .
I suppose that ’s something , but she did n’t correct or clarify anything .
I ’m disappointed .
The first bit of evidence , according to the Telegraph , is that auctions for fine wine in Hong Kong are blowing away similar auctions in NYC and London .
At one auction a buyer paid $ 93,000 for an Imperial bottle of 1982 Chateau Petrus .
And sepately , Louis Vuitton says it 's going to open stores in Lebanon and , get this , Mongolia this year .
Folks , we had a great run , but our time at the top is winding down fast .
Note : Jack first heard the twin sphere paradox recounted at an Oxford lecture in the mid 1990s , and has since forgotten the original source .
Imagine an alternate universe in which nothing exists except two fixed spheres , identical in size and composition .
There are no distinguishing characteristics for either sphere ; they are exactly the same .
Here is the question :
How can you tell the spheres apart ?
It ’s a trick question of sorts , because there is no way to do it .
Everything that is true of one sphere is true of the other .
They are automatically equidistant from each other , and there are no other fixed points in this imaginary universe to make reference of .
“ Ah , ” but you might say , “ I can picture one of them to my left and one of them to my right ” or some such .
But this would be a violation of the thought experiment .
In order to view the spheres from some fixed point of reference , you would have to travel to the alternate universe to do so .
Or , to take a picture of the two spheres , a camera would have to be transported to said universe , and so on .
The terms of the thought experiment specifically state that nothing exists in said universe except the two spheres ; to introduce a human being , a camera , or any other means of direct viewing would violate that stipulation .
The point of the thought experiment — at least as far as Jack recalls it — is that everything is relative , and the “ vantage point ” of personal reference matters a lot more than we think .
Without the ability to establish a point of reference , i.e. some temporary discrete vantage point of some kind , there is no way to tell one sphere from another .
For all intents and purposes they are the same , even though they are two .
Meaningful or Meaningless ?
Now try imagining another alternate universe — one with an earth - like planet just like ours , possibly , and yet a universe in which no sentient life forms exist .
Perhaps there are amoebas and primordial lichen and what have you , but nothing that thinks or feels or otherwise exhibits anything approaching consciousness or self - awareness .
The question this time is , does this alternate universe have “ meaning ? ”
Or is the whole place meaningless ?
Jack would argue that one cannot say … that neither “ meaningful ” nor “ meaningless ” could apply to such a universe , because , as with the twin sphere paradox , there is no temporary or permanent fixed vantage point within said universe from which to apply the designation !
As with the spheres mentioned earlier , without some personal vantage point from which to assign relative value , “ meaningful ” and “ meaningless ” become empty terms .
This is because to declare something meaningful — to say that phenomenon X or experience Y or concept Z has “ meaning , ” in the sense of richness or significance or import — is to make a personal judgment .
Note , too , that to declare something meaningless , or void of meaning , is also to make a personal judgment .
To say or imply or insinuate that XYZ means “ nothing ” or “ has no meaning ” is to declare XYZ void of import or significance … which is just as much an act of value assignation as the opposite !
And so , an alternate universe void of sentient life is neither “ meaningful ” nor “ meaningless ” because there is no one there to judge .
Such a universe , were it to exist , would simply “ be . ”
Bringing things back around to existing reality , to declare of our existing reality that “ the universe has meaning ” is to make a personal value judgment too .
To declare in relation to present reality that “ life is meaningless ” is to do just the same .
Both are subjective statements … public pronouncements of personally assigned values .
The Primacy of Personal Experience
“ Meaning , ” or the lack thereof , is derived from the personal vantage point of the conscious being doing the judging .
This is a natural extension of the fact that all meaning is derived from personal experience ( or so Jack would assert ) .
What does it mean to say that “ all meaning is derived from personal experience ? ”
Well , we already understand the practical implications as they exist in every day life .
For instance :
Let us say there is a song that comes on the radio that reminds you of an old flame every time you hear it .
That particular song has a unique pattern of richness , import or significance , i.e. “ meaning ” assigned by you alone , in a manner that resonates uniquely with you alone .
( Others may lay claim to the song , but their patterns of meaning will be different . )
Similarly , a patch of grass in a park might remind you of a beloved deceased family pet , or the smell of muffins baking might remind you of grandmother ’s house , and so on .
To the degree that these things stir up feelings in you , generate a positive or negative emotional response or complex cognitive response in you , they have meaning — personal meaning — in relation to your life and unique existence .
The examples chosen in the previous paragraph are deliberately down to earth , but the same judgment applies to more high minded things like worldviews and moral codes and abstract frames of reference .
The degree to which one belief system among many resonates where countless others do not is a function of personally assigned value , i.e. self - created meaning .
Self - Created Meaning
The next step forward ( in Jack ’s view ) is to recognize that all meaning is self - created .
There is no such thing as independent or transcendent meaning … whenever one ponders the “ meaning ” of something , it is always in relation to some vantage point of consciousness .
“ Meaning ” is tethered to consciousness , and thus becomes a non sequitur when severed from some originating form of “ self ” — be it the personal self , the self of some other human being , a collective societal self , or what have you .
And so , given that meaning is 1 ) tethered to consciousness , and 2 ) grounded in personal vantage point , it is logical to recognize that all meaning is self - created .
There is no other mechanism than consciousness ( which in turn implies the existence of a self ) to generate it !
Self - created by whom , you might ask ?
Answer :
By whomever is doing the experiencing , the conceiving … whoever is participating in reality as a conscious being .
Were , say , a dolphin or a chimpanzee self aware enough to assign emotional impact values of “ import , richness and significance ” to things , then one could say to whatever degree consciousness exists in such a creature , that creature has the ability to experience — and create — meaning .
The point is not to get on a rabbit trail as to whether animals have consciousness or whether life forms beyond humanity can truly experience meaning .
Rather , it is to point out that “ humanity ” is not the critical thing .
Self - awareness is the thing … consciousness as intertwined with the existence of thinking , feeling self is the thing .
To the degree that a being ( human or otherwise ) is conscious , self - reflecting , and self - aware , he / she / it has the ability to generate and experience self - created meaning .
And that ’s the only kind of meaning there is .
Meaning can be transferred and explored and collectively shared by way of recorded knowledge , creative expression and robust communication mediums , but at the end of the line , meaning is always end - user experienced ( and uniquely generated ) by some “ self ” on a personal individualized level .
Like words on a page of an unread book , the symbolic aspects of reality do not become impactful until some conscious being shows up with the capacity to “ read ” ( i.e. personally experience ) reality ’s text .
No Fixed Answers
Let ’s go a step further now .
If one agrees that all meaning is self - created , i.e. derived from personal experience , then one can further deduce that burning questions such as “ Is the universe meaningful ? ” or “ Does life have meaning ” are not questions with fixed immutable answers .
As mentioned , a universe devoid of sentient life is not automatically a “ meaningless ” universe .
As with the twin spheres , there is no point of reference to declare in either direction ( who is there to declare ? ) .
We get tripped up when trying to imagine abstract overlays for such a place because we automatically assume a point of reference by default .
We almost ca n’t help it — so much of reality is personal , we are like fish with no feel for what “ water ” is .
Being fully immersed in the midst of an intensely personal existence , we tend to forget ( or fail to recognize in the first place ) just how subjective and solipsistic the individual consciousness experience truly is .
Similarly , there is no final answer as to whether THIS universe is “ meaningful ” or “ meaningless ” except to the degree that one ASSIGNS such a value in personal terms .
Does life have meaning ?
For one individual , quite possibly .
For another individual , possibly not .
Embracing Paradox
The point of opening with the twin sphere paradox was to facilitate a break with conventional thinking .
Most of us are so used to perceiving and processing reality from a personal vantage point , we tend to automatically conflate the personal aspects of existence with the broader impersonal reality beyond .
Pondering the twin sphere paradox can potentially help highlight the faultiness of such a conflation ( or so Jack hopes ) .
A natural , accidental tendency to conflate the biased personal with the neutral universal — often in a parochial or arrogant way — further explains why people routinely go around saying “ the world is ABC ” or “ reality is XYZ ” as if they were speaking in concrete terms , when , in actuality , they are merely expressing subjective personal value judgments in the vast majority of cases .
The concept of self - created meaning is also a bit of a brain bender , in that we are not used to the idea of creating meaning ourselves and having no higher arbiter than our own consciousness to declare such assignations valid or invalid .
Most of us are used to thinking of meaning as some intangible , transcendent thing — as if the inherent value in ideas , codes , concepts and things is something one is subjected to , rather than something one creates on one ’s own ( whether such act of creation is recognized or not , conscious or not , hijacked by outside interests or not ) .
In philosphical discussions we tend to treat our perceptions of meaning as if meaning somehow managed to reside beyond the personal — and where would it live exactly ?
— even if we do not recognize the implications .
The idea of “ meaningless ” as active value judgment is even more tricky for some , because again , many if not most of us fail to recognize that assigning a negative value to something is still very much an act of subjective judgment .
In some ways , then , to shout “ the universe is meaningless ! ” is no more metaphysically justified in the big scheme of things than to shout “ vanilla ice cream tastes better than chocolate ! ”
Such statements may be true for you , and also for those who agree with you , but that would be as far as it goes … and vice - versa for those who would declare the universe a hands - down meaningful place .
Again , as with the lack of reference point in relation to the twin spheres paradox , the absence of any higher arbiter of meaning means that self - created meaning becomes the ultimate authority .
There is no transcendent meaning to override our personal experiences as to what is important , what bears a weighting of import or richness or significance and what doeis not .
We are , quite literally , then , left to create meaning for ourselves , whether we accept such awesome responsibility consciously or not , whether we embark on such a critical mission willingly or not .
To choose someone else ’s prepackaged value system , like a box of cereal off a grocery store shelf , is still to make a choice .
Note , too , that “ awesome ” and “ critical ” are readily used here in personal subjective terms — and there is nothing wrong with adopting or otherwise synthesizing attractive aspects of someone else ’s belief system if it feels right to do so .
Selecting , compounding and synthesizing is how humanity advances ( if one gives merit to such a concept ) .
And in so doing ( generating our own canvas of self - created meaning ) , it is also worthy to note the experiences and ideas and concepts we choose to value as meaningless / null / void can matter just as much as the things we choose to attach great worth to .
The canvas of fulfilled life is not just brush stroke alone , but also the open space between the strokes .
p.s. More food for thought ( in airport lounge parable form , as adopted from a Jack Sparrow comment on another blog ) :
Three teachers sit by the side of the road .
The first teacher cries , over and over again , “ All is meaningless — you MUST accept this ! ”
The second teacher cries , just as loudly , “ All has a deeper hidden purpose — you MUST accept this ! ”
The townspeople , curious as to which teacher is right , inquire of the quiet third man , hoping he will break the tie .
But , instead of picking a winner , the quiet teacher merely smiles and responds : “ These two are as noisome twin brothers — what they say is the same .
There is no universal truth … how could there be , when even the sun and moon will one day go out .

He has the most powerful perch in Congress as head of the House Ways and Means Committee .
He is connected -- one of the original Friends of Bill ( Clinton ) , an avid supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton .
But New York Democrat Charlie Rangel is under increasing pressure to step down as chairman in the wake of an ethics investigation over his failure to report $ 600,000 in assets in his Senate financial disclosure form .
In recent “ amendments ” to his reports , Rangel acknowledged that he omitted just a few assets -- such as a Merrill Lynch Global account worth at least $ 250,000 , holdings in PepsiCo and Yum !
Brands stocks , a vacation property in the Dominican Republic and , oh yeah , up to $ 100,000 in rent from a Harlem brownstone that he sold in 2004 for more than $ 1 million .
As the Wall Street Journal put it in an editorial , “ When normal people happen to ' find ' their own money , it might mean a twenty left in a winter coat , or discovering change beneath the sofa cushions .
But if you 're Charlie Rangel , it means doubling your net worth . ”
Republicans , led by California ’s Darrell Issa , are urging House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) to topple Rangel from the chairman 's seat and calling on Rangel to release his income taxes .
“ He ’s got to resolve the difference on whether these are reporting errors on a financial disclosure form or whether he ’s been filing false returns with the IRS , ” Issa said .
In September , when it was disclosed that Rangel failed to pay taxes on a Dominican Republic resort condo , the gravelly - voiced , 79 - year - old Harlem congressman said , “ I really do n’t believe making mistakes means you have to give up your career . ”
Pelosi has told aides that she has no intention of stripping Rangel of his gavel , explaining that she wants the Ethics Committee to investigate Rangel ’s lapses without any meddling from Democratic leaders .
“ Charlie Rangel is a very distinguished member of the House of Representatives , ” Pelosi said this week .
“ Whatever the leaders on their side say , he is very well - respected by members on both sides of the aisle . ”
Maybe , but good government types are not swayed .
“ If you come in on a platform of cleaning up corruption , you ca n’t excuse members of your own caucus , ” said Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics .
Referring to the just - convicted Louisiana Democrat William Jefferson , the one who stuffed $ 90,000 in his freezer wrapped in tin foil , Jazz Shaw wrote , " There 's really nothing missing from this story except a few piddling questions about why Charlie could n't afford a bigger freezer and could n't somebody have loaned the guy a couple of rolls of aluminum foil ?

HAMBURG , N.Y. --
Bills players are concerned with their privacy and safety after the front lawn of a home belonging to cornerback Leodis McKelvin was vandalized following Buffalo 's season - opening loss to New England .
Hamburg police on Tuesday confirmed the home of a Bills player was vandalized , but declined to release details of their investigation after an obscenity and the score of Monday night 's game -- a 25 - 24 loss to the Patriots -- were painted in white on the player 's lawn in suburban Buffalo .
McKelvin fumbled a kickoff return with under two minutes to play and the Bills leading 24 - 19 .
Three plays later , New England 's Tom Brady hit Benjamin Watson for the go - ahead touchdown as the Patriots overcome an 11 - point deficit in the final 2:06 .
Bills linebacker Kawika Mitchell referred to a teammate 's home being vandalized in a post on his Twitter page , though he did not say it was McKelvin 's home .
Mitchell warned fans that such behavior is disturbing .
" With all the safety issues n the NFL its not funny at all , " Mitchell wrote .
" We have Fam at our homes to protect .
If u show ur face on my prop Ill make sure I do everythin to keep my Fam safe . "
Mitchell warned that he would consider vandalism threatening behavior if it happened to his home .
" Its my job to protect my home as it is the job of all home owners .
Dont push the limit , " Mitchell wrote .
Though Bills fans are passionate about their team , Monday 's night 's vandalism is surprising .
Bills players previously have hailed the team 's fans for being respectful and allowing players their privacy .
Bills spokesman Scott Berchtold declined comment by saying the team considers this a police matter .
A message left on a phone listed to McKelvin was not returned .
It 's not clear if there was anyone at home at the time the vandalism occurred .
Bills players had the day off before returning to practice Wednesday to prepare to host Tampa Bay this weekend .
Bills safety George Wilson was shocked upon learning the news earlier in the day .
" To see that type of response from so - called passionate fans is taking things to the extreme , " said Wilson , who is the team 's union representative .
" You can blog and make your opinions , but to go to a person 's residence , you 're taking it to a whole new level . "
McKelvin , selected in the first round of the 2008 draft out of Troy , set a team record and ranked second in the NFL with 1,468 kickoff return yards last season .
He also scored a touchdown .
He opened this season by taking over a starting job opposite veteran cornerback Terrence McGee .
After the game against the Patriots , McKelvin was criticized for running the ball out of the end zone rather than taking a knee .
After being hit by Brandon Meriweather at the Bills 30 , McKelvin attempted to gain an extra yard before being stripped of the ball by Pierre Woods .
Following the game , McKelvin said he was disappointed that he fumbled but noted he would run the ball out of the end zone again if given the same opportunity .
" Next time I get the opportunity , I am going to hold on and make a better decision , " he said .
Coach Dick Jauron defended McKelvin .
" He 's a dynamic runner and he was trying to win a football game , ice a football game , " Jauron said , adding that McKelvin attempted to protect the ball with two hands .
" It 's just one of those things that happens , but I do n't have any problems with Leodis .
He plays the game hard . "
With a nod to Terrell Owens , defensive end Aaron Schobel was upbeat a day after yet another Monday night meltdown by the Bills .
" I think Terrell said it best before and after the game , " Schobel said .
" He said he 's been on a lot of teams and said we 've got talent .
We 've just got to put it together .
I think he 's right . "
Schobel did express concern that the Bills continue to struggle to seal victories .
They lost 29 - 27 to Cleveland on a Monday night last season on Phil Dawson 's 56 - yard field goal with 1:39 left .
Two years ago on a Monday night , Buffalo gave up 9 points in the final 20 seconds in a 25 - 24 loss to Dallas .
" The bottom line is when you have a chance to win the game , win the game .
We did n't do that , " he said .
" It 's a long season and we 're going to be all right .
We 've just got to get on a roll . "
Smallholders and and rural households should be helped , the FAO said Food production will have to increase by 70 % over the next 40 years to feed the world 's growing population , the United Nations food agency predicts .
The Food and Agricultural Organisation says if more land is not used for food production now , 370 million people could be facing famine by 2050 .
The world population is expected to increase from the current 6.7 billion to 9.1 billion by mid-century .
Climate change , involving floods and droughts , will affect food production .
The FAO said net investments of $ 83 bn ( £ 52.5 bn ) a year - an increase of 50 % - had to be made in agriculture in developing countries if there was to be enough food by 2050 .
Climate challenges
" The combined effect of population growth , strong income growth and urbanisation ... is expected to result in almost the doubling of demand for food , feed and fibre , " FAO Director - General Jacques Diouf told delegates at a forum entitled How to Feed the World 2050 .
The FAO said that even if governments increased agricultural investments , there could still be 370 million people suffering from famine in 2050 .
Difficulties ahead included a scarcity of natural resources such as land , water and biodiversity .
Food production would also have to deal with " the effects of climate change , notably higher temperatures , greater rainfall variability and more frequent extreme weather events such as floods and droughts , " Mr Diouf warned .
Climate change would reduce water availability and lead to an increase in plant and animal pests and diseases , he said .
Mr Diouf said it was important to increase food production in areas where it was most needed , as climate change could reduce potential output by up to 30 % in Africa and up to 21 % in Asia .
" There should be a special focus on smallholder farmers , women and rural households and their access to land , water and high quality seeds ... and other modern inputs , " he said .
He added that the biofuel market also presented competition to food production .
Biofuel production is set to increase by nearly 90 % over the next 10 years to reach 192 billion litres by 2018 , the FAO said .

Former agency translator called to testify in Ohio election case this Saturday on Turkish infiltration of U.S. government ...
Unless the Dept. of Justice re-invokes their twice - invoked " state secrets privilege " claim in order to once again gag former FBI translator - turned - whistleblower Sibel Edmonds , her attorneys have notified the department by hand - delivered , sworn letter of declaration this week , that she intends to give a public deposition , open to the media , in response to a subpoena this Saturday in Washington D.C. .
Edmonds has confirmed her intentions to answer any questions asked of her during the sworn proceedings , fully and publicly , during conversations with The BRAD BLOG this week .
She notes that her agreement with her former employer , the FBI --- who fired her illegally after she filed whistleblower allegations about corruption and foreign infiltration in the linguistics department --- includes certain non-disclosure requirements .
However , those requirements do not preclude her answering to a legally issued court subpoena .
The subpoena and request for sworn deposition is part of a case now pending before the Ohio Elections Commission in which Ohio's Republican U.S. Congresswoman Jean Schmidt ( R - 2nd District ) has filed a complaint against her 2008 independent challenger , David Krikorian who Schmidt has charged distributed false statements about her during last year 's campaign ...

Katie Couric is launching a new online interview series , called @katiecouric , this week , and her first subject is a pretty big get , at least if you believe what you read in TIME magazine : Glenn Beck .
( Fun fact : Back and Couric have the same publicist .
Because he just despises the MSM ’s bias , not their professional assistants . )
In an online excerpt , Couric throws some political names at Beck , and “ Hillary Clinton ” elicits an interesting response , above .
Interesting , but maybe not surprising .
People tend to lump TV opinion hosts — and anybody else with an opinion about politics — under either “ liberal ” or “ conservative . ”
People thus call Beck a conservative talker , and he ’s even used the label for himself .
It ’s true insofar as it goes , but it also goes to show how inadequate and limiting our language for describing politics is .
The fact is , there are numerous subgroups within “ liberal ” and “ conservative , ” and some of the liberal subgroups have more in common with come conservative subgroups than with other liberals ; the same is true in reverse .
In a column I wrote earlier this year about Glenn Beck , I made a point — then , I think , deleted it for space — about how calling Fox News a “ conservative ” opinion haven is true but insufficient .
Fox News , I wrote , is like the bar in The Blues Brothers that has “ both kinds of music : country and western . ”
That is , it does so well in part because it brings under one umbrella several different kinds of conservative .
There ’s Neil Cavuto ’s Wall Street , big - business conservatism , Mike Huckabee ’s religious conservatism , Sean Hannity ’s party - line Republicanism , Bill O’Reilly ’s grouchy reactionariness — and now , touching a hot - button in the year of budget stimuli , Glenn Beck ’s conservative ( and paranoid ) libertarianism .
You can argue whether all those labels are accurate or whether those hosts are consistent in their values , but the point is , these can be very different beliefs when it comes to issues like bank bailouts or foreign policy .
“ Liberal ” and “ conservative ” imply that there is a single axis on which American politics is plotted , and all that needs to be done is to figure out where any given person lies on that line .
But there are a lot of axes : authoritarian vs. libertarian , internationalist vs. nationalist , activist vs. laissez - faire , individualist vs. communitarian , moralist vs. nonjudgmental , social libertarian vs. economic libertarian , and so on .
To someone like Beck , with his get - government - out - of - the - way refrain , a President who believes in government doing a lot , vigorously , is bad , period .
You can argue whether that ’s really an accurate description of McCain , but as Beck says , it is an accurate description of McCain ’s idol Teddy Roosevelt .
The fact that anyone would reflexively assume that Glenn Beck and John McCain would be simpatico only shows how weak and inaccurate “ liberal ” and “ conservative ” are as labels and how much nuance we lose with them .
And yes , I did just use “ Glenn Beck ” and “ nuance ” in the same sentence .
Have at me in the comments .
Things that vegans eat
A lot of people think that being vegan means a very limited diet .
I intend to blog what I eat in order to demonstrate that this is not the case .
A vegan diet can be varied or simple , healthy or unhealthy .
There are lots of places to eat out , and lots of things to cook at home .
I feel really lucky to have every type of food I could want available to me , I do n't think it 's necessary for animals to die for my sandwich .
Hofstra University today suspended a student who recanted claims that she was gang - raped by five men in a dorm bathroom during a party .
At the same time , Hofstra spokeswoman Melissa Connolly said the school had lifted a suspension against the one student among the five suspects who attended the Nassau County school .
The 18 - year - old freshman , Danmell Ndonye , accused the five men of rape on Tuesday , saying she had been attacked during a party on Saturday night .
Ndonye recanted a day later after prosecutors told her a video of the liaison exists , sources told The Post .
“ Late [ last night ] … the alleged victim of the sexual assault admitted that the encounter that took place early Sunday morning was consensual , ” said Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice on Wednesday .
The four suspects , who had been arrested — including 21 - year - old Hofstra student Rondell Bedward — were released from jail Wednesday night .
Each had faced up to 25 years behind bars .
“ I have launched an immediate criminal investigation into the statements and reports given by the woman in connection with this incident , ” Rice said , adding that her office is investigating possible charges against the woman for filing a false police report .
A lawyer for one of the those arrested , Kevin Taveras , 20 , said video of the sexual encounter refutes allegations that the victim was tied up and forcibly attacked .
Victor Daly - Rivera said Thursday that the video resembled “ a porn movie . ”
“ It showed just the opposite of what the allegations were .
There was no tying up , there was no bruising , there was no screaming , ” he said .
He said one of the five accused men shot the video on a cell phone .
He would not say which one .
“ Innocent until proven guilty ! ” shouted an elated Taveras , 20 , a Cablevision worker from Brentwood , LI , after walking out of jail .
“ I ’m so happy .
I ’m glad to be going home . ”
His 19 - year - old step - brother , Stalin Felipe , said that although he was “ very happy the truth came out , I ’m still embarrassed . … I have no comment for that girl . ”

Google and Apple are on a collision course .
While the companies are not each others ' biggest rivals , they are increasingly competing with each other .
This follows years of enjoying one of the coziest relationships in Silicon Valley -- one that will now get more complicated as the companies compete in more areas .

The latest : Google is developing a movie rental service for YouTube .
This is a logical extension of the Web 's top video site , as YouTube increases its focus on professional content .
But if it happens , it will put YouTube in square competition with Apple 's iTunes store , which has offered movie rentals for years .
Video rentals do not generate a huge amount of revenue for either company , so it 's not a big conflict .
But Google is also increasingly competing with Apple in its more important , core platform businesses .
Their most significant rivalry today is mobile phone platforms , where Google 's Android phones compete with Apple 's iPhones .
So far , Apple has had more success , both in getting consumers to buy its phones , and in getting software companies to develop apps for its platform .
But Google has a big year ahead :
It will eventually be distributed by all four major U.S. wireless carriers , while Apple is exclusive with AT&T ( for now , at least ) .
And phone manufacturers like Motorola have plans to make lots of mid-range , high - volume phones with Android .
Assuming the efforts are adequate , Google could catch up significantly in the next year .
Google is also developing an operating system for computers , which is , of course , one of Apple 's biggest businesses .
( The Mac generated more than one third of Apple 's non-GAAP , adjusted sales last quarter . )
Google 's Chrome OS is supposed to ship next year , initially on " netbook " portable computers , a market Apple does n't yet participate in .
But eventually , Google plans to offer Chrome OS for laptop and desktop computers , which will inevitably put the companies in deeper competition .
As we said , neither company is each other 's biggest rival .
Both are probably still most interested in disrupting Microsoft , which is one of the reasons they became so close earlier this decade .
Pretty much every area where Google is competing with Apple , it 's competing even stronger with Microsoft .
But it 's impossible for Apple to escape the crossfire .
And that 's one big reason that Google chief Eric Schmidt stepped down from Apple 's board of directors last month .
" Unfortunately , as Google enters more of Apple ’s core businesses , with Android and now Chrome OS , Eric ’s effectiveness as an Apple Board member will be significantly diminished , since he will have to recuse himself from even larger portions of our meetings due to potential conflicts of interest , " Apple CEO Steve Jobs said in a statement .

An international team of psychologists from the United States , New Zealand , and France has found that the way we initially think about the emotions of others biases our subsequent perception ( and memory ) of their facial expressions .
So once we interpret an ambiguous or neutral look as angry or happy , we later remember and actually see it as such .
The study , published in the journal Psychological Science , " addresses the age - old question : ' Do we see reality as it is , or is what we see influenced by our preconceptions ? ' " said coauthor Piotr Winkielman , professor of psychology at the University of California , San Diego .
" Our findings indicate that what we think has a noticeable effect on our perceptions . "
" We imagine our emotional expressions as unambiguous ways of communicating how we 're feeling , " said coauthor Jamin Halberstadt , of the University of Otago in New Zealand , " but in real social interactions , facial expressions are blends of multiple emotions – they are open to interpretation .
This means that two people can have different recollections about the same emotional episode , yet both be correct about what they ' saw . '
So when my wife remembers my smirk as cynicism , she is right : her explanation of the expression at the time biased her perception of it .
But it is also true that , had she explained my expression as empathy , I would n't be sleeping on the couch . "
" It 's a paradox , " Halberstadt added .
" The more we seek meaning in other emotions , the less accurate we are in remembering them . "
Researchers showed experimental participants still photographs of faces computer - morphed to express ambiguous emotion and instructed them to think of these faces as either angry or happy .
Once an ambiguous look was interpreted , it biased subsequent perception .
( Photo Credit : Courtesy of Piotr Winkielman , UC San Diego . )
The researchers point out that implications of the results go beyond everyday interpersonal misunderstandings – especially for those who have persistent or dysfunctional ways of understanding emotions , such as socially anxious or traumatized individuals .
For example , the socially anxious have negative interpretations of others ' reactions that may permanently color their perceptions of feelings and intentions , perpetuating their erroneous beliefs even in the face of evidence to the contrary .
Other applications of the findings include eyewitness memory : A witness to a violent crime , for example , may attribute malice to a perpetrator – an impression which , according to the researchers , will influence memory for the perpetrator 's face and emotional expression .
The researchers showed experimental participants still photographs of faces computer - morphed to express ambiguous emotion and instructed them to think of these faces as either angry or happy .
Participants then watched movies of the faces slowly changing expression , from angry to happy , and were asked to find the photograph they had originally seen .
People 's initial interpretations influenced their memories : Faces initially interpreted as angry were remembered as expressing more anger than faces initially interpreted as happy .
Even more interesting , the ambiguous faces were also perceived and reacted to differently .
By measuring subtle electrical signals coming from the muscles that control facial expressions , the researchers discovered that the participants imitated – on their own faces – the previously interpreted emotion when viewing the ambiguous faces again .
In other words , when viewing a facial expression they had once thought about as angry , people expressed more anger themselves than did people viewing the same face if they had initially interpreted it as happy .
Because it is largely automatic , the researchers write , such facial mimicry reflects how the ambiguous face is perceived , revealing that participants were literally seeing different expressions .
" The novel finding here , " said Winkielman , of UC San Diego , " is that our body is the interface :
The place where thoughts and perceptions meet .
It supports a growing area of research on ' embodied cognition ' and ' embodied emotion . '
Our corporeal self is intimately intertwined with how – and what – we think and feel . "

The BBC could screen some of the 2012 London Olympic games in 3D , a senior executive said today .
Roger Mosey , the director of the BBC's 2012 Olympics operation , said the corporation was looking at a number of new technologies to improve the spectacle for viewers .
" We could , and I believe should , capture some of the games in 3D , " Mosey said in a speech to the IBC technology conference in Amsterdam .
" Nobody would expect the games of 2012 to be comprehensively in 3D because the technology will be nothing like widespread enough ; but it would be a shame not to have any images of London that were part of an experiment with what will be one of the next big waves of change .
" The Olympic stadium may only exist in its full 80,000 + capacity for a relatively short period .
Not to have that at all in 3D would be , at the very least , a major gap in the archive . "
Mosey also said that " super high definition " cameras could also be based at Olympic sites , even though homes would not have the necessary equipment to pick up the images at that point .
" There wo n't be a [ super HD ] set in your living room by 2012 , but there could be a limited number of cameras and big screens that will give us a taste of the future – and could give a major creative boost to technologists and people thinking of the content of tomorrow , " he added .
" Both 3D and super HD are currently posing questions and opportunities rather than solutions ; but now 's the time to start examining seriously whether there are answers that could make 2012 even more of a landmark year . "
Mosey also used his speech to answer criticism from James Murdoch , News Corporation 's chairman and chief executive in Europe and Asia , that the BBC should not be involved in digital media .
" We want to cheer James up and suggest his pessimism is unfounded – that a BBC still respected across the world as a model of public service can and does work with the private sector , and a healthy BBC with popular support is a guarantor of innovation and supporter of enterprise , " he said .

Because it is both the 150th anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species and the 200th anniversary of author Charles Darwin 's birth , 2009 has been dubbed the Year of Darwin .
Scientists around the world are using the twin anniversaries as excuse to hold academic conferences discussing evolution , to publish papers exploring the current state of research and to simply celebrate the life and work of what some say is the greatest figure in modern biology .
In Texas , however , the Year of Darwin began with an attack on the teaching of evolution in public schools .
On January 21 , the Texas Board of Education was considering a resolution that would require textbooks to discuss the " strengths and weaknesses " in the theory of evolution --- a phrase science education advocates say is a backdoor approach to introducing creationist literature into the curriculum .
Modern science has established that life on Earth arose about four billion years ago , and that all creatures alive today have evolved from common ancestors .
Creationists reject that view , and say life is the handiwork of god , the creator .
Texas has special importance in the evolutionists - creationists fight , because it is a large state with a large student population , publishers tend to produce textbooks that meet the state 's standards and sell them across the US .
But more , Texas has an influential religious conservative movement .
Republican governor Rick Perry , for example , believes the Bible is the literal word of god , and that non-Christians are condemned to hell .
Don McLeroy , the chair of the board of education , rejects the scientific view that the Earth is four - and - a - half billion years old , saying instead that the Earth is merely several thousand years old , as related in the Bible .
Crammed into the board hearing room that January day were 14 board members ( including 10 Republicans ) , dozens of spectators ( most of them creationists ) , representatives of both the National Center for Science Education ( a defender of the teaching of evolution ) and the Discovery Institute ( the leading creationist advocacy group ) and reporters .
At one point in the proceedings , reports the Dallas Morning News , board member Barbara Cargill , a Republican " who supported the weaknesses requirement , said there have been ' significant challenges ' to evolution theory .
She cited a recent news article in which a European scientist disputed Darwin 's ' tree of life ' showing common ancestors for all living things . "
The article Cargill cited was from that day 's edition of New Scientist , a respected weekly publication that covers the scientific community .
It 's unknown if Cargill had actually read the article she cited , but the contents of the article were immaterial ; what mattered was the packaging .
As she made her argument , say NCSE reps who were present at the hearing , Cargill waved a copy of the magazine cover before her .
It read : " Darwin was wrong : cutting down the tree of life . "
The article discusses several scientists working on the frontiers of evolutionary research , starting with microbiologist Ford Doolittle , an American by birth who has spent the bulk of his career working at Dalhousie University .
Enlightenment philosophers were cataloguers .
They looked at the animal and plant world and heroically compiled taxonomies , classification systems for all living things .
Such taxonomies , including Linnaeus ' , which we still use today , grouped creatures based on physical characteristics that appeared to be similar .
It was Charles Darwin , however , who first suggested that all living things are actually related .
That is , like distant human cousins who share a common great - great - grandparent , different animal species , including humans , have a common ancestor .
And just as a genealogist can map out the living descendants of , say , Thomas Jefferson and draw a " family tree " originating with Jefferson , the history of all life can be represented by a " tree of life , " with one long - past species , the trunk , branching out into all of today 's living species , the twigs at the end of the branches ( see below ) .
Darwin held that there were small variations between individual members of a species , and through a struggle for survival , only the most fit individuals survived .
These individuals passed on the traits that made them survivors to the next generation , and so on from generation to generation .
As species gradually transformed , new branches arose on the tree of life .
Remarkably , though , Darwin came up with this theory without knowing what physical mechanism could explain how traits are passed from one generation to the next .
Through the early 20th century , scientists rediscovered Gregor Mendel 's work with the inheritance of traits , and worked out the basics of chromosomes , genes and DNA .
In 1953 , James Watson and Francis Crick famously discovered the " double helix " structure of DNA .
Born in Urbana , Illinois in 1942 , Ford Doolittle came of age during the Cold War , as the United States asserted its primacy in science .
Doolittle says the Soviet Union 's 1957 launch of Sputnik determined his future life path : " It made American boys want to be scientists and engineers --- if they wanted to get any girls for one thing --- and they wanted to feel like they were doing their duty for their country .
I think I would 've gone into the arts if it was n't for the emphasis on science education after Sputnik . "
As a teenager , Doolittle had a summer job in the lab of molecular biologist Sol Spiegelman at the University of Illinois .
" It was probably one of the more exciting labs to be in in the late ' 50s and ' 60s , " he says .
" It had the atmosphere of a hospital emergency ward --- everything was important , people worked all night , shifts of people , it was very exciting . "
Doolittle went on to Harvard , where he studied under Alwin Pappenheimer , a biologist who looked at infectious diseases , then to Stanford , in California , where Doolittle received a PhD in biochemical genetics , and then back to Urbana for a post - doctorate appointment , to work alongside Spiegelman .
But Doolittle found himself gravitating to the work of another University of Illinois researcher , Carl Woese .
" Sol Spiegelman , " says Doolittle , " was very intimidating --- brilliant , but you did n't want to say something stupid around Sol. Carl Woese was much more approachable .
You could drink beer with Carl and talk about sex and things .
Many of Sol 's people were closer to Carl Woese personally . "
Woese literally reordered the world of biology .
Up until that time , biologists considered all life to consist of two different fundamental types : prokaryotes and eukaryotes .
Prokaryotes are relatively simple cells with no nucleus ; eukaryotes are cells with a nucleus that contain the cell 's chromosomes .
But by looking at a piece of genetic material called ribosomal RNA , which makes proteins in the cell , Woese showed that there are two different kinds of prokaryotes --- bacteria and archaea , which are as fundamentally different from each other as they are from eukaryotes .
Woese found that life had three fundamental types , not two .
Doolittle was one of a small group of scientists referred to as Woese 's Army .
Through the ' 70s and ' 80s they mapped out the relationships between bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes .
By about 1990 that work had coalesced into a new view of how primitive life had developed , an understanding that most biologists share to this day .
The new picture ( see illustrations at the end of this article ) filled in some of the details of Darwin 's tree of life :
The trunk of the tree of life splits into two main limbs , bacteria and archaea .
Archaea in turn sprouts a new limb , eukaryotes .
And that eukaryotic limb leads to multi-celled organisms and branches into all the stuff we commonly think of life : plants and animals and people .
Doolittle was hired by Dalhousie University in 1975 .
" For an American to come here at that time --- if you were n't a Buddhist --- was a pretty rare thing , " he says .
" Or if you were n't a draft dodger , but I was neither of those . "
Dalhousie at the time was just beginning to find its research legs .
" I asked if there were any post - docs , and they said , ' We had one once , but it did n't work out . '
And of course post - docs are the lifeblood of modern research . "
As he was piecing together a research team of his own , Doolitle began working with blue - green algae .
" I realized that nobody had ever done any work on them in terms of molecular biochemistry , " he explains .
" As a scientist , that 's what you want , something no one else is working on . "
Soon , another member of Woese 's Army , Linda Bonen , came to Dalhousie as a grad student .
Bonen brought with her a technology Woese had developed for sequencing RNA molecules , and Doolittle applied it to the blue - green algae .
He and Bonen were the first to prove the theory that an ancestor of blue - green algae had been incorporated , whole , inside the cell of a eukaryote , evolving into the chloroplast , the part of plants that is responsible for photosynthesis .
That discovery showed that the tree of life was a bit more complex than once imagined : a bacterial ancestor of blue - green algae had fused with an eukaryote , like two trunks coming together to form a new limb .
( A similar event explains another part of the cell , the mitochondrion . )
" That put Dalhousie on the map in terms of molecular evolution , " says Doolittle .
Doolittle then began looking at the strange , and seemingly needless , duplication of the DNA molecule in some genes .
The zoologist Richard Dawkins had in 1976 coined the term " selfish gene " ; Doolittle borrowed the language to refer to what he called " selfish DNA , " and wrote a paper on it with student Carmen Sapienza .
He and Sapienza fired the paper off to both the journal Nature and to Francis Crick , co-discoverer of DNA , who was simultaneously working on much the same theory .
Crick called the editors at Nature and insisted that both his and Doolittle 's papers be published in the same 1980 issue , with Doolittle 's leading .
" Genes doing weird stuff has always been something that 's interested me , " says Doolittle .
" And genes not behaving the way that they should and things not being the way people think they are , that 's always interested me . "
In the following years , Doolittle kept at the top of the field , authoring or co-authoring an astounding 246 papers .
Along the way , he and Dawkins independently found time to take a swipe at James Lovelock 's Gaia Hypothesis , a theory much beloved in counter - culture circles that holds that the entire global ecosystem is in fact a single organism .
" It was just an instinctive reaction of a biologist who believes in natural selection , who does n't see how it 's possible for a global entity to arise , " he says of his Gaia critique , published in CoEvolutionary Quarterly .
That side project was probably his mostly wide read work , until recently .
The tree of life map holds that species evolve with the passage of time , through what scientists call " vertical descent . "
There were a couple of exceptions --- the " fusing " of the two branches brought together when the ancestors of chloroplasts and mitochondria were absorbed into eukaryotes --- but otherwise the tree explained pretty much everything , at least so long as scientists were looking at ribosomal RNA .
But around 1995 , new techniques for sequencing genes became available , and biologists began looking at other genetic material , including the DNA found on chromosomes in the cell nucleus .
And some of those genes tell a different evolutionary history , yielding a different tree .
It 's now known that sometimes --- rarely --- a gene will shift from one species right over to another species , a process scientists call " lateral gene transfer . "
A gene that 's in a certain kind of bacteria , for example , might through lateral gene transfer get absorbed into a eukaryotic cell , and become part of the eukaryote 's genetic profile , where through vertical descent it 's handed down from one generation to the next .
Lateral gene transfer confuses the tree of life .
As with Darwin 's tree , a gene will go through vertical descendent , from one generation to the next , for billions of generations , but over those billions of generations , it only takes one instance of lateral transfer to muck up the simple tree picture .
When Doolittle 's lab began making trees of life with the new techniques , " instead of showing archaea and eukaryotes together and bacteria separately , it might show bacteria and eukaryotes together and archaea separately , " he says , " or it would show one particular archaea had a bacteria version of a gene though another archaea had a different kind of version . "
While lateral gene transfer creates some problems with mapping , it 's been fully integrated into the science .
Biologists know of three mechanisms for lateral gene transfer and , for the most part , say it happens so infrequently it does n't matter for the purposes of truly understanding the tree of life .
But a growing number of microbiologists , say that lateral gene transfer happens much more often than was previously thought .
" It became a question of , ' How big of an iceberg was this the tip of ? ' " says Doolittle .
" It began to look like there was going to be more discordant signal than there was going to be concordant signal , and so in 1999 , I boldly published a paper in Science " ---" Phylogenetic classification and the universal tree " ---" that turned out to be a quite influential paper .
I 'm quite proud of it in retrospect , because I think I was reasonably careful in there to say , we do n't actually know yet that most of the signal is discordant , but if some significant fraction of it is discordant , we have to rethink what we 're doing .
" It made a lot of people angry .
It still makes a lot of people angry . "
Nowadays , Doolittle suggests all genes have been laterally transferred .
" That 's my claim , " he says .
" I could be wrong about that , but I would n't be more than 10 percent wrong .
It could n't be more than 10 percent of the genes that have not been exchanged .
" The overwhelming pattern of bacterial evolution is vertical descent , " he continues .
" But if you ask ,
In this particular bacterial genome that I have just sequenced , how many of those genes got there by lateral transfer ?
I 'll say , for gene X , right here , there only has to have been one lateral transfer in its entire four billion year history .
So the frequency can be once every four billion years , on average . "
If Doolittle is right , than the prevailing Darwinian view --- in which all existing species can be traced back to one common ancestor --- is wrong : there is no tree of life .
Instead , the picture is more complicated , with a tree - like branching for multi-cellular organisms ( plants , animals and people ) arising out of a confused mess , with no discernable trunk ( see illustration , page 15 ) .
None of Doolittle 's research has anything at all to do with creationism , but that does n't stop creationists from cherry picking his data and taking his findings out of context .
( Creationists themselves have given up the " creationist " label , preferring the term " intelligent design " to explain their views , but while they usually drop off the reference to the Bible , by definition " intelligent design " requires a designer --- a god --- and some act of creation . )
For example , one of the most prominent creationists --- Jonathan Wells , a follower of Sun Myung Moon , founder of the Unification Church --- cites Doolittle in Icons of Evolution : Science or Myth , Wells ' attack on evolution .
The Discovery Institute likewise uses Doolittle in its " Primer on the Tree of Life , " published on its website ( discovery.org ) .
" Doctor Doolittle --- he's an evolutionist , " says Casey Luskin , who wrote the several articles published by the Discovery Institute in preparation for the battle before the Texas board of education .
" He 's no proponent of intelligent design , and we 're not trying to claim that he is .
" I find his work interesting , " continues Luskin , who received a degree in earth sciences .
" The claim of lateral gene transfer is an inference --- it is not a hard fact .
It 's an inference based upon the finding of genetic similarity --- just like vertical descent is an inference based on the finding of genetic similarity .
Lateral transfer is just invoked when vertical descent fails : it 's an ad hoc backup hypothesis to save the view that life is fundamentally related in some sense .
" The notion that all life is related --- whether it is through a tree of life or lateral gene transfer --- that is an inference , based upon assumptions .
That all it is --- it 's a house of cards based upon assumptions . "
But to reject inference , no matter how much data has been collected , as Luskin does , is to reject all of science .
" Casey Luskin is simply reflecting the conventional creationist tradition , when he makes a comment like that , " says Susan Spath , of the National Center for Science Education .
" If you read the creationist literature , " continues Spath , " from around 1900 to the present , the fundamental issue is that the science of evolution undermines faith in god , which undermines the hold of Christianity on the culture , which therefore leads to moral decay and moral corruption .
So if you could stop the teaching of evolution , you could stop the moral corruption of society .
That 's what they believe .
" Their work does n't cut it --- it does n't cut it as science , A , and B , it has a particular religious belief embedded within it . "
Doolittle 's work is a very big deal in scientific and philosophical circles , so much so that philosophers at the University of Exeter in Britain hosted a " Perspectives on the Tree of Life " conference in Halifax over the summer , with Doolittle as the main subject of concern .
Spath used the occasion to gently prod Doolittle and other microbiologists questioning the fundamental tree of life to become more media savvy , and to think about how their work can be misconstrued .
" As an evolution education advocate , I see the obvious temptation to use language like ' we 're chopping down the tree of life , ' " says Spath .
" But I also see how profoundly misleading that is for the general public .
The tree of life for the general public is plants and animals , and a tree absolutely explains evolution at that level . "
Doolittle , for his part , is ambivalent about the creationists , who he calls " deeply dumb . "
Other scientists who have read the New Scientist article have told Doolittle they see no problem with it .
" But you see , other people do n't read the article , " he says .
" So in Texas people just ripped off the cover of New Scientist and took them to the Board of Education meeting .
" My position is : What are you going to do with people who do n't visit the argument ?
Are we supposed to deal with that ?
And the trouble is , we are .
I mean , in the States it 's a real problem , so it 's legitimate to criticize people like me , in the sense I take sort of a ' Fuck you if you can't take a joke ' attitude , but I think that 's not helping them in their battle against what is really a very strong evil thing which is happening , which is the growing stupidity of the American people .
" It amuses me .
But see , it 's not fair for me to be amused by it , because it 's not a problem here [ in Canada ] .
If I were teaching first - year biology in Arkansas , I 'd be deeply pissed off at me saying I 'm amused . "
The Texas board of education split the difference in January : the board rejected the " strengths and weaknesses " phrase but replaced it with the phrase " sufficiency or insufficiency . "
The creationist - evolutionist battle continues .
The Origin of Species concerns multicellular organisms --- the plants and animals and people that populate the visible world .
Darwin did n't know much about microorganisms and , if he thought about them at all , he did n't have the technology to seriously research them .
But microorganisms --- the single - celled prokaryotes and eukaryotes --- are the vast majority of all life forms .
As Spath sees it , Doolittle 's work involves organisms that are completely irrelevant to the common understanding of evolution .
" This generation of microbiologists has great science to offer to general biological theory , " she says .
" What they 're trying to do is say , ' the science of evolution is incomplete until you include the microbial world . '
[ But ] when they say ' Darwin was wrong ' --- Darwin was n't wrong , it 's just the theory was incomplete , and because of this new research on microbiology there 's an opportunity to achieve a new integration of the biological sciences and extend the theory of evolution . "
At the " Tree of Life " conference this summer , Spath urged Doolittle to stress that Darwin 's theory still explains evolution for plants and animals --- multicellular eukaryotes --- and that Doolittle 's work only applies to microorganisms .
Humans and apes still share a common ancestor .
Doolittle agrees that lateral gene transfer is not much of an issue for multicellular creatures , because we are protected by our germ line --- in order to have any effect on future generations , a gene would have to transfer directly into our sperm or eggs .
" If you get a piece of bacterial DNA injected into your gut cell , that 's fine , " he explains .
" I mean , it can make you sick or something , but your children are n't going to inherit it . "
But in fact , says Doolittle , if there have n't already been genes transferred laterally into our germ line , it 's only a matter of time before it happens .
" Animals [ arrived ] fairly recently , so if I 'm saying the rate of transfer is once every four billion years , which is enough to make my case for bacteria , we have n't got anything like that kind of time --- hundreds of millions of years as opposed to four billion years . "
This kind of talk upsets a lot of scientists , including notably Richard Dawkins , who adamantly hold to the tree of life view that all life can be traced back to one ancestor .
Doolittle dismisses these critics as " tree huggers , " and says that they are making a tactical mistake by reacting to the creationists .
" Genetic and ecological processes that we pretty well understand , operating over four billion years , are more than enough to explain the diversity and adaptations of living things , " says Doolittle .
" So that 's what our theory should be ; it should n't be that there is a tree of life , or that natural selection is the developmental force , or stuff like that .
I think a lot of the internal debates within the evolutionary biology field about natural selection or whether or not there is a tree get solidified on our side in order to defend ourselves against the other side that says , ' See , you guys do n't even know what you 're talking about . ' "
Most biologists , even most microbiologists , still think that there is one tree of life with a trunk of a single ancestor , says Maureen O'Malley , a philosopher at Exeter University who leads a two - year project studying the philosophical implications of Doolittle 's work .
" What is interesting , " says O'Malley , " is that if you start tracking statements people made in the ' 80s to what they 're saying now in 2009 , there have been major conceptual shifts in what they said about the tree .
I was reading something in the paper the other day by a ' one true tree ' microbiologist who was saying , ' Yes , I do accept that this one true tree is an artificial construct and that we apply it to the world to impose order on it '--- that 's a radical difference from what he was saying even two or three years ago .
" I do n't even know if Dawkins thinks you need to have an opinion on it --- he knows there 's weird stuff in the microbial world , but it does n't really interest him --- constructing trees of animals , and animals are the real kind of life in the world , so that 's good enough , as far as he 's concerned . "
Dawkins did not respond to a request to be interviewed for this article .
Where does that leave us ?
As far as O'Malley is concerned , the tree of life is still with us .
" It still seems to me that to understand evolution , you have to have this quite motivating idea of vertical inheritance and speciation , and if you lose that than you lose a lot of what we understand as evolution , and I do n't think that 's going to happen . "
" Some biologists find these notions confusing and discouraging , " Doolittle wrote in a February , 2000 article for Scientific America provocatively titled " Uprooting the tree of life . "
" It is as if we have failed at the task that Darwin set for us : delineating the unique structure of the tree of life .
But in fact , our science is working just as it should .
An attractive hypothesis or model ( the single tree ) suggested experiments , in this case the collection of gene sequences and their analysis with the methods of molecular phylogeny .
The data show the model to be too simple .
Now new hypotheses , having final forms we cannot yet guess , are called for . "
Today , Doolittle continues to say the tree has to go .
" The question is , What were we trying to do in the first place ?
We should try to change the model of evolution .
" Darwin was wrong , in the sense that Darwin did say that a treelike process explains classification , " he continues .
" Now , Darwin did n't go on about most of the living world , because he could n't have , so I 'm not going to hold him responsible for it , but he was wrong . "

The Creator of The Wire on the Drug War Etc .
There ’s a fascinating and riveting interview by Bill Moyers of David Simon , about Simon ’s HBO show The Wire–referred to here as “ the greatest , bravest , most truthful narrative programming ever heard on American television , ” and described this way by one critic : “ When television history is written , little else will rival ‘ The Wire . '” And when historians come to tell the story of America in our time , I ’ll wager they will not be able to ignore this remarkable and compelling portrayal of life in our cities . ”
And I agree it is one of the most amazing TV shows I ’ve ever seen ( which was on HBO – premium cable produces by far the best television recently , e.g. Californication , Entourage , the Sopranos , True Blood ) .
The show was amazingly honest about relationships , underclass issues , racism , crime , drugs , and so is Simon in the interview .
Well worth watching , or reading .
Any drug warrior needs to read this interview or watch the show .
At one point Moyers asks Simon , “ The character in that excerpt we just saw says , “ What ’s the answer ? ”
Do you have the answer after all these years ? ”
Simon ’s answer :
Oh , I would decriminalize drugs in a heartbeat .
I would put all the interdiction money , all the incarceration money , all the enforcement money , all of the pretrial , all the prep , all of that cash , I would hurl it , as fast as I could , into drug treatment and job training and jobs programs .
I would rather turn these neighborhoods inward with jobs programs .
Even if it was the equivalent of the urban CCC , if it was New Deal - type logic , it would be doing less damage than creating a war syndrome , where we ’re basically treating our underclass .
The drug war ’s war on the underclass now .
That ’s all it is .
It has no other meaning .
As for the state ’s corruption , and the corruption in schools caused by state regulations , see the discussion of “ juking the stats ” :
BILL MOYERS : Yes , one of my favorite scenes , in Season Four , we get to see the struggling public school system in Baltimore , through the eyes of a former cop who ’s become a schoolteacher .
In this telling scene , he realizes that state testing in the schools is little more than a trick he learned on the police force .
It ’s called “ juking the stats . ”
Take a look .
[…]
ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL :
So for the time being , all teachers will devote class time to teaching language arts sample questions .
Now if you turn to page eleven , please , I have some things I want to go over with you .
ROLAND “ PREZ ” PRYZBYLEWSKI : I do n’t get it , all this so we score higher on the state tests ?
If we ’re teaching the kids the test questions , what is it assessing in them ?
TEACHER : Nothing , it assesses us .
The test scores go up , they can say the schools are improving .
The scores stay down , they can’t .
PREZ : Juking the stats .
TEACHER : Excuse me ?
PREZ : Making robberies into larcenies , making rapes disappear .
You juke the stats , and major become colonels .
I ’ve been here before .
TEACHER : Wherever you go , there you are .
***
And do n’t miss the concluding discussion of one of my favorite scenes from the series , the scene where Det .
Greggs is holding her baby by her living room window late at night , looking out the window onto the streets of Baltimore , and they recite a modified version of Goodnight Moon :
BILL MOYERS : But I want to close with some poetry .
Some poetry that I do n’t know whether you created or whether you discovered .
But it ’s that unforgettable moment in THE WIRE when we hear “ Goodnight Moon . ”
Tell me about that before I play it for the audience .
DAVID SIMON : You know , I ’m going to– I ’m going to tell you that that is straight from a book that I totally admire .
CLOCKERS by Richard Price .
And Price wrote that episode .
And he recreated it right out of the novel .
It ’s almost a benediction for the city .
And it is the thing that , you did n’t get it if you were a politician or a police commander or a school superintendent , and you were running on your rep .
You did n’t get that THE WIRE was actually a love letter to Baltimore .
From your point of view , what it was , was just this nightmare that you had to like argue against .
But if you were a schoolteacher or a kid on a corner or a cop walking the beat .
If you– if you were , our sentiments were always with labor , it was always at the street level .
If you were one of those people , you could n’t help but hear the affection .
That this was – it may have been a conflicted lover .
But it was a love letter nonetheless .
And I thought that scene really caught it .
BILL MOYERS : We ’ll hear it now , this love letter .
Thank you , David Simon , for being with me on the Journal .
DAVID SIMON : Thank you . [… ]
DETECTIVE KIMA GREGGS : Let ’s say goodnight to everybody .
Goodnight moon .
You say it .
CHILD : Goodnight moon .
DETECTIVE KIMA GREGGS :
There you go .
Goodnight stars .
CHILD : Goodnight stars .
DETECTIVE KIMA GREGGS : Goodnight po-po’s .
CHILD : Goodnight po-po’s .

CHILD : Goodnight fiends .
DETECTIVE KIMA GREGGS : Goodnight hoppers .
CHILD : Goodnight hoppers .
DETECTIVE KIMA GREGGS : Goodnight hustlers .
CHILD : Goodnight hustlers .
DETECTIVE KIMA GREGGS : Goodnight scammers .
CHILD : Goodnight scammers .
DETECTIVE KIMA GREGGS : Goodnight to everybody .
CHILD : Goodnight to everybody .
DETECTIVE KIMA GREGGS : Goodnight to one and all .
CHILD : Goodnight to one and all .
Granted , some of Simon ’s analyses of “ capitalism ” are confused –he wants to equate the plight of the poor and those ravaged by the logic of the drug war with “ capitalism , ” without really clearly seeing that it is the anti-market state that is causing the problems he thinks the state can help to solve .
But still –fascinating interview .

A family in Campbell awoke this morning to find a fire burning in their garage and , after attempts to put it out with a garden hose , called 911 .
The Santa Clara County Fire Department brought the two - alarm blaze in the 600 block of Sobrato Drive under control in about 20 minutes , according to Chief Fire Investigator Dennis Johnson .
Shortly after 5 a.m. , a female family member walked into the garage to do laundry and was greeted by flames , Johnson said .
The daughter called her dad , who first tried to knock down the blaze with a fire extinguisher .
When that failed , the man ran outside , grabbed a garden hose and dragged it through the house to the garage , Johnson said .
At that point , “ the fire was growing too much for the garden hose to put out , ” Johnson said .
The man ’s daughter had called 911 at about 5:20 a.m .
About 30 firefighters responded to the scene and had the blaze under control at 5:40 a.m. , Johnson said .
The man suffered first - degree burns on both hands and was treated at the scene , Johnson said .
He did not immediately go to the hospital , Johnson said .
The blaze was mostly limited to the garage , Johnson said .
Combustible materials that were too close to the furnace caused the blaze , Johnson said .
Contact Mark Gomez at 408-920-5869 .
His bedroom bears all the telltale signs : the distinct , lingering odor of marijuana , the rolling papers tossed carelessly on the desk , a pile of lighters stashed in a bedside table .
Christiane Oliveri pulls open her son Michael 's desk drawer and there it is , plain as day -- nearly half a pound of marijuana .
New Jersey considers a medical marijuana law
Michael , 25 , who suffered deep depression as a child due to the onset of debilitating muscular dystrophy , recently moved out to California and has come home to Oradell , in northern New Jersey , for his sister 's wedding .
The drugs , the smoking , the marijuana leaves plastered on the back of his wheelchair -- this is Christiane Oliveri 's new reality .
And she hopes it stays that way .
As New Jersey lawmakers consider legalizing marijuana for medicinal use , residents like Oliveri , a 54 - year - old architect and artist from Egypt who says marijuana use transformed her son from a morose zombie into a self - confident , sky - diving optimist , are championing the cause .
At 5 - foot - 11 , Michael Oliveri , who has been wheelchair - bound since the age of 18 , weighs just 90 pounds -- " Ninety - five since he came home , " Christiane Oliveri says proudly .
" We 're going for 100 . "
His upper body is so skeletal , it seems dwarfed in proportion to his head .
His bicep and tricep muscles have died , leaving his upper arms half the size of his forearms and making it impossible to straighten his arms completely .
Years of taking powerful prescription medications to ease pain from crushed discs in Michael 's lower back have damaged his stomach to the point that he is permanently nauseous .
" I wake up feeling like I 'm going to throw up all over the place , " he says , lying in bed on a hot August morning while his mother fetches the strain of marijuana that best helps him wake up and settle his stomach -- " Morning Sugar , " it 's called .
In the complex world of medical marijuana , all weed is not created equal .
Michael Oliveri , who made a difficult move away from home for the first time nearly a year ago in order to live in California , where medical marijuana was legalized in 1996 , has brought home about 10 types of marijuana .
Strains like " Sour Diesel " and " Grape Ape " -- known as " sativas " -- are uppers , or " daytime weed . "
They are psychoactive , helping with alertness , and give Michael a much - needed appetite .
Strains like " L.A. Confidential " and " Grand Daddy Purple " -- known as " indicas " -- work as a muscle relaxer and offer the best pain relief , Michael says .
They help him relax enough to go to sleep at night .
" Everybody thinks , 'oh , it 's weed -- you get high , ' " Michael Oliveri says .
" The good thing about Cali is my choice of functional medication ... I can actually find a way to not get stoned , but be comfy -- be healthy . "
This is difficult new ground for the Oliveris .
Christiane Oliveri , a suburban mom who set up a local youth center so teenagers would n't get involved with drugs and alcohol , admits she " freaked " when Michael started using marijuana .
Michael 's father , Anthony , cut him off financially when he moved to California for the marijuana , and has only recently started to come around .
He still looks on disapprovingly as his wife helps prepare Michael 's morning hit of marijuana in a Volcano Vaporizer next to his bed .
" I did the journey of doctors with him , " Christiane Oliveri explains -- specialists , deep - tissue massage , excruciating physical therapy , expensive chiropractic treatments .
There were 27 epidurals .
The medications , including more than two years on a morphine patch , were devastating for Michael .
He grew withdrawn and lifeless , his mother says .
" There was no Michael in there , " Christiane Oliveri says .
" Just a body and someone who is surviving .
No food whatsoever . "
Eventually , Michael ended up hospitalized from fecal poisoning -- a side effect of morphine is severe constipation .
The near - death experience was the final straw for Michael .
Over a gut - wrenching eight - month period , he weaned himself off morphine , gave up on doctors , and turned to the one thing he found , quite by accident , greatly helped his pain and nausea -- marijuana .
The transformation was stark , Christiane Oliveri says .
Michael developed an appetite and started going out with his friends again and playing his bass .
" I realized , wait , we have Michael back , " she says .
" He 's actually happy .
He 's joining the family . "
Michael is so thankful for marijuana that he has the THC molecule -- the active ingredient in marijuana -- tattooed on his right forearm , with a heartbeat line morphing into a symbol for infinity .
" It 's keeping me alive more than anything else , " he says .
" If I had not seen it with my own eyes , I would not have believed it , " Christiane Oliveri told members of the state Assembly Health and Senior Services Committee this summer .
" Marijuana is a miracle . "
In February , the state Senate passed the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act , 22 to 16 , with two abstentions .
If enacted , the law would decriminalize marijuana use for people suffering from certain debilitating medical conditions such as cancer , AIDS , multiple sclerosis , glaucoma and epilepsy .
A modified version cleared the Assembly Health and Senior Services Committee in June and is expected to be up for a vote after the Assembly reconvenes this month .
The New Jersey medical marijuana bill has made strange bedfellows of one of the Assembly 's most conservative Republicans -- Michael Patrick Carroll , of Morristown -- and one of its most liberal Democrats -- Reed Gusciora , of Princeton .
The two are among the primary sponsors of the Assembly bill .
Gov. Jon Corzine has indicated he would sign the bill .
" Legislators really understand suffering .
Suffering is universal , " says Meagan Johnson , policy coordinator at the Drug Policy Alliance in New Jersey , which has advocated for medical marijuana laws .
" We 've found that there is bipartisan support for medical marijuana in the state of New Jersey . "
The cards would have to be renewed annually .
While marijuana remains a Schedule I substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act , the New Jersey bill notes that 99 percent of marijuana arrests are made under state law , according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission and the FBI .
In March , Attorney General Eric Holder made clear that federal agents would no longer raid medical marijuana dispensaries that appear to be complying with state laws , a shift from Bush administration policy .
The New Jersey bill cites a report by the National Academy of Sciences ' Institute of Medicine commissioned after the passage of medical marijuana voter referenda in California and Arizona .
The study , completed in 1999 , found cannabinoid drugs -- particularly THC -- have " potential therapeutic value " for pain , anxiety , nausea and vomiting , and appetite stimulation , but warned smoking marijuana was a poor delivery system for THC because of its harmful effects .
Opponents of New Jersey 's medical marijuana law point to reports of rampant abuse of the law in California , where patients with questionable conditions can easily access legal marijuana .
But sponsors of the New Jersey bill say they crafted the bill to avoid the most dangerous misuses by giving strict , centralized oversight to the Department of Health and limiting the amount of usable marijuana a patient can have to one ounce per month .
The Assembly heath committee further tightened the bill by eliminating a provisions that would have allowed patients to grow up to six marijuana plants .
The Assembly version also requires patients to pick up the marijuana in person , instead of sending a caregiver .
" There are 13 other states that have these laws .
The New Jersey bill is based on the best practices of all those states , " Johnson says .
" Our law would actually be the most restrictive law in the country . "
" I 'm not stupid enough to say we 're going to craft a perfect bill , " says Democratic state Senator Nicholas Scutari , a primary sponsor of the bill and a practicing attorney in Linden .
But the state already regulates a number of dangerous substances , Scutari says , including alcohol -- once a federally banned substance -- and tobacco , as well as the distribution of powerful and highly addictive pharmaceutical drugs .
" I 'm just saying we should n't treat it that much differently , " Scutari says of medical marijuana .
Nancy Fedder , 62 , a former database manager who lives with her daughter and grandchildren in Hillsborough , does n't want to go to jail .
At home , when the pain resulting from her multiple sclerosis does n't keep her in bed , she 's the fixer - upper , the pet - rabbit feeder , the babysitter .
But every now and again , she willfully and purposely breaks the law .
She drives into New York City to buy marijuana from an underground cooperative of patients .
" I could probably go to a local high school and get some , unfortunately , " Fedder says , but she trusts the co-op .
" There 's no Ecstasy thrown in there for an extra kick . "
One of the downsides of the going to the co-op , however , is the long drive home .
" I 'm very scared , " Fedder says .
" I 'm crossing state lines .
It 's in my car .
I 'm afraid of getting pulled over -- for anything , a busted tail light . "
Johnson says people all over New Jersey are living with the same fear .
" They do n't want to be associated with criminals and feel ashamed that they 're accessing their medicine on the black market , " she says .
In her white shorts and loose printed blouse , her walker parked nearby , Fedder looks like anyone 's grandmother , not a shifty drug user .
But there are still whispers among parents at the local bus stop , where her grandchildren are picked up for school .
Her open support for a medical marijuana bill has raised a few eyebrows in Fedder 's prim , leafy suburb and it upsets her .
" It 's not an easy decision to make , " she says .
Opponents of medical marijuana say people like Fedder are the exception -- extreme cases tricked out by activists to garner sympathy .
The majority of people who will benefit from a medical marijuana law , opponents say , are recreational users .
" The people who want to legalize drugs have financed this whole effort , " says David Evans , a Pittstown attorney and executive director of the Drug Free Schools Coalition .
" They are basically using sick people to further their agenda . "
Numerous testimonies from patients , sincere though they may be , are not enough , Evans says .
" We do n't make medical decisions in this country by anecdotal stories , " Evans says .
" Otherwise , we 'd just be approving medicine based on the way we did it a hundred years ago . "
The FDA trial process is not perfect , he says , but it 's critical in protecting people from the potentially serious consequences of taking medication .
To sidestep that process is simply " reckless public policy , " he says .
Ironically , it was Evans who was instrumental in formulating the American Bar Association 's position supporting medical marijuana in the late 1980s .
" It 's a very good argument , " Evans says , referring to the testimonies of sick and dying people .
As a cancer survivor and EMT , Evans is no stranger to pain and suffering , but he says after doing research into the harmful effects of marijuana , he regrets his initial support .
Evans also takes issue with the widespread belief that marijuana is essentially harmless , pointing to studies like one from Harvard Medical School two years ago that found marijuana , in any form , opens the body to the virus that causes Kaposi 's sarcoma , a type of cancer .
People with compromised immune systems , such as AIDS patients , would be particularly vulnerable .
As his children play in the backyard , Charles Kwiatkowski reaches behind a spice rack in a kitchen cabinet and pulls out a plastic tub of prescription medicines he keeps hidden from his three daughters .
The container is stuffed with prescription bottles , including OxyContin , Neurontin , muscle relaxers and antidepressants .
There are small yellow Post - its reminding him which side effects are caused by each drug : " nausea , " " hot flashes , " " dizziness . "
Another note says " suicidal thoughts . "
Kwiatkowski , 38 , who lives near the Jersey Shore in the town of Hazlet , suffers from multiple sclerosis .
Complications from the disease have led to nerve damage in his spine and blurred vision .
His head will often jerk involuntary .
Sometimes the pain is so unbearable that he gets up in the middle of the night , stands in the corner of the living room , leans his forehead against the wall and tries to sleep standing up .
Eight years ago , Kwiatkowski's condition worsened and he no longer could continue his job as a computer programmer at AT&T .
His physician prescribed a slew of medicines but the side effects -- severe nausea , weakness , even temporary blindness -- put a strain on his marriage and scared his children .
" I would scream at my children quite often and I did n't know why I was doing that .
I 'm really a loving dad , " says Kwiatkowski , who keeps pictures of his daughters -- Allie , 9 , Casey , 7 , and Madison , 4 -- in every room of the house .
Kwiatkowski says using marijuana allows him to drastically reduce the prescription swings and go swimming and kick a ball , " Kwiatkowski says .
" Without marijuana , I 'm stuck in bed having muscle spasms most of the day . "
The marijuana , which Kwiatkowski inhales using a Volcano Vaporizer kept in a locked box in the basement , also helps clear his multiple sclerosis - related vision impairment , including the persistent " floaters " in his field of vision .
" They 're black spots just flying everywhere -- which keeps me from seeing my beautiful girls , " Kwiatkoswi says .
" If there 's a medication that fixes your vision enough to see your children , that would be a medicine from God . "
Kwiatkowski says a bag of vapor in the morning and in the evening -- his wife , Mary , locks the basement door when he is medicating -- is all he has needed since he started using marijuana several years ago .
" My eyesight gets better , my pain gets less and my balance improves 100 percent , " Kwiatkowski says .
" I lose the neuralgia feeling , where it kind of feels like someone is pulling the skin off your face . "
When Fedder 's granddaughter was 11 , she started the school 's D.A.R.E. program , which teaches children to avoid drugs .
Fedder decided to sit her down and discuss her medical marijuana use , which she does out of sight .
" When we first started talking about it , she says , ' Grandma , that 's so bad for you .
It 's addictive and it's illegal , ' " Fedder recalled .
She made a distinction between abuse of marijuana and the careful use of dangerous drugs -- such as her pills -- to alleviate pain .
" She lives with me , she knows what I live with .
She was very understanding . "
Anti-drug groups have warned legalizing medical marijuana sends the wrong message to children and will increase young people 's interest in trying it .
Evans points to marijuana food products sold at legal dispensaries in other states that are marketed to imitate popular candy bars , like " Buddafinga , " " Pot - tarts " and " Munchy Way . "
Steven Demofonte , a 25 - year veteran of the Mount Laurel Police Department who retired last year and testified against the medical marijuana bill on behalf of the New Jersey Fraternal Order of Police , expressed similar concerns .
" Unfortunately , marijuana has been that gateway drug that so many young people that I 've dealt with over the years begin with , " he says .
But the bill 's supporters openly scoff at this argument .
" How can it be more prevalent than it is today ? " Carroll says .
" If I want marijuana right now , I can get it in 10 minutes .
If it 's that easy to get , it 's hard to see how anything we 're going to do could make it worse . "
Scutari pointed to the frequent abuse of prescription medications by teenagers , who raid their parents ' medicine cabinets and hold " pill parties , " where the medications are dumped into a party bowl and offered around .
" These pills are widely available , " Scutari says .
" The whole thing about what the children are going to think really comes to good parents versus bad parents , " says Charles Kwiatkowski .
" That 's just a part of life . "
There is widespread support for a medical marijuana law in New Jersey .
In 2002 , Rutgers University 's Eagleton Institute of Politics conducted a poll that found 82 percent of residents support the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes if recommended by a doctor ; 61 percent says they " strongly support " the idea .
The New Jersey poll reflects national polls on the subject .
A Time / CNN poll conducted the same year found the vast majority of respondents -- 80 percent -- think marijuana should be dispensed for medical purposes .
A similar poll conducted by the AARP in 2004 found 73 percent of people over 45 agreed .
But Demofonte says his organization is uncomfortable with the bill because law enforcement has reported spikes in crime in states where medical marijuana has been legalized .
" People are shot and victimized who work in these facilities , " Demofonte says .
" There 's street corner dealing that goes on around these facilities .
It creates an excessive burden on law enforcement wherever these dispensaries have shown up . "
The original Senate bill , Demofonte says , was " outrageous " because it loosely defined " chronic pain . "
He added that the Assembly 's version , which removed chronic pain , just gives the illusion that it 's more strict .
In reality , a catchphrase allows the Department of Health to add conditions at its discretion .
" Can it help some people ?
There 's no doubt in my mind . . .
If it was solely for those few individuals who need it , I do n't think there 's anyone in this state that would say it 's not okay for them to do it .
I wish someone would come up with a bill that would target simply those people . "
But Carroll , the state Assemblyman , sees it another way .
Not long ago , he had a relative with ovarian cancer who was hospitalized seven times with severe complications .
" If her doctor had told me at the time that smoking marijuana would have increased her appetite , " Carroll says , " I would have personally gone to the Green , called a press conference , found a drug dealer and bought it right there in front of everybody , including the attorney general , and dared them to arrest me . "

Audio CDs

Backing up :
If you 've only got a few CDs to digitize , either because you 're already on top of your backups or just want a few sacred albums , go ahead and use whatever music manager you 've got .
We 've found some decent explanatory guides for iTunes , WinAmp , and Windows Media Player , all of which suggest you make sure you 've got your format settings tweaked to your liking before you commit the time to swapping discs in and out .

What format should you back up to ?
We can't tell the future , nor do we know how much of an audiophile you are .
The safest bet is to go with a lossless compression method , which does n't compress audio information for file size , and so has a better likelihood of being rescued and re-converted if a new format takes over from MP3 .
Both iTunes and Windows Media Player offer their own lossless formats to convert to in their settings .
The free , open - source alternative is to convert to FLAC , which , while popular among serious music fans and the open - source community , is n't quite a readily - playable format on MP3 players and devices .
You can convert audio CD tracks to FLAC , or most any other audio format , using the free VLC Media Player .
If you do decide to stick with MP3s for your conversion , aim for a higher bitrate — perhaps 256 kbit /s. Some notice audio " artifacts " on files compressed at 192 kbit /s and lower .
On most modern hard drives , a library full of MP3s encoded at the 256 rate can readily be fit .

Selling and trading :
Your best deals will depend on your collection , with rare or hard - to - find discs , of course , likely to fetch a better dollar .
We 've previously posted that disc - by - disc Amazon selling can be worth the effort , if you 've got the time .
In my own brick - and - mortar experiences , I found that one locally - owned record store ( in a different town ) would n't bother giving me more than a cursory estimate for about 60 CDs , while another took the time to look for any gems with resale value and provided a final estimate .

I found the best deal at an FYE , because they can quickly scan CDs , match them against a national database of inventory , and offer you firm disc - by - disc prices .
A Tina Turner hits collection owned by my wife , and Black Flag 's The First Four Years netted surprising double - digit returns , but do n't kid yourself — audio CDs are not a product seeing growth , so you may have to swallow your pride and admit your Smashing Pumpkins collection is n't all that valuable these days .
If you 're offered mere pennies for a disc , you can , of course , always keep it , but there are alternatives .

Reader Richard wrote in to tell us about SwapACD , a service he 's found fairly reliable for trading out old , hardly - touched discs for unexplored music territory .
Swaptree is another fair bet for all kinds of media .

If mailing out your old wares disc by disc is n't all that appealing , we propose a fun alternative — host an Old CD Party .
Email a bunch of nearby friends whose tastes in music are n't completely appalling , buy some snacks and drinks , and invite everyone to spread their CD collections in personal piles on your floor , just like the baseball card trades of yore .
Swap albums , negotiate two - for - one deals , and laugh about what a sullen , sappy , or seriously goofy person you used to be .
It 's a lot more fun than getting 50 cents for your Throwing Copper disc(s ) .
DVDs

Backing up : Adam really dislikes having DVD scratches and skips interrupt his " stories , " while I loathe looking at my DVD purchases and realizing that , on a per-view basis , they 've cost me about $ 5 per hour .
How many films does one really intend to watch over and over ?
Would n't your copy of The Italian Job ( the newer , Marky - Mark remake , of course ) be put to better use as spare cash or a new DVD than as an entertainment center bench warmer ?
It may not be entirely , officially legal , but making a personal copy of a DVD for your viewing on any device is the mildest of infractions these days .

Adam so dislikes dealing with scratched optical media that he made two tools for converting them to digital goodness .
His one - click DVD Rip tool for Windows uses the ever - popular DVD Shrink to make it stupid - simple to turn any DVD disc into standard DVD folders — VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS .
Rather than make you dig through folders and thumbnail shots to find those ripped DVDs , he also patched together DVD Play to make browsing , playing , and editing the details of those ripped DVD folders much easier , using VLC for the actual playing work .

Selling and trading :
As with CDs , DVDs see a drastic reduction in value once they leave their plastic wrap , but videos are even more generally low - priced than their audio brethren .
As with CDs , though , there are specialized trading sites , SwapTree and SwapADVD among them , that might net you a bit more cash for your cinema .

If you 're not up for individual listing on Amazon , checking for no -seller - fee periods on eBay , or becoming an enlightened Craigslist seller , I 've found the best bet is selling in a garage sale , open flea market , or other face - to - face opportunity .
Price your discs accordingly — hit up Amazon , find the price for used discs , and go down from there .
Friends of mine have had the same kind of " Wait , really ? " success trading in DVDs at FYE and similar big - box chains that take them , but the best deals I 've seen involve bulk offers for boxes of DVDs .
It 's a guaranteed sale , the discount usually is n't that much , and , hey , you 've already got the essential movie moments backed up to digital files .

If you 're a PC gamer , some of your older games can likely be copied whole cloth onto blank discs , and any of our Hive Five CD and DVD burning tools can get the job done .
Some can't , or wo n't work on installation , because of proprietary copy protection systems .
In general , though , most games rely on a serial number to authenticate a game , so keep those backed up somewhere you can't lose them , like a code - named email to yourself , or on paper you wo n't likely lose .

For older games of yesteryear , along with today 's hot items , Nintari is a good place to test the pricing waters , though you 'll have to negotiate your trade or cash deal on your own .
Alternately , Goozex uses a point - based system to facilitate the buying , selling , or swapping of games .
Game rental service GameFly will buy certain used games and return monthly rental credit .
In bigger cities , a Craigslist post may be worth the effort ( mainly connected to spam replies ) for rare , well - reviewed , or or relatively new games .
Lifehacker readers reported hit - and - miss success at chains like GameStop when we asked for the best trade - in deals , but noted that more in - store credit will be offered than cash — and it 's a rare gamer who quits cold turkey .

Lee Ielpi , president of the September 11 Families ’ Association , is sending letters to public safety agencies offering artifacts .
“ Any bona fide city , town , county , state , corporations , other countries , France , Paris , Lyon , that would want a piece of steel , it would behoove us to accommodate them , ” he said .
In the years immediately following the attacks , donations of 9/11 artifacts trickled out to various entities , but the requests were not handled by a single organization , the Port Authority said .
The agency requires a detailed description in each request of how the steel will be displayed .
Individuals cannot receive artifacts , only cities or organizations .
The requests that are pending supplied detailed specifications for the pieces they want : “ I am looking for an ‘ I ’ beam roughly 8 ’ in length ; however , anything that we could have would mean more than words could ever express , ” wrote Lt. Michael L. Zarella with the fire department of Mendon , Mass .
He visited and chose the piece he wanted , a 10 - foot - long hunk of steel “ twisted like a party streamer , ” he said .
Requests for the steel must also be approved by Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of Federal District Court , who is overseeing the wrongful death lawsuits stemming from the attacks .
While the steel is considered potential evidence in those cases , tests on the steel were completed in 2005 .
The judge has since granted all requests and has given no indication he will do otherwise for the pending ones .
The requests are deferential .
“ All we need is a 1 - foot - by - 1 - foot - by - 4 - feet tall piece of steel , ” read a letter from the mayor and the president of a memorial in Glens Falls , N.Y .
“ It ’s a small piece of steel to fill our big hearts . ”
In Wichita , Kan. , the Transportation Security Administration awaits shipment of a 600 - pound piece of steel .
Officials plan to chop it into eight pieces and display each piece in one of the state ’s airports .
“ Most of these are really , really small airports , ” said Keith Osborn , the security director .
Steel will be displayed in two parks only about 20 miles apart in Ohio : one beside the Westerville Fire Division Headquarters ( “ We plan on standing it up and have it facing in the same direction it was when it was in New York , with the north side facing in the right direction , ” said a firefighter , Thomas C. Ullom ) ; the other in Hilliard , which selected three pieces .
Both memorials will be called First Responder Park .
" No .
They have something to show you . "
( The last time an employee of an airline wanted to show me something it was her written reprimand for eating an in - flight meal without paying for it .
" Yes , " she said , " we have to pay for our own meals on board now . " )
The plane landed and I stepped into the cockpit .
" Read this , " the first officer said .
He handed me a letter from the airline to him .
It was headlined " LETTER OF CONCERN . "
It seems this poor fellow had taken three sick days in the past year .
The letter was a warning not to take another one -- or else .
" Great , " I said .
" Just what I want -- you coming to work sick , flying me up in the air and asking to borrow the barf bag from my seatback pocket . "
He then showed me his pay stub .
He took home $ 405 this week .
My life was completely and totally in his hands for the past hour and he 's paid less than the kid who delivers my pizza .
I told the guys that I have a whole section in my new movie about how pilots are treated ( using pilots as only one example of how people 's wages have been slashed and the middle class decimated ) .
In the movie I interview a pilot for a major airline who made $ 17,000 last year .
For four months he was eligible -- and received -- food stamps .
Another pilot in the film has a second job as a dog walker .
" I have a second job ! , " the two pilots said in unison .
One is a substitute teacher .
The other works in a coffee shop .
You know , maybe it 's just me , but the two occupations whose workers should n't be humpin ' a second job are brain surgeons and airline pilots .
Call me crazy .
I told them about how Capt .
" Sully " Sullenberger ( the pilot who safely landed the jet in the Hudson River ) had testified in Congress that no pilot he knows wants any of their children to become a pilot .
Pilots , he said , are completely demoralized .
He spoke of how his pay has been cut 40 % and his own pension eliminated .
Most of the TV news did n't cover his remarks and the congressmen quickly forgot them .
They just wanted him to play the role of " HERO , " but he was on a more important mission .
He 's in my movie .
" I had n't heard anywhere that this stuff about the airlines is in this new movie , " the pilot said .
" No , you would n't , " I replied .
" The press likes to talk about me , not the movie . "
And it 's true .
I 've been surprised ( and slightly annoyed ) that , with all that 's been written and talked about " Capitalism : A Love Story , " very little attention has been paid the mind - blowing stuff in the film : pilots on food stamps , companies secretly taking out life insurance policies on employees and hoping they die young so the company can collect , judges getting kickbacks from the private prison industry for sending innocent people ( kids ) to be locked up .
The profit motive -- it 's a killer .
Especially when your pilot started his day at 6 am working at the local Starbucks .
Guido Westerwelle , leader of the pro-business Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) addresses the media during a news conference in Berlin September 28 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Arnd Wiegmann
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Guido Westerwelle , who is widely expected to become foreign minister in the next German government , admonished a reporter who asked him a question in English on Monday , saying : “ We ’re in Germany here . ”
The head of the Free Democrats ( FDP ) , who are poised to enter government in coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s conservatives , was giving his first news conference since Sunday ’s election when a BBC reporter asked whether he might be willing to respond to a question in English .
“ Would you please be so kind , this is a press conference in Germany , ” Westerwelle replied in German .
Undeterred , the reporter then asked Westerwelle if he could respond in German to a question in English , only to be rebuffed again .
“ In Great Britain people are expected to speak English and it is the same in Germany , people are expected to speak German , ” Westerwelle answered .
Using a translator , the BBC reporter then proceeded to ask a question about how German foreign policy would change with Westerwelle as foreign minister .
Westerwelle dodged the question , before adding : “ Just so it ’s clear , I ’m happy to meet you for tea outside the press conference and then we can speak only English .
But we ’re in Germany here . ”

Climate protestors in New York are demanding further cuts
The global recession and a range of government policies are likely to bring the biggest annual fall in the world 's carbon dioxide emissions in 40 years .
The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) estimates that global CO2 emissions will fall by more than 2 % during 2009 .
Measures such as emissions trading have complemented the drop in emissions as economic activity has declined .
The news comes as leaders gather at the UN for a day of climate talks convened by Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon .
The anticipated fall in emissions is larger than that seen during the recession of the early 1980s .
Policy measures
The close relationship between GDP and carbon emissions is well documented , so many commentators were expecting that the recession might cause emissions to drop .
But the size of the fall has come as something of a surprise .
The IEA estimates that the recession is responsible for about three - quarters of the fall .
As well as curtailing the business sector 's energy use by applying a general economic brake , the straitened circumstances have reportedly led to deferments on investment in new fossil fuel plants .
The remaining quarter of the reduction comes from policies designed to curb CO2 production , according to the IEA .
The EU's Emissions Trading Scheme is one cited by the agency ; others are improvements to vehicle fuel efficiency in the US , and China 's economy - wide drive to increase energy efficiency .
The full findings will be documented in the IEA 's annual World Energy Outlook , to be published in November .
This week sees two significant summits - a special session for heads of government at the UN in New York , and a G20 meeting in Pittsburgh that may unlock new proposals on financing poorer countries ' transitions to a low - carbon economy .
One of the main stumbling blocks in the process of trying to agree a new UN climate treaty has been the reluctance of some industrialised countries , in particular the US , to pledge emission cuts big enough to placate developing countries .
The IEA suggests its findings show that emissions can be cut more easily than some governments have assumed .

Expats Mark Swain and his son , Sam , have become the first father and son duo to cycle the 15,685 kilometers between Ireland and Tokyo , Japan .
The inspiring story began in west Ireland , went through Europe , Turkey , India , Southeast Asia and China before reaching its destination .
All in all , it took them 10 months from beginning to end .
And the journey was originally inspired by Sam when he was just 10 years old ( now 19 ) .
As Mark , 51 , explained : “ He knew that his mother and I first met when we worked in Japan and there was a kind of mystique about the country .
He did n’t know how far it was and at the time I thought he was crazy . ”
In other words , it was his parents ’ previous expatriation which planted the seed of curiosity in the young child ’s mind about other places .
Furthermore , the journey has done much to forge a father and son bond between the adventurous duo .
On the journey , they averaged about 135 km a day , and would normally use local hostels for accommodation .
While being an expat is certainly not a necessary element in beckoning such a journey , we like to think that it ’s the traveling , adventure - seeking , risk - taking spirit of expatriation that played a part in inspiring such a heroing escapade .

As another G20 meeting rolls around , this time on home soil , the time comes once again for the economically curious but politically unconnected to wonder what is really happening behind closed doors .
But while admiring the pageantry , chuckling at the awkward group photos , and parsing the joint communiqu�s like newly found Dead Sea scrolls , the overwhelming majority of observers will miss the meeting 's dominant theme : hypocrisy .
Everyone agrees that the principal agenda item in Pittsburgh will be the need to rein in the ' global imbalances ' that created the late economic crisis .
Everyone also agrees that these imbalances involve too much spending and borrowing by Americans and too little of both by the Chinese and other developing nations .
In his remarks this week at the United Nations , President Obama used his peerless rhetorical skill to frame the issues clearly and plainly .
Noting that a return to pre-crisis economics is impossible , the president assured the world that his administration will pursue policies to increase savings and decrease spending at home and challenged his Chinese counterparts to enact measures with the opposite effect in their own country .
While this is roughly what needs to happen , President Obama is actually doing everything in his power to prevent it .
In point of fact , every policy move undertaken by his administration has exacerbated the very imbalances he supposedly wants to curtail .
To so seamlessly profess one goal while simultaneously undermining it is an impressive piece of political theater .
Unfortunately , this particular drama is likely to have an unhappy ending � and the ticket price will be staggering .
What exactly are the federal fiscal stimuli other than deliberate , but clumsy , efforts to get people , companies , and governments to spend money they do n't have ?
Programs like tax credits for new homebuyers or ' cash for clunkers ' are intended to encourage consumers to spend money that they otherwise might have saved .
Grants to municipalities allow them to hire workers and spend money locally that they otherwise would have forgone .
Federal intervention in the mortgage and credit card debt markets , where they are now nearly the sole buyer , has been specifically undertaken to keep interest rates low and financial firms solvent � so that Americans can keep buying homes and using their credit cards .
While the Fed will continue to hand out free money to any and all borrowers for an " extended period , " the abysmally low interest on deposits that such a policy creates disincentivizes personal savings even further .
In 2009 , despite the tilted playing field , the American people have heroically managed to increase their savings ( although clearly not as much as they would have in a free market ) .
But President Obama 's runaway deficit spending is undermining their efforts .
The simple truth is that government debt is our debt .
So if a family manages , at some cost to their lifestyle , to squirrel away an extra $ 1,000 in saving this year , but the government adds $ 20,000 in new debt per household ( each family 's approximate share of the $ 1.8 trillion fiscal 2009 deficit ) , that family ends up owing $ 19,000 more than they did at the beginning of the year !
So much for our end of the bargain .
How about on the other side of the Pacific ?
Will the Chinese restore balance by increasing their spending ?
How can they while they are lending us all their money ?
Remember , any money the Chinese spend is money they cannot loan to us .
So , if China really wanted to spur domestic consumption , the best way to do so would be to stop buying our debt .
Even better , they could sell Treasuries they already own and distribute the proceeds to their citizens to spend .
However , the Obama administration is heavily lobbying the Chinese to get them to step up to the plate and buy record amounts of new Treasury debt .
Obama cannot have it both ways .
He cannot claim he wants the Chinese to spend more , but then beg the Chinese government to take money away from Chinese consumers and loan it to the United States Treasury .
In the end , Obama will get precisely what he publicly claims to desire but privately dreads .
The Chinese government will come to its senses and stop buying Treasuries .
This will cause the U.S. dollar to collapse , but it will also allow Chinese citizens to fully enjoy the fruits of their labor .
Once the Chinese begin consuming more of their own products , those products will no longer be available to Americans .
Once they start spending more of their incomes on themselves , those funds will no longer be available for us to borrow .
Unfortunately , that is when our real economic crisis will begin .
The worst part is that the longer these imbalances are allowed to continue , the larger they grow and the more painful the ultimate adjustment process becomes .
But for now , it 's all pomp , circumstance and hypocrisy in Pittsburgh .
Why yes , Madam Finance Minister , I 'd love another of those crab cakes !

In one of its less - reported actions last week , Nasa 's LCROSS lunar mission last week gave Douglas Adams 's Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy the extra-planetary exposure it has always deserved .
A Twitter feed from the satellite sent crashing onto the moon 's surface on Friday channelled the voice of an improbably created sperm whale that discovers itself hurtling towards a different outer - space collision in Adams 's much - loved story .
Published 30 years ago , the classic novel features two missiles , aimed at Zaphod Beeblebrox 's spaceship the Heart of Gold , turned into a whale and a bowl of petunias by the vessel 's Improbability Drive ( at an Improbability Factor of 8,767,128 against ) .
The whale spends the last few minutes of its life pondering its existence – " Ahhh !
Woooh !
What 's happening ?
Who am I ?
Why am I here ?
What 's my purpose in life ?
What do I mean by who am I ? " – before it crashes into the surface of the planet Magrathea .
As Nasa 's LCROSS spacecraft travelled towards the moon at more than 9,000 kilometres per hour on Friday afternoon , it tweeted in the whale 's words : " And what 's this thing coming toward me very fast ?
So big and flat and round ... it needs a big wide sounding name like ' Ow ' , ' Ownge ' , ' Round ' , ' Ground ' ! ...
That 's it !
Ground !
Ha !
I wonder if it 'll be friends with me ? "
Then it crashed into the moon , unfortunately failing to produce the 10 km plume of dust and rock which could have been scanned for evidence of frozen water .
Nasa made no mention of Adams 's bowl of petunias , which thought only " Oh no , not again " as it tumbled towards Magrathea .
" Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now , " wrote Adams in 1979 .
The 30th anniversary of The Hitchhiker 's Guide has also been marked with the publication of a sixth book in Adams 's series , written by children 's author Eoin Colfer with the blessing of Adams 's widow , Jane Belson , and published today .
And Another Thing ... picks up from where Adams 's Mostly Harmless ended , and has been heralded as a triumph despite initial trepidation from fans .
" Colfer has pulled off the near - impossible , " wrote Euan Ferguson in the Observer .
" It 's faithful to Adams 's humour and , more important , it 's also got his rhythm , the cadences and the footfalls that made his style so often ( badly ) imitated . "
" Fans can put away the axes right now , because he has done a fine job , " wrote Lisa Tuttle in the Times .
" I have n't read anything in a long time that made me laugh as much as the battles on Planet Nano involving the elderly super - rich , their personal trainers and a sect of cheese - worshippers who cry , ' You will bring Edamnation down on us all ! ' "
Today I have for you nothing but a classic ; scalloped potatoes .
These have been around almost forever and chances are many of you have eaten them at least once .
If you are not familiar with this dish scalloped potatoes are basically sliced potatoes with a creamy sauce that are baked .
Scalloped potato recipes are usually with or without ham , this recipe uses ham .
It also uses vegetables such as green peppers and onion .
This can either be a side dish or can serve as a main course by itself .
It is very filling but if you have a large family you might want to double the recipe .
Try and slice the potatoes decently thin or they will take longer to cook .
This recipe is very simple and the prep only takes about 20 minutes then the oven does the rest .
During the last few minutes of baking , you can top the dish with cheddar cheese if desired .
Enjoy .

U.S. Intelligence and the Detection of the First Soviet Nuclear Test , September 1949
Edited by William Burr *
Washington , DC , September 22 , 2009 - Sixty years ago this week , on 23 September 1949 , President Harry Truman made headlines when he announced that the Soviet Union had secretly tested a nuclear weapon several weeks earlier .
Truman did not explain how the United States had detected the test , which had occurred on 29 August 1949 at Semipalatinsk , a site in northeastern Kazakhstan .
Using declassified material , much of which has never been published , this briefing book documents how the U.S. Air Force , the Atomic Energy Commission , and U.S. scientific intelligence worked together to detect a nuclear test that intelligence analysts , still unaware of the extent to which the Soviets had penetrated the Manhattan Project , did not expect so soon .
Stalin and the Soviet Politburo were probably stunned by Truman 's announcement ; they did not know that Washington had a surveillance system for detecting the tell - tale signs of a nuclear test and they wanted secrecy to avoid giving the United States an incentive to accelerate its nuclear weapons activities .
( Note 1 ) Joe - 1 ( as U.S. intelligence designated it ) was also a jolt for U.S. intelligence analysis , which for several years had asserted that the Soviets were unlikely to have the bomb before mid-1953 , although mid-1950 was also possible .
A few weeks after the test , CIA director Roscoe Hillenkoetter argued that " I do n't think we were taken by surprise " because of an error of only a " few months , " but not all of his Congressional masters accepted that .
How did the Truman administration discover Moscow ’s secret ?
Shortly after the Soviet test , on 3 September 1949 , a WB - 29 [ " W " for weather reconnaissance ] operated by the Air Force 's Weather Service undertook a routine flight from Misawa Air Force Base ( Japan ) to Eilson Air Force Base ( Alaska ) on behalf of the secretive Air Force Office of Atomic Energy - 1 [ AFOAT - 1 ] [ later renamed the Air Force Technical Applications Center , or AFTAC ] .
The plane carried special filters designed to pick up the radiological debris that an atmospheric atomic test would inevitably create .
So far none of the flights in the Northern Pacific had picked up a scent , but after this flight returned to Eilson and a huge Geiger counter checked the filters , the technicians detected radioactive traces .
This was the 112th alert of the Atomic Energy Detection System ( the previous 111 had been caused by natural occurrences , such as earthquakes ) .
After a complex chain of events , involving more flights to collect more air samples , consultations among U.S. government scientists , consultants , and contractors , including radiological analysis by Tracerlab and Los Alamos Laboratory , and secret consultations with the British government , the U.S. intelligence community concluded that Moscow had indeed conducted a nuclear test .
On 23 September 1949 , President Truman announced that " We have evidence that within recent weeks an atomic explosion occurred in the U.S.S.R. " ( Note 2 )
What made the detection of Joe - 1 possible in the first place was a series of decisions that began in 1947 .
In September of that year , Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower assigned the Army Air Force , not yet an independent service , with responsibility for establishing an Atomic Energy Detection System ( AEDS ) so that physical manifestations of overseas nuclear development activity could be discovered .
Later that year , the Air Force created what would later become known as AFOAT - 1 . During and after World War II , the possibility of detecting radioactive particles and emissions ( as well as seismic and acoustic indicators ) became the subject of protracted research and development work , which included the collection of radioactive samples following U.S. atomic tests .
During 1947 - 1949 , a complex process of review and decision at the Defense Department led to the creation of an " Interim Surveillance Research Net " that was operating routinely by the spring of 1949 .
A more comprehensive surveillance system integrating radiochemical , seismic , acoustic , and other methods was not yet in place .

While such senior officials as Atomic Energy Commissioner Lewis Strauss sought detection capabilities to avoid an " atomic Pearl Harbor , " intelligence analysts did not see a Soviet test as a near - term likelihood .
Thus , intelligence estimates produced at the CIA 's Office of Research and Estimates ( ORE ) were significantly off - base , with estimates produced in 1948 and 1949 projecting mid-1953 as " the most probable date , " although mid-1950 was possible .
Analysts at ORE were so preoccupied with the " big picture " of Soviet intentions that work on the nuclear issue became a marginal part of its effort .
Exceptionally tight security measures in the Soviet Union made it difficult to produce accurate estimates of Soviet atomic energy work , but CIA clandestine operators picked up highly relevant information that ORE failed to consider .
For example , secretly acquired information provided significant detail on the production in the Soviet zone of Germany of distilled metallic calcium , which is integral to the separation of uranium metal from uranium ore .
( Note 4 ) Nevertheless , ORE analysts were so disengaged from scientific intelligence activity that three days before Truman 's announcement they produced a paper repeating the Joint Nuclear Energy Intelligence Committee estimate of mid-1953 " as the most probable date . "
( Note 5 )
The discovery that Washington had lost its nuclear monopoly would have a decisive impact on U.S. diplomacy and military policy ; it was one of the stimuli for an interagency report , NSC 68 ( 14 April 1950 ) , which called for massive military spending to offset the political and military impact of Stalin 's bomb .
That is exactly what the Soviets had hoped to avoid by keeping their bomb project secret ; even when they responded to Truman 's announcement , they did not acknowledge that they had tested a weapon and tried to convey " the impression that the Soviet Union had possessed the atomic bomb since 1947 . "
In any event , the Soviet Union 's entrance into the nuclear club soon had a direct impact on its policy ; it emboldened Stalin to support Kim Il - Sung 's plan for a North Korean invasion of the South .
As Evgueni Bajanov put it , when Stalin approved Kim 's proposal , he " was now more confident of the Communist bloc 's strength . "
( Note 6 )
When Truman made his announcement , he provided no further information about the discovery , even the estimated date of the test , and for many years the U.S. government kept the details secret , although that did not stop informed journalistic speculation about the " mechanical " means for detecting atomic tests .
No one without a " need to know " and a high security clearance even knew what AFOAT - 1 did .
Nevertheless , the Soviets , who had been assiduously gathering intelligence on the U.S. nuclear program , which saved them a year or two in building their own bomb , learned how the test had been detected from spies at the British Embassy .
( Note 7 ) Nevertheless , much of the secret would become declassified .
Doyle Northrup , one of the leading officials in AFOAT - 1/ AFTAC wrote an account of the detection of the Soviet test and two versions were prepared , the shorter one of which appeared in the CIA 's classified journal , Studies in Intelligence .
Eventually , Northrup 's narratives were declassified ( with excisions ) and received some dissemination .
It was not until the 1990s that two anthropologists at Brandeis University , Charles A. Ziegler and David Jacobson , pieced together the declassified archival record so they could produce an authoritative and accomplished account of the early history of AFOAT - 1 and the detection of Joe - 1 : Spying Without Spies : Origin of America 's Secret Nuclear Intelligence Surveillance System ( Praeger , 1995 ) .
( Note 8 )
It is difficult to reconstruct decades - old U.S. government declassification decisions , but when agencies declassified the primary sources used in this briefing book , they could only have assumed that significant information about the techniques used to discover Joe -1 -- the filters on WB - 29s that caught nuclear debris or the collection of debris in rain water , the analysis of the debris , and the finding that the Soviets had tested a plutonium weapon -- were no longer sensitive .
Indeed , important elements of the secrecy of nuclear test detection had eroded ; for example , during the late 1980s , NGOs like the Natural Resources Defense Council , working with the Soviet Academy of Sciences , and university consortiums established seismological systems on the territory of the former Soviet Union for monitoring nuclear tests .
( Note 9 )
Nevertheless , a complete picture of the events of September 1949 is still not possible because government agencies continue to see sensitivities in the nuclear test detection business .
Only last year , the CIA denied much of a National Security Archive FOIA request for information on the intelligence work surrounding Joe - 1 , 59 years after it happened .
Moreover , the U.S. Air Force , which manages the nuclear detection system today , played a leading role in the controversial reclassification effort at the National Archives between 1999 and 2006 .

An inter-agency assessment produced a year later , and only six weeks before " Joe I " reached the same conclusion as the Hillenkoetter report to Truman .
One modification was that if the Soviets were using only " one method " to produce nuclear weapons fuel , then mid-1951 was the earliest possible date .

Documents reclassified at Truman Library .
The information in Vandenberg ’s memorandum to the Secretary of Defense and the attached reports shaped President Truman 's decision to announce the Soviet test .
The Truman Library recently indicated that these previously declassified documents are no longer available in the Library ’s open files .
Despite their reclassified status , the documents are well described in studies by Jeffrey Richelson , Charles Ziegler , and David Jacobson , who had access to them .
Drawing on the finding of Tracerlab and other organizations , AFOAT - 1 concluded that an atomic bomb had been detonated , that it was a plutonium bomb with a uranium tamper surrounding the pit , and that the date of the test was between 27 and 30 August .
Top U.S. scientific and military experts on nuclear weapons , including J.R. Oppenheimer and Vannevar Bush , supported the AFOAT - 1 analysis .
On 22 September , General Vandenberg wrote Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson that " I believe an atomic bomb has been detonated over the Asiatic land mass during the period 26 August 1949 to 29 August 1949 .
I base this on positive information that has been obtained from the system established by the Air Force for the long range detection of foreign atomic activities . "
Further , " [ c] onclusions by our scientists based on physical and radiochemical analyses of collected data have been confirmed by scientists of the AEC , United Kingdom and Office of Naval Research . "

When Washington alerted the British government that an air mass containing radioactive particles was going to pass north of Scotland , London ordered special air sampling flights that picked up more traces of the Soviet test .
While the British had their own routine air sampling flight program , the next one was not scheduled until 14 September so important evidence could have been missed had it not been for the U.S. alert .

Some months before the Soviet test , in April 1949 , the U.S. Navy began " Project Rain Barrel " to analyze debris from nuclear weapons tests that might show up in rain water collected secretly at stations in Kodiak , Alaska and Washington , D.C. " Rain Barrel " information described in this report was critically important to forming the scientific consensus about the nature of the Joe - 1 test .

Roderick Spence , a scientist at Los Alamos , directed the Lab's Radiochemistry Group .
He had played a key role in helping AFOAT - 1 contractor Tracerlab to improve its capabilities to analyze atomic bomb debris ; therefore , when it was time to work on Joe - 1 debris , Tracerlab 's capabilities were as good as the AEC's .
While Tracerlab was analyzing Joe -1 , AFOAT - 1 sent Spence a sample of the radioactive material for independent analysis .
( Note 12 ) Confirming the Tracerlab findings , Spence 's report concluded that the " samples supplied to us contained radioactive isotopes and that the bulk of the activity was due to fission products of fairly recent origin , their age probably being one month or less . "

With the U.S. nuclear monopoly , if not U.S. nuclear superiority , ending , U.S. intelligence began to look at the military implications .
Air Force intelligence made an early effort with this report , which estimated Soviet capabilities to produce atomic weapons and develop means to deliver them to targets in the United States and the United Kingdom .
The Air Force projected that the Soviets already had the capability to deliver atomic weapons on targets in the Northwest United States , using TU - 4 bombers on two - way missions .
Significant industrial , political , and military installations further east would require one - way missions until the Soviets had an aerial refueling capability .
The Air Force estimate had little to do with the actual situation in the Soviet Union , which had only a handful of deliverable weapons by the end of 1951 and did not begin producing them in quantity until 1953 .

During this hearing of the Joint Committee of Atomic Energy ( JCAE ) , a defensive CIA director Roscoe Hillenkoetter argued that " our estimate was not too far off in the first place " because it was an " error of a few months " ( p. 5 ) and that " I do n't think we were taken by surprise . " ( p. 46 ) .
Nevertheless , a fuller picture emerged later in the testimony , when the JCAE Chairman , Sen. Brian McMahon ( D - Conn ) read from the 1949 estimates of the Joint Nuclear Energy Intelligence Committee ( see document 3 above ) estimating mid-1953 as the " most probable " date .
One of the Republicans on the JCAE , Senator Eugene D. Milliken ( CO ) observed that it was a " very bad mis-estimate " and that " we have not had an organization adequate to what is going on in the past and he gives me no assurance that we are going to have one in the future . "
Hillenkoetter had his defenders , for example , Rep. Chester Holifield ( D - Ca ) argued that " you ca n't order a piece of intelligence out of Russia like you order groceries in the morning . "
One Senator , Edwin C. Johnson Johnson ( D - CO ) questioned why the Soviets would " stumble on to the very best way to do this job without a little assistance from some place or the other . "
Hillenkoetter cited the high proficiency of Soviet science , but part of the answer to Johnson 's question would emerge when Klaus Fuchs was arrested some months later .

Thirteen years after the event , Doyle Northrup , who was a key player at AFOAT /1 , wrote what may have been the first detailed account of the detection of Joe I , providing a narrative of the creation of the Atomic Energy Detection System and the analytic effort that followed Alert No. 112 .
He also showed how U.S. intelligence was able to develop a more accurate estimate of the date and location of the test .
While acoustic records at the time of Joe 1 were analyzed , they did not then provide useful information .
" On subsequent review these records revealed weak signals at two stations .
These acoustic signals were very useful because they helped after the fact to establish the location , time , and size of Joe - 1 with greater precision than was possible otherwise . "
( See page 17 ) .
Although this report provides no further information , apparently U.S. intelligence was able to determine the site of Joe - 1 to " within 100 miles and the time to within 10 minutes . "

Americans think that they have " freedom and democracy " and that politicians are held accountable by elections .
The fact of the matter is that the US is ruled by powerful interest groups who control politicians with campaign contributions .
Our real rulers are an oligarchy of financial and military / security interests and AIPAC , which influences US foreign policy for the benefit of Israel .
Have a look at economic policy .
It is being run for the benefit of large financial concerns , such as Goldman Sachs .
It was the banks , not the millions of Americans who have lost homes , jobs , health insurance , and pensions , that received $ 700 billion in TARP funds .
The banks used this gift of capital to make more profits .
In the middle of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression , Goldman Sachs announced record second quarter profits and large six - figure bonuses for every employee .
The Federal Reserve ’s low interest rate policy is another gift to the banks .
It lowers their cost of funds and increases their profits .
With the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act in 1999 , banks became high - risk investment houses that trade financial instruments such as interest rate derivatives and mortgage - backed securities .
With abundant funds supplied virtually free by the Federal Reserve , banks are paying depositors virtually nothing on their savings .
Despite the Federal Reserve ’s low interest rate policy , beginning October 1 banks are raising the annual percentage rate ( APR ) on credit card purchases and cash advances and on balances that have a penalty rate because of late payment .
Banks are also raising the late fee .
In the midst of the worst economy since the 1930s , heavily indebted Americans , who are losing their jobs and their homes , are to be bled into bankruptcy by the very banks that are being subsidized with TARP funds and low interest rates .
Moreover , it is the American public that is on the hook for the TARP money and the low interest rates .
As the US government ’s budget is 50 % or more in the red , the TARP money has to be borrowed from abroad or monetized by the Fed .
This means more pressure on the US dollar ’s exchange value and a rise in import prices and also domestic inflation .
Americans will thus pay for the TARP and low interest rate subsidies to their financial rulers with erosion in the purchasing power of the dollar .
What we are experiencing is a massive redistribution of income from the American public to the financial sector .

And this is occurring during a Democratic administration headed by America ’s first black president , with a Democratic majority in the House and Senate .
Is there a government anywhere that less represents its citizens than the US government ?
Consider America ’s wars .
As of the moment of writing , the out - of - pocket cost of America ’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is $ 900,000,000,000 .
When you add in the already incurred future costs of veterans benefits , interest on the debt , the forgone use of the resources for productive purposes , and such other costs as computed by Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz and Harvard University budget expert Linda Bilmes , " our " government has wasted $ 3,000,000,000,000 — three thousand billion dollars — on two wars that have no benefit whatsoever for any American whose income does not derive from the military / security complex , about which five - star general President Eisenhower warned us .
It is now a proven fact that the US invasion of Iraq was based on lies and deception of the American public .
The only beneficiaries were the armaments industries , Blackwater , Halliburton , military officers who enjoy higher rates of promotion during war , and Muslim extremists whose case the US government proved by its unprovoked aggression against Muslims .
No one else benefitted .
Iraq was a threat to no one , and finding Saddam Hussein and executing him after a kangaroo trial had no effect whatsoever on ending the war or preventing the start of others .
The cost of America ’s wars is a huge burden on a bankrupt country , but the cost incurred by veterans might be even higher .
Homelessness is a prevalent condition of veterans , as is post - traumatic stress .
American soldiers , who navely fought for the munitions industry ’s wars , for high compensation for the munitions CEOs , and for dividends and capital gains for the munitions shareholders , paid not only with lives and lost limbs , but also with broken marriages , ruined careers , psychiatric disorders , and prison sentences for failing to make child support payments .
What did Americans gain from an unaffordable war in Iraq that lasted far longer than World War II and that put into power Shi’ites allied with Iran ?
The answer is obvious : nothing whatsoever .
What did the armaments industry gain ?
Billions of dollars in profits .
What about President Obama ?
" A corporate marketing creation , " sums up the distinguished British journalist John Pilger .
Obama is the presidential candidate who promised to end the war in Iraq .
He has n’t .
But he has escalated the war in Afghanistan , started a new war in Pakistan , intends to repeat the Yugoslav scenario in the Caucasus , and appears determined to start a war in South America .
In response to the acceptance by US puppet president of Columbia , Alvaro Uribe , of seven US military bases in Columbia , Venezuela warned South American countries that the " winds of war are beginning to blow . "
Here we have the US government , totally dependent on the generosity of foreigners to finance its red ink , which extends in large quantities as far as the eye can see , completely under the thumb of the military / security complex , which will destroy us all in order to meet Wall Street share price expectations .
Why does any American care who rules Afghanistan ?
The country has nothing to do with us .
Did the armed services committees of the House and Senate calculate the risk of destabilizing nuclear - armed Pakistan when they acquiesced to Obama ’s new war there , a war that has already displaced two million Pakistanis ?
No , of course not .
The whores took their orders from the same military / security oligarchy that instructed Obama .
The great American superpower and its 300 million people are being driven straight into the ground by the narrow interest of the big banks and the munitions industry .
People , and not only Americans , are losing their sons , husbands , brothers , and fathers for no other reason than the profits of US armaments corporations , and the gullible American people seem proud of it .
Those ribbon decals on their cars , SUVs and monster trucks proclaim their nave loyalty to the armaments industries and to the whores in Washington who promote wars .
Will Americans , smashed and destroyed by " their " government ’s policy , which always puts Americans last , ever understand who their real enemies are ?
Will Americans realize that they are not ruled by elected representatives but by an oligarchy that owns the Washington whorehouse ?
Will Americans ever understand that they are impotent serfs ?

British psychologist , Rufus May is taking an unusual approach to schizophrenia by encouraging his patients not to battle against their voices - but to embrace them .
" The voice in my head says : ' You have to kill yourself because it 's the only way you 'll be free , ' " explains a young woman .
I have been invited to a meeting of the Hearing Voices Network , a group that encourages people to come together to share their experiences .
It is a bit like a meeting of Alcoholic Anonymous : people sit in a circle on plastic chairs ; there is tea and biscuits .

The man chairing the meeting is Rufus May , a psychologist who has dedicated his career to helping people who hear voices .
" Did anyone ever ask you what the voices in your head were actually saying ? " he asks a newcomer .
She has just recounted a story familiar to many of those here , of spending years in and out of mental institutions .
" The doctors told the other staff not to pay attention to me when I spoke about the voices ; they said it would be playing into my delusions , " she says .
Quirk of nature Traditionally , the psychological community sees voices as a symptom of mental disorders such as schizophrenia or psychosis .
Voices are symbolic messages about things that have happened in someone 's life
Rufus May But Dr May belongs to a new school of thought that considers hearing voices as a naturally occurring human difference , such as left - handedness or homosexuality - something to be understood , not cured .
" Many people who hear voices never come to the attention of the mental health services , " he explains .
" But when someone has a traumatic experience , the voices can turn against them , and become frightening . "
Even then the voices are still worth listening to , according to Dr May .
" Voices are symbolic messages about things that have happened in someone 's life and if we decode them , they are usually trying to tell us about an issue needs to be addressed , " he says .
Dr May has been called a maverick and even labelled " dangerous " by the psychiatric community for the methods he uses to treat people who hear voices .
He is keen to show me how he works and so I am allowed to sit in on one of his therapy sessions .
His patient , Jackie ( not her real name ) hears two distinct voices , one male and one female .
Dr May ignores Jackie sitting opposite him and addresses the voices in her head directly , a little like he is invoking spirits at a seance .
" Is anybody there ?
Who wants to talk to me today ? "
Before long Jackie responds , by repeating exactly what the voice in her head says .
" I hate you !
You 're always trying to mess things up by telling her she should n't kill herself , " the voice tells him .
Not all the talk is aggressive , although it is often surreal .
Dr May asks the voices how they enjoyed a recent holiday Jackie took , and while one responds that she quite enjoyed it , the other claims he stayed at home .
Jackie seems drained afterwards but she is convinced she benefits from these sessions .
" I used to be afraid to leave the house but in the last few months I 've reduced my medication and I feel much better , " she tells me .
Harnessing the voices
One of the chairs of the Hearing Voices Network , Pete Bullimore , is testament to how effective these methods can be .
I would n't want to get rid of my voices now , they 're part of me
Pete Bullimore
Pete heard his first voice aged seven , after suffering sexual abuse at the hands of a child minder .
" I heard a child 's voice telling me to keep going , that everything would be OK .
It was reassuring , a bit like an imaginary friend , " he says .
But as the abuse went on the voices increased in number , eventually turning sinister and aggressive .
" They told me to set myself on fire , to slash myself and destroy myself , often 20 or 30 voices all shouting at me at once , " he says .
By his mid-twenties Pete had lost his business , his family , his home , everything .
" The voices just encompassed my life ; I curled up in a chair and did n't wash or eat .
" I was locked in a world of voices , paranoia and depression , and it was probably the most frightening time of my life , " he says .
Pete spent more than a decade after that on heavy medication , but the voices never went away .
It was only when he came off the medication and met people who share his experience that he was able to stop being so afraid of the voices and actually start listening to them .
Life is n't easy .
Pete still hears up to 40 voices at a time - it is worse when he is tired or stressed - making it difficult to concentrate and impossible to drive a car .
But he has rebuilt his life and has even been hearing a more positive voice recently , which is dictating a children 's book to him .
He has already written several chapters , and there has been some interest from publishers .
" I would n't want to get rid of my voices now , they 're part of me , " he says .

Five years ago , car - wash owner Orman Wilson set up a pension plan for himself and six employees .
For that , he may owe the IRS a $ 1.2 million tax penalty .
Mr. Wilson , the owner of 19 coin-operated car washes in Houston , says he relied on four advisers , including a certified public accountant , to set up a plan that received approval from the Internal Revenue Service .
Then , in late 2007 , the IRS found fault with the plan and assessed it $ 250,000 -- plus special penalties of $ 1.2 million .
The penalties " would wipe us out , " Mr. Wilson says .
Hundreds of small - business owners have been hit with similar penalties in connection with pension or benefit plans , says Alex Brucker of the Small Business Council of America , an association representing small firms on pension , tax and health - care issues .
Hundreds more are likely to get hit with these penalties in the near future , he says .
All are anxiously awaiting relief from Congress , where alarm about the penalties ' impact came to a head this summer .
In June , Senate Finance Committee leaders Charles Grassley and Max Baucus issued statements saying they hope to change the law that mandated the fines .
They also asked the IRS to stop collections of the penalties because they were threatening to throw small - business owners like Mr. Wilson into bankruptcy .
In July , the agency agreed .
Fifteen years ago , as the horror of genocide ripped apart Rwanda , Paul Rusesabagina became a hero .
A humble hotel manager , he saved 1,268 people who had sought sanctuary from the machete - wielding mobs , an act of such courage it was rapidly immortalised in print and on screen .
Rusesabagina spent days pleading with bands of killers to spare his charges , buying lives with alcohol when that failed , then spent nights on the one phone line that had not been cut off sending faxes to kings and presidents begging for international help to stop the butchery .
Today , Rusesabagina is once again calling for international action .
Why , he asks , is Britain handing out so much aid to his nation when its ruler is fighting a proxy war in the Congo ; when its elites are getting rich on stolen minerals ; when democracy is a sham and dissent is stifled ?
" We know what happened in the past .
But that does not mean we close our eyes to what is happening now , " he told me this week .
" I did not keep silent in 1994 and I cannot keep silent now .
The British taxpayer is financing a proxy war .
We need justice , not aid . "
He is right to be alarmed .
Britain is Rwanda 's biggest donor , pumping in £ 52 m this year in direct contributions , a form of aid - giving reserved for those that have proved good governance .
But human rights groups are increasingly concerned by restrictions on freedom of speech in Rwanda ; even the BBC has not escaped a ban on its local language service .
And other major donors , including the Netherlands and Sweden , suspended direct aid after a UN report highlighted Rwanda 's role in eastern Congo , where war has claimed the lives of six times as many people as the Rwandan genocide .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Paul Kagame , Rwanda 's charismatic president , plays the guilt card with such skill that his regime has , literally , got away with murder .
His defenders point to impressive economic growth rates , improved health and education , and the healing of some of the genocide scars .
But the case of Rwanda illustrates a glaring problem with British foreign policy , most notably in Africa .
And it is a problem that raises uncomfortable questions at a time of looming spending cutbacks .
Many of the issues revolve around the Government 's golden child , the Department for International Development ( Dfid ) , set up by Tony Blair in 1997 as a dramatic gesture of modernisation .
Dfid is seen as the sexiest branch of Whitehall , attracting the brightest entrants who find the prospect of improving schools in Mozambique far more enticing than improving schools in Middlesbrough .
Its staff were encouraged from the start not to play by the normal fusty rules of Whitehall .
Dfid behaves more like a charity than an arm of government , armed with soaring wealth and driven by its laudable , if rather ambitious , mission to eliminate poverty .
Its first budget was £ 2.6 bn , twice that of the foreign office .
A decade later it was handed £ 5.3bn and next year , as the Government pushes on to meet its Gleneagles commitment to increase aid to 0.7 per cent of gross national income , it will be given just under £ 8 bn .
These budgets are set to keep on rising , whoever wins the next election .
This raises several problems .
First , and most obviously , this torrent of money must be spent .
People tasked with doling out aid rarely win promotion by finding reasons not to spend it .
But there are only a finite number of countries that need aid , deserve aid and are not so shattered that it is like pouring water into a sieve .
So when decisions are taken to back regimes , officials tend to stick by them .
As a result , there is no criticism of Kagame .
And aid flows into Uganda , where Yoweri Museveni 's regime has been accused of torture and repression .
Britain increased total aid to Ethiopia even after Meles Zenawi , another poster boy for this supposed new wave of African leaders , oversaw a brutal clampdown following a blatantly rigged election and waged war on Somalia .
A strange paradox seems to be emerging : the more money spent on aid , the less chance of criticism .
Second , despite soaring budgets , the number of full - time civil servants working for Dfid has actually fallen slightly since its creation .
The number of staff appointed " in country " has also been reduced in recent years .
This is commendable productivity .
But it means more reliance on charities and consultants , more pressure to hand over aid directly and , inevitably , less effective scrutiny .
Third , money is power .
Much of Britain 's foreign policy in sub-Saharan Africa is now dictated by Dfid , not the Foreign Office as elsewhere in the world .
The Foreign Office , of course , has a far from perfect record .
But this sends out a sign that we see Africa as a place in need of salvation , rather than a complex continent of 53 nations deserving respect as our equals .
And for all the honeyed words of ministers and officials , the result is too much emphasis on the ambiguous cause of development rather than relentless focus on good governance , human rights and long - term strategic issues .
The most outrageous example was in Kenya , where Dfid officials tried to prevent the British ambassador from speaking out against obscene corruption .
Only last week I heard of a senior minister who , told he was signing agreements with one of Kenya 's most corrupt politicians , glibly replied that he was less interested in the man 's record than the desire to get children into education .
Little wonder Kenya remains plagued by corruption .
Then there are wider issues about the effectiveness of our approach .
Dfid has won global respect for its tenacity – and there can be no doubt British aid has led to improvements in the daily lives of thousands .
But for all the new schools and clinics , justified questions remain over whether pouring in vast levels of aid help or hinder a country 's long - term development .
As Richard Dowden , director of the Royal African Society , says , it is noticeable that none of the most passionate advocates of aid are African – and some of its harshest critics are , such as the Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo .
Immense sums have been poured in over the decades and significant economic growth remains elusive .
Studies have indicated that aid is subject to diminishing returns as it is increased , ceasing to be effective after it reaches 16 per cent of a country 's gross domestic product .
Africa was close to that level before Gleneagles – and by 2005 aid was already accounting for a quarter of Rwanda 's GDP .
On top of this , the sacred target of handing over 0.7 per cent of national income , first calculated more than four decades ago , appears increasingly arbitrary and outdated .
Our approach to the continent is riddled with contradictions .
We pour in billions in aid while erecting trade barriers that squeeze out African firms .
We encourage land tenure in Africa , then drive farmers out of business by dumping cheap produce .
We pay lip service to good governance , then prop up repressive regimes , do deals with despots and allow our banks to launder their plunder .
We retain prohibitive drugs laws that are spreading chaos through some West African states , having wrecked parts of South and Latin America already .
Then we complain when migrants flee the consequent poverty and unrest .
Few would argue for aid spending to be savaged .
And emergency relief remains vital , not least since climate change will exacerbate Africa 's difficulties .
But our approach to aid , driven by pop stars and designed to appease domestic audiences , seems anachronistic .
In the current economic climate , even some of those who helped create Labour 's policy on Africa admit privately that it is hard to offer Dfid immunity from cuts based upon its effectiveness in encouraging lasting development .
Maybe it is time to ignore the hype and end the hypocrisy .

“ You should go out and meet some new people .
Or some old friends of yours . ”
“ I have no friends . ”
“ Of course you do .
Anyway , you should not be alone all day long , every day .
You must feel lonely . ”
“ I am not lonely .
I am not alone either , God is often with me . ”
“ Often ? ”
“ He is always with me .
But he talks to me often , I meant that . ”
“ Did you mention to your doctor that God talks to you ? ”
“ No , why should I ? ”
“ Well , I may be wrong , but if there is no God , and you hear voices , that could be a sign of some chemical imbalance .
Maybe you need a medication to help you with that . ”
“ Ha ha , you need help .
You are the one who never hears God .
Why do you think that is ? ”
“ Because there is no God . ”
“ Or because you have been a bad girl and God is upset with you . ”
“ Right , or – that .
And why do you say “ He ” ?
Even if there was a God , it may be female .
Or sexless .
Or hermaphrodite .
Or who knows … ”
“ You are so silly .
It is clear from his voice he is male .
He has such a warm , deep , manly voice . ”
“ Actually , most people who hear voices in their head hear male voices .
That is because , beside other reasons , it is easier for our brains to replicate male voices ; they are of a less complexity . ”

Complexity , replication , schmention … or , simply and truly – God is male . ”
“ Oh , whatever .
Please , talk to some doctor about it . ”

With IDA , one can use the command line interface ( CLI ) not only to type scripting related commands but also to send debugger specific commands to the current debugger plugin .
Although the topic mentions device drivers , you do not have to know much about drivers to learn something new from this post .
For the sake of demonstration , we will start a kernel debugging session with IDA / Windbg plugin and execute the ! drvobj command :
We now have the dispatch table for the NTFS driver , but what if we want to display all the dispatch tables of all drivers and be able to easily browse the list with IDA ?
Before answering this , first let us see which debugger modules can receive commands through IDA ’s CLI :
GDB : SendGDBMonitor ( ) sends commands to GDB monitor
Bochs : BochsCommand ( ) sends commands to Bochs internal debugger ( “ info idt ” and parse the result for instance ? )
WinDbg : WinDbgCommand ( ) sends commands to the windbg debugger engine
Please note that these commands are available only during the debugging session .
Now that we know how to send commands to WinDbg , let us see how to answer the previous question :
Get a list of loaded drivers :
We can use IDA SDK ( get_first_module ( )/get_next_module( ) ) and / or scripting ( GetFirstModule ( ) / GetModuleName ( ) ) .
We can also use the “ lm ” command Issue the “ ! drvobj DRVNAME ” command and parse the result :
In IDC we can simply write “ auto s ; s = WinDbgCommand ( “ ! drvobj DRVNAME ” ) ” .
In Python we can use the Eval ( ) to call an IDC function .
Parse and store the result :
We can use regular expressions Finally repeat the step 2 and 3 for all drivers .
The end result is a simple IDAPython script that automates this task :

The Beatles coming to iTunes has been a rumor that ’s been floating around for years now , but just recently it picked up some steam once again , in large part due to the significance of the date of Apple ’s media event tomorrow – 9/9/09 – which is also when the entire remastered Beatles catalogue will be re-issued and when a Beatles themed version of “ Rock Band ” will go on sale .
Alas , the timing of Apple ’s media event is more of a coincidence than anything else .
Citing sources “ familiar with the band ’s plans ” , Peter Kafka of AllThingsD writes that the Beatles on iTunes just ai n’t happenin ’ tomorrow .
The reason , not surprisingly , boils down to cold hard cash .
If you ’re trying to convince people to spend $ 16.99 for a remastered copy of the White Album , or as much as $ 250 to play along with the band ’s ghostly avatars , why offer a competing product from Apple at the same time ?
Nor do I see Steve Jobs expressing much interest in coordinating his marketing announcements with the likes of Viacom .
Pretty straight forward , really .
The record labels are n’t exactly buddy buddy with Apple and iTunes , so why would they want to stifle or diminish the selling power of the remastered Beatles tracks with $ 1.29 individual song downloads from iTunes ?
The record labels may be greedy , but they certainly are n’t stupid .
Well , not completely stupid , anyways .
At this rate , the Beatles might finally hit iTunes when I ’m 64 .
Wow , that was bad , we know …
DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) --
A Colorado man was convicted of first - degree murder and a bias - motivated crime and sentenced to life in prison for killing a transgender teen he met on an online social networking site .
Allen Andrade was convicted of first - degree murder and a hate crime in the slaying of a transgender teen .
It was the first time in the nation that a state hate crime statute resulted in a conviction in a transgender person 's murder , the advocacy group Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation said .
Seated in the front row of the courtroom , the family of Angie Zapata broke out in tears as the verdicts against Allen Andrade were read Wednesday .
The jury deliberated for just under two hours before returning the verdict shortly after 3 p.m. Watch Andrade listen to the verdict »
" I lost somebody so precious , " said Maria Zapata , the victim 's mother .
She glanced at Andrade and continued : " The only thing he can't take away is the love and the memories that I have of my baby .
My beautiful , beautiful baby . "
Andrade spoke just one word .
" No , " he said when asked if he wished to address the court .
Judge Marcelo Kopcow then imposed the mandatory sentence for the first - degree murder conviction -- life in prison without parole .
Watch Andrade get sentenced to life without parole »
The verdict was hailed by gay and transgender rights groups .
" This is a landmark decision , " said Mindy Barton , the legal director of the Gay , Lesbian , Bisexual and Transgender Community Center of Colorado .
Barton attended the trial daily .
" Hearing ' guilty on first - degree murder ' and ' guilty of bias - motivated crime ' was a hugely emotional experience for all the family , friends and the supporters of Angie , " Barton added .
" She will not be forgotten . "
Andrade admitted killing Zapata , but his defense argued that he acted in the heat of passion after discovering that Zapata was biologically male .
The defense asked for a lesser verdict , such as second - degree murder or manslaughter .
Throughout the trial , prosecutors referred to Zapata as " she , " while the defense referred to the transgender teen , who was born Justin Zapata , as " he . "
" When [ Andrade ] met him , he met him as ' Angie , ' " defense attorney Annette Kundelius argued on Wednesday .
" When he found out it was n't ' Angie , ' that it was ' Justin , ' he lost control . "
But the jury rejected the argument , deciding in favor of prosecutors , who argued that Andrade knew Zapata was biologically male and that knowledge motivated the crime .
" This was an ambush attack , " said Chief Deputy District Attorney Robb Miller .
" This was an all - out blitz . "
Zapata was " born in a boy 's body but living as a female , " added Miller .
" Ultimately , she was murdered because of it . "
The case has become a rallying point for supporters of the transgender community , who have held vigils and launched Web sites in remembrance of Zapata .
They are calling for the inclusion of transgender people in hate crime statutes across the country and at the federal level .
Currently , 11 states and the District of Columbia recognize transgender people in their hate crime laws .
According to prosecutors , Zapata , 18 , and Andrade , 32 , met online in summer 2008 and arranged to meet .
Zapata brought Andrade to her apartment in Greeley , Colorado , where they spent nearly three days together .
According to a police affidavit , Zapata was out of the apartment when Andrade noticed photographs that made him " question victim Zapata 's sex . "
Andrade confronted Zapata , who declared , " I am all woman . "
Andrade then grabbed Zapata and discovered male genitalia .
According to court records , Andrade told police he began hitting Zapata with his fists , knocking her to the ground .
He then grabbed a fire extinguisher and twice hit her in the head .
Andrade told police he thought he had " killed it , " referring to Zapata , and covered her with a blanket .
Realizing what he had done , he then cleaned up the crime scene , the affidavit said .
Andrade told police he heard " gurgling " sounds coming from the victim and saw Zapata sitting up .
He hit her again with the fire extinguisher , he said , according to the affidavit .
Andrade took Zapata 's car and fled .
Police discovered the car two weeks later and arrested Andrade .
The jury heard jailhouse phone conversations , including Andrade telling a girlfriend " gay things must die . "
He did not testify in his own defense .
Zapata was 16 when she adopted the name " Angie , " and made the decision to live as a woman .

President Obama has announced a revamp of detainee interrogation A special US prosecutor has been appointed to investigate allegations of abuse of terror suspects .
The announcement of John Durham 's selection came as a report was published detailing the allegations of abuse by CIA agents .
Agents threatened to kill a key terror suspect 's children and sexually assault another 's mother , it is claimed .
The report was made in 2004 but only a heavily censored version appeared and a judge ordered fuller disclosure .
The justice department is reported to be reopening about a dozen prisoner abuse cases .
[ I will ] stand up for those officers who did what their country asked and who followed the legal guidance they were given
Leon Panetta , CIA director
Profile : John Durham Teenager leaves Guantanamo Also on Monday , President Barack Obama approved a new elite team to question terror suspects .
The team includes members of agencies other than the CIA .
It will be led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and supervised by National Security Adviser James Jones .
The administration has vowed that in future interrogations will be strictly in accordance with the army 's field manual , and adhere to strict rules on tactics .
Republican anger Mr Durham , who is already investigating the destruction of videotapes of CIA interrogations , was picked by US Attorney General Eric Holder .
CIA INTERROGATION REPORT
Drawn up by CIA Inspector - General John Helgerson in 2004 .
Edited version released last year Lists cases of abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and secret CIA " black site " prisons in Europe , Middle East and North Africa Says interrogation techniques were " unauthorised , improvised , inhumane and undocumented "
Alleges agents carried out mock executions , threatened inmates with handguns and drills , and made suggestions about sexually assaulting a detainee 's family Finds that some detainees provided more information after brutal treatment Says some methods , such as mock executions , failed Read the report in full [ 6.17MB ]
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here Mr Holder said : " I fully realise that my decision to commence this preliminary review will be controversial .
" In this case , given all of the information currently available , it is clear to me that this review is the only responsible course of action for me to take . "
Special prosecutors in the US are independent figures appointed to investigate the possible wrongdoing of government officials or agencies .
Senior Republicans have already expressed anger at the decision .
Nine signatories of a letter to Mr Holder said they were " deeply disappointed " at a decision that " could have a chilling effect on the work of the intelligence community " .
' Aggressive '
The declassified document released by the justice department said that one agent told key terror suspect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that " we 're going to kill your children " if there were further attacks on the US .
ANALYSIS Kevin Connolly , BBC News , Washington
The question now that these startling depictions of the handling of those suspects are in the public domain is - what should happen next ?
Barack Obama does n't want to inflame anti-American feelings around the world but he does n't want to alienate the professionals within America 's own intelligence agencies .
The problem is that below the cautious pragmatism of the White House rages a partisan political battle .
America 's human rights lobby wants full disclosure , and on the left of the Democratic Party there is a real appetite for proceeding with further investigations .
Conservatives , though , will argue that the harsh interrogations came at a desperate moment in American history .
The interrogators could be cast as dedicated intelligence officers , ruthless only in the cause of protecting their fellow citizens .
Dilemma over CIA tactics
Another agent allegedly told Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , a suspect in the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 , that his mother would be sexually assaulted in front of him .
The agent has denied the allegation .
In other incidents involving Mr Nashiri , he was allegedly threatened with an unloaded gun and had a power drill held near him which was repeatedly turned on and off .
Another incident involved an agent pinching an artery in a detainee 's neck .
As the man was passing out , the agent shook him awake , then repeated the action twice .
Ahead of the document 's release , CIA Director Leon Panetta wrote on the agency 's website that the report was " in many ways an old story " and that he would make " no judgments on the accuracy of the report or the various views expressed about it " .
He said it was clear that the CIA had " obtained intelligence from high - value detainees when inside information on al - Qaeda was in short supply " .
Mr Panetta said the CIA had been " aggressive " in seeking regular legal advice from the department of justice on its techniques .
He said his primary concern was " to stand up for those officers who did what their country asked and who followed the legal guidance they were given .
That is the president 's position , too . "
But Mr Panetta also said : " This agency made no excuses for behaviour , however rare , that went beyond the formal guidelines on counter - terrorism . "
Earlier on Monday , deputy White House press secretary Bill Burton confirmed there would be a new interrogation team for key terror suspects .
Correspondents say Mr Obama was concerned at the number of different agencies involved and he wanted to bring them together .
The new team will be called the High - Value Detainee Interrogation Group .

No , 10 day - old signatures are NOT up to date and do NOT offer adequate protection .
Under certain circumstances , Microsoft 's recently launched Security Essentials ( MSE ) security solution fails to download updates for several days , despite new anti-virus signatures being available on the server .
As a result , the software no longer offers adequate protection against new malware .
These are the results found in tests run by The H's associates at heise Security for the latest edition of the computer magazine c't .
The tests showed that , despite being connected to the Internet , under certain circumstance MSE fails to download updates for up to seven days .
The phenomenon was reproducible , occurring , for example , on a laptop which was regularly placed in sleep mode by closing the lid .
On resuming from sleep mode every day , MSE assured the user , even after more than an hour online , that anti-virus and spyware signatures were up to date and that the user was protected .
Taking a closer look at the date , however , revealed that these signatures were often several days old .
A search of Microsoft 's website showed that the company had since released several update packages containing new signatures .
The computer was therefore not properly protected against dozens of known hazards which Microsoft itself classified as ' severe ' .
MSE appears to have just a few , fixed times at which it checks whether new signatures are available to download .
If it sleeps through these times , on waking it fails to correct this omission — at least as long as the signatures are not more than one week old .
For up to six days the application appears to regard its signatures as sufficiently up to date , after which it finally switches its status to a warning yellow and attempts to download updates off - schedule .
To add insult to injury this test is also delayed , so that for the first quarter to half an hour after resuming , even 10 day - old signatures are shown as being up to date , giving the user a wholly false sense of security .
Microsoft has been unable or unwilling to confirm this behaviour , let alone to promise that they will fix it .
After two weeks of communication , the software giant 's point of view boils down to this : “ those who do not get updated signatures downloaded to their PCs for 6 days will still be protected by the very latest definitions through the Dynamic Signature Service . ”
Microsoft 's optimistic assessment does not appear to be borne out by the facts .
Tests by c't regularly show that the protection offered by anti-virus software diminishes rapidly where new signatures are not downloaded .
Anti-virus software using two - week old signatures typically detects just 30 to 50 per cent of new malware .
Nor is the " Dynamic Signature Service " quite what it 's cracked up to be .
When AV - Test.org tried running 20 pieces of malware , for which MSE did not have signatures , on a system running MSE , not a single one triggered an alarm and all 20 were able to infect the system .

The History
Oskar Blues started in 1997 , and opened as a brewpub in Lyons , Colorado in 1999 .
They ’re best known for the somewhat gimmicky approach of only selling their beers in cans ( claiming to be the first microbrewery to can their own beer ) …
Today , Oskar Blues cans 5 beers available pretty much nationwide .
Ten Fidy was introduced in late 2007 as a winter seasonal .
The Style
Russian Imperial Stouts , like Ten Fidy , are typically dark , thick , and high in alcohol .
The name comes from a type of English Stout / Porter brewed for export to Catherine the Great .
Much like the India Pale Ale , Imperial Stouts are more robust to survive the long journey east .
They are characterized by a heavy malt taste - especially roasted chocolate - low to moderate carbonation , and little or no hops .
Ten Fidy boasts an above average 10 % ABV , and an unheard of ( for stouts , at least ) 98 IBU .
The high alcohol , plus the 100 % light - blocking effects of an aluminum can make this - or any Oskar Blues beer - a perfect candidate for long - term aging .
Oskar Blues is nice enough to print dates on all their cans , and mine was filled on 12-22-2008 , giving it just under nine months to stew and mellow before hitting my lips .
The Tasting
Pours as black as oil , and nearly as thick .
Little carbonation .
A thin head quickly disapears , leaving only a milk chocolate ring around the glass .
Aroma is not very strong , but what ’s there is full of burnt caramel , chocolate , and soy sauce .
Taste is sweet and metallic - perhaps from the can ?
Bitter coffee , soy sauce , and molasses dominate up front .
Also a slight dried fruit .
Hops at the end , not much but more than your typical stout .
The hops are a bit floral and not too dry , typical of popular American hop varieties , and do a lot to balance the initial dark sweetness .
The flavor here is incredibly complex .
The more I sip , swish , and think , the more I can detect .
A sweet note here , a bitter note there , a glimmer of citrus , some burnt smoke .
Alcohol is surprisingly hidden .
A loooooong aftertaste , deserving of at least five or six o’s .
Finish is dry , with a slight iodine bitterness that fills the palate long after I ’ve swallowed .
Mouth is bold and full .
The beer coats the tongue .
There ’s not much carbonation or alcohol tinge .
It ’s smooth , not syrupy .
It ’s highly drinkable - but ’ sippable ’ rather than ‘ gulpable ’ .
I could easily put back several over the course of a few hours , it ’s not heavy or filling like most stouts .
I ’m restricting myself to one , though , mostly because at 10 % alcohol , I might not remember anything past the third .
The Verdict
Ten Fidy has been on my ‘ to - try ’ list for about two years , so there ’s a great deal of anticipation and expectation here .
I ’m happy to report that my high standards were met , but not exceeded .
This is by far the most bitterly hoppy stout I ’ve ever tasted , yet somehow that ’s desirable .
A great beer all around .
Catherine II would be impressed .

THE National Cancer Institute , which has overseen American efforts on researching and combating cancers since 1971 , should take on an ambitious new goal for the next decade : the development of new drugs that will provide lifelong cures for many , if not all , major cancers .
Beating cancer now is a realistic ambition because , at long last , we largely know its true genetic and chemical characteristics .
This was not the case when President Richard Nixon and Congress declared a “ war on cancer ” more than 35 years ago .
As a member of the new National Cancer Advisory Board , I argued that money for “ pure cancer research ” would be a more prudent expenditure of federal funds than creating new clinical cancer centers .
My words , however , fell on deaf ears , and the institute took on a clinical mission .
My reward for openly disagreeing was being kicked off the advisory board after only two years .
While overall cancer death rates in the United States began to decrease slowly in the 1990s , cancer continues to take an appalling toll , claiming nearly 560,000 lives in 2006 , some 200,000 more fatalities than in the year before the War on Cancer began .
Any claim that we are still “ at war ” elicits painful sarcasm .
Hardly anyone I know works on Sunday or even much on Saturday , as almost no one believes that his or her current work will soon lead to a big cure .
A comprehensive overview of how cancer works did not begin to emerge until about 2000 , with more extensive details about specific cancers beginning to pour forth only after the 2003 completion of the Human Genome Project ( a breathtaking achievement that the Italian - born virologist and Nobel laureate Renato Dulbecco foresaw in 1985 as a necessary prerequisite for a deep understanding of cancer ) .
We shall soon know all the genetic changes that underlie the major cancers that plague us .
We already know most , if not all , of the major pathways through which cancer - inducing signals move through cells .
Some 20 signal - blocking drugs are now in clinical testing after first being shown to block cancer in mice .
A few , such as Herceptin and Tarceva , have Food and Drug Administration approval and are in widespread use .
After the entire world 's population blacks out for approximately 2 minutes and 17 seconds , which in effect causes the entire world to see a glimpse of life 6 months into the future , an elite FBI task force is formed to investigate who / what caused the global blackout , whether the events foreseen were simply flashes or true events of what 's to come , and whether or not it could possibly happen again ...

It was meant to be a day of global reconciliation , when the new leader of the free world put all the rancour of the past eight years behind him and heralded an era of unity .
And so it might have been were it not for a short man , swathed in saffron robes and a black felt hat waving his arms around and shouting : " Terrorism ! "
Muammar Gaddafi - for it was he - grabbed his 15 minutes of fame at the UN building in New York today and ran with it .
He ran with it so hard he stretched it to an hour and 40 minutes , six times longer than his allotted slot , to the dismay of UN organisers .
On his first visit to the US , and in his maiden address to the UN general assembly , Gaddafi fully lived up to his reputation for eccentricity , bloody - mindedness and extreme verbiage .
He tore up a copy of the UN charter in front of startled delegates , accused the security council of being an al - Qaida like terrorist body , called for George Bush and Tony Blair to be put on trial for the Iraq war , demanded $ 7.7tn in compensation for the ravages of colonialism on Africa , and wondered whether swine flu was a biological weapon created in a military laboratory .
At one point , he even demanded to know who was behind the killing of JFK .
All in all , a pretty ordinary 100 minutes in the life of the colonel .
To be fair , this was a man suffering from severe sleep deprivation .
The US state department , New York city council and Donald Trump had prevented him from laying his weary head in an air - conditioned tent in New Jersey , Central Park and Bedford respectively , and the resulting strain was evident .
" I woke up at 4 am , before dawn ! "
Gaddafi lamented about an hour into his speech , adding for the benefit of the jetlagged diplomats seated stony - faced in front of him : " You should be asleep !
You 're all tired after a sleepless night ! "
Gaddafi certainly knows how to woo a crowd , particularly at important junctures such as this .
This was after all his big chance to cement Libya 's re-entry into the bosom of the international community after 20 years in the wilderness .
The technique he chose to do so - cunningly - was to blatantly insult his audience .
The representatives of the 192 nations assembled in the assembly hall were no better , he told them , than orators at Hyde Park's Speakers ' Corner .
" You make your speech and then you disappear .
That 's all you are right now . "
He then turned his wrath on to America , Britain , France , Russia and China - the permanent members of the security council , or " terror council " as he renamed it .
Their veto was tantamount to terrorism .
" This is terrorism , like the terrorism of al - Qaida .
Terrorism is not just al - Qaida , it takes many forms . "
In case the point was lost on anyone , he tore up his copy of the UN rule book .
Having thus abused and alienated 99.99 % of the world 's top diplomats , he suddenly changed tack , heaping praise and devotion on the one man he appears to respect .
" Now the black man does n't have to sit in the back of the bus , the American people made him president and we are proud of that .
We would be happy if Obama stayed president of America forever . "
Poor Barack Obama .
Having Gaddafi applaud his stance towards the world must have been as pleasing as being congratulated on his domestic policy by the leader of the birthers , who insist Obama was not born in America .
In an example of exquisite stage management in which the UN appears to specialise , Gaddafi was scheduled to speak immediately after Obama 's first historic address to the general assembly .
If Gaddafi upstaged everybody inside the austere UN assembly hall , outside the building the PR message would have been a little less to his liking .
Relatives of the victims of Pan Am 103 gathered in New York 's First Avenue bearing posters saying " Murderer " and venting their anger about the hero 's welcome given to the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al - Megrahi last month .
That aside , the self - proclaimed king of kings , figurehead of a thousand African kingdoms , must have been chuffed by how his morning had turned out .
Now , where to pitch that tent ?
A lot of hot air
UN protocol stipulates that heads of state addressing the general assembly must keep to time limits – 15 minutes since rules changed in 2003 .
Muammar Gaddafi's 100 minutes was clearly way too much , although modest compared with Cuba 's Fidel Castro , who in 1960 spoke for a record four hours and 29 minutes , also to the general assembly .
The overall record for a non-head of state is held by India 's then UN ambassador , Krishna Menon , in 1957 .
He was defending India 's stand on Kashmir to the security council .
" People went out and had lunch and came back , and then went and had dinner and came back and he was still going at it , " one fan remembered later .
It came in at over nine hours , non-stop .

In his column today , David Leonhardt makes a point about medical malpractice that does n’t get enough attention :
The fear of lawsuits among doctors does seem to lead to a noticeable amount of wasteful treatment .
Amitabh Chandra — a Harvard economist whose research is cited by both the American Medical Association and the trial lawyers ’ association — says $ 60 billion a year , or about 3 percent of overall medical spending , is a reasonable upper - end estimate .
If a new policy could eliminate close to that much waste without causing other problems , it would be a no - brainer .
At the same time , though , the current system appears to treat actual malpractice too lightly .
Trials may get a lot of attention , but they are the exception .
Far more common are errors that never lead to any action .
After reviewing thousands of patient records , medical researchers have estimated that only 2 to 3 percent of cases of medical negligence lead to a malpractice claim .
This deserves more attention .
We can argue about the costs of defensive medicine forever .
But I ’m willing to tentatively accept $ 60 billion as a conversation starter .
It ’s never going to be possible to get a precise answer anyway since , as Leonhardt says later , virtually every incentive in our medical system is to do more .
Trying to isolate and quantify the blame for each particular unnecessary test just is n’t possible .
Still , $ 60 billion is a reasonable enough guess , and trying to reduce that cost is , as Leonhardt says , a no-brainer .
Unfortunately , the real problem with our medical malpractice system is n’t that it costs too much .
The real problem is that it ’s a lottery .
Some people get money they do n’t deserve because it ’s cheaper to settle with them even if their claims are frivolous .
But far more people who are victims of genuine malpractice never sue and never get a dime .
A genuinely fair reform , one that cut frivolous malpractice suits but also did a better job of compensating everyone who was genuinely injured , would almost certainly end up costing us more , not less .
Here ’s a little - known fact that helps to make this clearer .
If you ’re injured in a hospital , how do you know if you ’re the victim of malpractice ?
After all , not every surgery has a positive outcome .
If yours did n’t work out , that does n’t mean the doctor was negligent .
The answer is : you do n’t .
Unless you sue .
Most hospitals refuse to release their internal records unless you sue them and force disclosure via discovery or a subpoena .
This means two things .
First , lots of suits that look frivolous ( because they ’re dropped quickly ) are n’t .
They were merely attempts to see the actual records of a case .
If there were an easier way to do that , the suit would never have been filed in the first place .
Second , despite our famously litigous nature , suing is a lot of work .
Most people do n’t want to do it just on the chance that there might have been some malpractice .
And most people do n’t .
Which means that lots of cases of malpractice are never discovered .
We could fix this pretty easily by making it much easier for patients to see the records of their own cases .
If we did , that would cut down on “ frivolous ” lawsuits and it would increase the number of justified lawsuits .
That would be fairer for everyone , but it probably would n’t cut medical malpractice costs .
It would increase them .
That ’s why the medmal warriors never talk about this .
They like the idea of cutting back on frivolous suits , but they ’re much less keen on admitting that there ’s also a lot of genuine malpractive that goes completely unnoticed .
Even if we eliminated medmal suits entirely , the cost savings would be pretty modest .
Genuine reform , on the other hand , would likely cost us money .
That ’s why you never hear much about it .
Charles Haughey used Royal Ulster Constabulary surveillance technology in political spying operations at the end of the 1970s , a new book on the undercover anti-terror war claims .
Haughey went on to boast that the use of the bugging equipment , which was meant for anti-terrorist operations in Northern Ireland , " changed the course of Irish political history " .
According to the book , Border Crossing , by George Clarke , a retired Special Branch officer , the future taoiseach even refused a request to hand back the two pieces of spying equipment .
Clarke says he lent the bugs – one in the shape of a pen , the other disguised as a 13 - amp plug adapter , both of which he had bought in a specialist spy shop in London for £ 90 – to one of his counterparts in the Garda .
They were passed at some point to a senior commander in the Garda in Dublin .
Several months later , when Clarke asked for them back , his Garda contact confessed that the senior commander had told him that the bugs were now with Haughey , who would not hand them back .
Clarke , referring to his Garda contact and friend as " Garvin " , recalled : " He [ Garvin ] told me that he had pressured his senior officer so much [ for the return of the devices ] that he asked him to visit him at Garda headquarters in Dublin .
There , he was told that they had been passed to a politician who had requested bugging devices and he was refusing to return them .
' Garvin ' was sworn to secrecy and told to claim expenses towards their cost . "
Clarke said that when he had held a second meeting with " Garvin " in another attempt to get the bugs back , " Garvin " had named the politician as Haughey and recounted the conversation he had had with the senior Garda officer .
According to " Garvin " , his senior commander had said : " I have known Charlie Haughey well for many years and when he asked me about bugging devices I could n't refuse him .
When I met him at a Fianna Fáil function a couple of weeks ago , we had a couple of minutes together alone and I asked him about the equipment I had loaned him …
Haughey finished with : ' These gadgets have changed the course of Irish political history and taught me a lesson – that in life things are never as they seem .
In politics , one must have a Machiavellian personality , it is crucial to know your friends ' . "
In the late 1970s , Haughey was rebuilding his reputation within Fianna Fáil after being sacked from the cabinet over the arms trials in 1970 , when he and two other Fianna Fáil figures were accused of arming the nascent Provisional IRA .
Haughey and his supporters were also plotting to overthrow taoiseach Jack Lynch , which they later achieved through an internal Fianna Fáil coup in 1979 .
Haughey had a history of bugging political opponents and journalists he regarded as enemies : in 1982 he was exposed for ordering the bugging of the phones of three leading Irish journalists .
There was no link , however , between the technology he used to do that and the RUC devices referred to by Clarke .
After a spate of sightings around Lake Gunung Tuju , in the Kerinci national park , a team from the Devon - based Centre for Fortean Zoology - which investigates unknown species of animals - embarked on a two - week mission to the region to see if they could obtain evidence of the creature .
Reviewer : John M. Artz
In 1970 E. F. Codd published a paper in the Communications of the ACM [ 1 ] that introduced the relational data model and made an indelible mark on the evolution of database management systems .
For the last 20 years , Codd has staunchly defended the relational data model against the pragmatic compromises of vendors who wished to call their products relational without delivering on the full promise of a relational database .
In a 1985 Computerworld interview Codd announced his 12 criteria for determining whether a database management system could or should be called relational [ 2,3 ] .
Since none of the products on the market met all 12 criteria , bitter debate ensued .
Vendors tried to protect their turf ( the database products ) and Codd fought to protect his ( the relational model ) , Codd 's premises are certainly straightforward .
He wishes to keep the relational model simple and abstract : simple so the semantics of the model do not become unwieldy for casual users , and abstract so integrity can be insured by the database management system rather than by application programmers .
His rationale for these premises is also simple .
Codd believes that data should be shared and accessible by a wide variety of people who may or may not be familiar with the physical peculiarities of the database .
He wishes to deliver simplicity and reliability to the database user at the expense of the database product developer .
This book is a feature - by - feature description of the Relational Model Version 2 ( RM / V2 ) .
The original relational model , now designated RM / V1 , had 12 specific requirements as stated in the Computerworld interview .
Version 2 has over 300 features , only 50 of which were implicit in RM / V1 .
Once the industry has absorbed the shock of this new treatise , the controversy will begin again .
This time , however , the debate will include a new group — those champions of the relational model who disagree with Codd .
The dissension will occur in three main areas .
First , Codd addresses his readers in a heavy - handed prescriptive tone that unequivocally declares the conditions for being fully relational , leaving no room for alternative views or further debate .
Second , Codd has extended the model in certain ways that run counter to conventional wisdom , some of which are in direct conflict with more fundamental aspects of the model .
Third , he has failed to extend the relational model in other ways that would almost certainly have gained wide acceptance while maintaining the integrity of the model .
Codd states that in order to be fully relational in the 1990s a database management system must meet more than 300 stringent criteria .
I have three problems with this position .
First , while the industry is grateful to Codd for introducing the relational model in 1970 , it is not at all clear that he alone should maintain it in 1990 .
Many brilliant minds have addressed relational issues in the last 20 years , and many more opinions remain to be gathered .
Second , many of the features are ill - defined , so it would probably not be possible to implement all of them even if a vendor were so inclined .
Finally , some of the features are counter to the premises of simplicity and abstraction and should not be implemented .
Instead of dictating the features as requirements , it would have been more appropriate for Codd to offer them as his opinions and as a basis for further debate .
The debate will ensue regardless , but Codd 's extreme position on these features puts him at great risk for lost credibility if the industry does not ultimately agree .
Another area of potential discord is the extensions to the model that are not widely accepted as appropriate directions .
For example , Codd wishes to enforce closure on relational operators , so any relational operators must return a valid relational table .
The rationale for this is that relational operators can be composed — the results of one operation can always be fed into another operation — but the implications are far - reaching .
Relational closure requires that no relational operator return a table with duplicate rows , since a table with duplicate rows is not a valid relational table .
A second implication of closure is the need for a nomenclature that will ensure that columns in any derived table are uniquely named .
With certain operations this nomenclature gets very complicated .
In general , I think closure within the relational operators is a good idea because it will greatly increase the expressive power of a relational language .
This power does not come without a cost , and I expect many different opinions on its value .
Another questionable extension is the inclusion of four - valued logic .
RM / V2 allows two types of nulls : missing but applicable , and missing and not applicable .
Granting that RM / V1 does not have systematic treatment for nulls , this extension is complicated , confusing , and counterintuitive .
If simplicity and abstraction were goals of RM / V2 , they have been badly violated by the four - valued logic .
I do not agree with this extension and do not believe many other people will either .
Since the conception of the relational data model , other useful data models have been identified , notably the deductive and object - oriented data models .
Whether or not they are “ data ” models in any absolute sense , they both embody powerful ideas .
The deductive data model allows the inclusion of inferential rules to extend the information in the database to include those facts that can be derived from existing facts .
The object - oriented model allows data objects to have behavior as well as models .
Both these concepts could make the relational model much more powerful without sacrificing simplicity or abstraction .
Indeed , these ideas increase simplicity and abstraction .
Unfortunately , Codd appears to be in a competitive rather than a cooperative mode and criticizes the ideas of others rather than attempting to see their value .
This book has several shortcomings .
While it appears to be highly systematic , with more than 300 features and 18 classes , it is really quite disorganized .
The features are neither orthogonal nor independent .
A feature may have implications in other features throughout the book .
The discussion of a single concept may be carried from place to place throughout the book , rehashed , and even redefined ; it is thus difficult for the reader to pin a concept down well enough to understand it fully .
You have to read the book over and over , and then speculate as to what Codd really had in mind .
Codd frequently rambles on about an idea rather than just stating it .
For example , the concept of duplicate rows arises 13 times in the first chapter alone and many more times in the rest of the book .
It would have been better if Codd had made his case and left it at that .
I often felt that he was anticipating an argument and kept coming back to certain points in order to strengthen them .
I have very mixed feelings about this book .
Some of the new features are very good ideas , and some are very bad ideas .
The book is badly in need of a good technical editor to organize and clarify the ideas .
The book is sometimes lofty and sometimes petty .
Nonetheless , I am glad Codd wrote it .
With all its shortcomings , it is a very important book .
It is not the last word on relational databases , and I do not believe that it will be the standard against which relational databases are compared .
I do , however , believe that it will become the standard against which opposing views are compared .
Whether you agree with the contents or not , this book is absolutely must reading for anyone seriously interested in relational databases in the 1990s .
If you 're worried about taking your kids to see Where The Wild Things
Are after reports of crying children having to leave screenings of the rough cut , halfway through , then Maurice Sendak has a message for you : " Go to hell . "

A story in the Oct. 19 Newsweek contains this classic exchange :
What do you say to parents who think the Wild Things film may be too scary ?
Sendak : I would tell them to go to hell .
That 's a question I will not tolerate .
Because kids can handle it ?
Sendak :
If they can't handle it , go home .
Or wet your pants .
Do whatever you like .
But it 's not a question that can be answered .
Jonze : Dave , you want to field that one ?
Eggers :
The part about kids wetting their pants ?
Should kids wear diapers when they go to the movies ?
I think adults should wear diapers going to it , too .
I think everyone should be prepared for any eventuality .

So apparently I was wrong about Michael Bay being the film - maker most eager to have us all wear diapers to the movies .

Clojure is a LISP for the JVM created by Rich Hickey .
Over the past year it has gained a lot of attention , mostly due to its concurrency features such as support for Software Transactional Memory ( STM ) and other powerful data structures .
The recent rise of interest in functional languages also did n't hurt .
A few months after the release of Clojure 1.0 , real world projects implemented in Clojure are now appearing .
FlightCaster is a new site for flight delay prediction .
Its web frontend is built using Rails deployed on Heroku .
The backend for processing data is written using Clojure , using Hadoop and Cascading , Cloudera and other tools .
We talked to Bradford Cross of the project about the architecture powering FlightCaster , how Clojure was used to implement it , as well as tips for budding Clojure and Lisp programmers coming from OOP languages .
InfoQ : Could you explain what FlightCaster does , ie .
the analysis part ?
Flightcaster predicts flight delays in real time .
The analytical work involves applying statistical inference and machine learning techniques .
The precise techniques in question concerning matters of flight delay prediction do not exist , and even if they did exist , I certainly would n't know anything about said matters . :-)
InfoQ : What 's your architecture ?
In your post to the Clojure group , you mention Cloudera as a layer on top of Hadoop ?
How does all this fit together ?
Related Sponsored Content Demystifying Microservices for Jakarta EE & Java EE Developers
Cloudera is a wonderful provider of services , and Hadoop distributions , deployment scripts , and AMIs ( Amazon Machine Instances ) for folks doing large scale distributed processing with Hadoop .
We use Cloudera to deploy Hadoop clusters on EC2 of between 10 and 100 nodes for our data processing and analytical work .
We have found a tremendous amount of value in using the Cloudera distributions to alleviate some of the complexities of deploying Hadoop on EC2 .
There are only two of us that have been working on the research side of things , so leaning on Cloudera has been a great help .
InfoQ : Which parts are actually written in Clojure ?
Another critical piece of infrastructure is Cascading ; an excellent layer on top of Hadoop that adds additional abstraction and functionality .
We definitely recommend Cascading to anyone doing serious data processing and mining with Hadoop .
All our Clojure runs on top of Cascading in production .
Two main parts of the system are written in Clojure .
One is all the preprocessing and transforming of the data into the proper view for analysis .
This involves filtering , as well as multi-stage distributed joins and such .
Getting the right view into unstructured data from heterogeneous sources can be quite tricky .
For instance , we have to build time series views into the data becasue a lot of our analysis takes temporal factors into account .
Anyone who has really built these sorts of systems knows how much work the data processing can be - and Clojure +
Cascading are a massive help for that .
The other part that is built in Clojure is all the statistical inference and machine learning code .
We would go into more detail explaining this part of the system , if such a part of the system were to exist .
Supposing that such a part of the system were to exist , it certainly seems like it would benefit greatly from Clojures ' lovely functional abstractions , macro system , rich immutable data structures and sequence processing libraries , destructuring , and monadic abstractions for composing complex multi-phase computations that might have intermediate failures .
InfoQ : Do you make use of Clojure 's concurrency and STM features ?
We do n't use Clojures built in concurrency features despite their coolness .
Rather , we take advantage of another of Clojures ' attributes , the pragmatic choice to build it on the JVM .
We just delegate parallelism and distributed computation to Cascading +
Hadoop , upon which we have build a very pleasant little layer that we might open source if we get the time .
InfoQ : Could you give a short overview of how your Clojure code is structured ?
Eg. how you use namespaces , multi-methods , macros , etc .
Having previous experience with functional programming has ( unsurprisingly ) lead us to structure the code in a very functional style .
We use namespaces as one would use them in any other language .
We tend to use very few macros and multi-methods , although where we do use them they are just the right abstraction for the job .
People get the impression that Lisp is all about lots of macros and meta - sauce .
While that is true in some ways , you can and should go very far with the basic building blocks of FP ; lambdas , HOFs , currying , partial application , and so on .
I am not a monad master by any means , but I feel similarly about mondads as I do about multi-methods and macros .
These abstractions are great , powerful , cool , and they get a lot of attention .
I try to use these tools when they seem like the natural abstraction to make things easier , but a lot of the times all it takes is a little rigor in your thinking and you can do fine with plain old functional programming and data structures .
A last word on monads in Clojure .
Some people seem to have the impression that monads are for state , and Clojure already has lots of effective ways of dealing with state , so why use monads .
We have n't used the state monad , but there are lots of other useful monads .
I like the way Brian Beckman describes monads ; they are just function composition in disguise .
Out biggest win has come from using the maybe concept for safe - composing multi-stage computations that can fail or bump into a nil along the way .
Destructuring bind , which seems to garner less attention than abstractions like macros and monads , is really a massively powerful abstraction in practice .
The way that Rich elected to de-couple destructuring bind from pattern matching was brilliant .
I am sure that sometime soon we will have ML style pattern matching in Clojure , people have already been working on implementations .
InfoQ : You mentioned Clojure readers for importing data formats toClojure data structures ; do you use Reader macros ?
Clojure does n't have reader macros and we have n't had a pressing need for them as of yet .
In order to read and write Clojure data structures we just use the idiomatic print - dup , which allows you to define multimethods to dispatch your printers .
Printer implementations are only really necessary where you need to read and write a type that has no built in literal representation .
For instance , we have a special printer for joda - time dates and we also read them back in a special way .
InfoQ : You mention writing out Clojure data structures - do you use that to serialize data for transport , for storage , or other uses ?
We use Clojure data structure literals as both intermediate representation for communication , and for storage .
For example , the output of all our data transformation jobs are Clojure data structure literals , and the intermediate representation in all our Hadoop jobs are as well .
This is a critical part of our layer of goodness on top of Cascading and Haooop that lets us weasel out of dealing with Hadoop input formats .
InfoQ :
Is there something you 'd like to get added to Clojure or the Clojure ecosystem ( libraries , tools , ... ) ?
Someone will come up with a high quality destructuring pattern matching facility and that will be quite useful .
I 'm a big fan of that style of " guard , guard , base - case " composition for programming in the small .
We still do it without pattern matching , and Clojure has a lot of nice little abstractions that make it so you do n't miss pattern matching as much , but it would still result in cleaner code in a lot of places in my small opinion .
I suppose it would be cool if Rich opened up the reader , it might help out for creating nice syntax for things like the pattern matching and monad implementations .
Then again , Clojure is my first Lisp experience so I have no experience with reader macros - so I am just speculating and I do n't really know what I am talking about on this topic .
It would also be nice if Rich does n't reserve the vertical bar for anything so we can keep it as part of our core DSL for conditional probability notation . :-)
InfoQ : Do you have any tips or recommendations for Clojure libs that you use ( d ) ?
The number 1 tip for working with Clojure libs is that Clojure - core and Clojure - contrib are small , so go read all the code .
You will find cool stuff in there .
Keep an eye out for all the amazing data structures and data structure processing functions .
For example , Clojure has a delightful implementation of sets and operations on sets , as well as some quasi-relational algebra thrown in for good measure .
One parting thought is that I have come to think of Clojure as sort of a data structure oriented functional programming .
Clojure has an amazing core set of data structures .
Moreover , all these data structures have literal representations so they work naturally with the reader and destructuring .
The combination of all this is downright pleasurable .
In the ML - descended functional languages , functions have type signatures .
In Clojure , functions have data structure topology signatures .
InfoQ : FlightCaster 's web frontend is written using Rails , and deployed on Heroku .
What where the reasons for choosing Rails and Heroku ?
When I came on board to build the intelligence , Heroku and Rails were already the direction for production .
It is a direction that makes sense ; the Ruby and Rails ecosystems are productive and well trodden paths for building webapps .
Heroku and Rails were a natural choice for the team since two of the other founders had Rails experience , and one of the Herkou founders is close friends with our CEO . :-)
Flightcaster shares office space with Heroku and they have been great !
Having an inside connection surely does n't hurt .
InfoQ : How do you integrate your Web UI with the Clojure backend ?
Rails is not just the web frontend but also the webserver .
We use Clojure for the data processing and machine learning research .
We integrate using a very simple strategy : we have some Clojure code that produces a json intermediate representation of our predictive model , we then push that to the Ruby side of the world and read in the json .
Stuart Halloway , the author of the first book on Clojure , recently published an article showing different techniques of using Clojure .
The article provides several examples of Encapsulation , Polymorphism , etc in Clojure - which should be interesting for developers coming from an OOP background ( turns out , there 's a life outside classes and inheritance ) .
For more general information on Clojure see , InfoQ 's interview with Rich Hickey which touches on topics such as STM , concurrency and also multimethods .
A talk by Rich 's talk on Clojure offers a more detailed look at Clojure features and its design principles .
This is a collection of web - based algorithmic composition toys , written by Tim Thompson .
All of them make use of the KeyKit programming language for processing and producing MIDI music .
The source code for most of the tools is viewable from each tool 's page .
The most interesting toys are noted with .
Muse - O- Matic
In this toy , you enter a word in a form , and get back algorithmic music based on that word .
The algorithm is deterministic , so entering the same word will produce the same result .
There are two algorithms to choose from - algorithm A produces melodics results , algorithm B produces more atonal results .
Muse - O- Matic was the very first tune toy .
Key Chain
This toy is very open - ended and much less " canned " than the other toys .
You specify a series of transformations on a musical phrase .
Initially there are no transformations , and you add them one at a time - they are applied in series .
This toy gives you a flavor of the things you can do , algorithmically and interactively , with the KeyKit software .
Pieces-O-MIDI
This toy takes an existing MIDI file , splits it into pieces , and puts it back together to produce a new MIDI file .
To use it , you enter a URL for a MIDI file ( anywhere on the web ) , and it gets processed to produce another MIDI file .
You can control the number of pieces that the MIDI file is split into .
MIDI Mixup
This toy , like Pieces - O - MIDI , takes existing MIDI files and processes them .
In this case , three MIDI files get combined - one is used for pitches , one is used for timing , and one is used for durations .
The files are combined to produce another MIDI file .
Expresso
This toy produces wildly varying music .
By using an L - systems ( fractal ) algorithm , simple expressions ( literally just the variable X ) are mutated to produce extremely long and complicated expressions - still in terms of a variable X . A note , small phrase , or chord is substituted for the variable X , and the expression is evaluated .
The result varies wildly .
This is one of the best Tune Toys , in terms of producing suprising and unusual output .
Fresh Roast
This toy extends and refines the algorithm used in the Expresso toy .
Algorithmic drum patterns have been added , and up to 8 tracks ( each track using a different random sound ) are generated and combined .
Every measure is generated independently , including patch changes , so that the results change continuously .
Life Forms
This toy uses John Conway 's " Game of Life " to generate music .
The game involves a matrix of cells that evolve one " generation " at time .
There are rules that govern whether a given cell will live , die ( from over - crowding ) , or be born .
This toy takes each generation and converts the cells into notes .
The result is a melody that evolves .
The following are n't really " toys " .
One is a repository for the results of other Tune Toys , and one is a general collaborative area for uploading and sharing bits of music .
Tune Trove A repository for good tune toy output .
Composer 's Quarry
This was a web - based collaborative interface - upload MIDI and MP3 files to various areas , and interact with other composers .
It no longer works .
Israel ’s hawkish Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has sought to reassure people today that hawkishness will not be going out of fashion , as he attacked those expressing hope for a peace deal in the near term and insisted there was absolutely “ no chance ” of that happening .
Avigdor Lieberman
“ Anyone who says that within the next few years an agreement can be reached ending the conflict simply does n’t understand the situation and spreads delusions , ” Lieberman declared .
Lieberman ’s Yisrael Beiteinu Party has been firmly against the peace process for years , insisting that peace is impossible with the Palestinians and that security and stability could be attained while continuing a perpetual but low level conflict with the Palestinians .
The platform won Yisrael Beiteinu a significant role in Israel ’s coalition government , and Lieberman says he will make it clear in talks with US envoy George Mitchell that he does n’t believe in a comprehensive peace deal .
His advice to Israelis is to “ learn to live with it . ”
Welcome to Part 3 of our 4 - Part Series : A Rookie ’s Guide to Buying a Muscle Car !
This series is designed for the person new to the muscle car world .
You know you ’d like to own one , but in all honestly , they all look great to you and you have no idea where to start .
We ’ll assume that you want to really like the car as well – even if you are purchasing it as an investment .
Our series will deal with the following topics ( and by the end you ’ll be ready to wheel your new ride down the road ) :
1 ) Determine the make and model you want
2 ) Determine how you want to use the car ( drive often , show car only , etc . )
3 ) Determine your price range and payment method
4 ) Evaluate the car , set up insurance , and purchase
Since we ’ve already deal with Topic # 1 ( Deciding which make and model car to choose ) and Topic # 2 ( Determine how you want to use the car ) we can now move on to the next step .
Today ’s topic : Determine your price range and payment method .
After completion of steps 1 and 2 you should now have your make and model choice fairly whittled down , and you ’ve likely already started noticing a few prices .
Now let ’s dig into determining what a reasonable price range would be for a particular car , and then go about deciding how to pay for it .
Price Range :
Determining the price range on a major purchase , whether it be a muscle car , a fighter jet , or a dishwasher generally comes down to evaluating your personal financial situation and determining what you can afford .
We ’ll assume that you already understand that and will stick to determining the price range that the make and model car you are looking at may fall in .
So just how do you really determine the price range for a classic muscle car ?
Simple – you need to take a look at what the market thinks it ’s worth .
Just like real estate , muscle car values are determined by what the market thinks the cars are worth , not by calculating the sum cost of all of their parts .
The price that people are currently paying for muscle cars is key .
It ’s a subjective thing that relies on supply and demand .
Also , unlike 99 % of modern cars , 1960 ’s and ’ 70 ’s muscle cars are really not going down in value anymore .
Their value bottomed out long ago and has been on the rise ever since .
Over the past few years we ’ve seen somewhat of a bubble in values , but they still remain quite high .
Now that we understand how value ranges are established for a make and model , it ’s clear to see why understanding how you will use your muscle car is critical when doing your car shopping ( refer to our previous post for more details ) .
If you are planning to have a weekend funmobile , a mid-price range car is going to serve you quite well , and you may even be able to go cheaper .
If you ’re buying a car for an investment a mid-price range car is likely the LOWEST value of car you would go with .
Remember , the unique cars , the popular cars , and the all original cars are going to be at the high end of the price range for that particular make and model .
To see what the market thinks various make and model cars are worth based on their varying condition , simply visit Keith Martin ’s Collector Car Price Tracker .
It ’s the best resource on the web to get an idea of the trends in the industry based on SALE prices of cars , and you can look at values over the last several years on a model by model basis .
We offer a free one - month membership to Keith Martin ’s Collector Market simply by signing up for our newsletter .
Remember , HOW you plan to use the car is a must when looking at car values .
You may come to the conclusion after looking at the sale prices cars have gone for that you need to look at a different make / model , or change your plans in how you will use the car .
In addition to Keith Martin ’s Collector Car market , start taking notice of all the prices listed in the Classifieds section here at The MuscleCar Place and the other online places as well .
Most asking prices for cars are consistent with what the market will bring ( give or take ) , so you should at least be able to develop a trend .
Payment Method :
Now that you have the make / model down , how you ’re going to use the car determined , and have a good idea of what the car will cost you to buy it ’s time to put your payment method together .
Do this BEFORE striking a deal for the car .
Being prepared with information in this step is key to making a purchase that is fair to both you and the car owner , so do your homework ahead of time .
Most dealers do offer financing of some type as a courtesy , but in all honestly the best payment method is the old fashioned one : cash .
Buying a car in cash will help you do a couple of things :
1 ) It will allow you to negotiate the best price possible
2 ) It will secure you from ( potentially ) being upside down in a loan – and remove other risk as well .
If you are buying a car for an investment , the car really can be considered part of your overall portfolio ( just as real estate might be ) .
Never cash out a 401k early to buy a muscle car ( or anything for that matter ) , but instead use cash available on hand or transfer it from other cash investments .
Remember , while muscle car values have been doing well in the past 10 years investment growth is not a guarantee .
Bill Paweski at Arizona Classics routinely recommends to his clients to be mindful of the market – and to be prepared to hang on to the car until the market is ready before even thinking about selling it ( which is another good reason to purchase in cash ) !
Wrap -up :
Doing your homework up - front will save you a lot of pain later on .
Now is not the time to shortcut the process .
The last thing you ’d want to happen would be to end up hating the muscle car that you purchased , and if you follow the process laid out here that will not happen .
Go for it !
In our next and final post in this series we will discuss how to evaluate the car , set up insurance , and purchase !

Apple 's worldwide single - carrier exclusivity model for each nation is seen as fleeting , as a new report suggests the iPhone could be available for carriers other than AT&T in the U.S. within a year .
In his latest note to investors , Gene Munster , senior research analyst with Piper Jaffray , takes on 14 " unanswered questions " that surround Apple .
They address the company 's financial guidance , the iPhone , iTunes , iPods and Apple retail stores .
One prediction suggests Apple would add new iPhone carriers in the U.S. with the debut of a new product in the summer of 2010 .
" For various reasons the company moved from an exclusive relationship with French wireless carrier Orange to a multi- carrier model , " Munster said .
" In France , the company now enjoys dramatically higher market share ( in the 40 percent range vs. about 15 percent in ROW ) than in countries with exclusive carrier agreements ( such as AT&T in the U.S. where the iPhone has market share in the mid-teens ) .
We believe Apple is seeing the increased unit sell - through more than offset the slightly ( ~10 percent ) deteriorated economics per unit involved in non-exclusive agreements . "
This as the iPhone 3GS has had an outstanding launch , with Apple having trouble keeping the device in stock .
The Piper Jaffray report states that the new iteration of the iPhone " seems to have exceeded Apple 's internal expectations . "
Additionally , Munster does not believe Apple will offer another model below the $ 99 iPhone 3G with a cheap , mass - market device .
Noting that $ 10 basic phone models dominate markets like India , he said Apple would likely pass on that segment of the market .
The Piper Jaffray analyst is not alone in believing the iPhone could jump ship next year , as others believe Apple is looking to Verizon as a possible alternative .
Even Denny Strigle , Verizon 's president , has been complimentary of the iPhone this year , as his company is rumored to be fast - tracking its new 4G network for launch by early 2010 .
AT&T , meanwhile , is said to be continuing its negotiations with Apple , in an attempt to keep the iPhone exclusive through 2011 .
While customers have been extremely satisfied with Apple 's phone and have embraced it , many U.S. customers have been disappointed with the AT&T network .
In his report , Munster also believes that Apple is dissatisfied with the current status of video content offered in iTunes .
Specifically , he said the video store is lacking HBO and is often tied to limited movie availability periods .
" We believe Apple is unhappy with the current status of video on the iTunes Store and is working to change it , " Munster said .
" These changes , however , will take time , in the form of lengthy negotiations , in order to bring the rights for TV and movies up to speed in a digital world . "
Munster believes that Apple will eventually offer a monthly subscription offer for TV shows on iTunes .
At a cost of $ 30 to $ 40 a month , he said the company could offer unlimited access to content from network and cable providers .
If the Cupertino , Calif. , company were to offer a subscription model , he believes it would replace a consumer 's cable bill .
I am just back from Istanbul , where I was part of the light entertainment laid on for the anxious international financial community gathered at the Annual Meetings of the International Financial Institutions .
Speaking on a panel entitled the world beyond the crisis , convened by President Robert B Zoellick of the World Bank , presupposes a degree of hopefulness that may be misplaced .
But for the poorest countries , the profound changes arising from the crisis have not just created immediate problems : they have worsened the long - term landscape .
Zoellick was right to pose the question , but what is the answer ?
One legacy of the crisis is that the appetite of international investors for risk has collapsed .
The result has been a flight to safety .
The most remarkable manifestation of this flight to safety has been the flood of money into dollars : the epicentre of global financial ruin has benefited from its folly because despite its humiliation it is still seen as the safest haven in a storm .
By the same logic , investors have fled from Africa because it has perennially been rated as the riskiest region .
Money has retreated back to the rich OECD economies where , although risks have clearly risen , they are nevertheless seen as lower than the historically high risks of Africa .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The flight of finance from Africa is already across the spectrum .
African exporters can no longer even get the short - term finance for trade , the age - old system known as " letters of credit " , because our fine international banks no longer trust their unknown African counterparts .
This collapse in letters of credit has hit Africa far harder than any other region .
If the finance of African trade is now seen as too risky , imagine what is happening to the finance of fixed investment .
Again , the decline in the appetite for risk has stood the evidence on its head .
Even prior to the crisis , the rate of return on investment in Africa was higher than that in any other region .
The crisis has further reduced the return on investment in the advanced economies , and East Asia is now so awash with investment that the return there is also crashing .
Yet the flight from risk will shift investment from Africa to the supposedly lower - risk environments where likely returns have fallen .
Why does this matter ?
It matters because Africa desperately needs more investment .
For decades Africa has been investing only around 20 per cent of national income , whereas Asia is investing around 40 per cent .
At these rates , almost regardless of returns , Africa will continue to fall further behind the emerging market economies .
Yet Africa simply cannot afford to finance a substantial increase in investment from its internal resources .
A domestically financed increase in investment could only come at the expense of consumption .
So if international finance is essential and private international finance is fleeing , the only option is international public finance .
Indeed , this is the hour for which the international financial institutions were invented .
To date , despite the fury of the street protests in Istanbul , they have " had a good war " , being well - led and scaling up their provision of finance enormously .
But almost all of that finance has been to the emerging market economies and eastern Europe .
The poorest countries have been further marginalised by the crisis .
The underlying reason is not reluctance of the World Bank and the IMF to help , but the way that the G20 have structured their increase in finance .
Extra aid , which has traditionally been the source of public finance for the poorest countries , has basically been off the table .
Money has been found for the IMF through the issue of Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) , and for the World Bank through the issue of more IBRD loans , but these instruments have traditionally been largely confined to middle - income countries .
If the countries of the bottom billion are to benefit , the criteria for disbursement will need to be changed .
The potential is considerable .
Surplus SDRs could be reassigned from the many rich countries that do not need them to the poor countries that do : the French government has already led the way .
Flows from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) to middle - income countries are so enormous that even a modest share would be equivalent to a large increase in aid : it is for this that Zoellick rightly seeks a capital increase for the Bank .
Street protesters should be screaming their support .
Yet using SDRs and the IBRD would carry serious risks .
Unlike aid , both have to be paid back .
Unless the money was well used , resorting to them would have the makings of a new debt crisis without an obvious exit strategy .
What does " well used " actually mean ?
It is not synonymous with the conventional aid concern that the money should " reach poor people " .
It means using the money only for investment , which poor people would be highly unlikely to do .
And it means investing the money productively .
Each of these steps would be a new departure for many African governments .
For the first step , use of the new financing instruments has to be accompanied by a credible way in which governments commit themselves to their own citizens not to spend borrowed money on consumption .
This implies that governments need to be able to tie their hands , for example through explicit legislated medium - term budget commitments to investment supported by legal recourse .
For the second step , before spending money they need a prior phase of building the capacity of the society to invest .
Civil service capacity to plan and implement projects needs to be enhanced .
Impediments to private sector investment need to be reduced .
Scaled - up international public finance for the bottom billion through an extension of IBRD and SDRs is about as good as we can realistically hope for .
It comes with a silver lining : the potential of a new seriousness in how African governments use international money .
But there is no disguising the risks : in two decades we could need a new Jubilee campaign .

Apple may have plenty of announcements of its own to make at this year 's WWDC , but it looks like it just could n't help itself from taking a few jabs at Microsoft as well .
Doing the honors was Bertrand Serlet , who took the stage by saying " what a sharp contrast with Vista our OS is , " and only got rolling from there , pointing out " what a big hole Microsoft has dug , " and adding that " they 're trying to get out of it with Windows 7 . "
Of course , Serlet did n't have many good things to say about Windows 7 either , which he says has " even more complexity " than Vista because it 's just based on the " same old tech as Vista . "
Bayer said that the company had been served with 74 lawsuits brought by women who charge that they developed health problems after taking Yaz or Yasmin .
The company says it intends to defend itself vigorously against the suits .
The health questions and the lawsuits may rattle consumer confidence , but the warnings from federal health authorities about advertising and quality control raise larger questions about Bayer ’s approach to complying with government rules , said Michael A. Santoro , an associate professor at the Rutgers Business School who has studied ethics in the pharmaceutical industry .
Birth control pills work by altering a woman ’s hormone levels .
Researchers have long known that taking a combination hormone birth control pill  which contains estrogen and a progestin hormone  can increase the risk of stroke and blood clots in the legs and lungs .
That is because estrogen can play a role in blood coagulation .
Indeed , since the introduction of oral contraceptives in the 1960s , drug companies have greatly reduced estrogen doses to decrease the risk of thrombosis , the medical term for blood clots .
With lower - dose estrogen pills now available , the safety debate , continuing for the last decade , has focused on whether the type of progestin in a formula may also play a role in the risk of cardiovascular problems .
In 2001 , the F.D.A. approved Yasmin , which contains a novel progestin called drospirenone .
Yaz , which contains drospirenone and a lower dose of estrogen , received agency approval in 2006 .
For women seeking contraception , the drug is also approved to treat severe emotional and physical symptoms called premenstrual dysphoric disorder and for moderate acne .
Because drospirenone can increase potassium levels in the body , it may put women who have liver or kidney problems at risk for serious heart problems , according to the drug label .
Studies on the safety of birth control pills have reported different results on the risks of progestins .
Image Anne Marie Eakins is suing Bayer , saying that she developed blood clots in her lungs after taking Yaz .
Labels for Yasmin and Yaz by Bayer contain warnings about the risk of side effects like blood clots and strokes .

One large - scale study in Europe , sponsored by Bayer , reported that there was no difference in the risk of cardiovascular problems or death in women taking drospirenone birth control pills compared to women who took pills that contained levonorgestrel , a progestin that has been used since the 1970s .
As chance would have it , New York Fashion
Week starts tomorrow and for a moment last week , it did look as if something might bring about a healthy change to an industry that has proven remarkably resistant to previous efforts .
But this has nothing to do with a model showing some tummy fat .
That particular photo , posed for in an American fashion magazine , has been exhaustively discussed everywhere , from the Guardian to GMTV .
According to one hyperbolic newspaper headline , it might even " blow fashion apart " and , according to another , " start a catwalk revolution . "
Dear readers , I can exclusively reveal to you that this will not happen – not this week , not ever .
I do n't care how many times the same two models get wheeled out to say that Jean - Paul Gaultier loves their bounteous cleavage ( well , he let them appear in a show , once , possibly just after the transvestite model ) , the fashion industry is not interested in making women feel better about themselves .
Fashion is about making people want something they are unlikely to get , whether it be a flat stomach or a £ 5,000 Fendi coat , and any satisfaction achieved is fleeting and faintly disappointing .
' Tis not for naught that the fashion world 's usual drug of choice is cocaine .
Yes , fashion 's obsession with thinness is sick .
But I 'd like to talk about something else .
Last week , just as Lorraine Kelly was cooing over the " pioneering " photo , a fashion designer in Los Angeles was notching up a different kind of first .
Anand Jon Alexander , known professionally as Anand Jon , has achieved a certain kind of success since moving to America from India : his clothes have been worn by Paris Hilton , he has appeared on America 's Next Top Model .
Then , last week , he was sentenced to 59 years in prison , having been found guilty of 16 counts , including sexual battery and performing lewd acts on a child .
In other words , Alexander , 35 , had for many , many years been raping models who worked for him , some of whom were only 14 at the time .
These 16 counts only relate to charges in California – he is still awaiting similar charges in Texas and New York .
Yet this was barely reported in the UK , and even the US coverage was pretty limited , certainly compared to that of the PR stunt of the model showing her tummy .
Even more than eating disorders , the fashion industry 's real dirty secret is the sexual abuse of models , male and female , and last week when I spoke to models and editors about the Alexander case , the only surprise they expressed was not at what he had done , but that the models had come forward at all .
This rare conviction going almost unnoticed is a missed opportunity of literally criminal proportions .
One picture of a normal - sized model is commendable , but it will not effect any real change .
Widespread coverage of the Alexander case , however , could have forced the industry to at least acknowledge this issue .
Instead , it has been brushed aside .
It is impossible to say how common assaults on models by people in the business are because so few are reported , partly for the usual reason assaults often go unreported ( a sense of shame on the woman 's part ) , but also because of some factors specific to the fashion industry : models are often very young ; they fear they wo n't work again if they " cause a fuss " .
Model Cohen describes it as " a reality in the industry " .
" I know a model who , when she was 16 , went to Paris on a photoshoot with a very famous photographer and he sexually assaulted her .
She was stunned but did n't say anything , " says Sara Ziff , a model in New York .
When Ziff herself was 15 , she had to explain to a photographer that she was n't interested , " and I was lucky in that he was fine about it . "
Also , she points out , fashion is a very small industry in that " all the important people know each other , and look out for each other . "
Or , in other words , cover for each other .
Katie W , a model , testified that Alexander had contacted her via a website ( " I was really excited when I got the email , " she told the court ) and , after personally assuring her mother that he would look after her , invited her to meet him .
" He said , ' If you 're going to be a fashion model in runway shows , you know , they get naked backstage .
You gotta be comfortable being naked . '
It made sense at the time . "
And then he raped her .
There have been efforts to change this .
Ziff recently made a film , Picture Me , about this problem in the industry .
In this country , Victoria Keon - Cohen and her fellow model Dunja Knezevic , have established the first union for models , protecting its members against these kinds of abuses .
Erin O'Connor has been similarly proactive helping younger colleagues .
The fact that all these efforts have come from models as opposed to the outside media ( which gets too distracted with painting models as evil fem - bots and harbingers of eating disorders to see them as underpaid homesick teenagers ) , suggests maybe people find the idea of models making them feel fat more upsetting than the very real fact of models being raped .
This is not to diminish the weirdness of fashion 's fetishisation of thinness – just a suggestion there are other problems worthy of attention , too .
Fashion is often accused , rightly , of being obsessed with surfaces .
But last week it was everyone else who was too busy ogling a model 's tummy to look beneath the depths and beyond the PR stunts .
Just because you can see a model 's fat roll , does n't mean the image has n't been airbrushed .

President Obama ’s critics often complain that he is overexposed and on television too much , but the ratings disagree .
The latest example of this was the president ’s Monday night appearance on David Letterman ’s The Late Show .
Obama delivered Letterman his highest ratings in four years and over 7 million total viewers .
It seems that Americans still like to watch this president .
Here is the video :

The size of the victory for Letterman was pretty stunning .
Letterman beat Conan O’Brien ’s
The Tonight Show in every audience category , and absolutely trounced O’Brien 7.218 million viewers to 2. 44 million .
Obama ‘s appearance on Letterman also meant good things for CBS ’
The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson , which pulled in its biggest audience ever of 3.2 million .
Ferguson also beat all of his competition , and he outdrew Conan O’Brien .
Over at NBC , the transition from Leno to Conan has not gone smoothly .
O’Brien has lost Leno ’s older audience , while have Leno himself back on the network at 10 PM has not helped The Tonight Show in the least .
Some people may wonder why President Obama chose to appear on Letterman over O’Brien .
The answer has everything to do with show location .
O’Brien is located in Los Angeles now , but Obama was already heading to address the UN , so it made sense for him to appear on the NYC based Letterman .
All of the right wing whining about Obama being overexposed has its basis in their own hopes that people will get sick of seeing Obama .
However , the ratings continue to demonstrate that when this president hits the talk show circuit , people tune in , which tells me that a majority of Americans still like this president , and will tune in to see what he has to say .
This powerful documentary reveals the great cosmic conflict between good and evil now being waged over Planet Earth !
“ Basterds ” at the box office
There are actually four new major releases coming out this weekend , but only one you ’ll likely be hearing much about … and you ’ve already been hearing about it , and hearing about it , and hearing about it , and we ( mostly me ) here at Premium Hollywood have been as guilty as anyone .
Quentin Tarantino ’s “ Inglourious Basterds ” is set to make upwards of $ 25 million says jolly Carl DiOrio of THR and The Wrap ’s Lucas Shaw .
Those of you who have been following this know that the film ’s take has been given more attention than a lot of movies because many suspect it will be crucial to the fortunes of Harvey and Bob Weinstein , formerly of Miramax and now of The Weinstein Company .
( They say that they ’re actually doing okay . )
Harvey Weinstein is such a well known character that all the makers of “ Entourage ” had to do was hire similarly proportioned character actor Maury Chaykin and call him “ Harvey ” and 1/3 of the audience probably knew who was referenced .
The Weinsteins have always been something of a throwback to the movie moguls of old times with their seat of the pants judgments and risk taking , so that lends a bit drama to the matter .
As for the critical reception , it ’s about as good as Tarantino and the Weinsteins could have asked for , especially given that the film ’s Cannes premier was greeted with a chorus that some have described as negative but was really all over the place ; some proclaimed instant love , others expressed varying degrees of disappointment , and others were baffled .
Now , after some apparently very effective tinkering on Tarantino ’s part , the U.S. chorus at is singing mostly in harmony with an 88 % “ Fresh ” at Rotten Tomatoes .
Though there has been a smattering of controversy over the film ’s “ once upon a time in Nazi occupied France ” tone / plot no -longer - surprises , it ’s a far cry even from the debates over violence that raged over “ Kill Bill , Volume 1 . ”
Oh well , one less source of free publicity .
There is an additional lure this time .
For once , Tarantino is n’t reviving the career of his lead actor but is actually benefiting from the presence of an A - lister in no particular need of a comeback in Brad Pitt .
The possible fly in the ointment is that we critics are different from other people : we see more films .
No director on the planet so makes movies for movie fans as Tarantino and , as with his other films , there ’s always the chance that viewers who are n’t fully steeped in cinema might be lost at sea .
As Anne Thompson wrote a couple of weeks back after seeing what she thought was a greatly improved cut of the film :
“ Inglourious Basterds ” is great fun — for cinephiles .
It ’s not a mainstream movie .
If it gets to $ 50 million domestic there will be cheers through the corridors of Universal and Weinstein Co .
And it should easily do better than that overseas .
That second part of Thompson ’s prophesy has already begun to be proven , with Variety ‘s Pamela McClintock reporting Tarantino ’s strongest opening yet in France , Belgium , and Francophone Switzerland .
As for the reaction of regular ol ’
Americans , only time will tell .
Still , everybody seems to be expecting it to defeat the similarly male - leaning and violent “ District 9 ” and at least match the $ 25.1 million opening weekend of “ Kill Bill , Volume 2 .
Carl DiOrio is guessing $ 8 - 10 million for the new release from Tarantino ’s good pal and “ Grindhouse ” partner , Robert Rodriguez , who is using the same weekend to put out a film aimed at a completely different audience .
Rodgriguez is almost the definition of an uneven director and his last family film , “ The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl ” was detested by PH / Bullz - Eye ’s David Medsker and earned the eternal enmity of another family man of my acquaintance .
( Of course , the hatred is exacerbated by the fact that his kids liked it , forcing him to endure parts of it over and over again . )
The PG - rated comedy , “ Shorts , ” got a similar 1 - star reaction from Medsker but it did slightly better with critics as a whole with an unimpressive 36 % RT rating .
Still , I ’m sure my friend will be hoping this one flies well below his kids ’ radar , and he might not be alone .
“ Shorts ” may be booked into nearly as many theaters ( 3,000 + ) as “ Basterds , ” but I doubt RR and QT will be mutually high - fiving each other over similar mega-million receipts on Sunday night .
Booked into just under 2,000 screens , “ Post Grad ” is a PG - 13 comedy starring Alexis Bledel of “ Gilmore Girls ” and “ Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants ” about a recent college graduate who returns home to her wacky parents ( Michael Keaton and Jane Lynch ) .
It failed to impress our own Jason Zingale and did even worse with critics as a whole , netting a miserable 6 % “ Fresh ” rating .
Expectations are very , very modest — perhaps $ 5 million or so .
The last of the new major releases is a semi- interesting movie anomaly from Disney / ESPN .
“ X - Games 3 - D : The Movie ” will on about 1,300 3 - D screens for a special one - week only engagement .
Unfortunately , critics are n’t seeing anything special here other than an lengthy and expensive advertisement for the popular games and overall expectations here seem nearly as muted .
There ’s obviously an audience for this sort of thing , but I guess they ’ll be too busy seeing the Basterd ’s bash their way through alternative history .
Like I ’ve been saying , this is Tarantino ’s week .
There ’s an old math paradox that says that all natural numbers are interesting , since otherwise there would have to be a smallest uninteresting number , and that in itself is pretty interesting .
Of course , this is meant to show that ideas in the English language do not always translate to well - defined mathematical concepts , but let ’s ignore our better mathematical sense and tinker with the idea of how interesting different numbers are a little bit .
In particular , I claim that 11630 is utterly bland and uninteresting .
Why 11630 ?
Before saying why 11630 is uninteresting , I should probably say what I consider “ interesting ” to even mean .
Interesting , to me , means that it has some ( semi-unique ) mathematical property that sets it apart from other numbers .
11 is interesting because it is prime , 16 is interesting because it is a perfect power ( 16 = 42 ) , and so on .
Clearly , there is some ambiguity in this definition , since one could consider composite numbers interesting , just as I considered prime numbers interesting .
Additionally , do we consider 2719 interesting simply because it is prime ?
I ’d say no , since there are hundreds of prime numbers that come before it — perhaps only the first few numbers that satisfy a given property should be considered interesting as a result of it ?
Using these ideas , it seems like determining how interesting a number is would be a task perfectly suited to the Online Encyclopedia of Integer sequences ( OEIS ) .
If you ’re unfamiliar with it ( i.e. , if you ’re not a math person and have no place reading my blog ) , the OEIS is a database containing thousands of ( you guessed it ) integer sequences that have been submitted by users over the last decade or so ( such as the sequence of prime numbers 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , … and the sequence of perfect powers 1 , 4 , 8 , 9 , 16 , … ) .
Presumably , if an integer is interesting then it will appear in at least one or two of the 159437 sequences contained in the database , right ?
Indeed , it seems that we can get a rough idea of how interesting a number is by looking at how many sequences that number appears in in the database compared to other numbers of similar size .
11630 is the first number that is not listed in a single sequence in the OEIS .
It is not prime , nor is it highly composite ( 11630 = 2×5×1163 ) .
It does n’t have any particularly notable residue properties , and it does n’t come up in counting problems .
It ’s boring in every way , and it seems as though not a single mathematician has found a use for it in the last dozen or so years ( let me know if you ’ve discovered otherwise ) .
What Numbers are Interesting ?
First off , I ’m not going to deal with particularly small numbers ( say in the range of 1 – 50 ) since , as the strong law of small numbers quips , these numbers will appear all over the place just because they ’re small .
You could probably argue that most ( if not all ) of them are interesting , so I ’ll instead take a look at a couple larger numbers that are particularly interesting .
The number 421 appears in some 1894 sequences , while most numbers that size appear in about 940 sequences .
This seems to indicate that 421 is a particularly interesting number , but why ?
What ’s so special about 421 ?
Well , it ’s prime ( in fact , it ’s a twin prime , Pythagorean prime , cuban prime , lucky number of Euler prime , additive prime , and irregular prime ) , it ’s congruent to 1 mod 2,3,4 , 5 , 6,7 , 10 , 12 , it ’s the sum of five primes , and 4212 = 4202 + 292 .
Similarly , 512 appears in 2116 sequences even though most numbers around 512 appear in about 800 sequences .
This is perhaps less surprising than 421 , since 512 = 29 = 83 = 162 + 162 is a number that somehow seems “ nice ” due to it being a perfect power .
Additionally , 512 is a Leyland number , Harshad number , and it comes up in all sorts of counting problems .
What of the Paradox ?
Recalling the paradox from earlier , we are now forced to ask ourselves whether or not 11630 is now interesting as a result of it being the first number not included in the OEIS .
Rather than come up with an answer , I ’m going to take the easy way out and let the OEIS decide .
The sequence of uninteresting numbers is 11630 , 12067 , 12407 , 12887 , 13258 , 13794 , 13882 , 13982 , 14018 , 14163 , … Let ’s submit that to the OEIS and see if they consider it to be interesting or not .
Update [ June 13 , 2009 ] : I got word back via e-mail today that this sequence did n’t make the cut .
So there you have it — these numbers truly are uninteresting .
Update [ November 12 , 2009 ] :
It looks like 11630 is now listed in the OEIS .
Additionally , 12067 was recently added , meaning that 12407 is now the first uninteresting number .
Update [ October 7 , 2011 ] : Interested readers might want to check out this paper , which explores similar questions and mentions the numbers computed here .
Update [ November 14 , 2011 ] : The British television show QI recently aired a segment on exactly this topic .
See the video here .
Update [ November 22 , 2013 ] : A whole bunch of these numbers have been added to the OEIS lately , making 14228 the new first uninteresting number .

Britain has developed an astonishing culture of public self - harm .
Almost every politician or commentator wants to earn their credentials as economically literate by outdoing each other in calling for Britain to cut its £ 175 bn budget deficit and as soon and by as much as possible .
On all sides they say there must be honesty with voters about the swingeing pain ahead .
The case is obvious .
There seems almost complete ignorance that the 22 April Budget already committed the government to halving the budget deficit in the four years from 2010 / 11 through a mixture of a radically reduced rate of public spending growth and tax increases .
But when Alistair Darling repeated the commitment in Cardiff last week in a good speech , making the case for government activism and investment – and again in his Observer article today – he is hailed as a conquering hero and tribune of honesty .
He has won the argument with Gordon Brown over Labour 's strategy , it is confidently asserted , so demonstrating his new autonomy having survived Brown 's attempted sacking .
No longer is the choice between Tory cuts and Labour investment , as Brown wanted .
Now it is to be between the nice and nasty cutters , despite the fact that the trajectory of falling borrowing is exactly the same as it was five months ago .
These new economic literates plainly do not read the Budget background papers .
Meanwhile , David Cameron and George Osborne , who had been developing an interesting argument , if with little flesh , for a high - investment , moral , environmentally sustainable capitalism , have decided that the national debt peaking at some 80 % of GDP constitutes a national emergency .
Never mind that since 1750 the national debt has always been proportionally higher than this , except for two 40 - year periods – one at the end of the 19th century and the other from the 1970s until now .
From 1750 to 1870 , Britain won wars , assembled an astonishing navy , built an empire and launched the Industrial Revolution to become the envy of Europe , yet the national debt was consistently above 80 % of GDP .
Nobody cared .
High national debt was a precondition for winning two world wars in the 20th century .
Periods when the over - riding preoccupation has been lowering the national debt have coincided with industrial , economic and strategic decline .
So it will again .
Nor does it seem to count for anything that the " runaway " increase in public spending and borrowing has been a central plank in avoiding a slump .
The Conservative party has a sacred duty to restore discipline and order against the free - wheeling socialist spendthrifts .
Thus David Cameron is " taking a lead " with a populist attack on reducing the pay , perks and numbers of MPs .
He remarked ruefully that it was a pinprick beside the enormous scale of what has to be done , but even democracy must share in the pain .
Later , 20 Conservative councils were paraded as exemplary cost -cutters .
Nobody is for waste .
There are complex reasons why so much of central government is poorly managed and that 's not just to do with strong trade unions .
Dealing with it requires wholesale cultural and even structural change , which wo n't be helped by using the language of a jihad against the state .
The public sector workers need to be made into allies ; instead , they must by now fear for their job and pensions , caught in a political discourse in which public activity is the same as being a leech .
It is not clever .
Yes , Britain entered the recession with borrowing that was too high .
Brown had fallen for his own over - optimistic rhetoric .
Nor can borrowing now remain at £ 175 bn .
But it wo n't .
Darling will tighten the purse strings , even as Brown shrank from doing so .
Public borrowing will peak .
It will then halve over four years .
Then the national debt will be more than manageable .
The rating agency Moodys confirmed last week that the triple A status on our debt remains .
So let 's have an " honest " debate .
First , there should be recognition of the breathtaking success of the most aggressively Keynesian economic stance taken since the war and how the state has been forced to come to the aid of a feckless private sector in order to relieve the prospect of mass unemployment and business collapse .
The intellectual and practical lesson is that there is a profound relationship between the public and private .
The private sector does not organise itself optimally in markets ; it needs constant monitoring , regulating and stimulating .
The architecture in which it operates , employs and innovates has to be consciously designed or it will be dysfunctional .
The state is the system designer , collective investor and risk manager and taxation is its due deserts and enables it to discharge its function .
Rolling it back mindlessly comes from the same economic mindset that gave us the credit boom and subsequent collapse .
The debate should not be how much self - harm we can inflict on ourselves , but how to build on the lessons learnt from the crisis and create a high - investment , fair capitalism , a cause that the Tory high command has now semi-abandoned .
In the same way Keynesianism works at a high level , so it works at micro level .
The allegedly self - organising market is delivering far too low a level of business start - ups and far too few of these firms survive to become fully - fledged , medium - sized enterprises , a crisis made worse by the collapse of credit .
Too much entrepreneurship in Britain comes from the same school as the four MG Rover directors , who directed tens of millions into their own pockets , or those traders earning absurd bonuses for being micro-seconds ahead in some socially useless trading .
Yet the scientific and technological opportunities are growing exponentially .
Labour has helped the scientific community so that we are only just behind our competitor nations in innovation .
What we should now be discussing as a country is how to build on this and develop it into a system fostering productive – rather than Arthur Daley - style – entrepreneurs .
On top , we need a world class - infrastructure – from a high - speed rail network to great schools and universities .
Then there should be a discussion about better enabling and equipping ordinary people to build their careers and lives and how better to manage risk by offering a new deal on insuring their incomes , their mortgages and offering new resources for training over their working lives .
All this costs money , but fortunately Britain can sell its debt easily .
We should be measured about cutting the deficit , certainly no faster or sooner than Darling plans .
Nothing should stand in the way of a determined effort to build a high - innovation , high - skill economy .
Investors will find this more reassuring than the self - harm of swingeing budget cuts and will care no more about whether the national debt is 100 , 80 or 60 % of GDP than our forebears did when they used it to build British industrial and military pre-eminence .
David Cameron please take note .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Executioners could n’t find a suitable vein in which to inject drugs to kill a 53 - year - old murderer , who then got a one - week reprieve from the governor so Ohio prison officials can figure out what to do .
“ This is unchartered territory for us , ” prison spokeswoman Julie Walburn said of the difficulty in killing convicted rapist and murderer Romell Broom .
Democratic Governor Ted Strickland issued the reprieve at the request of the prison warden overseeing the state ’s execution chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville .
Walburn said prison officials would consult “ several people ” about how to perform Broom ’s execution , which by state law must be done by lethal injection .
Broom is to be executed for the rape and murder of 14 - year - old Tryna Middleton in Cleveland in 1984 .
It was not the first time Ohio has had difficulty executing a condemned man .
In May 2006 , Joseph Clark sat up to tell his executioners the drugs intended to render him unconscious were not working .
The state subsequently added a step to its execution protocol where the warden tries to rouse the condemned prisoner after an initial dose of sedatives is administered before the injection of lethal drugs .
Broom ’s execution did not get that far .
“ Our team attempted several times to obtain an access point , however those access points were not usable , ” Walburn said .
She said Broom ’s veins had appeared to be accessible in a medical evaluation .
The prisoner was cooperative throughout , Walburn said .
Some of Middleton ’s family members present to witness the execution were emotional afterward , Walburn said .
“ They were looking for closure and obviously they did not get that , ” she said .
The new Ricky Gervais film , “ The Invention of Lying , ” postulates a world in which no one has ever told a lie .
We know this because the hero , Mark Bellison , played by Gervais , tells us all about it in an opening voice - over .
It is the first , small warning sign that the movie may not be firing right : what level of confidence can you have in your own comic device — the conceit that will power the whole story — if you feel the need to explain it before the drama gets under way ?
One delight of “ The Truman Show ” was the onus it placed on viewers from the start , both daring us and trusting us to work out , at our own speed , just what the hell was going on in that spotless seaside town .
No such joy from Gervais , who wrote and directed the new film with Matthew Robinson , and who seems to have mislaid the T - shirt that is handed to every first - time movie director — the one that reads “ Show , Do n’t Tell . ”
This is a shame , because the conceit itself is ripe with possibility .
Entire segments of ordinary life are drained of the color and flavor that we have come to expect : advertising , for instance , is reduced from a blaze of slogans and jingles to one sallow guy on TV , holding a can and a glass and saying , “ I ’m asking you to not stop buying Coke . ”
A while later , we see a rival message on the side of a bus : “ Pepsi — when they do n’t have Coke . ”
On the basis that imagination , too , is no more than a fancy , upmarket word for fibbing , acts of fiction remain unknown ; at Lecture Films , the movie studio where Mark toils — he is introduced as “ one of our least successful screenwriters ” — the typical product consists of a blazered bore reciting a plain historical narrative woven from verified facts .
Mark is responsible for the fourteenth century , although not for much longer , since he ’s about to get fired .
This is cheering news to his colleagues , such as Shelley ( Tina Fey ) , who announces brightly , “ I loathed almost every minute that I worked for you , ” and Brad ( Rob Lowe ) , who says , “ I ’ve always hated you . ”
As I listened to this volley of invective , I thought , Is Gervais cheating here ?
Is there not already a slight , illogical shift in his central gag ?
Just because humans can only tell the truth does not , surely , mean they must do so — that they are compelled to blurt it out on every occasion .
After all , to suppress a malicious instinct is the task not strictly of fabrication but of good manners , and neither Gervais nor his movie is nihilistic enough to propose that goodness itself is a fraud .
It is almost as if a new strain of Tourette ’s syndrome were spreading through the population ; when Mark goes to meet a date , Anna McDoogles ( Jennifer Garner ) , she greets him at the door with “ I was just masturbating . ”
It gets a laugh , but it also sets a tone of helplessness , with characters endlessly victimized by their own loose tongues .
“ I had a better time than I thought I would , ” Anna admits as she says good night .
We have heard something similar before , in “ Liar Liar ” ( 1997 ) , which presented Jim Carrey as a lonely blurter in a mendacious world .
( “ I ’ve had better , ” he said , when a lover , settling back after sex , asked him how it had been . )
Here the situation is reversed .
Everyone dwells in veracity except for Mark , who , one day , at a bank , suddenly tells a lie ; we watch it happening inside his brain , a rare synaptic spark , and it nets him five hundred dollars .
( I loved the notion that , like a child grappling with fresh concepts , he does n’t have any words for what he just did : “ I said something that was n’t ” is the best he can manage . )
From here , the game is on ; Mark can reinstate himself at Lecture Films and dream up random plots , crammed with spaceships and ninjas , and earn a fortune for his pains .
No one doubts him , because , until now , there has been no room for doubt .
He can say that he ’s black , and the person listening will reply , “ I always knew it . ”
He can instruct a total stranger to go to bed with him , saying that , if she does n’t , the world will end , and she will comply .
Above all , he can comfort his aged mother ( Fionnula Flanagan ) , as she fades away in a nursing home —
“ A Sad Place for Hopeless Old People , ” it calls itself — with an off - the - cuff account of a radiant afterlife , complete with mansions , where she will continue to exist .
“ Go on , ” one of the nurses urges him .
So he does , and “ The Invention of Lying ” promptly lurches into another gear , with Mark finding fame — first local , then global — as a Moses figure , with a hint of John the Baptist .
The difference is that those men believed what they foretold , whereas Mark makes it up as he goes along , scribbling nostrums on whatever comes to hand .
“ Everything you need to know is written on these pizza boxes , ” he declares to a crowd of people gathered outside his apartment , telling them of a mysterious “ man in the sky ” who controls their destinies , and promising them eternal ice cream if they behave well on earth .
Audiences here should be reminded , at this point , that Gervais found his fame on the BBC , with “ The Office ” and “ Extras , ” and that the execration of religious faith , specifically Christianity — plus a reflex sneer at the fools who fall for it — has , in the past decade , become the default mode of British cultural life .
It makes sense , I suppose , for Gervais to use his film to air such mockery , if spiritual belief genuinely strikes him as a lie like any other ; the plan would carry more weight , however , if he did n’t use the rest of the film to air his transcendent belief in Ricky Gervais .
There is a form of self - deprecation that can tighten into self - pity and , from there , mutate into a ready - wounded pride , and that , pretty much , is the tenor of this movie .
“ If you ’re a chubby little loser , you ’re all alone , at the bottom of the pile , ” Mark says at the beginning , and the plaintive note is struck time and again , to the point of embarrassment ; even when his lot improves , Anna still spurns him as a mate , because he would be likely to sire porky little Marks with snub noses .
“ Does being rich and famous change your genetic material ? ” she asks , and the question is one that Hollywood has put to every talented , smart , but unhandsome soul who has ever arrived at its gates .
You can feel Gervais using all the means at his command ( he co-produced the film as well ) to agonize over the one aspect of his person — his appearance — which is not his to command , and never will be .
The result is most peculiar : a vanity project made by someone who wishes he had more to be vain about .
“ You ’re the sweetest man I ’ve ever met , ” Anna says , adding , “ You ’re my best friend . ”
The very phrase , as generations of men can confirm , is like a bell that tolls the death of romance .
But then , without warning , “ The Invention of Lying ” changes gear once more , and turns into a teary rom-com ; for reasons that I still can’t fathom , the beast gets his beauty after all .
Did somebody fix his genes ?
The movie is no easier on the eye , or the ear , than its whining hero .
Even the non -office scenes have a strip - lit look — an unconscious homage , you might say , to the scene of Gervais ’s first triumph — and , as for the soundtrack , it ’s like being haunted by the ghost of Easy Listening Past .
Supertramp and the Electric Light Orchestra are one thing , but Donovan : there ’s no excuse .
And what really galls is not the songs themselves but the greasy way in which they are wrapped around crucial passages of action , to muffle any awkward transitions ; thus , once Mark has armed himself with white lies , he strolls off to reassure all the other miserable folk we have encountered so far — old - timers , bums on the street , a bickering couple — with a smile and a word in their ears .
But what word ?
We ca n’t tell , because Elvis Costello is busy belting out “ Sitting ” by the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens .__
The last third of the movie is as bad as anything I ’ve seen this year , with the laughs trailing off , and half of the supporting characters , the zestier ones , being airbrushed from the frame .
( What director in his right mind would drop Tina Fey from the proceedings ? )
It ’s a curious elision , because , until now , some of the best lines have belonged to passing figures ; I especially liked the woman at the reception desk , in a restaurant , who welcomes the ravishing Anna with the words “ Hi , I ’m threatened by you . ”
As befits the creator of “ Extras , ” Gervais is keenly attuned to those on the fringes of life : to the no-hopers and their even sadder next of kin , the hopers .
That is a very British predilection , and it may be one reason for his wincing unease when placed at the hub of events ; as with Sacha Baron Cohen and , years ago , Peter Sellers , you get the perplexing sense of a highly gifted , essentially shy man , far from comfortable in his own skin , forcing himself into the spotlight .
Toward the end , “ The Invention of Lying ” becomes almost a one - man show ; we find ourselves in a traditional church ( who built that ? ) , with the Cross digitally removed from its steeple and an icon of Mark , with outstretched arms , above the altar .
So , the sweet best friend with the snub nose not only gets the girl ; he gets to play the man in the sky .
Talk about invention . ♦

If the promise of nanotechnology is to be fulfilled , nanoparticles will have to be able to make something of themselves .
An important advance towards this goal has been achieved by researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) who have found a simple and yet powerfully robust way to induce nanoparticles to assemble themselves into complex arrays .
By adding specific types of small molecules to mixtures of nanoparticles and polymers , the researchers are able to direct the self - assembly of the nanoparticles into arrays of one , two and even three dimensions with no chemical modification of either the nanoparticles or the block copolymers .
In addition , the application of external stimuli , such as light and / or heat , can be used to further direct the assemblies of nanoparticles for even finer and more complex structural details .
" We 've demonstrated a simple yet versatile approach to precisely controlling the spatial distribution of readily available nanoparticles over multiple length scales , ranging from the nano to the macro , " says Ting Xu , a polymer scientist who led this project and who holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division and the University of California , Berkeley 's Departments of Materials Sciences and Engineering , and Chemistry .
" Our technique can be used on a wide variety of nanoparticle and should open new routes to the fabrication of nanoparticle - based devices including highly efficient systems for the generation and storage of solar energy . "
The Art of Self - Assembly
Nano - sized particles -- bits of matter a few billionths of a meter in size , or more than a hundred times smaller than the stuff of today 's microtechnologies -- display highly coveted properties not found in macroscopic materials , including optical , electronic , magnetic , etc .
The promise of nanotechnololgy is that exploiting these unique properties on a commercial scale could yield such " game - changers " as sustainable , clean and cheap energy , and the creation on demand of new materials with properties tailored to meet specific needs .
Realizing this promise starts with nanoparticles being able to organize themselves into complex structures and hierarchical patterns , similar to what nature routinely accomplishes with proteins .
" Precise control of the spatial organization of nanoparticles and other nanoscopic building blocks over multiple length scales has been a bottleneck in the bottom - up generation of technologically important materials , " says Xu . " Most of the approaches that have been used so far have involved surface modifications . "
Small as they are , nanoparticles are essentially all surface so any process that modifies the surface of a nanoparticle can profoundly change the properties of that particle .
Precisely arranging these nanoparticles is critical to tailoring the macroscopic properties during nanoparticle assembly .
Although DNA has been used to induce self - assembly of nanoparticles with a high degree of precision , this approach only works well for organized arrays that are limited in size ; it is impractical for large - scale fabrication .
Xu believes a better approach is to use block copolymers -- long sequences or " blocks " of one type of monomer molecule bound to blocks of another type of monomer molecule .

" Block copolymers readily self - assemble into well - defined arrays of nanostructures over macroscopic distances , " she says .
" They would be an ideal platform for directing the assembly of nanoparticles except that block copolymers and nanoparticles are not particularly compatible with one another from a chemistry standpoint .
A mediator is required to bring them together . "
Xu and her group found such a " mediator " in the form of small molecules that will join with nanoparticles and then able attach themselves and their nanoparticle partners to the surface of a block copolymer .
For this study , Xu and her group used two different types of small molecules , surfactants ( wetting agents ) dubbed " PDP " and " OPAP . "
These small molecules can be stimulated by light ( PDP ) or heat ( OPAP ) to sever their connection to the surface of a block copolymer and be repositioned to another location along the polymeric chain .
In this manner , the spatial distribution of the small molecule mediators and their nanoparticle partners can be precisely directed with no need to modify either the nanoparticles or the polymers .
" The beauty of this technique is that it involves no sophisticated chemistry , " says Xu .
" It really is a plug and play technique , in which you simply mix the nanoparticles with the block copolymers and then add whatever small molecules you need . "
For this study , Xu and her colleagues added PDP or OPAP small molecules to various blends of nanoparticles , such as cadmium selenide and lead sulfide , mixed in with a commercial block copolymer -- polystyrene - block - poly ( 4 - vinyl pyridine ) .
While she and her group worked with light and heat , she says other stimuli , such as pH , could also be used to reposition small molecules and their nanoparticle partners along block copolymer formations .
Strategic substitutions of different types of stimulus - responsive small molecules could serve as a mechanism for structural fine - tuning or for incorporating specific functional properties into nanocomposites .
Xu and her colleagues are now in the process of adding functionality to their self - assembly technique .
" Bring together the right basic components -- nanoparticles , polymers and small molecules -- stimulate the mix with a combination of heat , light or some other factors , and these components will assemble into sophisticated structures or patterns , " says Xu .
" It is not dissimilar from how nature does it . "
This research was supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy 's Office of Science and in part by the Army Research Office and National Science Foundation .
The nanoparticles were synthesized at Berkley Lab's Molecular Foundry and characterizations of the nanoparticle assemblies were performed at Beamline 7.3.3 of Berkeley Lab's Advanced Light Source .
Both the Molecular Foundry and the Advanced Light Source are DOE Office of Science national user facilities .
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - UBS will give U.S. authorities the names of about 5,000 wealthy Americans suspected of using the Swiss bank to evade taxes under a deal that will be formalized this week , a U.S. legal source said on Monday .
The logo of Swiss bank UBS can be seen outside its New York office August 12 , 2009 .

The source , who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the agreement , said it was due to be announced jointly by the Swiss and U.S. governments on Wednesday .
Initialed last week , the deal ends a long - running legal dispute between Swiss and U.S. negotiators over access to the names of American clients of UBS suspected of using secret accounts at the bank to conceal assets and dodge U.S. taxes .
The case strained relations between the United States and Switzerland because of aggressive tactics used by U.S. investigators for more than a year to crack open one of the world ’s leading bastions of bank secrecy and confidentiality .
The source said the deal settling the dispute , which was finally hammered out in Washington last week , would involve the disclosure to U.S. authorities of roughly 4,500 to 5,000 names of American clients of UBS .
That is less than the 52,000 names the United States originally hoped it could force the bank to disclose through a lawsuit .
But U.S. government sources have said repeatedly that U.S. prosecutors could still claim a big win in the case , if they come away with names believed to hold the biggest offshore accounts , containing the bulk of the estimated $ 15 billion in assets linked to U.S. - based clients of UBS .
That , in turn , should resonate across the global offshore banking industry amid concerted efforts by the United States and other countries to fight money - laundering and tax cheats .
UBS became the target of U.S. probes in 2007 when a former executive at the bank , Bradley Birkenfeld , began cooperating with U.S. authorities and helped them start building criminal and civil complaints against the bank .
The whistle - blower , who once smuggled a client ’s diamonds into the United States in a toothpaste tube , is due to be sentenced in a Florida court on Friday after pleading guilty in June 2008 to helping a billionaire hide $ 200 million of assets from U.S. authorities .
I ’m a Windows user .
I do dabble with a little Ubuntu now and then but most of the time since I am running around a lot : uni , work , flat , parent ’s home , gf… I tend to stick to one platform .
So I said to myself , I ca n’t work with Haskell the way I am , writing code in Notepad + + and compiling manually in command prompt .
( Well I can but I wanted to make things easier ) .
My next logical question was :
Is there possibly no IDE for my most fav language ?
Of course there is … so I look things up and find out that the two most popular beta IDEs are Leksah and EclipseFP2 .
Both Leksah and Eclipse work on windows as well !
Perfect .
Anyone would do !
Leksah
Since , I have worked with gtk and I liked it I went to Leksah first ( ahem … there is also the new installer which kinda made the choice in the end for me ) .
I installed it but I could n’t figure out why it would n’t parse my installation ’s modules .
( I am using the Haskell Platform with ghc 6.10.3 for the pure reason that I want to work with gtk2hs and it currently supports that version . )
At first it was due to my system ’s lack of the tar application which I tried to fix using GNU Tar .
Unfortunately the latter seems to be missing some fork mode so it did n’t work out .
Is there any way to remedy this somehow or are there any step by step installations somewhere on how to install Leksah ( I have followed the given instructions to no avail ) ?
Disclaimer : I ca n’t neglect the fact that I might have not managed to make it work due to lack of knowledge from my part .
EclipseFP2
After some hours I said … well lets try EclipseFP2 .
Now I know it was / still is in development but I said , lets give it a shot .
Unfortunately I met with problems again :
1 . I could n’t get GHC to work with it even thought I set the Haskell implementation and the scion correctly .
2 . I could n’t make it show what errors my code contained as my console was blank all the time .
When I opened the Errors view i found out that my error was due to a problem with :
Could not write file : D : \Eclipse Workspace\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.debug.core\.launches\L\My
Project\src .
The folders were there up to .launches , the rest was non-existant .
So , I am sorry to say that neither of them worked for me .
For now I am going back to Notepad ++ and old command prompt .
I want to make it clear that I am not saying that the developers who have worked on these IDEs should be ashamed of themselves but the direct opposite .
By my attempts I am showing how I applaud their time spent on giving us an IDE .
I just wish I was good enough to make the IDEs work myself but sadly I was not able to .
I just hope that someday Haskell will have its own IDE or that someday soon I might get time to work on one of the projects myself .
I sincerely believe that given the publicity given to Haskell by the various publications and books such as Real World Haskell , the only real thing missing from making this language more mainstream is an IDE .
And unfortunately not just on Linux - based systems but also on Windows .
We all have to admit that most mainstream people come from Windows : especially first year uni students attending their functional programming course ( that ’s how I met Haskell ) and Java / .
Net professional programmers who want to dabble in functional programming .
Anyways , three things :
1 . If anyone managed to make Leksah or EclipseFP2 work well on their machines please let me know where I went wrong in the comments .
I ca n’t stop stressing the fact that it could be something I missed .
2 . What do you guys think is the future of Haskell ’s IDE development ?
3 . What is the most common platform and compilation method most Haskellers use ?
Let me know ! 🙂
Edit : Gotta love this community !
1. Just minutes after my post I got a reply from Hamish Mackenzie link with tips on how to fix my problem .
I am currently working on it with his help !
Thanks !
2 . I also asked Thomas ten Cate about EclipseFP2 on his website here and he has replied here .
Thanks both of you guys . 🙂
Edit 2 : Leksah works , now EclipseFP2
1. Leksah works for me on Vista .
Here is a screenshot as proof !
Coincidentally there is also some of 4Blocks ’ code which I hope to release shortly , as soon as I have some time to figure out how to work with Cabal .
2. Going attempt to make EclipseFP2 work next .
Since I need to pull the source from the live sources via github and I have never used the latter , it might take me some time .
Or I can wait a bit as JP Moresmau seems to be working upon updating EclipseFP2 .
To both teams : Keep up the great work . 🙂

EARLY this year , many China - watchers warned that the government 's stimulus was not enough to save the economy from a deep downturn .
With indecent haste , they have now switched to worrying that overly lax policies have created a gigantic bubble in shares and house prices .
Figures due later this month are likely to show that China 's real GDP grew by around 9 % in the year to the third quarter — a period over which output in most other economies probably fell .
A recent flurry of bearish reports has warned that sooner or later the markets will crash , excessive borrowing and investment will cause banks ' bad loans to surge , and China 's growth will collapse .
If the government does not act soon to tighten liquidity , share and house prices will become seriously overvalued .
But it is much too early to use the “ B ” word .
Start with China 's stockmarket , described by Andy Xie , an independent economist , as a “ giant Ponzi scheme ” .
Despite a recent slide , Shanghai's A - share index is still up by over 60 % since its trough last November .
Yet this is only a fraction of the gain during China 's previous bubble in 2006 - 07 , when the price / earnings ratio jumped to an eye - popping 70 .
Today the p/e ratio stands at 24 .
That is high compared with developed markets but well below China 's long - term average of 37 ( see left - hand chart ) .
China 's faster trend pace of growth also means that the outlook for corporate profits is rosier than elsewhere .
They are already bouncing back : in the three months to August industrial profits were 7 % higher than a year ago , after falling by 37 % in the year to February .
Bubble suspect number two is the housing market .
Average Chinese home prices are nine times average annual household income .
In the rich world a ratio of more than four would sound alarm bells ; in other Asian countries prices are typically 5 - 7 times income .
The volume of property sales has surged by 85 % over the past year and prices of new apartments in Shanghai have risen by nearly 30 % .
Some conclude that prices have been pumped up by imprudent bank lending and that the market is at risk of crashing .
However , average nationwide house prices have risen by only 2 % over the past year , after falling in 2008 .
The official price index may understate the true average gain but figures for central Shanghai will overstate it .
Either way , house prices are rising nowhere near as fast as they did during the previous boom in 2004 - 07 ( see right - hand chart ) .
And in relation to income , average house prices in China have fallen slightly over the past decade ( although they have risen in some big cities ) .
Arthur Kroeber , an economist at Dragonomics , a research firm in Beijing , argues that the high level of prices relative to income is partly explained by hidden subsidies .
A high proportion of households live in apartments purchased at a fraction of their value from the government a decade ago ( when the housing market was privatised ) or have upgraded to apartments financed by the sale of such properties .
The leap in property sales follows a deep slump last year after the government deliberately cooled the market .
The level of transactions in August was less than half its level in 2005 or 2006 .
More important , China 's housing market is much less dependent on credit than those in places like America , so its economy would be less vulnerable to any sharp fall in prices .
Andy Rothman , an economist at CLSA , a broker , estimates that only one - quarter of middle - class homeowners have a mortgage and their average loan is only 46 % of the property 's value , compared with 76 % in America .
Homeowners have to put down a minimum deposit of 20 % .
Speculators buying property as an investment have to put down 40 % .
Rising home prices are not an accidental consequence of government easing but one of its goals .
The government needs a lively housing market to support the economy when its fiscal stimulus fades .
It creates a lot of jobs , spurs private - sector investment in construction and encourages new homebuyers to spend more on furniture and electrical goods .
Until recently China 's recovery was driven largely by state spending but thanks to a rebound in construction , private - sector investment rose by 30 % in the year to August , double its growth rate in December .
But even if China 's stockmarkets and housing markets do not look particularly overvalued now , there is a clear risk that they could become so .
Mingchun Sun , an economist at Nomura , points to some big differences between the recent sell - off in shares and the previous one in November 2007 .
Inflation was then 6.9 % and rising , so policymakers were forced to slam on the monetary brakes .
Today consumer prices are falling .
In 2007 liquidity was tight , with the M2 measure of money supply growing more slowly than nominal GDP .
Today excess liquidity ( money growth minus GDP growth ) is growing at its fastest pace on record .
Low inflation , lashings of liquidity and strong growth are the ideal environment for asset - price inflation .
Mr Sun concludes that equity and housing bubbles are inevitable and may grow even bigger than those in 2007 .
The third alleged threat to China 's recovery is overinvestment .
It is widely argued that the recent investment boom has simply exacerbated China 's overcapacity , which will reduce the return on capital and eventually drag down its growth rate .
Yet analysis by BCA Research , a Canadian research firm , finds surprisingly little evidence of wasteful overinvestment to date .
One yardstick of the efficiency of capital is the incremental capital - output ratio ( ICOR ) — the investment needed to generate an additional unit of output ( ie , annual investment divided by the annual increase in GDP ) .
The higher the ICOR , the less efficient the investment .
China 's ICOR has been fairly stable over the past three decades .
This year it will shoot up because investment surged and growth slowed , but the ICOR is meaningless in a recession .
America 's ICOR , for example , will be infinite because GDP fell .
In general , BCA finds that China 's ICOR is lower than that in many other places , suggesting that its capital spending is more , not less , efficient .
But what about this year 's state - directed investment boom ?
The good news is that little new investment has gone into industries which already had excess supply , such as steel .
Three - fifths of new lending this year went into infrastructure projects .
Some of this money will inevitably be wasted and banks ' non-performing loans will rise in future years as payments come due .
But much of the new infrastructure , especially railways and roads , should help improve future productivity .
As for bank lending , which grew by a thumping 34 % in the year to August , the government has repeatedly signalled that it will maintain its easy monetary policy because it is still concerned about the sustainability of the recovery .
But it is also trying to curb speculative excesses and to tighten bank supervision .
The banking regulator strengthened the rules on mortgages for investment properties this summer , and has told banks to raise their capital ratios to 10 % and to hold provisions equal to 150 % of projected loan losses by the end of the year .
China does not yet have dangerous bubbles in housing and shares that could threaten its recovery .
Indeed , rising asset prices will help boost consumer spending over the next year , which will in turn help broaden China 's recovery .
But to minimise the risk that China is starting to inflate its biggest bubble ever , the government does need to curb excessive liquidity .
That means allowing the yuan to appreciate .
With interest rates likely to remain close to zero in America for some time , China cannot significantly tighten its own rates unless it allows its currency to rise .
If China 's growth has decoupled from America , then so must its monetary policy .
