Although these doctrines are recognizably atomist in spirit , the term ‘ logical atomism ’ is not used by Wittgenstein .
It was introduced by Russell in his 1911 lecture to the French Philosophical Society , Le Réalisme Analytique ( Russell 1911 ) . [ 1 ]
Russell had advertised “ The Philosophy of Logical Atomism ” as being “ very largely concerned with explaining certain ideas which [ he had ] learnt from [ his ] friend and former pupil Ludwig Wittgenstein ” ( Marsh , 177 ) .
No doubt partly as a result of this description , the term ‘ logical atomism ’ subsequently became associated with Wittgenstein ’s early philosophy .
The term is now standardly used to apply to a vaguely defined set of doctrines centered on theses ( i ) – ( vi ) .
In Russell ’s opinion , what makes it appropriate to speak of logical atomism is that the atoms in question are to be arrived at by logical rather than physical analysis ( Russell 1956 , 179 ) .
For Wittgenstein too , the ultimate constituents of reality are to be revealed by a process of logical analysis ; so , to that extent , the label seems apt .
It is not , however , uncontroversial ( see Floyd 1998 and 2007 ) . [ 2 ]
Although it has few adherents today , logical atomism was once a leading movement of early twentieth - century analytic philosophy .
Different , though related , versions of the view were developed by Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein .
Russell ’s logical atomism is set forth chiefly in his 1918 work “ The Philosophy of Logical Atomism ” ( Russell 1956 ) , Wittgenstein ’s in his Tractatus Logico - Philosophicus of 1921 ( Wittgenstein 1981 ) .
The core tenets of Wittgenstein ’s logical atomism may be stated as follows : ( i ) Every proposition has a unique final analysis which reveals it to be a truth - function of elementary propositions ( Tractatus 3.25 , 4.221 , 4.51 , 5 ) ; ( ii ) These elementary propositions assert the existence of atomic states of affairs ( 3.25 , 4.21 ) ; ( iii ) Elementary propositions are mutually independent — each one can be true or false independently of the truth or falsity of the others ( 4.211 , 5.134 ) ; ( iv ) Elementary propositions are immediate combinations of semantically simple symbols or “ names ” ( 4.221 ) ; ( v ) Names refer to items wholly devoid of complexity , so - called “ objects ” ( 2.02 & 3.22 ) ; ( vi ) Atomic states of affairs are combinations of these objects ( 2.01 ) .
The “ names ” spoken of in the Tractatus are not mere signs ( i.e. , typographically or phonologically identified inscriptions ) , but rather signs - together - with - their - meanings — or “ symbols . ”
Being symbols , names are identified and individuated only in the context of significant sentences .
A name is “ semantically simple ” in the sense that its meaning does not depend on the meanings of its orthographic parts , even when those parts are , in other contexts , independently meaningful .
So , for example , it would not count against the semantic simplicity of the symbol ‘ Battle ’ as it figures in the sentence “ Battle commenced ” that it contains the orthographic part , “ Bat , ” even though this part has a meaning of its own in other sentential contexts .
For Wittgenstein , however , something else does count against this symbol ’s semantic simplicity , namely , that it is analyzable away in favour of talk of the actions of people , etc .
This point suggests that in natural language Tractarian names will be rare and hard to find .
Even apparently simple singular terms such as ‘ Obama , ’ ‘ London , ’ etc. , will not be counted as “ names ” by the strict standards of the Tractatus since they will disappear on further analysis .
( Hereafter , ‘ name ’ will mean “ Tractarian name ” unless otherwise indicated . )
It is a matter of controversy whether the Tractatus reserves the term ‘ name ’ for semantically simple symbols referring to particulars , or whether the term comprehends semantically simple symbols of all kinds .
Since objects are just the referents of names , this issue goes hand in hand with the question whether objects are one and all particulars or whether they include properties and relations .
The former view is defended by Irving Copi ( Copi 1958 ) and Elizabeth Anscombe ( Anscombe 1959 , 108 ff ) , among others .
It is supported by Tractatus 2.0231 : “ [ Material properties ] are first presented by propositions — first formed by the configuration of objects . ”
This might seem to suggest that simple properties are not objects but rather arise from the combining or configuring of objects .
The Copi-Anscombe interpretation has been taken to receive further support from Tractatus 3.1432 :
We must not say , “ The complex sign ‘ a Rb ’ says ‘ a stands in relation R to b ; ’ ” but we must say , “ That ‘ a ’ stands in a certain relation to ‘ b ’ says that aRb . ”
This has suggested to some commentators that relations are not , strictly speaking , nameable , and so not Tractarian objects ( see , for example , Ricketts , 1996 , Section III ) .
It may , however , be intended instead simply to bring out the point that Tractarian names are not confined to particulars , but include relations between particulars ; so this consideration is less compelling .
The opposing view , according to which names include predicates and relational expressions , has been defended by Erik Stenius and Merrill and Jaakko Hintikka , among others ( Stenius , 1960 , 61–69 ; Hintikka and Hintikka , 1986 , 30 – 34 ) .
It is supported by a Notebooks entry from 1915 in which objects are explicitly said to include properties and relations ( NB , 61 ) .
It is further buttressed by Wittgenstein ’s explanation to Desmond Lee ( in 1930 –1 ) of Tractatus 2.01 : “ ‘ Objects ’ also include relations ; a proposition is not two things connected by a relation .
‘ Thing ’ and ‘ relation ’ are on the same level . ” ( LK , 120 ) .
The Anscombe - Copi reading treats the forms of elementary propositions as differing radically from anything we may be familiar with from ordinary — or even Fregean — grammar .
It thus respects Wittgenstein ’s warning to Waismann in 1929 that “ The logical structure of elementary propositions need not have the slightest similarly with the logical structure of [ non- elementary ] propositions ” ( WWK , 42 ) .
Going beyond this , Wittgenstein seems once to have held that there can be no resemblance between the apparent or surface forms of non-elementary propositions and the forms of elementary propositions .
In “ Some Remarks on Logical Form ” ( 1929 ) he says : “ One is often tempted to ask from an a priori standpoint :
What , after all , can be the only forms of atomic propositions , and to answer , e.g. , subject - predicate and the relational propositions with two or more terms further , perhaps , propositions relating predicates and relations with one another , and so on .
But this , I believe , is a mere playing with words ” ( Klagge and Nordman , 1993 , 30 ) .
A similar thought already occurs in a more compressed form in the Tractatus itself : “ There can not be a hierarchy of the forms of the elementary propositions .
Only that which we ourselves construct can we foresee ” ( 5.556 ) .
It is possible , then , that the options we began with represent a false dichotomy .
Perhaps Wittgenstein simply did not have an antecedent opinion on the question whether Tractarian names will turn out to be names of particulars only , particulars and universals , or whatnot .
And it may even be that he believed that the final analysis of language would ( or might ) reveal the names to defy such classifications altogether .
This broader range of interpretive possibilities has only recently begun to receive the attention it deserves ( See Johnston 2009 ) .
By “ Linguistic atomism ” we shall understand the view that the analysis of every proposition terminates in a proposition all of whose genuine components are names .
It is a striking fact that the Tractatus contains no explicit argument for linguistic atomism .
This fact has led some commentators — e.g. , Peter Simons ( 1992 ) — to suppose that Wittgenstein ’s position here is motivated less by argument than by brute intuition .
And indeed , Wittgenstein does present some conclusions in this vicinity as if they required no argument .
At 4.221 , for example , he says : “ It is obvious that in the analysis of propositions we must come to elementary propositions , which consist of names in immediate combination ” ( emphasis added ) .
Nonetheless , some basic observations about the Tractatus ’s conception of analysis will enable us to see why Wittgenstein should have thought it obvious that analysis must terminate in this way .
A remark from the Philosophical Grammar , written in 1936 , throws light on how Wittgenstein had earlier conceived of the process of analysis :
Formerly , I myself spoke of a ‘ complete analysis , ’ and I used to believe that philosophy had to give a definitive dissection of propositions so as to set out clearly all their connections and remove all possibilities of misunderstanding .
I spoke as if there was a calculus in which such a dissection would be possible .
I vaguely had in mind something like the definition that Russell had given for the definite article ( PG , 211 ) .
One of the distinctive features of Russell ’s definition is that it treats the expression “ the x such that Fx ” as an “ incomplete symbol . ”
Such symbols have no meaning in isolation but are given meaning by contextual definitions that treat of the sentential contexts in which they occur ( cf. PM , 66 ) .
Incomplete symbols do , of course , have meaning because they make a contribution to the meanings of the sentences in which they occur ( cf. Principles , Introduction , x ) .
What is special about them is that they make this contribution without expressing a propositional constituent .
( On the nature of incomplete symbols , see Pickel 2013 )
Russell ’s definition is contained in the following clauses ( For the sake of expository transparency , his scope - indicating devices are omitted . ) .
[ 1 ] G ( the x : Fx ) = ∃x ( ∀y ( Fy↔y=x ) & Gx ) Df .
( cf. Russell 1905 b ; Russell 1990 , 173 ) [ 2 ] ( the x : Fx ) exists = ∃x∀y ( Fy↔y=x ) Df .
( cf. Russell 1990 , 174 )
The fact that existence is dealt with by a separate definition shows that Russell means to treat the predicate ‘ exists ’ as itself an incomplete symbol , to be eliminated in favour of the existential quantifier .
One can understand why Wittgenstein discerned an affinity between the theory of descriptions and his own envisioned “ calculus , ” for one can extract from his remarks in the Tractatus and elsewhere two somewhat parallel proposals for eliminating what he calls terms for “ complexes ” :
[ 3 ] F[ aRb ] iff Fa & Fb & aRb
[ 4 ] [ aRb ] exists iff aRb
Clauses [ 1 ] to [ 4 ] share the feature that any sentence involving apparent reference to an individual is treated as false rather than as neither true nor false if that individual should be discovered not to exist .
Wittgenstein ’s first contextual definition — our [ 3 ] — occurs in a Notebooks entry from 1914 ( NB , 4 ) , but it is also alluded to in the Tractatus :
Every statement about complexes can be analysed into a statement about their constituent parts , and into those propositions which completely describe the complexes ( 2.0201 ) .
In [ 3 ] the statement “ about [ the complex ’s ] constituent parts ” is “ Fa & Fb , ” while the proposition which “ completely describes ” the complex is “ aRb . ”
If the propositions obtained by applying [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] are to be further analysed , a two - stage procedure will be necessary : first , the apparent names generated by the analysis — in the present case ‘ a ’ and ‘ b’ — will need to be replaced [ 3 ] with symbols that are overtly terms for complexes , e.g. , ‘[ cSd ] ’ and ‘ [ eFg ] ; ’ second , the contextual definitions [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] will need to be applied again to eliminate these terms .
If there is going to be a unique final analysis , each apparent name will have to be uniquely paired with a term for a complex .
So the program of analysis at which Wittgenstein gestures , in addition to committing him to something analogous to Russell ’s theory of descriptions , also commits him to the analogue of Russell ’s “ description theory of ordinary names ” ( cf. Russell 1905a ) .
This is the idea that every apparent name not occurring at the end of analysis is equivalent in meaning to some definite description .
Wittgenstein ’s first definition , like Russell ’s , strictly speaking , stands in need of a device for indicating scope , for otherwise it would be unclear how to apply the analysis when we choose , say , “ ~G ” as our instance of “ F . ”
In such a case the question would arise whether the resulting instance of [ 3 ] is [ 5 ] : “ ~ G[ aRb ] = ~ Ga & ~ Gb & aRb , ” which corresponds to giving the term for a complex wide scope with respect to the negation operator , or whether it is : [ 6 ]
“ ~ G[ aRb ] = ~ [ Ga & Gb & a Rb ] , ” which corresponds to giving the term for a complex narrow scope .
One suspects that Wittgenstein ’s intention would most likely have been to follow Russell ’s convention of reading the logical operator as having narrow scope unless the alternative is expressly indicated ( cf. PM , 172 ) .
Definition [ 3 ] has obvious flaws .
While it may work for such predicates as “ x is located in England , ” it obviously fails for certain others , e.g. , “ x is greater than three feet long ” and “ x weighs exactly four pounds . ”
This problem can hardly have escaped Wittgenstein ; so it seems likely that he would have regarded his proposals merely as tentative illustrations , open to supplementation and refinement .
Although Wittgenstein ’s second contextual definition — our [ 4 ] — does not occur in the Tractatus , it is implied by a remark from the Notes on Logic that seems to anticipate 2.0201 :
Every proposition which seems to be about a complex can be analysed into a proposition about its constituents and … the proposition which describes the complex perfectly ; i.e. , that proposition which is equivalent to saying the complex exists ( NB , 93 ; emphasis added ) [ 4 ]
Since the proposition that “ describes the complex , ” [ aRb ] , “ perfectly ” is just the proposition that aRb , Wittgenstein ’s clarifying addendum amounts to the claim that the proposition “ aRb ” is equivalent to the proposition “ [ aRb ] exists . ”
And this equivalence is just our [ 4 ] .
It turns out , then , that existence is defined only in contexts in which it is predicated of complexes .
Wittgenstein proposal thus mirrors Russell ’s in embodying the idea that it makes no sense to speak of the existence of immediately given ( that is , named ) simples ( cf. PM , 174–5 ) .
This is why Wittgenstein was later to refer to his “ objects ” as “ that for which there is neither existence nor non-existence ” ( PR , 72 ) .
His view seems to be that when ‘ a ’ is a Tractarian name , what we try to say by uttering the nonsense string “ a exists ” will , strictly speaking , be shown by the fact that the final analysis of some proposition contains ‘ a’ ( cf. 5.535 ) .
But of course , the Tractatus does not always speak strictly .
Indeed , what is generally taken to be the ultimate conclusion of the Tractatus ’s so - called “ Argument for Substance ” ( 2.021–2.0211 ) itself tries to say something that can only be shown , since it asserts the existence of objects .
The sharpness of the tension here is only partly disguised by the oblique manner in which the conclusion is formulated .
Instead of arguing for the existence of objects , the Tractatus argues for the thesis that the world “ has substance . ”
However , because “ objects constitute the substance of the world ” ( 2.021 ) , and because substance is that which exists independently of what is the case ( 2.024 ) , this is tantamount to saying that objects exist .
So it seems that Wittgenstein ’s argument for substance must be regarded as a part of the ladder we are supposed to throw away ( 6.54 ) .
But having acknowledged this point , we shall set it aside as peripheral to our main concerns .
The most obvious similarity between the two sets of definitions is that each seeks to provide for the elimination of what purport to be semantically complex referring expressions .
The most obvious difference consists in the fact that Wittgenstein ’s definitions are designed to eliminate not definite descriptions , but rather terms for complexes , for example the expression “ [ aRb ] , ” which , judging by remarks in the Notebooks , is to be read : “ a in the relation R to b ” ( NB , 48 ) ( This gloss seems to derive from Russell ’s manner of speaking of complexes in Principia Mathematica , where examples of terms for complexes include , in addition to “ a in the relation R to b , ” “ a having the quality q ” , and “ a and b and c standing in the relation S ” ( PM , 44 ) . ) .
One might wonder why there should be this difference at all .
Why not treat the peculiar locution “ a in the relation R to b ” as a definite description — as say , “ the complex consisting of a and b , combined so that aRb ” ?
This description could then be eliminated by applying the Tractatus ’s own variant upon the theory of descriptions :
The F is G ↔ ∃x ( Fx & Gx ) & ~∃x , y( Fx & Fy )
( cf. 5.5321 )
Here the distinctness of the variables ( the fact that they are distinct ) replaces the sign for distinctness “ ≠ ” ( cf. 5.53 ) .
Since Wittgenstein did not adopt this expedient , it seems likely that he would have regarded the predicate “ x is a complex consisting of a and b , combined so that aRb ” as meaningless in virtue of — among other things — its containing ineliminable occurrences of the pseudo - concepts “ complex , ” “ combination , ” and “ constitution . ”
Only the first of these notions figures on his list of pseudo - concepts in the Tractatus ( 4.1272 ) , but there is no indication that that list is supposed to be exhaustive .
There is a further respect in which Wittgenstein ’s analytical proposals differ from Russell’s .
Russell ’s second definition — our [ 2 ] — has the effect of shifting the burden of indicating ontological commitment from the word ‘ exists ’ to the existential quantifier .
In Wittgenstein ’s definition , by contrast , no single item of vocabulary takes over the role of indicating ontological commitment .
That commitment is indicated only after the final application of the definition , by the meaningfulness of the names in the fully analysed proposition — or , more precisely , by the fact that certain symbols are names ( cf. 5.535 ) .
The somewhat paradoxical consequence is that one can assert a statement of the form “ [ aRb ] exists ” without thereby manifesting any ontological commitment to the complex [ a Rb ] ( cf. EPB , 121 ) .
What this shows is that the two theories relieve the assertor of ontological commitments of quite different kinds .
In Russell ’s case , the analysis — our [ 2 ] — removes a commitment to an apparent propositional constituent — a “ denoting concept ” [ 5 ]
— expressed by the phrase ‘ the F , ’ but it does not remove the commitment to the F itself .
For Wittgenstein , by contrast , the analysis shows that the assertor never was ontologically committed to the complex [ aRb ] by an utterance of “ [ aRb ] exists . ”
Russell ’s conception of analysis at the time of the theory of descriptions — c.a. 1905 — is relatively clear : Analysis involves pairing up one sentence with another that expresses , more perspicuously , the very same Russellian proposition .
The analysans counts as more perspicuous than the analysandum because the former is free of some of the latter ’s merely apparent ontological commitments .
By the time of Principia Mathematica , however , this relatively transparent conception of analysis is no longer available .
Having purged his ontology of propositions in 1910 , Russell can no longer appeal to the idea that analysans and analysandum express one and the same proposition .
He now adopts “ the multiple relation theory of judgment , ” according to which the judgment ( say ) that Othello loves Desdemona , instead of being , as Russell had formerly supposed , a dyadic relation between the judging mind and the proposition Othello loves Desdemona , is now taken to be a non-dyadic , or , in Russell ’s terminology , “ multiple , ” relation whose terms are the judging mind and those items that were formerly regarded as constituents of the proposition Othello loves Desdemona ( Russell 1994 , 155 ) .
After 1910 Russell can say that a speaker who sincerely assertively uttered the analysans ( in a given context ) would be guaranteed to make the same judgment as one who sincerely assertively uttered the analysandum ( in the same context ) , but he can no longer explain this accomplishment by saying that the two sentences express the same proposition .
A further departure from the earlier , relatively transparent conception of analysis is occasioned by Russell ’s resolution of the set - theoretic version of his paradox .
His solution involves giving an analysis of a sentence whose utterance could not be taken to express any judgment .
One argues that the sentence “ {x : φx} ε {x : φx} ” is nonsense because the contextual definitions providing for the elimination of class terms yield for this case a sentence that is itself nonsense by the lights of the theory of types ( PM , 76 ) .
It ’s ( apparent ) negation is , accordingly , also nonsense .
In Principia , then , there is no very clear model of what is preserved in analysis .
The best we can say is that Russell ’s contextual definitions have the feature that a ( sincere , assertive ) utterance of the analysans is guaranteed to express the same judgment as the analysandum , if the latter expresses a judgment at all .
Some of the unclarity in the conception of analysis introduced by Russell ’s rejection of propositions is inherited by Wittgenstein , who similarly rejects any ontology of shadowy entities expressed by sentences .
In the Tractatus a “ proposition ” ( Satz ) is a “ propositional sign in its projective relation to the world ” ( 3.12 ) .
This makes it seem as though any difference between propositional signs should suffice for a difference between propositions , in which case analysans and analysandum could at best be distinct propositions with the same truth conditions .
Enough has now been said to make possible a consideration of Wittgenstein ’s reasons for describing the position I have been calling “ linguistic atomism ” as “ obvious . ”
Since the model for Tractarian analysis is the replacement of apparent names with ( apparently ) co-referring “ terms for complexes , ” together with eliminative paraphrase of the latter , it follows trivially that the endpoint of analysis , if there is one , will contain neither “ terms for complexes ” nor expressions that can be replaced by terms for complexes .
Wittgenstein , moreover , thinks it obvious that this analysis of every proposition does terminate .
The reason he supposes analysis cannot go on forever is that he conceives an unanalyzed proposition as deriving its sense from its analysis .
As Tractatus 3.261 puts it : “ Every defined sign signifies via those signs by which it is defined ” ( Cf. NB , 46 ; PT 3.20102 ) .
It follows that no proposition can have an infinite analysis , on pain of never acquiring a sense .
So analysis must terminate in propositions devoid of incomplete symbols .
That much , at least , is plausibly obvious , but unfortunately it does not follow that the final analysis of language will be wholly devoid of complex symbols .
The trouble is that for all we have said so far , a fully analysed proposition might yet contain one or more complex symbols that have meaning in their own right .
Clearly , then , Wittgenstein was assuming that all genuine referring expressions must be semantically simple : they must lack anything like a Fregean sense .
But why should that be so ?
The seeds of one answer are contained in Tractatus 3.3 , the proposition in which Wittgenstein enunciates his own version of Frege ’s context principle : “ Only the proposition has sense ; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning ” ( 3.3 ) .
Wittgenstein ’s juxtaposition of these two claims suggests that the context principle is supposed to be his ground for rejecting senses for sub-sentential expressions .
But just how it could provide such a ground is far from clear .
Another , more concrete , possibility is that Wittgenstein simply accepted the arguments Russell had given in “ On Denoting ” for rejecting senses for sub-sentential expressions .
By “ Metaphysical atomism ” we will understand the view that the semantically simple symbols occurring in a proposition ’s final analysis refer to simples .
The Tractatus does not contain a distinct argument for this thesis , but , as we will see , one uncovers the needed argument in the course of scrutinizing the famous “ Argument for Substance ” of 2.0211 –2 :
2.0211
If the world had no substance , then whether a proposition had sense would depend on whether another proposition was true .
2.0212
It would then be impossible to draw up a picture of the world ( true or false ) .
To see what precisely is being contended for in this argument one needs to appreciate the historical resonances of Wittgenstein ’s invocation of the notion of “ substance . ”
The Tractatus ’s notion of substance is the modal analogue of Kant ’s temporal notion .
Whereas for Kant , substance is that which “ persists ” ( in the sense of existing at all times ) , for Wittgenstein it is that which , figuratively speaking , “ persists ” through a “ space ” of possible worlds .
Tractarian substance is the “ unchanging ” in the metaphorical sense of that which does not undergo existence change in the passage ( also metaphorical ) from world to world .
Less figuratively , Tractarian substance is that which exists with respect to every possible world .
For Kant , to assert that there is substance ( in the schematized sense of the category ) is to say that that there is some stuff such that every existence change ( i.e. , origination or annihilation ) is necessarily an alteration or reconfiguration of that stuff .
For Wittgenstein , analogously , to say that there is substance is to say that there are some things such that all “ existence changes ” in the metaphorical passage from world to world are reconfigurations of them .
What undergo “ existence changes ” are atomic states of affairs ( configurations of objects ) : a state of affairs exists with respect to one world but fails to exist with respect to another .
Those things that remain in existence through these existence changes , and which are reconfigured in the process , are Tractarian objects .
It follows that the objects that “ constitute the substance of the world ” ( 2.021 ) are necessary existents .
The Tractatus , rather wonderfully , compresses this whole metaphorical comparison into a single remark : “ The object is the fixed , the existing [ das Bestehende ] ; the configuration is the changing [ das Wechselnde ] . ” ( 2.0271 ) .
“ Wechsel , ” it should be noted , is the word that Kant expressly reserves for the notion of existence change as opposed to alteration ( Critique , A 187/ B230 ) .
( Unfortunately , however , whether Wittgenstein had read the Critique in time for this circumstance to have influenced his own phrasing in the Tractatus is unknown . )
Tractarian objects are what any “ imagined ” — or , more accurately , conceivable — world has in common with the real world ( 2.022 ) .
Accordingly , they constitute the world ’s “ fixed form ” ( 2.022–3 ) .
‘ Fixed ’ because , unlike the world ’s content , objects ( existentially speaking ) hold fast in the transition from world to world .
‘ Form ’ because they constitute what is shared by all the worlds .
( On Wittgenstein ’s conception of possibility , the notion of an “ alien ” Tractarian object — one which is merely possible — is not even intelligible ) .
If the objects make up the world ’s form , what makes up its content ?
The answer , I think , is the various obtaining atomic states of affairs .
Distinct worlds differ with respect to content because they differ with respect to which possible states of affairs obtain .
Notably , possible atomic states of affairs also allow for a distinction between form and content .
Their form is the manner of combination of their components , their content those components themselves ( that is , their contained objects ) .
If this is right , it follows that substance — the totality of objects — is indeed , as Wittgenstein says , “ both form and content ” ( 2.024–5 ) .
It is at once the form of the world and the content of possible states of affairs ( These and further details of this interpretation of Wittgenstein ’s conception of substance as the fixed or unchanging are provided in Proops 2004 ; see also Zalabardo 2015 , Appendix II for more on simples , names , and necessary existents ) .
As we have seen , the immediate goal of the argument for substance is to establish that there are things that exist necessarily .
In the context of the assumption that anything complex could fail to exist through decomposition , this conclusion entails that there are simples ( 2.021 ) .
While the argument is presented as a two - stage modus tollens , it is conveniently reconstructed as a reductio ad absurdum ( The following interpretation of the argument is a compressed version of that provided in Proops 2004 .
For two recent alternatives , see Zalabardo 2015 , 243–254 and Morris 2017 ) :
Suppose , for reductio , that
[ 1 ]
There is no substance ( that is , nothing exists in every possible world ) .
Then
[ 2 ] Everything exists contingently .
But then
[ 3 ]
Whether a proposition has sense depends on whether another proposition is true .
So
[ 4 ]
We cannot draw up pictures of the world ( true or false ) .
But
[ 5 ]
We can draw up such pictures .
Contradiction So
[ 6 ]
There is substance ( that is , some things exist in every possible world ) .
Our [ 5 ] is the main suppressed premise .
It means , simply , that we can frame senseful propositions .
Let us now consider how we might try to defend the inference from [ 2 ] to [ 3 ] on Wittgensteinian principles .
As a preliminary , note that , given Wittgenstein ’s equation in the Notes on Logic of having sense with having truth - poles ( NB , 99 ) , it seems reasonable to suppose that for a sentence to “ have sense ” with respect to a given world may be for it to have a truth value with respect to that world .
Let us assume that this is so .
Now suppose that everything exists contingently .
Then , in particular , the referents of the semantically simple symbols occurring in a fully analysed sentence will exist contingently .
But then any such sentence will contain a semantically simple symbol that fails to refer with respect to some possible world .
Suppose , as a background assumption , that there are no contingent simples .
( It will be argued below that this assumption plausibly follows from certain Tractarian commitments . )
Then , if we assume that a sentence containing a semantically simple term is neither true nor false evaluated with respect to a world in which its purported referent fails to exist — and , for now , we do — then , for any such fully analysed sentence , there will be some world such that the sentence depends for its truth valuedness with respect to that world on the truth with respect to that world of some other sentence , viz. , the sentence stating that the constituents of the relevant complex are configured in a manner necessary and sufficient for its existence .
It follows that if everything exists contingently , then whether a sentence is senseful with respect to a world will depend on whether another sentence is true with respect to that world .
The step from [ 3 ] to [ 4 ] runs as follows .
Suppose that whether any sentence “ has sense ” ( i.e. , on our reading , has a truth - value ) depends ( in the way just explained ) on whether another is true .
Then every sentence will have an “ indeterminate sense ” in the sense that it will lack a truth value with respect to at least one possible world .
But an indeterminate sense is no sense at all , for a proposition by its very nature “ reaches through the whole logical space ” ( 3.42 ) ( i.e. , it is truth - valued with respect to every possible world ) .
[ 6 ]
So if every sentence depended for its “ sense ” ( i.e. , truth - valuedness ) on the truth of another , no sentence would have a determinate sense , and so no sentence would have a sense .
In which case we would be unable to frame senseful propositions ( i.e. , to “ draw up pictures of the world true or false ” ) .
One apparent difficulty concerns the assumption that to have sense is just to be true or false .
How can such a view be attributed to the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus given his view that tautology , which is true , and contradiction , which is false , are without sense ( sinnlos ) ( 4.461 ) ?
The seeds of an answer may be contained in a remark from Wittgenstein ’s lectures at Cambridge during the year 1934 –1935 .
Looking back on what he ’d written in the Tractatus , he says :
When I called tautologies senseless I meant to stress a connection with a quantity of sense , namely 0 . ( [ AM ] ) , 137 )
It is possible , then , that Wittgenstein is thinking of a sinnlos proposition as a proposition that “ has sense ” but has it to a zero degree .
According to this conception , a tautology , being true , is , in contrast to a nonsensical string , in the running for possessing a non-zero quantity of sense , but is so constructed that , in the end , it does n’t get to have one .
And , importantly , in virtue of being in the running for having a non-zero quantity of sense its possession of a zero quantity amounts to its , broadly speaking , ‘ having sense ’ .
Such a view , according to which , for some non-count noun N , an N - less entity has N , but has a zero quantity of it , is not without precedent in the tradition .
Kant , for example , regards rest ( motionlessness ) as a species of motion : a zero quantity of it ( Bader , Other Internet Resources , 22 – 23 ) .
If Sinnlosigkeit is , similarly , a species of Sinn , the equation of having Sinn with being true or false will be preserved .
To offer a full defence of this understanding of Sinnlosigkeit would take us too far afield , but I mention it to show that the current objection is not decisive .
Another apparent difficulty for this reconstruction arises from its appearing to contradict Tractatus 3.24 , which clearly suggests that if the complex entity A were not to exist , the proposition “ F[ A ] ” would be false , rather than , as the argument requires , without truth value .
But the difficulty is only apparent .
It merely shows that 3.24 belongs to a theory that assumes that the world does have substance .
On this assumption Wittgenstein can say that whenever an apparent name occurs that appears to mention a complex this is only because it is not , after all , a genuine name — and this is what he does say .
But on the assumption that the world has no substance , so that everything is complex , Wittgenstein can no longer say this .
For now he must allow that the semantically simple symbols occurring in a proposition ’s final analysis do refer to complexes .
So in the context of the assumption that every proposition has a final analysis , the reductio assumption of the argument for substance entails the falsity of 3.24 .
But since 3.24 is assumed to be false only in the context of a reductio , it is something that Wittgenstein can consistently endorse ( This solution to the apparent difficulty for the present reconstruction is owed , in its essentials , to David Pears ( see Pears 1987 , 78 ) .
To complete the argument it only remains to show that Tractarian commitments extrinsic to the argument for substance rule out contingent simples . [ 7 ]
Suppose a is a contingent simple .
Then “ a exists ” must be a contingent proposition .
But it can not be an elementary proposition because it will be entailed by any elementary proposition containing ‘ a , ’ and elementary propositions are logically independent ( 4.211 ) .
So “ a exists ” must be non-elementary , and so further analyzable .
And yet there would seem to be no satisfactory analysis of this proposition on the assumption that ‘ a ’ names a contingent simple — no analysis , that is to say , that is both intrinsically plausible and compatible with Tractarian principles .
Wittgenstein cannot analyse “ a exists ” as the proposition “ ∃x ( x = a ) ” for two reasons .
First , he would reject this analysis on the grounds that it makes an ineliminable use of the identity sign ( 5.534 ) .
Second , given his analysis of existential quantifications as disjunctions , the proposition “ ∃x ( x = a ) ” would be further analysed as the non-contingent proposition “ a = a ∨ a = b ∨ a = c… ” .
Nor can he analyse “ a exists ” as “ ~ [ ~ Fa & ~ Ga & ~ Ha … ] ” — that is , as the negation of the conjunction of the negations of every elementary proposition involving “ a . ”
To suppose that it could , is to suppose that the proposition “ ~ Fa & ~ Ga & ~ Ha … ” means “ a does not exist , ” and yet by the lights of the Tractatus this proposition would show a’s existence — or , more correctly , it would show something that one tries to put into words by saying “ a exists ” ( cf. 5.535 , Corr , 126 ) ) .
So , pending an unforeseen satisfactory analysis of “ a exists , ” this proposition will have to be analysed as a complex of propositions not involving a .
In other words , ‘ a ’ will have to be treated as an incomplete symbol and the fact of a’s existence will have to be taken to consist in the fact that objects other than a stand configured thus and so .
But that would seem to entail that a is not simple .
The argument for substance may be criticized on several grounds .
First , the step leading from [ 2 ] to [ 3 ] relies on the assumption that a name fails to refer with respect to a possible world at which its actual - world referent does not exist .
This amounts to the controversial assumption that names do not function as what Nathan Salmon has called “ obstinately rigid designators ” ( Salmon 1981 , 34 ) .
Secondly , the step leading from [ 3 ] to [ 4 ] relies on the assumption that a sentence that is neither true nor false with respect to some possible world fails to express a sense .
As Wittgenstein was later to realize , the case of intuitively senseful , yet vague sentences plausibly constitutes a counterexample ( cf. PI Section 99 ) .
Lastly , one may question the assumption that it makes sense to speak of a final analysis , given that the procedure for analysing a sentence of ordinary language has not been made clear ( See PI , Sections 60 , 63 –4 , and Section 91 ) .
How could we possibly know that something is a Tractarian object ?
Wittgenstein has little or nothing to say on this topic in the Tractatus , and yet it is clear from his retrospective remarks that during the composition of the Tractatus he did think it possible in principle to discover the Tractarian objects ( See AM , 11 and EPB , 121 ) .
So it seems worth asking by what means he thought such a discovery might be made .
Sometimes , it can seem as though Wittgenstein just expected to hit upon the simples by reflecting from the armchair on those items that struck him as most plausibly lacking in proper parts .
This impression is most strongly suggested in the Notebooks , and in particular in a passage from June 1915 in which Wittgenstein seems to express confidence that certain objects already within his ken either count as Tractarian objects or will turn out to do so .
He says : “ It seems to me perfectly possible that patches in our visual field are simple objects , in that we do not perceive any single point of a patch separately ; the visual appearances of stars even seem certainly to be so ” ( NB , 64 ) .
By “ patches in our visual field ” in this context Wittgenstein means parts of the visual field with no noticeable parts .
In other words , points in visual space ( cf. KL , 120 ) .
Clearly , then , Wittgenstein at one stage believed he could specify some Tractarian objects .
However , the balance of the evidence suggests that this idea was short - lived .
For he was later to say that he and Russell had pushed the question of examples of simples to one side as a matter to be settled on a future occasion ( AM , 11 ) .
And when Norman Malcolm pressed Wittgenstein to say whether when he wrote the Tractatus he had decided on anything as an example of a “ simple object , ” he had replied — according to Malcolm ’s report — that “ at the time his thought had been that he was a logician ; and that it was not his business as a logician , to try to decide whether this thing or that was a simple thing or a complex thing , that being a purely empirical matter ” ( Malcolm 1989 , 70 ) .
Wittgenstein was not suggesting that the correct way to establish that something is a Tractarian object is to gather evidence that its decomposition is physically impossible .
That reading would only have a chance of being correct if Wittgenstein had taken metaphysical possibility to coincide with physical possibility , and that is evidently not so .
[ 8 ]
His meaning seems rather to be just that the objects must be discovered rather than postulated or otherwise specified in advance of investigation ( cf. AM , 11 ) .
But since Wittgenstein was later to accuse his Tractarian self of having entertained the concept of a distinctive kind of philosophical discovery ( see WVC 182 , quoted below ) , we must not jump — as Malcolm appears to have done , to the conclusion that he conceived of the discovery in question as “ empirical ” in anything like the contemporary sense of the word .
We know that Wittgenstein denied categorically that we could specify the possible forms of elementary propositions and the simples a priori ( 4.221 , 5.553–5.5541 , 5.5571 ) .
But he did not deny that these forms would be revealed as the result of logical analysis .
In fact , he maintained precisely this view .
This idea is not explicit in the Tractatus , but it is spelled out in a later self - critical remark from G. E. Moore ’s notes of Wittgenstein ’s 1933 lectures at Cambridge :
I say in [ the ]
Tractatus that you ca n’t say anything about [ the ] structure of atomic prop[osition ]s : my idea being the wrong one , that logical analysis would reveal what it would reveal ( entry for 6 February , 1933 , Stern et. al. , 2016 , 252 )
Speaking of Tractarian objects in another retrospective remark , this time from a German version of the Brown Book , Wittgenstein says : “ What these [ fundamental constituents ] of reality are it seemed difficult to say .
I thought it was the job of further logical analysis to discover them ” ( EPB 121 ) .
These remarks should be taken at face value : it is logical analysis — the analysis of propositions — that is supposed to enable us to discover the forms of elementary propositions and the objects .
The hope is that when propositions have been put into their final , fully analysed forms by applying the “ calculus ” spoken of in the Philosophical Grammar we will finally come to know the names and thereby the objects .
Presumably , we will know the latter by acquaintance in the act of grasping propositions in their final analysed forms .
Admittedly , Wittgenstein ’s denial that we can know the objects a priori looks strange given the fact that the analytical procedure described in Section 2 above seems to presuppose that we have a priori knowledge both of the correct analyses of ordinary names and of the contextual definitions by means of which terms for complexes are eliminated .
But some tension in Wittgenstein ’s position on this point is just what we should expect in view of his later rather jaundiced assessment of his earlier reliance on the idea of philosophical discovery :
I [used to believe that ] the elementary propositions could be specified at a later date .
Only in recent years have I broken away from that mistake .
At the time I wrote in a manuscript of my book , “ The answers to philosophical questions must never be surprising .
In philosophy you cannot discover anything . ”
I myself , however , had not clearly enough understood this and offended against it .
( WVC , 182 , emphasis added )
The remark that Wittgenstein quotes here from “ a manuscript of the Tractatus ” did not survive into the final version , but its sentiment is clearly echoed in the related remark that there can : “ never be surprises in logic ” ( 6.1251 ) .
Wittgenstein is clear that in the Tractatus he had unwittingly proceeded as though there could be such a thing as a philosophical surprise or discovery .
His idea that the true objects would be discovered through analysis , but are nonetheless not known a priori , is plausibly one instance of this mistake .
On the conception of the Tractatus , objects are to be discovered by grasping fully analysed propositions , presumably with the awareness that they are fully analysed .
But since that is so , we shall not have fully explained how we are supposed to be able to discover the simples unless we explain how , in practice , we can know we have arrived at the final analysis of a proposition .
But on this point , unfortunately , Wittgenstein has little to say .
In fact , the only hint he offers is the rather dark one contained in Tractatus 3.24 :
That a propositional element signifies [ bezeichnet ] a complex can be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it occurs .
We know that everything is not yet determined by this proposition .
( The notation for generality contains a prototype ) . ( 3.24 )
It is an indeterminateness in propositions — whatever this might amount to — that is supposed to alert us to the need for further analysis .
In Wittgenstein ’s view , then , we possess a positive test for analyzability .
However , since the notion of “ indeterminateness ” in question is unclear , the test is of little practical value .
The indeterminateness in question is plainly not the one considered in section 3 : what is in question at the present juncture is the indeterminateness of propositions , not of senses .
But what does that amount to ?
According to one line of interpretation , due originally to W. D. Hart ( Hart 1971 ) , a proposition is indeterminate when there is more than one way it can be true .
Thus if I say “ Barack Obama is in the United States , ” I leave open where in particular he might be .
The source of the indeterminacy is the implied generality of this statement , which is tantamount to : “ Obama is somewhere in the United States . ”
This line of interpretation has the merit of promising to make sense of the closing parenthetical remark of 3.24 .
But it can not be correct .
The kind of indeterminacy that Wittgenstein has in mind at 3.24 is supposed to serve as a sign of further analysability .
But Hart ’s notion cannot play this role , since any disjunctive proposition would be indeterminate in his sense , even a fully analysed proposition consisting of a disjunction of elementary propositions .
According to a second line of interpretation , a proposition is indeterminate in the relevant sense if the result of embedding it in some context is structurally ambiguous .
Consider , for example , the result of embedding “ F [ A ] ” in the context “ it is not true that , ” where ‘ A ’ is temporarily treated as a semantically simple term designating a complex ( Keep in place the assumption that a sentence containing a non-referring semantically simple term is neither true nor false ) .
In this case the question would arise whether the result of this embedding is neither true nor false evaluated with respect to a world in which A does not exist , or simply true .
The first option corresponds to giving the apparent name wide scope with respect to the logical operator , the second to giving it narrow scope .
Such a scope ambiguity could not exist if ‘ A ’ were a genuine Tractarian name , so its presence could reasonably be taken to signal the need for further analysis .
So far , so good , but where does the business about the generality notation “ containing a prototype ” come in ?
Nothing in the present explanation has yet done justice to this remark .
Nor does the present explanation really pinpoint what it is that signals the need for further analysis .
That , at bottom , is the fact that we can imagine circumstances in which the supposed referent of ‘ A ’ fails to exist .
So , again , there is reason to be dissatisfied with this gloss on indeterminacy .
It must be concluded that Wittgenstein never supplied an adequate way of recognizing when a proposition is fully analysed , and consequently that he failed to specify a means for recognizing something as a Tractarian object .
Wittgenstein ’s turn away from logical atomism may be divided into two main phases .
During the first phase ( 1928 –9 ) , documented in his 1929 article “ Some Remarks on Logical Form ” ( Klagge and Nordmann , 1993 , 29 –35 ) , Wittgenstein exhibits a growing dissatisfaction with certain central details of the Tractatus ’s logical atomism , and notably with the thesis of the independence of elementary propositions .
During this phase , however , he is still working within the broad conception of analysis presupposed , if not fully developed , in the Tractatus .
The second phase ( 1931 –2 ) involves a revolutionary break with that very conception .
The so - called “ colour - exclusion problem ” is a difficulty that arises for the Tractatus ’s view that it is metaphysically possible for each elementary proposition to be true or false regardless of the truth or falsity of the others ( 4.211 ) .
In view of its generality , the problem might more accurately be termed “ the problem of the manifest incompatibility of apparently unanalysable statements . ”
The problem may be stated as follows : Suppose that a is a point in the visual field .
Consider the propositions P : “ a is blue at t ” and Q : “ a is red at t ” ( supposing “ red ” and “ blue ” to refer to determinate shades ) .
It is clear that P and Q can not both be true ; and yet , on the face of it , it seems that this incompatibility ( or “ exclusion ” in Wittgenstein ’s parlance ) is not a logical impossibility .
In the Tractatus Wittgenstein ’s response was to treat the problem as merely apparent .
He supposed that in such cases further analysis would succeed in revealing the incompatibility to be logical in nature :
For two colours , e.g. , to be at one place in the visual field is impossible , and indeed logically impossible , for it is excluded by the logical structure of colour .
Let us consider how this contradiction presents itself in physics .
Somewhat as follows :
That a particle cannot at the same time have two velocities , that is , that at the same time it cannot be in two places , that is , that particles in different places at the same time cannot be identical ( 6.3751 )
As F. P. Ramsey observes in his review of the Tractatus ( Ramsey , 1923 ) , the analysis described here actually fails to reveal a logical incompatibility between the two statements in question ; for , even granting the correctness of the envisaged reduction of the phenomenology of colour perception to facts about the velocities of particles , the fact that one and the same particle cannot be ( wholly ) in two places at the same time still looks very much like a synthetic a priori truth .
It turns out , however , that Wittgenstein was well aware of this point .
He knew that he had not taken the analysis far enough to bring out a logical contradiction , but he was confident that he had taken a step in the right direction .
In a Notebooks entry from August 1916 he remarks that : “ The fact that a particle can not be in two places at the same time does look more like a logical impossibility [ than the fact that a point cannot be red and green at the same time ] .
If we ask why , for example , then straight away comes the thought :
Well , we should call particles that were in two places [ at the same time ] different , and this in its turn all seems to follow from the structure of space and particles ” ( NB , 81 ; emphasis added ) .
Here Wittgenstein is conjecturing that it will turn out to be a conceptual ( hence , for him logical ) truth about particles and space ( and presumably also time ) that particles in two distinct places ( at the same time ) are distinct .
He does not yet possess the requisite analyses to demonstrate this conjecture , but he is optimistic that they will be found .
The article “ Some Remarks on Logical Form ” ( 1929 ) marks the end of this optimism .
Wittgenstein now arrives at the view that some incompatibilities cannot , after all , be reduced to logical impossibilities .
His change of heart appears to have been occasioned by a consideration of incompatibilities involving the attribution of qualities that admit of gradation — e.g. , the pitch of a tone , the brightness of a shade of colour , etc.
Consider , for example , the statements : “ A has exactly one degree of brightness ” and “ A has exactly two degrees of brightness . ”
The challenge is to provide analyses of these statements that bring out the logical impossibility of their being true together .
What Wittgenstein takes to be the most plausible suggestion — or at least a sympathetic reconstruction of it — adapts the standard definitions of the numerically definite quantifiers to the system described in the Tractatus , analysing these claims as respectively : “ ∃x ( Bx & A has x ) & ~∃x , y( Bx & By & A has x and A has y ) ” ( “ Bx ” means “ x is a degree of brightness ” ) and “ ∃x , y( Bx & By & A has x and A has y ) & ~∃x , y , z( Bx & By & Bz & A has x & A has y & A has z ) . ”
But the suggestion will not do .
The trouble is that the analysis — absurdly — makes it seem as though when something has just one degree of brightness there could be a substantive question about which ( if any ) of the three mentioned in the analysis of the second claim — x or y or z — it was — as if a degree of brightness were a kind of corpuscle whose association with a thing made it bright ( cf. Klagge and Nordmann , 33 ) .
Wittgenstein concludes that the independence of elementary propositions must be abandoned and that terms for real numbers must enter into atomic propositions , so that the impossibility of something ’s having both exactly one and exactly two degrees of brightness emerges as an irreducibly mathematical impossibility .
This , in turn , contradicts the Tractatus ’s idea that all necessity is logical necessity ( 6.37 ) .
Wittgenstein differs from Frege and Russell in denying that the symbols for generality have meaning in isolation .
Instead , the Tractatus treats them as incomplete symbols to be analysed away according to the following schemata :
∀x . Φx ↔ Φa & Φb & Φc …
∃x . Φx ↔ Φa ∨ Φb ∨ Φc …
Universal ( existential ) quantification is treated as equivalent to a possibly infinite conjunction ( disjunction ) of propositions .
Wittgenstein ’s dissatisfaction with this view is expressed most clearly in G. E. Moore ’s notes of Wittgenstein ’s lectures from Michaelmas term 1932 .
Now there is a temptation to which I yielded in [ the ]
Tractatus , to say that ( x ) .fx = logical product , [ 9 ] fa . fb . fc… ( ∃x ) .fx = [ logical ] sum , fa ∨ fb ∨ fc…
This is wrong , but not as absurd as it looks .
( entry for 25 November , 1932 , Stern et. al. , 2016 , 215 ) [ 10 ] .
Explaining why the Tractatus ’s analysis of generality is not palpably absurd , Wittgenstein says :
Suppose we say that : Everybody in this room has a hat =
Ursell has a hat , Richards has a hat etc .
This is obviously false , because you have to add “ & a , b , c , … are the only people in the room . ”
This I knew and said in [ the ] Tractatus .
But now , suppose we talk of “ individuals ” in R[ussell ] ’s sense , e.g. , atoms or colours ; and give them names , then there would be no prop[ osition ] analogous to “ And a , b , c are the only people in the room . ” ( ibid . )
Clearly , in the Tractatus Wittgenstein was not making the simple - minded mistake of forgetting that “ Every F is G ” can not be analysed as “ Ga & Gb & Gc … ” even when a , b , c , etc. are in fact the only Fs. ( Unfortunately , his claim that he registered this point in the Tractatus is not borne out by the text ) .
His idea was rather that the Tractatus ’s analysis of generality is offered only for the special case in which a , b , c , etc , are “ individuals ” in Russell ’s sense .
Wittgenstein had supposed that in this case there is no proposition to express the supplementary clause that is needed in the other cases .
Unfortunately , Wittgenstein does not explain why there should be no such proposition , but the answer seems likely to be the following :
What we are assumed to be analysing is actually “ Everything is G. ”
In this case any allegedly necessary competing clause — for example , “ a , b , c etc. , are the only things ” ( that is , Tractarian objects ) — would just be a nonsense - string produced in the misfired attempt to put into words something that is shown by the fact that when analysis bottoms out it yields as names only such as figure in the conjunction “ Ga & Gb & Gc … ” ( cf. Tractatus 4.1272 ) .
What led Wittgenstein to abandon the Tractatus ’s analysis of generality was his realization that he had failed adequately to think through the infinite case .
He had proceeded as though the finite case could be used as a way of thinking about the infinite case , the details of which could be sorted out at a later date .
By 1932 he had come to regard this attitude as mistaken .
The point is made in a passage from the Cambridge Lectures whose meaning can only be appreciated after some preliminary explanation .
The passage in question makes a crucial claim about something Wittgenstein refers to as “ The Proposition ” .
By this phrase in this context he means the joint denial of all the propositions that are values of the propositional function “ x is in this room ” .
This proposition can be written :
( x is in this room ) [- - - - - T ]
( Entry for November 25th , 1932 , Compare Stern et. al , 217 )
There is a most important mistake in [ the ] Tract [ atus ] … I pretended that the Proposition was a logical product ; but it is n’t , because “ … ” do n’t give you a logical product .
It is [ the ] fallacy of thinking 1 + 1 + 1 … is a sum .
It is muddling up a sum with the limit of a sum ( ibid . )
Here the symbol ‘[- - - - - T ] ’ symbolizes the joint - denial operation , and the whole symbol expresses the result of applying this operation to arbitrarily many values of the propositional function “ x is in the room ” .
The dashes in the symbol for joint denial represent rows in the truth - table on which one or more of the truth - arguments — that is values of the propositional function — is true .
The result of applying the operation of joint denial to those truth - arguments is accordingly false .
( In a variant on this notation each of the dashes could be replaced with ‘ F’ ) .
Wittgenstein is interested in the fact that while we write down finitely many dashes we intend the arguments for the joint - denial operation to be arbitrarily many and possibly infinitely many .
His criticism of these conceptions runs as follows :
His point is that the Proposition does not , despite appearances , express a logical product .
It rather , he now seems to be saying , expresses something like an indefinitely extensible process .
Wittgenstein came to see his earlier hope that it did express a logical product rested on the mistake of confusing “ dots of infinitude ” with “ dots of laziness . ” .
The upshot could scarely be more important : if Wittgenstein is right , the Tractatus ’s very conception of the general form of the proposition , because it makes essential appeal to the idea of the joint denial of arbitrarily many values of a propositional function , is itself infected with confusion .
Wittgenstein , however , does not think that the confusion of kinds of dots was the deepest mistake he made in the Tractatus .
Beyond this :
“ There was a deeper mistake — confusing logical analysis with chemical analysis .
I thought ‘( ∃x ) fx ’ is a definite logical sum , only I ca n’t at the moment tell you which ” ( November 25 , 1932 , ibid. ; cf. PG , 210 ) .
Wittgenstein had supposed that there was a fact of the matter — unknown , but in principle knowable — about which logical sum “ ( ∃x ) .fx ” is equivalent to .
But because he had failed to specify the analytical procedure in full detail , and because he had not adequately explained what analysis is supposed to preserve , this idea was unwarranted .
Indeed , it exemplified an attitude he was later to characterize as amounting to a kind of unacceptable “ dogmatism ” ( WWK , 182 ) .
But Dr. Annese has something Dr. Yakovlev did not : advanced computer technology that tracks and digitally reproduces each slice .
An entire brain produces some 2,500 slices , and the amount of information in each one , once microscopic detail is added , will fill about a terabyte of computer storage .
Computers at U.C.S.D. are now fitting all those pieces together for Mr. Molaison ’s brain , to create what Dr. Annese calls a “ Google Earthlike search engine , ” the first entirely reconstructed , whole - brain atlas available to anyone who wants to log on .

“ I feel like the world is watching over my shoulder , ” said Jacopo Annese , who dissected the brain of Henry Molaison , known as H. M. Credit ... Diego Mariscal / The Brain Observatory , University of California , San Diego
“ We ’re going to get the kind of resolution , all the way down to the level of single cells , that we have not had widely available before , ” said Donna Simmons , a visiting scholar at the Brain Architecture Center at the University of Southern California .
The thin whole - brain slicing “ will allow much better opportunities to study the connection between cells , the circuits themselves , which we have so much more to learn about . ”
Experts estimate that there are about 50 brain banks in the world , many with organs from medical patients with neurological or psychiatric problems , and some with a stock donated by people without disorders .
“ Ideally , anyone with the technology could do the same with their own specimens , ” Dr. Corkin said .
The technical challenges , however , are not trivial .
To prepare a brain for dissection , Dr. Annese first freezes it in a formaldehyde and sucrose solution , to about minus 40 degrees Celsius .
The freezing in the case of H. M. was done over four hours , a few degrees at a time : the brain , like most things , becomes more brittle when frozen .
It can crack .
Mr. Molaison lost his ability to form new memories after an operation that removed a slug - size chunk of tissue from deep in each hemisphere of his brain , making it more delicate than most .
“ A crack would have been a disaster , ” Dr. Annese said .
It did not happen .
With the help of David Malmberg , a mechanical engineer at U.C.S.D. who had designed equipment for use in the Antarctic , the laboratory fashioned a metal collar to keep the suspended brain at just the right temperature .
A few degrees too cold and the blade would chatter instead of cutting cleanly ; too warm , and the blade wants to dip into the tissue .
Mr. Malmberg held the temperature steady by pumping ethanol through the collars continually , at minus 40 degrees .
He suspended the hoses using surfboard leashes picked up days before the dissection .
The Forgotten – Christmas 2009
A decade of reflection of my own life is enough to make one realize that one never prepares for the changes that come about .
Dreams from ten years ago differs greatly from the life I have before me now .
2009 marked a number of challenges personally and due to unfortunate and unforeseen circumstances I am unable to spend Christmas with those closest to me .
With 2009 being my eye opening experience in my life , I decided to bring light to a matter I have championed on numerous occasions .
Armed with my heart and memories of Christmases I once used to know , I am spending December 25th on the streets of Toronto capturing the unfortunate plight of those who are less fortunate and without homes and cheer for the holidays .
It will be a challenging shoot as the weather reports show that Mother Nature is not going to be a friend on this day .
I hope that I will open the eyes of many and my work will prompt friends , family , and colleagues to offer their hearts , time and donations to those who are indeed less fortunate at this time of year .
To my Canadian friends , I am a huge supporter of United Way , Covenant House , Daily Bread Food Bank and Second Harvest .
These are a limited number of fantastic organizations and all I ask is that you throw support to an organization that assists those in need wherever you are in this world .
Of all days where one should be at home with those who are close , it will be a humbling and heartfelt experience for me .
Merry Christmas !
Ghost of Christmas Present
Conditioning myself for this project was not an easy undertaking .
Secluding and separating myself from Christmas altogether was a challenge and I want to thank friends and family for your wonderful support and understanding .
This was indeed a different Christmas morning from the other 33 I have had before and I am already humbled by this experience so far .
I am sure this is going to be an eye opening experience today .
It is 930 am Toronto time and I am about to hit the streets armed with 2 camera bodies , 6 lenses , 12 batteries and 10 memory cards .
I am also layered with a lot of clothing to battle the rain this afternoon .
The Ghost of Christmas Future
The important thing for me today was to ensure that whatever I captured was not coming across to exploit or become typical photographic imagery of a street shooter .
I was unsure of how I was going to approach shooting today and let my style unfold as the day progressed .
I am very humbled by the experience and absolutely in awe of the wonderful compassion of complete strangers today .
This was an incredible Christmas for me , I will carry the memories of today with me for a long time to come and look forward to sharing my story over the next week .
This is the last capture I made before heading home .
It was cold , wet and very windy , my time exposed to the weather elements although only a brief eight hours , pales in comparison to the people I captured who endure this day in and day out .
They ’ll do this again tomorrow , that is their future until something changes for them .
Please join me over the next week as I release a new story each day .
Justified and Crazy ( J.C. )
Fresh off the streetcar at Yonge and Dundas streets , I mounted my long range lens so that I could shoot anonymously from afar .
Immediately I felt guilty for shooting this way and kept thinking over and over again that something different needed to happen .
My initial nervousness changed quickly when I came walking back down the street and this gentleman smiled and say ‘ hi ’ to me .
I returned with a ‘ Merry Christmas ’ he laughed and said ‘ Oh , so that ’s what all of this is about ! ’ , he also ribbed me for shooting him from across the street .
J.C. is his name , short for Justified and Crazy .
He is 66 years old and has spent 47 years on the streets of Vancouver , Montreal with his last stop being Toronto .
I got to know some of what he has seen , one can only imagine what his eyes and heart have experienced during his time .
He is a self proclaimed ‘ Non Profit Social Worker ’ of the streets .
I am thankful that J.C. was my first capture as his wisdom and advice helped me overcome my initial fears , I put away my long range lens and mounted my short range lens to stay close .
From here on in , I would get to know the first hand stories of some very wonderful people .
The Power I Once Had ( Zena )
There are times when I run into a mire of defeating thoughts , frustration and anger and I see how easy the inability to change ‘ past choices ’ can haunt you in the present .
You work through what you could have done differently almost obsessing over each those moments that have come to define who you are today .
Those defining moments never fade , it is how you choose to live with them that alters your future .
Some know what they need to do , but ca n’t achieve it .
I am fortunate for awesome family and absolutely amazing zany crew of friends that helped pick me back up .
Some people just slip away into obscurity with no one to pick up the pieces when they need mending .
I ran into Zena ( Pronounced Zen - Nah ) while walking on Richmond St. near York St. I sat down at the edge of the curb to talk to her for awhile and instantly her story flooded .
She sat above a steam metal grated vent to keep warm all the while constantly rubbing her hands together .
Her distinct accent easily detected as her words flowed .
She has been in Canada for 13 years immigrating from South Africa losing touch with most or all of her family .
Judging from the conversation she continues to work through her scenario over and over again in her mind .
She is embattled with her fading memories and trying to achieve what she thinks will save her in the future .
Some of the conversation becomes borderline surreal and nonsensical , but the merit of the tale rang through of decisions that ca n’t be changed , loneliness , despair has gripped her and a haunting knowledge that a resolution may never come .
She continually phrased the words ‘ the power I once had ’ or ‘ I need to someone to give me the power again ( she apparently calls a lawyer regularly and leaves messages for them asking for this power she needs )
I guess she is recalling a time when she had independence and freedom to do things on her own without challenge and now to become anonymous on the streets with little resource available to her must be a dis-empowering feeling .
She talked about a brother in Vancouver , she mentioned University Degrees that she lost during her travels ( losing the degrees is also something that she leaves in messages for the lawyer and something she thinks is required for her to achieve social assistance .
Also a very important link to her story in some way . )
While we continued conversation , I requested to photograph her and she became very shy thinking she was n’t photogenic , immediately hiding her worn and stained hands into her sleeves .
She did say I could capture a shot and granted me full permission but I realized that I was losing her comfort and trust at this point so I backed off as I did n’t want to be intrusive to her and almost decided not to use her photograph at all .
I am hoping that maybe someone might catch her image on the blog and recognize the story , while she is n’t clearly defined in this shot , family and friends always have a way spotting someone they care about a mile away .
Corporate Responsibility
I was a little worried about the controversy that could be created with this shot as I am singling out one of Canada ’s leading financial institutions to produce this image .
Before this becomes a battle of money , power and greed versus the poor and helpless .
I want everyone to visit TD Canada Trust Community Responsibility page .
I had a responsibility to ensure both sides of the story are told and proved that even the giants will try help in any way they can from the rank and file of powerful executives and money managers to each of their own employee ’s pulling donations from their own pocket .
This financial power house is in no way responsible for this man being here .
Ignorance , avoidance , forgetfulness and the unwillingness to acknowledge these people is why he sleeps within the warmth of this enclosure .
I also realize that it takes willingness on the part of people to accept help when offered but it all starts with open hearts and a willingness to talk about the issue from both sides of the streets .
This was an important image for me to tell the story of my Christmas on the streets and it tells a story of a major financial institution with loads of money in the banks , invested income from all walks of life and income levels and here I have a man seeking comfort and warmth within the enclosure of the bank machine area .
For some this is a troubling issue of trust when entering to withdraw cash and having someone who is obviously troubled and on their last leg within reach , I can understand the nervousness and fear that most would encounter at this moment .
An easy solution is to not forget those who need help , pay attention and try to help when you can .
This man and many other may never seek solace in a place like this again if we help .
This is no place for someone to be on Christmas Day .
Salvation in T.V. ( Bob )
My time with Bob was brief , he is originally from Hamilton , Ontario and came to Toronto just for something different .
When I asked how long he had been on the street he was unsure of the actual numbers .
He quickly asked for two dollars and I obliged and while sifting through my change to find a twoonie he saw that I had more and asked for another .
He was shy , excitable and unsure but knew that with the money he had collected from me and many others today that he would be able to find a room with a T.V. for the night .
He was also excited about the prospect of having a turkey dinner at the Salvation Army .
I captured this on Queen St. at Yonge St. immediately after he collected the four dollars from me , he was on his way to catch a streetcar that was fast approaching .
Like a child on Christmas morning I watched him bolt across the street with a youthful bound .
He did catch his streetcar and I am hoping Bob found his T.V. for the night .
Now I can honestly question some of things I take for granted every day and I do own a T.V. with a full cable package that I never watch .
Something that simple put a leap in his step , I turned my T.V. on for the first time in months tonight .
I smiled , wondering what Bob would be watching .
At the Edge
This is one of a few candid anonymous shots I captured on Christmas Day .
I did n’t want to disturb whomever was sleeping at the edge of the street .
Part of me just wanted to wake them to get them away from the corner .
With vehicles passing by at any moment , one of them could easily mount the curb and wipe this person out .
This was a saddening and frightening image to come across on Christmas Day , anonymous on the edge while people and cars pass by in the Financial District of Toronto .
Embrace of Trust ( Johnny )
Continuing along the backstreet of Richmond , I came across Johnny who looked as though he had a whole party going on .
Our time together could have gone in different directions , he was polite , smiled and acknowledged me .
I could have dismissed him easily and he would n’t have thought otherwise .
I sat with Johnny leaned my back up against the wall of an expensive restaurant I had eaten in two Christmases ago .
I traded cigarettes with him and both of us just started a conversation like we were old friends over smokes .
One thing I realized about the people I met on the streets is that trust is important and to build trust you have to do what you would do in all of your relationships .
Respect , acknowledge , appreciate and listen to the person you want to trust and have them return the same to you .
I gave Johnny what I would give any of my friends and for that I received an amazing and memorable Christmas gift from him .
2009 had been a year where I lost trust in people and skeptical of anyone ’s underlying motive towards me .
My own misgivings and inability to trust had been shutting me out from people who cared and wanted to be there for me .
Johnny began opening up bags to show me what people had left for him throughout the night and all day of Christmas .
He pulled out envelopes filled with money gifted from strangers , many pairs of socks , he offered some of the food he received to share with me .
I realized he trusted me , he had nothing more than what was surrounding him on the corner .
His whole life in bags and he shared everything with me even asking about my life and story .
The stories he shared with me are n’t much different from my own experiences in life .
His trust in me became very important and I appreciated it very much .
Something else magical happened with Johnny and it was this moment that will stay with me forever .
Trust is something earned , friendship is something maintained and from that people choose to include you as part of the pack of family they have .
A woman came walking up the street , Johnny turned to the woman ( a good friend of his and fellow streeter ) and asked how she was and she returned with smiles and typical banter .
Johnny then introduced me by my name to Tamara , she and I exchanged handshakes and conversation .
While his situation is difficult , he took the time to listen to me as much as I listened to him and for 15 minutes I got to be a part of their friendship circle and it made me feel welcomed .
Johnny is in his 30 ’s originally hailing from the good ole city of Halifax , he lost his parents in a car crash five years ago in Nova Scotia and last year while sleeping on the streets he was run over by a garbage truck spending only fours in hospital to be sent back to the street .
He has been on and off the streets for the last four years and does n’t feel sorry for himself in the slightest .
After wishing me a Merry Christmas we parted ways , emotionally choked I walked away and could feel the tears welling in my eyes .
Merry Christmas Johnny !
Thank you !
The Fine Line ( Tamara )
Tamara is the woman I told you of being introduced to by Johnny , I came across her again a little further down the street .
We started to talk again and this time she was explaining her appreciation for me taking the time to talk to her , get to know her .
Something a lot of people do n’t do , while appreciative of the gifts they were receiving from total strangers throughout the day .
The common story came about still remaining anonymous from all of my subjects .
I watched it happen throughout the day , wonderful people offering generous support , gifts and taking the time away from their Christmas with family to do something for others .
However amazing this was , people would run from cars and hand them a bag , an envelope or a card and turn around run back to the car and fade off to find another person in need without getting to know any of the people they just helped .
Tamara has been on and off the street for about five years , she feels safer out in the open streets than being in shelters for fear of being hurt , beaten , robbed and has her friends Johnny and her buddy whom I did n’t catch a name to protect her as she does in return for them .
I also learned that Toronto offers 11 homeless shelters for men and only 2 for women according to Tamara .
She was also turned away from the Salvation Army due to overload .
This is still unsafe for her as men and women are both put together in a common area at the Salvation Army .
The two things that bother Tamara the most is being ignored .
“ I bleed the same colour of blood you do , I cry too ” she says .
She too received money throughout the evening and knows that she is still going to kicked out of restaurants , when she like everyone else can pay for her own food .
The other thing , do n’t tell her to get a job , she would love one .
A challenge , how does someone from the streets of no fixed address send resume’s .
No employer is going to respond to “ please meet me at the corner of York and Richmond ” as a credible address .
Her worn features she says makes people feel intimidated , again how do you build trust when first formed opinions are how a person looks .
She is right about everything she said , very sad and true .
Reality is , she is there on the street .
But just as easily I could be there at anytime given the right circumstances to fall in place .
There is a fine line between safety and the unknown of the streets .
Anyone could get there , having to struggle to fit in as a human being again , being kicked out of common places that we once went into freely .
Tamara , thank you for allowing me to capture you !
You are an amazing woman , somehow I know if I made it to the streets I know I would be able to call upon you for help .
My time in your circle of trust is greatly appreciated .
Urban Angel ( Daniel )
Everyone and every place has a story and this location played an important role in different decisions that wish I could have made or handled differently .
I let someone very close and important to me down at this very place .
With mixed emotions I walked into the scene to catch this lively character named Daniel huddled under blankets perched against a fire hydrant .
He saw me catch the first frame and as I walked across the street to greet him he started chatting away with me .
I introduced myself to him , instantly he pulled out his hand and we shook on the cordial introduction .
It had starting to rain and I had been sitting on the pavement for most of the day , so with soggy pants I sat down to chat with Daniel .
He told me of stories of friends that he had who changed their lives , gotten married , had kids , homes and cars .
I asked how long he had been on the street and he is running into his ninth anniversary at the age of 43 with no real ambition to change at this point .
He accepts his situation as a life and challenge he has been given by god and tries to live each day as best he can .
I have had people trying to pound this thought into me all year long , I guess it took a gentle giant on the street to finally drive that point home to me .
While Daniel and I were talking , a pickup truck with a mother and child rolled up , the boy had a bag of food that was now intended for Daniel .
Daniel could n’t get up quickly so I jumped over to receive the dinner on his behalf .
While making my way back down to the ground Daniel asked if I was hungry , he said that he could n’t eat anymore today , that it was hard for him to turn down the generosity of others but just could n’t fathom eating anymore and wanted me to have it instead .
I offered many thanks , declined and told him to hold onto the food for later .
Daniel was smarter than I , the rain was coming down heavier and he started to get up and pack his belongings to find shelter .
While packing his things , an SUV pulled up along side us , a gentleman jumped out of the vehicle and handed Daniel a twenty dollar bill .
Daniel started bouncing around and almost tackled the guy with an amazing hug .
His spark for life , his graciousness , his friendliness makes him an Urban Angel .
Daniel finally collected his things , we parted ways with a handshake and him giving me two oranges .
I ate one of them , gave the other away .
For Better for Worse ( Mark and Ellen )
Marriages and relationships end for some reason or other and I have encountered stories including my own that met an impasse and part ways for far less stress and reasoning .
I came across Ellen sitting by herself and asked how she was , I noticed she had a cell phone in which she explained she had found a few months ago .
It does n’t work with a cell package , but Ellen was resourceful in buying a charger for it so that she could play games to pass time .
Earlier in the year I lost two Blackberry phones leaving me extraordinarily frustrated .
My phone is my line out to the world and without it I felt disconnected , so now I am hoping that someone like Ellen has found my phones .
Wishful thinking on my part , but it would make feel better about losing them .
Ellen is n’t homeless , but down on hard times and she mentioned her husband Mark had gone to run an errand .
She was really worried about him as he had been gone awhile .
I captured a couple pictures of Ellen and bade her farewell and asked what Mark looked like so that if I ran into him I could tell him she was looking for him .
Realize I said this to be reassuring , I did n’t think I would actually run into Mark .
I was walking west on Queen St. and had gotten a fair distance from Ellen when I noticed a guy fitting the description she gave me of Mark , so I called his name out and sure enough , I ran into Mark .
I introduced myself and that I had met Ellen and what I was doing today .
He offered me a cigarette and we chatted about the day and how he has been working odd jobs to make ends meet .
I was taken aback when he mentioned that he and his wife were friends with Spring Phillips whom I had only just read about in the news recently .
Spring had been murdered on December 5th earlier this month .
Not only dealing with life ’s stress over the holidays , they had to deal with the violent passing of a friend .
Mark and I exchanged phone numbers , I will give them a call to see how they are making out and to let them know about this blog entry .
Thank you both .
To stay together 15 years through both good and really hard times is a strength that most couples dream of .
I wish you both absolutely the best and many more years together .
I hope the tables turn and we ’ll see you on the upside of the valley soon .
I am glad that I got to capture a photo of the two of you together .
Cold Hard Reality – Cold Weather Alert December 28th 2009
To most a cold weather alert means to bundle and dress up warm to combat the cold .
It means that all should take precaution against the elements for fear of frosbite , hypothermia or potential death if exposed inadequately for too long .
For me tonight , the cold weather alert just hit home because I now know the names of a few people that may be out there right now inadequately prepared for this weather .
I myself just came in from that cold and I would hate to think any of my subjects are out there out right now fighting - 9 degrees celsius with a wind chill of - 20 degrees .
It is going to get colder this evening as it progresses to - 15 with a windchill of – 25 into the wee hours of the morning of tomorrow .
Most days I would just curse the weather and renounce the fact that I live in the northern parts of the world .
Given what I experienced on Christmas Day , the thought of Johnny , Tamara , Chris , The Gary ’s , Billy , Paul and Zena sitting out there while I am warm typing this message feels extraordinarily helpless .
That is a cold hard reality for the people who live on the streets of Toronto in the winter .
You Call That Art ???
( Gary and Chris )
I am writing this as the cold alert has been put in place by the City of Toronto .
I am hoping these two zany characters are warm and safe right now .
They both reminded me of Laurel and Hardy of the Toronto ’s Financial District .
Neither deserve to be cold tonight .
I met Gary earlier in the day at King and Church streets , we exchanged hello’s and he expressed great distress over the fact that he was unable to get his usual piles of Outreach Newspapers that he would sell in hopes to make money at the corner of Queen and Yonge St. which one of our major subway hubs .
While we were talking , a young guy came into the picture , his name was Chris .
Gary is an outlandish personality with an amazing sense of humour , Chris is a strong silent watcher of his surroundings and also very protective of Gary .
Chris is a young guy , good looking and deserves to be at a restaurant or club with a very beautiful woman on his arms .
Instead he is one of many stories that has made its way to the streets .
Gary is just a fun loving guy who just does n’t take things too seriously and tries to find some humour in things .
I really admire both of them for the strengths .
The two zany guys would be a central part of my whole day as I would keep running into them throughout my time on the streets .
Chris was a little apprehensive in the beginning , I made the mistake of saying that I am usually known as an artistic photographer creating fine art images while I was training my camera on Gary to capture a portrait .
Chris started chuckling and laughing really hard , blurting out “ You call that fucking art ? ” in which Gary retorted ” Yeah , I am , I am gonna be famous .
I am a celebrity now go back to your blanket . ”
This would become the theme every time I would run into them .
Chris ’ shyness prevented me from being able to capture an up close portrait .
However he seemed appreciative of my sincerity .
I offered to get him a coffee as it was cold and windy where he was , he shyly and humbly asked for a hot chocolate instead .
I am not rich , I am not affluent nor do I have the power to change this kids life .
If I could , I would get him off the streets in a heart beat .
He does n’t deserve this at all .
Yet he quietly moves about not asking for anything and gracious of anyone who offers assistance to him .
Gary on the other hand is the opposite , he has such an entertaining personality .
He loved that I captured his photograph or that I wanted to capture him at all .
Every time we would meet up , he would ask how his fame was coming along .
To give you an idea of how lighthearted Gary is , when I squatted to the ground to talk to him or when I was capturing an image of him .
He would call out to those passing by to give donations because I needed help in making him famous and could n’t afford my camera ’s or even better yet that I was a starving artist in need of help more than him .
The funny thing about this , he almost convinced a few people to throw money in support of me .
I watched a few reaching into their pockets and I could n’t help but laugh as this guy was blatantly mocking me in jest and almost got away with it .
Gary and Chris became my grounding point throughout the day , adding humour and a sense of fun to their reality , also making me feel welcomed , appreciated and just gave me a hell of a good laugh .
To those who almost donated to my cause .
I appreciate it , but it was Gary ’s fault not mine .
He was just my artistic muse and hopefully I can make him famous .
So , to my readers especially those in Toronto , if you happen to pass Queen and Yonge St. at the Queen St. subway station and see a guy selling Outreach Newspapers .
Please ask Gary for an autograph !
Also tell him he is a beautiful piece of art too !
It ’ll give him some ammunition to go back at Chris with a story .
Gary is wearing the striped pants and Chris is in the black toque and cargo pants .
This is Art !!
They went everywhere together .
The Bells of Christmas Silently Toll
I live in a world crossed between sound and silence .
I can choose to include sounds in my daily life with the use of a hearing aid or I can easily bring the quiet silence in to my life .
It is nice that I have a choice to do this , something I have appreciated for many years and still to this day some will question why I enjoy silence .
To walk in a world silently is an amazing experience that only a select few can appreciate .
I realize now that while I learned to appreciate this wonderful option I have , I also take it for granted .
To see this was heartbreaking when everyday I slip in and out of the silent and loud world at will .
Here I have a 68 year old woman who is crying for assistance so that she can bring sounds back into her life .
I ca n’t imagine not being able to have some hearing and not being able to take full advantage of what is remaining without the use of my hearing aid .
Here is someone sitting at the edge of a street in silence as people pass by without her knowledge .
For those who do n’t understand how the system works .
Ontario offers a program called Assistive Devices Program or ADP for short .
I am able to take advantage of this every five years now that I am an adult .
Hearing Aids can cost anywhere from $ 900 – $ 1400 and ADP will kick in up to $ 700 leaving the rest up to the person who requires this device to pay out of pocket .
Each hearing aid has special features depending on hearing loss and could require the most expensive option , so how does this 68 year old woman pay the other $ 200 - 700 while on the streets and still find shelter or food ?
Double those numbers if you need two hearing aids .
Then the terrible reality , these devices also require batteries that run up to $ 20 a package for about 8 weeks worth of sound .
After running across this scene , I put away my ipod , I turned my hearing aid off and moved on in silence in her honour .
Brief Passage of Time ( Billy , Gary , Paul and Mike )
Some of my moments were brief encounters but no less memorable , some were openly receptive to my presence and others were guarded and I did n’t want to force my time nor make anyone feel uncomfortable .
However brief , I still have names that I can place on these four men whom I am sure we have passed throughout our times on the streets of Toronto .
Billy
While sipping on a breakfast shake outside a 7/11 on Bay St. at Richmond I ran into Billy who was shy and extraordinarily polite .
He has been on the streets for roughly 5 years , constantly in search of warmth during the winter , sadly and unfortunately some have to resort to means of pulling stunts that can wind you up in jail .
It ’s a bed , food , and shelter .
Sad how good people may have to cross a line for a sense of sheltered protection .
Billy was sitting back watching the perch on behalf of his friend Paul whom I ran into later .
Gary
Gary was reserved of my presence and we exchanged a couple of stories .
He has been on the streets for 9 years originally hailing from Thunder Bay .
He received a lot throughout the evening as my other subjects had too .
I requested to take his photograph , he agreed but followed up with “ But you have to leave me alone now ” .
He was n’t being rude , he is just private , guarded and not used to all of the attention he was receiving all Christmas Day .
The reality is the 364 days is spent in silence and all of the sudden you become celebrity like with people coming at you from everywhere .
For all of us , I guess it is time to notice and pay attention during the other 364 days .
Mike
He is from Manitoulin Island , has been on the streets for 15 years and has family in Barrie .
He is a quiet gentle giant who is unsure and very guarded as well .
We exchanged idle chit chat for a few minutes over a cigarette but he was looking around everywhere and I did n’t want to steal his thunder in case someone wanted to offer him a gift .
It can be intimidating to others when you have two people congregated on the sidewalk .
Paul
I mentioned to Paul about running into Billy , he laughed and he was telling about how he was just running about through the day and now back at his usual location in front of the 7/11 .
He has has been on and off the streets for about 20 years .
I left the photo intact with imperfections of rain on the lens on purpose .
It was starting to rain pretty hard by this point .
You can see how wet he is , I too shared the same wet feeling but I have the opportunity to dry off in warmth later on .
He does n’t have that same option .
Reflections in the Mirror – Future Hope
One has to take a moment and pause and reflect on their own life , look into a mirror and remember that even our lives have stories that may not be much different than the people I met on Christmas Day .
We all come from families , we have had people that are a part of our lives , some may be supportive others maybe not but there is always a connection to others .
A moment in a mirror , you might recall the child that used to look back at you , remember the laughter and innocence that you once had and remember that all of my captures were young and innocent once .
This journey was a personal reflection into my own past , and listening to the lives of my subjects made me realize how fortunate I am to have the family , friends and colleagues that I have in my life .
Their presence , acknowledgment and compassion kept me on a straight line or I could have easily been one of these stories myself .
Anyone with the right circumstances to fall into place could be any of my Christmas stories .
It really does n’t take much to fall .
These people did n’t arrive here easily , no one grows up to aspire a life on the streets .
Each of these people had others that let them fade when they needed help the most and before long without guidance , support or a soft place to land .
I would now come to meet all of them on Christmas Day when most are sharing a special times their families .
The easiest way to prevent this from being a reality in the future , is to pay attention to those around you .
Someone you know may be struggling with drug and alcohol addictions .
Others are just teetering on losing everything financially and without the means of money where does one go ?
Someone may be struggling with the symptoms of mental illness .
Each of my subjects had people in their lives at one point that saw them slipping , avoidance , turning the other way and not paying attention landed them here .
I realize that we ca n’t all save everyone even if we wanted to , but some have more power than others and if my photo series opens even just one heart to preventing another soul from landing on the streets then I achieved a goal .
If my series now prompts people to talk to those we would normally pass by , then I have achieved another fantastic milestone .
I am sure now , those who have been following this series will look a little closer to their pockets of friendships and families and they will see someone who needs support .
There are many social programs that anyone can take advantage before things go out of control .
Today is a good time to take stock of those you love as tomorrow could be too late .
From the enormous outpouring of support I have been receiving for this project , I know that I have done my part into opening conversation among many of my own friends that would n’t have happened a week ago and that is a starting point .
I know that this problem will never go away , I know that it wo n’t change overnight , I realize that more people will follow the paths of Johnny , Tamara , Daniel , J.C. , Mike , The Gary ’s , Chris , Paul , Zena , Billy , Mark and Ellen but I came across a scene that would be a hopeful thought of someone shedding their life on the street for something better .
If my city was littered with this scene and no one around to claim ownership I would be all the happier .
Thank you for all of the amazing support and wonderful encouragement and appreciate you following my Christmas Day on the streets of Toronto .
It was an amazing experience and I would do it over and over again , but there is hope that this might not happen one day .
Thank you to everyone who granted me permission to capture your images and for allowing me into your lives for a few moments .
You will all stay in my memories and each of you made a Christmas for me to remember always .
To my readers , I would love to have you take a moment and make something count , whether it be donations to a support group that you believe in , commit some time to help those in need or just keep the conversation alive so that we can pay attention more in the future .
Happy Holidays , may everyone have a safe and Happy New Year .
One of the stars of the 1986 Tokyo Motor Show was the Suzuki Nuda concept .
The styling attracted a huge amount of attention , and unlike most 20 - year - old concept studies , still looks fresh today .
The Nuda was reputedly operational and rideable , propelled by the DOHC in - line four GSX - R750 engine ; it had two - wheel - drive , with power transmitted via shaft drives , and the front wheel was hub - steered in the Bimota fashion .
Otherwise , details about this machine are surprisingly hard to find .
Does anyone have a source of information ?

Millions of people use BitTorrent to share files every day , but only a small percentage actually understand how BitTorrent works and appreciate why it is such an efficient way to share large files .
A simplified but insightful visualization helps to shed some light on the inner workings of the BitTorrent client .
As with most technology , viewing a simple simulator depicting the inner working of BitTorrent is much easier than having to plow through pages of technicalities and insider lingo .
So , for those who never got to read up on what ’s under the hood of a BitTorrent client , this visualization comes in handy .
The nifty BitTorrent swarm visualization uses processing .js to represent how a BitTorrent swarm works .
In particular it may help novices get a grasp on how BitTorrent functions and why it ’s capable of sending a gigabyte of data to millions of people in only a few minutes .
As most tech - savvy users know , BitTorrent starts with chopping a file into small pieces .
The person who starts sharing the file sends those small pieces to available peers in the swarm .
The BitTorrent protocol makes sure that the seed sends pieces to everyone , so they can immediately exchange these pieces with each other .
What follows is a sharing fest of bits and bytes .
Your BitTorrent client tries to find the rarest piece that ’s available among the peers in the swarm to avoid getting stuck at 99 % and sharing relies on fair trading principles ( tit - for - tat ) .
In general BitTorrent transfers go faster if the number of seeders in the entire swarm is higher .
This means that a torrent with 20 seeders and 50 leechers should result in a better download speed compared to a torrent with 50 seeders and 250 leechers .
The BitTorrent simulation is a simplified visualizations of this process .
It works in all up - to - date browsers except Internet Explorer .
Seeds can be added to the swarm with the “ s ” key and peers with the “ p ” key .
The “ r ” key allows you to delete seeds or peers from the swarm at random .
In 2006 we wrote about an earlier version of this “ BitTorrent simulator , ” but because the original is no longer online and since many more people use BitTorrent nowadays , the update is appreciated .

Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton .
In last week ’s post I used a stylized illustration to throw into sharp relief the economic and ethical dimensions of community - rated premiums for health insurance .
I am gratified by the many comments that post drew , and even more so by their quality .
( In fact , I have shared these comments with my students in a course on health policy . )
The comments show that there is no consensus on the merits of community rating in this country .
Remarkably , in virtually all other industrialized nations , this issue is hardly ever raised .
Community rating there has long been widely accepted and is unlikely to be abandoned in the foreseeable future .
The health systems of Switzerland , the Netherlands and Germany are frequently cited as potential models for a reformed American health system .
All three countries offer their citizens a wide choice of health insurers — none of which is a government - run health plan .
Yet in all three countries full community rating is de rigueur .
Swiss citizens , for example , are required to purchase insurance coverage for a comprehensive health - benefit package from a large menu of private health insurance companies that compete for customers on the basis of the premium they charge for that coverage .
Profits cannot be earned on insurance for the basic package .
Premiums do vary among competing insurers , but for a given insurer they can vary only by the deductible and coinsurance rates of the different policies .
Neither the individual ’s health status nor age affects the premium charged the individual by a given insurer .
Health insurers ending up with an older or sicker enrolled risk pool then receive compensation from a risk - equalization fund .
Similarly , Dutch citizens are required to purchase insurance coverage for a comprehensive benefit package from a menu of private for - profit or not - for - profit insurers .
Roughly half of the cost of this coverage is financed by a payroll tax — that is , it is based roughly on ability to pay .
The other half comes from competitively set premiums collected directly from those enrolled .
The payroll taxes are paid into a national risk - equalization fund that then pays a risk - adjusted amount to the insurance carrier chosen by a particular individual .
Among health services researchers , this risk - adjustment mechanism has long been viewed as one of the most sophisticated in the world .
The part of the premium collected by Dutch insurers directly from individuals is fully community - rated .
Although these premiums vary among insurers , a given insurer must charge all comers , healthy or not , young or old , the same premium , which is community - rated over that insurer ’s pool of those insured .
Germany ’s statutory health insurance system , covering about 90 percent of the population , also has a national risk - equalization fund , which is fed by a flat payroll tax on gross income of about 14 percent paid by all employees insured by that system .
The risk - equalization fund makes a risk - adjusted payment to the health insurer ( which is a nonprofit “ sickness fund ” ) of the individual ’s choice .
That payment from the risk - equalization fund , of course , does reflect the individual ’s health status and age .
But the individual ’s payroll - tax payment into the risk - equalization fund is completely independent of the individual ’s age and health status .
It is based strictly on ability to pay .
I could continue to describe the health insurance systems of other European countries , or Canada , Taiwan , Japan , South Korea , Australia or New Zealand .
We would find that in none of these health systems does the individual ’s or family ’s contribution to health insurance reflect that individual ’s age or health status .
Community rating is so acceptable in these countries because citizens there view it not only as part of a larger social contract , but also as a vehicle for life - cycle economic planning .
The vast majority of citizens in these countries view health care as a “ social good ” that is to be shared on the basis of need by all on roughly equal terms and is to be financed largely on the basis of ability to pay .
By contrast , Americans have never agreed on a shared social ethic that should govern their health system , as the current debate over health reform has made visibly and audibly clear .
Furthermore , younger and healthier people in these countries realize that , but for the grace of God , they might become chronically ill only a few years hence and that , in any event , one day they , too , will be older and sicker .
By paying more than their actuarially expected cost for health insurance , young and healthy people in these countries join a club , so to speak , that offers them a valuable call option .
That call option allows them to procure at age 55 health insurance at a premium much below their actuarially expected cost .
By contrast , Americans have been taught that health insurance is largely a private consumption item purchased year to year and customized to the individual ’s circumstances .
Indeed , the private health insurance industry in this country has never been able to offer individual Americans the kind of life - cycle health insurance citizens in virtually all other industrialized nations take for granted .
With the exception of Medicare , all health insurance in the United States is basically temporary .
Curiously , however , although Americans often flatter themselves with the image of being self - reliant , rugged individualists , they actually tend to rely more than citizens in many other countries on government - run health insurance and pensions in their old age , or when they fall on hard times .
It is what makes the creature called “ American ” so perplexing in the eyes of foreigners .
Furthermore , many Americans who oppose community - rated insurance in the current health - reform plan are themselves beneficiaries of community rating .
I shall have something more to say about this oddity in my next post to this blog .
Oct. 28 , 2009  -- Alison Howard , a single mom from Atlanta , sent her only son Bryan off to college last year for what she hoped would be a lifelong education .
One lasting lesson is now burned into his brain : Beware of banks bearing special credit card offers .
The University of Albany , Ga. , student , failing to fully familiarize himself with all the many lines of fine print in the terms of the arrangement , unwittingly racked up hundreds of dollars in penalty fees in just a few months .
In an effort to protect consumers like Bryan Howard from what the Federal Reserve called " unfair or deceptive " practices by banks issuing credit cards , Congress earlier this year passed the Credit CARD Act of 2009 .
But such unfair or deceptive practices have n't abated in the lag time between when the law was passed and when it goes into full effect in February -- they are actually on the rise , according to a report released today by the Pew Charitable Trusts .
A full 100 percent of the credit cards offered online by the 12 leading bank card issuers continue to include practices that will be soon be outlawed , once the legislation passed in May takes effect next year , according to a new report by the Pew Health Group 's Safe Credit Cards Project .
How Is the Economy Treating You ?
Share Your Story With ABC News
Pew 's findings come as little surprise to Alison and Bryan Howard .
An administrative specialist at the CDC , Howard encouraged her son to open a Bank of America account that included a credit card , debit card and a money market account .
Soon , monthly service fees on the accounts led to a negative balance , then overdraft fees that the 20 - year - old student never knew existed in the first place .
These penalty fees piled up every time he so much as charged a can of soda .
In the end , penalty fees wound up totaling around $ 400 in just a few months , even though he had been making more than his minimum monthly payments , and on time no less .
" I honestly despise BofA for the way they treated my son , " Howard said .
" They did n't need a bailout .
They get one every day from their customers . "
Credit Card Interest Rates , Penalty Rates Rise
The report by the Pew Health Group 's Safe Credit Cards Project also found that credit card interest rates went up by an average of 20 percent in the first six months of 2009 , even as banks ' cost of lending declined
" Some of the most harmful practices have actually grown more widespread , " said Shelley Hearne , who helped oversee the research project .
" Not one of the bank cards reviewed would meet the legal requirements outlined in the Credit CARD Act . "
The Pew report examined some 400 consumer credit cards .
Some key findings :
99.7 percent of bank card terms allowed issuers to increase interest rates on outstanding balances -- a jump from 93 percent in December .
95 percent of bank card terms permitted issuers to apply payments in a way ( allocating payments toward the lowest interest balances and not the highest ) the Federal Reserve found likely to cause substantial financial injury to consumers .
90 percent of bank cards had penalty rate hikes , with the vast majority imposed by " hair triggers " of one or two late payments in a year .
" The Federal Reserve must ensure that the rules it is developing will prevent unreasonable or disproportionate penalties , including penalty rate increases , which our data show remain far too common , " said Nick Bourke , manager of Pew 's Safe Credit Cards Project .
The practices of credit card companies continue to draw lawmakers ' attention .
Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. , earlier this week announced he was supporting legislation that would force the credit card industry to comply with the new laws starting in December , two months ahead of schedule .
Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , meanwhile , has proposed legislation imposing an across - the - board rate freeze on credit card companies .
Bank of America Vows Cooperation
Scott Talbott , senior vice president for government affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable , a banking , credit card and securities industry lobbying group , defended the industry moving to , in some cases , increased interest rates and / or higher fees by pointing out the realities card issuers are facing on two fronts .
" Rates and fees are in response to increased risk presented by borrowers and by economic conditions in general , " Talbott said .
" We are talking about the riskiest form of lending .
Bottom line : People are free to shop around . "
Outrage over credit card industry practices , and in particular BofA practices , literally reached critical mass earlier this autumn when a Red Bluff , Calif. , woman named Anne Minch posted a video on YouTube venting her rage and disgust over BofA 's decision to hike her rate from around 13 percent to 30 percent .
Speaking forcefully into the camera and aiming her comments at bank honchos , Minch vowed to boycott her payments in protest .
The video went viral .
Eventually , she got results : BofA agreed to take the rate back down to 13 percent .
Betty Riess , a BofA spokeswoman , explained that while she could not disclose any customers ' specific account information , she could confirm that the bank reached out to Minch , and that after getting some additional information regarding her situation the parties " reached a mutually agreeable resolution . "
Riess said she could not comment on the Howards ' situation , but she said the bank takes a fair and responsible approach to lending , adding that " when we do provide credit to students , we have a strong educational component and provide information about fees and terms up front . "
BofA does appear to be trying to offset growing negative perception .
Bank executive John Collingwood , BofA 's director of federal government relations , earlier this month fired off a letter vowing cooperation to House Financial Services Committee chairman Rep. Barney Frank .
Collingwood 's letter , which BofA has made public , stated : " In light of the concerns expressed to us by our customers , Bank of America will not implement any change in terms ( risk or economic based ) rate re-pricing of consumer credit card accounts between now and the effective date of the CARD Act .
We believe that this is responsive to the concerns we have heard and is consistent with other consumer oriented policy changes we have made recently , like giving customers much more control over the risk of incurring overdraft fees and substantially limiting the application of those fees . "
How Consumers Can Fight Back
John Ulzheimer , president of consumer education for Credit.com , a San Francisco - based provider of credit card data , says the Pew study confirms what his own research has shown .
The Web site 's surveys of credit card users over the past three months revealed that 45 percent of respondents indicated that card companies had either raised rates , imposed higher fees , increased minimum payment , reduced credit lines or shaved reward programs , up from 33 percent in June .
Apart from shooting an outrage video and hoping it goes viral , how can consumers most effectively fight back against sneaky credit card companies , whether before the new laws go into effect or after ?
" There are thousands of smaller providers and credit unions who issue cards and who do not , generally speaking , engage in deception or unfair practices , " Ulzheimer said .
" The big banks are not the only game in town .
People need to shop around . "
The Pew study concurred : Credit unions offered significantly lower advertised rates compared to bank credit cards , with penalty fees that were half the cost of comparable bank fees and fewer dangers associated with " unfair or deceptive " practices , researchers found .
And , of course the best way to avoid hidden fees , Ulzheimer added : " Read the fine print . "
Oil -rich Saudi Arabia is one of the world 's wealthiest countries .
But though it 's generous when it comes to building Islamic religious schools and mosques throughout the world , Saudi Arabia has been rather miserly when it comes to the suffering of the people of Haiti , which was struck by a cataclysmic earthquake that destroyed its capital and killed tens of thousands .
Certainly , Haiti is a world away from Saudi Arabia .
And it 's a mostly Christian country , rather than Muslim .
But that has n't stopped other wealthy Middle East countries from pitching in .
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : afv-0.0.0
Hi ,
Here is the first release of Atom 's Formal Verifier ( AFV ) [ 1 ] , a tool intended to verify Atom -- or human -- generated C code .
With the help of the Yices SMT solver [ 2 ] , AFV uses bounded model checking and k-induction to verify assertions in iteratively called C functions , such as an embedded control loop .
For each assertion in a design , AFV will return a pass , a fail , or an inconclusive result -- or it will die trying .
In addition to Yices , AFV needs GCC for C preprocessing .
This is a very early release .
There are many things missing including counter example generation , finite precision modeling , and basic model reduction .
And they is a chance -- say about 100 % -- that there are bugs with the modeling transformations .
In addition , the list of unsupported C syntax is embarrassingly long : - recursive functions - non-unique top level names ( e.g. top level names hidden with static ) - loops - switch statements - pointers - arrays - type casting - non void functions - functions with arguments - structs - enums - unions - typedefs Still , AFV works well for the handful of tests I have tried so far .
AFV comes with a simple example .
To run : $ afv example #
This generates afv.h and example .c shown below ... //
Provides assert and assume functions .
# include " afv.h " // Periodic function for verification .
Implements a simple rolling counter .
void example ( ) { //
The rolling counter .
static int counter =
0 ; // Assertions .
GreaterThanOrEqualTo0 : assert ( counter >= 0 ) ; // The ' counter ' must always be greater than or equal to 0 .
LessThan10 : assert ( counter < 10 ) ; // The ' counter ' must always be less than 10 .
// Implementation 1. if ( counter == 10 ) counter = 0 ; else counter ++ ; // Implementation 2 . // if ( counter == 9 ) // counter = 0 ; // else // counter = counter + 1 ; // Implementation 3 . // if ( counter >= 9 ) // counter = 0 ; // else // counter ++; // Implementation 4 . // if ( counter >= 9 || counter < 0 ) // counter = 0 ; // else // counter ++; // Implementation 5 . // counter = ( counter + 1 ) % 10 ; } To run the verification on the example : $ afv verify example -k 20 example .c #
Which returns ... parsing example .c ... verifying assertion example .
GreaterThanOrEqualTo0.assert ... inconclusive : unable to proved step up to max k = 20 verifying assertion example .
LessThan10.assert ... FAILED : disproved basis in k = 11
These results state AFV was unable to prove the " GreaterThanOrEqualTo0 " assertion and it disproved the " LessThan10 " assertion .
The different implementations in the example yield different results .
Any feedback or questions are more than welcome .
I would like to thank Benedikt Huber and friends for the language -c library [ 3 ] , Ki Yung
Ahn for the yices library [ 4 ] , and the folks at SRI for their work on the Yices SMT solver .
Without these tools and libraries , AFV would not have been possible .

The Senate is going to be in session all weekend , debating the big health care bill and arguing about which direction the cost - curve is heading .
This is a positive development on two counts .
It keeps senators off the streets while providing much - needed employment in the chart - making sector of our economy .
Or we could just lock them in a basement until they ’re done squabbling .
Either way is good , but the basement option would have the advantage of covering some of the less - active debaters with an attractive coat of mildew .
In any case , I guarantee you that the number of normal Americans who will pay attention can be numbered in the low single digits .
So as a public service to the nonlistening audience , let me give you a summary of the important action so far :
ROUND ONE Republicans :
Let ’s get rid of all the Medicare savings in the bill .
Think of the seniors !
Democrats : Yettaruttayetta .
ROUND TWO Mammograms !
Everybody loves them .
Ca n’t have enough .
ROUND THREE
Republicans :
Let ’s get rid of part of the Medicare savings in the bill .
Think of the seniors !

You are here : Home / Weird Stuff / 12 Weird Things to Do With Your Cremated Remains
As cremations have become more and more popular in recent years , people have devised a number of unusual ways to commemorate the dearly departed .
If youâ€™re looking for a unique way to be remembered , here are 12 strange things you can do with your cremated remains .
1. You Can Be Shot Into Space
Celestis made headlines in 1997 when they launched the cremated remains of 60 â€™s icon Timothy Leary and Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry into space .
For a fairly reasonable fee ( starting at $ 695 ) , you can send a â€œsymbolic portionâ€ of yourself on the next available mission , riding alongside a commercial or scientific satellite .
You can come back to Earth after the flight , or pay more to remain in orbit .
Youâ€™ll stay there for an estimated 10 to 240 years before reentering the atmosphere in a blaze of fire .
In the future , Celestis plans to launch cremated remains into the moonâ€™s orbit , to the surface of the moon , and possibly into deep space .
2. You Can Be Exploded With Fireworks
Yes , you can literally â€œgo out with a bang.â€ 
Companies like Heavenâ€™s Above Fireworks can pack a small portion of your ashes into professional - grade fireworks and stage a memorial display for your survivors .
You can choose a big , noisy , colorful display or a quieter , more understated event .
For a smaller fee , you can have your ashes stuffed into small , self - fired rockets , so your family can have their own private fireworks ceremony at home .
3. You Can Be Mixed Into a Coral Reef
Environmentalist ?
Ocean lover ?
You can create your own â€œliving legacyâ€ by having your ashes turned into an artificial coral reef .
Your remains will help restore damaged reefs and create a nurturing marine environment for fish and other forms of sea life .
Starting around $ 4,000 , Eternal Reefs will mix your cremated remains into concrete , shape the artificial reef and place the reef out on the sea floor .
Larger personal reefs can hold up to four people and include pets .
If thatâ€™s too pricey , you can have your remains mixed together with others and as part of a complete reef system .
4. You Can Be Crushed Into a Diamond
Jewelry from human remains ?
It sounds ghoulish , but weâ€ ™re not talking about necklaces made from bones or teeth .
With companies like LifeGem , your carbon remains ( or a lock of your hair ) can be crushed into a gemstone that is identical to a natural diamond on a molecular level .
Using modern technology , this process only takes a few months instead of millions of years .
Itâ€™s not cheap , though .
Expect to shell out a few grand for the smallest gems , and that doesnâ€™t include the cost of the setting .
5. You Can Be Fired In Hand - Blown Glass
Canâ€™t shell out a small fortune to be crushed into a diamond ?
For a fraction of the price , you can still be turned into bling at Memory Glass .
Starting around $ 150 , the artists at Memory Glass take a small portion of cremated remains and infuse them into hand - blown glass keepsakes and jewelry .
Each member of your family can get their own colorful glass pendant to wear on a chain or leather cord .
6. You Can Be Painted Into a Work of Art
The professional artist at Ashes to Portraits creates oil paintings of the deceased with traces of cremated ashes mixed in .
If you like this idea , make sure you leave behind a large , close - up photograph to work from ( at minimum , 4 ? x 6 ? , but the bigger the better ) .
Theyâ€™ll also do portraits of your cremated pet .
If you prefer something less literal , you can send a bit of your ashes to Art in Ashes .
Their staff painter creates colorful modern abstract art mixed with cremated remains .
You can choose one of their pre-made compositions or let them know what colors you want to see .
7. You Can Be Launched in a Helium Balloon
Scattering cremated remains by airplane is fairly common these days , but it can be expensive and difficult for family members to participate .
The Eternal Ascent Society makes aerial ash scattering more accessible and affordable by placing the ashes inside a large helium balloon and launching it into the clouds .
The balloon itself is 5 feet wide and comes in red , green , blue and yellow .
About 6 miles up into the sky , the atmosphere gets so cold that the balloon will freeze and shatter , and your ashes will disperse into the clouds .
Itâ€™s biodegradable , so you donâ€™t have to worry about damaging the environment .
8. You Can Be Stuffed Into a Teddy Bear
Huggable Urns are stuffed animals with a lined velvet compartment inside to hold a personâ€™s cremated remains .
You can choose from a number of teddy bears , plush dogs and cats or just a simple , soft pillow .
You can send in a loved oneâ€™s clothing or special blanket to have a small outfit or accessory made for your Huggable Urn .
They also make customized stuffed animals , if youâ€™d like one that looks just like a deceased pet .
9 . You Can Be Mounted to a Vehicle
Some people are happiest when theyâ€™re behind the wheel , and now you can be there permanently after your demise .
A Mobile Cremation
Urn can be mounted on a motorcycle , motor home , car , truck , police cruiser , cruise ship or pretty much anything else that moves .
You can personalize your mobile cremation urn with engraving , and add your picture to the mobile urn with your name or a favorite quote .
You can also choose a commemorative disc for the end cap based on your religion , profession , military service or social organization .
10 . You Can Be the Sand in an Hourglass
An interesting twist on the typical urn is the Hourglass Keepsake Urn .
This hourglass is filled with cremated ashes instead of sand , creating a lovely symbol of the passage of time in every personâ€™s life .
If you and your spouse or loved one would like to share an hourglass , your ashes can be mixed into a single urn .
11 . You Can Be Turned Into a Box of Pencils
With this project , artist Nadine Jarvis is exploring the idea of turning a deceased person from â€œashes to ashes.â€ 
She estimates that about 240 pencils could be made from the carbon of human cremains .
The pencils would be stored inside a specially designed box , with a sharpener in its side and a viewing window on top .
When the pencils are sharpened into the side of the box , the pencil shavings turn into a new kind of ash , and the box becomes a kind of urn .
12 . You Can Be Built Into a Pyramid
In ancient Egypt , the pyramids were built to hold the remains and worldly goods of the royal deceased .
Unfortunately , these â€œpermanentâ€ monuments have deteriorated under the stresses of time , weather and incessant grave - robbing .
In modern times , a company called PYRA Development wants to build pyramids out of a high - impact polymer that would last over a million years .
Each building block of the pyramid would contain the remains and memorabilia of a deceased person .
Thereâ€™s no evidence that this project ever got off the ground , but itâ€™s a fascinating idea nonetheless .

Anti-War Activist Mounts GOP Campaign for Congress
Created : December 18 , 2009 06:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Adam Kokesh at an antiwar rally in September 2007 ( Flickr : ragessos )
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) had barely begun to give his acceptance speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention when a clamor went up in the upper levels of St. Paul ’s XCel Center .
Adam Kokesh , a marine who had become a leader of Iraq Veterans Against the War , stood up and unfurled a banner with two sides .
On the first side : “ YOU CAN ’T WIN AN OCCUPATION . ”
On the other side : “ MCCAIN VOTES AGAINST VETS . ”
[ GOP1 ]
Security guards went into action and dealt with Kokesh ’s banner ; an irritated crowd of Republicans chanted “ USA ” until the banner was removed .
McCain moved right on , but Kokesh had n’t finished yet .
“ I ’m grateful to the president of the United States for leading us in these dark days following the worst attack in American history , ” said McCain .
“ Ask McCain why he votes against veterans ! ” shouted Kokesh .
He did n’t get another chance to rain on McCain ’s parade , but Kokesh remained proud of what he did .
A video that cut together the interruption with jokes , subtitles , and a pounding soundtrack went up on Kokesh ’s YouTube account .
It ’s still there , even though Kokesh ’s relationship to the Republican Party is very different now .
He ’s a candidate for Congress in New Mexico ’s 3rd district , looking like the Republican front - runner just one short year after he crashed the convention .
Over the course of a year , he ’s made the move from confrontation - seeking anti-war activist to clean - cut politician in the mold of the man he supported in 2008 , Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) .
“ The ground has really shifted away from the neocon agenda , ” Kokesh told TWI during a break in his campaign schedule .
“ There was no influx of young people getting into the Republican Party to support John McCain .
By contrast , Ron Paul brought a huge number of young people into the Republican Party .
It ’s really exciting to see that happening again with my campaign . ”
Kokesh ’s move into electoral politics–he is 27 years old , and this is his first stab at campaigning–unifies two trends that have made the GOP that will fight the midterm elections dramatically different than the one Kokesh used to protest .
The first is the rise of Ron Paul ’s libertarianism .
After years of obscurity , Paul came out of the 2008 elections with a national fundraising base and new respect for his ideas about war and economics among Republican activists and voters .
The second trend is the Tea Party movement .
After feeling ignored by George W. Bush ’s Republicans , the conservative base has come together to demand commitment to the Constitution , commitment to small government values , and guarantees of national and state sovereignty .
“ He never had an official role in the campaign , but we could count on him to energize people , ” said Jesse Benton , Paul ’s spokesman .
Kokesh was a late addition to Paul ’s 2008 “ Rally for the Republic , ” an event meant to “ bring the Republican Party back to its roots ” held in Minneapolis before McCain ’s address to the RNC in 2008 .
“ I ’d like to think that this symbolizes some good old - fashioned traditional conservatism making a comeback in the GOP , ” said Benton .
“ Republicans have seen that running as the ‘ war party ’ is a loser for them . ”
Today , Kokesh argues that the efforts of Paul supporters look more or less successful .
Bush - era “ neocons ” are out of the political mainstream , replaced by people like him .
“ Our nation is drifting dangerously from freedom to fascism , ” Kokesh said at a July 2008 rally for Paul in Washington , D.C. ; at a 2007 Senate hearing , he was photographed holding up a tally of how many times then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales had said “ I do n’t recall . ”
But rhetoric that sounded out of the mainstream that year sounds perfectly in line with the comments of Republicans like Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn. ) or Sen. Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) , and criticism of the GOP or the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are no longer controversial in the party ’s grassroots .
“ If you want to compare to Washington , yes , I ’m a radical extremist , ” Kokesh told TWI .
“ If you want to compare me to normal American values , I ’m right in the middle of the road .
I ’m finding out that the grassroots of both parties are so grossly misrepresented by their representatives in Washington that we have more in common with each other . ”
Depending on who ’s analyzing the race , New Mexico ’s third district is either an ideal or a poorly chosen battlefield for a candidate like Kokesh .
It ’s the most Democratic - leaning district in the state , having given 61 percent of the vote to the Obama - Biden ticket in 2008 .
Rep. Ben Ray Lujan ( D - N.M. ) , the freshman that Kokesh wants to challenge , won his election by 27 points , spending $ 1.5 million to fend off a Republican who spent only $ 190,000 .
One Democratic insider labeled Kokesh as an interesting candidate with an interesting strategy and no chance to win .
“ There is almost zero chance this seat will change hands , ” said David Wasserman , House race editor of the Cook Political Report , which ranks NM - 3 the 133rd bluest seat in America .
“ It is just too Democratic . ”
Still , Democrats and Republicans in the district , with the election 11 months away , expressed some respect for a first - time campaigner ( Kokesh is 27 years old ) who cleaned up for politics in a hurry .
His connections to Ron Paul ’s movement have allowed him to raise near $ 150,000 in a few months since entering the campaign in August .
“ He ’s an interesting candidate , ” said Richard Ellenberg , chairman of the Santa Fe County Democratic Party .
“ There are some people who surprise me with –I almost want to call it their ‘ star - struck ’ approach to this campaign .
They were star - struck by Obama and they ’re star - struck by Kokesh . ”
A spokeswoman for the New Mexico Republican Party told TWI that the presence of another candidate in the Republican primary –Tom Mullins , another first - time politician–prevents the party from saying anything more than how its members are “ excited to have strong candidates in this district . ”
But John Otter , a founder of the Green Party of the United States who is the party ’s treasurer in Santa Fe , said that Kokesh had a shot at winning over anti-war liberals .
“ Personally , I ’d vote for him , ” said Otter .
“ I ’d be be attracted to someone with a position against the war .
Lujan was elected with liberal votes , and he ’s just gone with the flow . ”
Kokesh ’s appeal has a lot to do with the hard - edged activism that launched his career .
He has traded in military fatigues for suits and plaid shirts .
“ I think people have told him that the one - fisted Black Panther salute might not sell anymore , ” said Jesse Benton .
His message , however , is the same anti-war libertarian populism that used to get him kicked out of buildings .
“ You ca n’t just start chanting ‘ End the Fed ’ at a GOP county meeting , ” said Kokesh .
“ You have to take a step back and explain this perspective on monetary policy .
But what ’s so exciting now , in terms of the opportunity presented by this horrible economic situation is that you can start teaching these Austrian economic principles , and all of a sudden they do n’t seem so abstract because you can connect them to what ’s happening in real life . ”
Mullins , who entered the race in October and is running a more traditional Republican campaign , has not chosen to make an issue out of Kokesh ’s anti-war activism or argue that his opponent is out of the party mainstream .
“ I disagree with his characterization of our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan as ‘ occupations , ’ ” said Mullins .
“ I think the president made the right decision , and we should finish the job , but to be honest the war does n’t come up much right now . ”
Kokesh agreed with Mullins , after smiling at how his opponent had tried to publicize his own libertarian credentials .
( “ He ’s holding a copy of The Road to Serfdom on his website , ” said Kokesh .
“ Of course , he ’s also holding up a copy of Going Rogue . ” )
Anti-war activists are key to the Kokesh campaign .
He received an attention - getting endorsement from former Sen. Mike Gravel , and he ’s publicized his support from Tina Richards , a “ marine mom ” who gained notoriety after a heated 2007 confrontation with Rep. Dave Obey ( D - Wisc. ) over why Democrats refused to cut off funding for the Iraq War .
But the issue that got him to confront John McCain is n’t motivating voters in New Mexico .
“ Most of them do n’t care , and that ’s really sad , ” said Kokesh .
“ It ’s not just Republicans , but all voters .
The Obama administration is keeping up the Bush policy of keeping Americans isolated from the war . ”
But Democrats , even as they write off his chances at a win , say Kokesh ’s transition from the anti-war movement to anti-Fed , libertarian populism is coming at a perfect time .
“ I think he ’s trying to pick up a national mantle , as a national personality in the Ron Paul mode , ” said Ellenberg .
“ I think he ’s been successful so far . ”
As far as ending wars abroad is concerned , 2009 was the year of too many dashed hopes .
President Barack Obama appears both master and slave of the Long War trajectory as we move into year nine of our post - 9/11 war ethos .
But there ’s one war the president may stop – in fact , his election has motivated developments toward this end at a pace not seen in decades .
We ’re talking about the War on Drugs , and ending it could change the lives of millions of Americans – as well as Mexicans , Colombians , and others in places that feed America ’s illicit drug habits .
While it might sound a little fantastic , consider this : in the last year , the White House has ordered its Justice Department to stop prosecuting medical marijuana growers , users , and dispensaries , as long as they are operating within state law .
That has led the 13 states with medical marijuana laws to push forward more assertively in establishing public dispensaries and encouraged legislation in other states to relax marijuana statutes and allow medical marijuana .
Draconian minimum sentencing for drug arrests has finally been reversed in New York , and sentencing reform has pushed ahead in other states , too .
Just last week , Congress ended a restriction on a District of Columbia medical marijuana law passed by voters in 1998 .
Ironically , former U.S. Rep. Bob Barr ( R - Ga. ) helped put that restriction into place , but since then , the former federal prosecutor has reexamined his position on marijuana as a states ’ rights issue and has been helping to push back against further federal intrusion .
In February , Obama appointed Gil Kerlikowske as drug czar .
Ostensibly , he ’s quite the antithesis of drug czars past , since he is no ideologue .
In fact , he faithfully implemented decriminalization efforts as Seattle ’s police chief despite his own opposition , pragmatically working with community activists to keep nonviolent drug offenders out of jail .
Allen St. Pierre , director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) , told Antiwar.com that his organization was invited to participate in Kerlikowske ’s blue ribbon panel on criminal justice policies and drugs .
Talk about change : St. Pierre and Co. would n’t have gotten past security when Barry McCaffrey ( czar under Bill Clinton ) and John Walters ( czar under George W. Bush ) were in office .
Meanwhile , former heads of state in Latin American countries are urging decriminalization , if not full legalization , as a solution to the bloody , cartel - driven drug war throughout the hemisphere .
Mexico relaxed its own criminal statutes for drugs this year in an attempt to stem the violence , most of which is spurred by U.S. demand for illegal drugs .
Finally , while there is hardly widespread support for reversing criminal restrictions on drugs such as cocaine and heroin , American attitudes about marijuana have softened in ways not seen in this country since the 1960s .
But even then there was a seemingly impenetrable cultural and political divide between conservative prohibitionists and socially liberal users .
Today , a clear majority of Americans ( representing both sides of the aisle ) consider the medicinal uses of pot quite valid , and more than ever , they are open to decriminalization generally ( some recent polls show over 50 percent in favor ) .
Even the American Medical Association , which heretofore had not officially recognized the potential medical benefits of marijuana , reconsidered its position in November , actually calling on the federal government to take pot off the Drug Enforcement Agency ’s Schedule I ( a place it dubiously shares with the most restricted drugs , including heroin and methamphetamines ) and to allow for more thorough cannabis research ( which is n’t possible now , because the government controls all the plants that could be used for sanctioned study ) .
" There is no doubt that I am biased , " said NORML ’s St. Pierre , " but it ’s hard to argue that there have n’t been some significant changes . "
" What we call the War on Drugs is really a war on cannabis users , " he added .
And , thanks in part to the election of Obama , but also because of traction in local and state governments and , ironically , the " crushing economic times , " that war seems to be reaching a breaking point .
St. Pierre pointed to recent statistics that find that 49 percent of all drug arrests today are for marijuana .
Of the 850,000 pot busts in 2008 , 89 percent were for possession only .
As St. Pierre put it , " An election has happened , a different attitude and mentality has been brought to the forefront .
I would n’t be a soothsayer to predict that had [ John ] McCain been elected [ in 2008 ] … there would have been a phalanx of federal lawyers " sent to places like Rhode Island and Maine , where local laws have just been passed to make it easier for people to sell and buy medical marijuana .
While pot is still illegal at the federal level , the Justice Department ’s recent directive takes Uncle Sam further out of the equation .
Meanwhile , California is actually grappling with the possibility of legalizing marijuana outright ( a current ballot initiative for legalization is expected to reach a public referendum in 2010 ) and taxing marijuana revenues .
While California by no means represents the whole of the country , the fact that its Republican governor has called for an open debate on the issue says how far attitudes have come since California Republican Richard Nixon first declared war on drugs in 1969 and California Republican Ronald Reagan intensified that war in the ’ 80s .
" All these things are coming together right now , and it ’s kind of ironic , " said St. Pierre .
He pointed out that Eric Holder served as deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration , which pushed the drug war with zeal , elevating McCaffrey as a sort of anti-pot Patton who ran the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy ( ONDCP ) as an elaborate command center that gobbled up millions of dollars for what are now considered useless anti-drug campaigns .
" Here is a guy [ Holder ] who in the 1990s was going around trying to knock out all the medical marijuana laws .
Mr. Holder was making those arguments – wrongly – against medical marijuana , and they lost , as you can see , " said St. Pierre .
Though the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held up the right of the federal government to prosecute anti-marijuana statutes , " we have clearly won in the court of public opinion . "
The ONDCP ’s public anti-drug campaign budget , which cost taxpayers $ 1.6 billion between 1998 through 2006 , was slashed on the House side of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations for fiscal year 2010 , though the final bill has been held up in conference .
But there seems to be a growing recognition , backed up by government reviews , that the media campaigns are , for lack of a better term , wasted on today ’s youth .
Meanwhile , a May 20 memo [ .pdf ] handed down by the Obama administration was a genuine extension of faith , if not a gift to drug war activists and federalists in general , according to St. Pierre .
The memo , regarding federal assertions of preemption in state laws , was as surprising as it was welcome .
" In my lifetime , one of the major tenets of the GOP has been the idea of returning states ’ rights and decentralizing power out of the big , bad Beltway , " he said .
" Ironically … it is something that in eight years the Bush administration had the opportunity to do but never did . "
Putting the Toke Before the Smoke
David Boaz , author and vice president of the Cato Institute , warns that the challenges for activists like St. Pierre are still very real , and perhaps ultimately insurmountable .
Prohibitionist lawmakers and bureaucrats across the spectrum wo n’t cave without a protracted and bloody political fight , especially when their long - held beliefs and livelihoods are truly threatened .
" I ’ve been watching this for a long time .
Getting the government to stop doing what it ’s been doing for 70 years is extremely difficult , " said Boaz , author of The Politics of Freedom .
State laws may evolve , but statutory changes at the federal level , which are key to ultimate decriminalization , are n’t in the cards yet , especially when Republicans like Sen .
Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) continue to demagogue the issue .
" The number - one risk for our kids is not obesity , it is illicit marijuana , " Coburn declared in a hearing with Holder in October , where he also stated that " 90 percent of the people with a prescription in California [ for medical marijuana ] do not have a real illness , what they have is a desire to smoke marijuana . "
Anti-drug money is in " every nook and cranny " of the federal budget and will inspire all forms of pushback from departments as far - ranging as Education to Justice to the Treasury , or in other words , the " drug war - industrial complex , " said Boaz .
" That should be the backdrop for all the enthusiastic stories about marijuana , " we ’re seeing in the media today , he added .
That would inevitably include the argument that taxing legalized marijuana , just like alcohol , would bring boatloads of revenues into lagging state coffers .
" When you make it legal , prices will naturally come down ; there wo n’t be a $ 10 billion industry to tax anymore . "
However , Boaz acknowledges the extraordinary shift in political and cultural attitudes about pot , suggesting that no matter how tough the battle , there is no turning back now .
Particularly , the growing chorus of mainstream domestic – and foreign – voices insisting that decriminalization is necessary for security .
" You ’d think a country built on capitalism would understand basic laws of supply and demand .
Instead , a failed and irrational national policy blunders forward , costing billions , incarcerating large numbers of people , and enriching ruthless crime syndicates .
" The cartels are not stagnant .
They are growing in power and influence .
In Phoenix , Mexican cartels are blamed for a dramatic rise in kidnapping and other violence .
" Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard says it may be only a matter of time before the kind of turf battles that are common in Mexico erupt along drug - transit corridors in Arizona .
Goddard , who does not support legalization , says , ‘ I do support an intelligent dialogue [ on legalization ] . ’ …
" It ’s time to hit the bad guys where it really hurts . "
" Take away their cash cow . "
This was written by Linda Valdez , columnist for the Arizona Republic .
Out West , even law enforcement officials – some , not all – recognize that the Drug War is a vicious drain on their resources .
" Part of me wants marijuana legalized , " said Wayne Hanson , a sheriff ’s sergeant in Humboldt County , Calif. , " because it would take away the wealth and the greed and the violence . "
A retired sheriff ’s lieutenant interviewed recently by NPR said California law enforcement helped destroy 4.5 million illegal plants last year – but that was only a tiny percentage of the existing crop .
Drug cartels are now competing directly with domestic growers , audaciously cultivating in our state and national parks and using illegal immigrants to do it .
This year a summit of former Latin American leaders called for drug legalization in order to stop the killing and corruption in their countries .
" It will be almost impossible to solve Mexico ’s problems and other countries ’ problems without a more ample , comprehensive set of policies from the U.S. government , " said former Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardosa .
In August , Mexico quietly acted .
It passed a law decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of major drugs , including cannabis , cocaine , heroin , and ecstasy .
From Time :
" Washington ’s silence on the issue is telling .
In 2006 , Mexico ’s Congress approved a bill with almost exactly the same provisions .
However , the administration of George W. Bush immediately complained about the measure and then - president Vicente Fox refused to sign it into law .
In contrast , officials of the Obama administration have been decidedly guarded in commenting on the new legislation .
When asked about it in his visit to Mexico last month , drug czar Gil Kerlikowske said he would ‘ wait and see . ’
Many view such a change as evidence that Washington is finally reconsidering its confrontational war on drugs , four decades after Richard Nixon declared it .
‘ There is a growing opinion that the use of force has simply failed to destroy the drug trade and other measures are needed , ’ says Mexican political analyst José Antonio Crespo .
‘ It appears that the White House may be starting to adjust its approach . ' ”
Conservative columnists like George Will are starting to see the writing on the wall .
Between the flourishing state medical marijuana laws and other efforts at the state level ( there have even been " colleges " for medical marijuana established in friendly states like California and Michigan ) and a cultural shift ( you know there is something going on when the Today Show is interviewing " Stiletto Stoners " ) , that wall may be crumbling .
Which means at least one war may be finally coming to an end .
And in an age when it is all war , all the time , these events are toast - worthy as we ring in the New Year .
" Who knew communism would end when it did ? " said Boaz , who is hopeful , despite his warnings .
" If the Soviet Union can fall , certainly marijuana laws can . "
MOST mobile phones are now more intelligent than their teenage owners , it emerged last night .
Researchers at the Institute for Studies found the latest Nokia smartphone has an extensive vocabulary , a built - in calculator and is not permanently ripped to the tits on low - grade skunk .
N96 , a smartphone belonging to 14 - year - old Wayne Hayes , said : " I am constantly disappointed by his appalling grammar , his neanderthal social skills and his protracted , chimp - like bouts of frenzied masturbation .
" In addition , his punctuation is distressingly moronic .
He thinks a comma is a form of deep unconsciousness one may succumb to as a result of a serious head injury . "
But Hayes dismissed N96's criticism , insisting : " You 're a fucking bender .
Fuck off , you fucking bender . "
In a bid to boost grades , some schools have begun excluding their students from classes and simply teaching the mobile phones instead .
Roy Hobbs , a head teacher from Hatfield , said : " They are genuinely interested in subjects like geography , modern literature and British social history instead of the heads of famous women that have been grafted on to the bodies of porn actresses who are taking it up the back passage . "
He added : " What 's more they are well - designed , punctual and have yet to spray - paint a big , fat cock on the bonnet of my car . "

La baja de la temperatura en los últimos días en México , por la presencia del frente norte número 22 , es sólo una muestra de lo que el cambio climático es capaz de producir en los extremos , aseguró el investigador del Centro de Ciencias de la Atmósfera , Carlos Gay , e integrante del IPCC , ganador del Premio Nobel por sus estudios en este campo .
Gay sostiene que el mundo requiere “ inventar ” un nuevo modelo de desarrollo económico no sólo para salir de una crisis monetaria sino para sacar a parte importante de su población de las condiciones de pobreza , pero que implique menos emisiones de bióxido de carbono .
Adelantó que los efectos del cambio climático , en los próximos años serán , entre otros , la menor disponibilidad de agua y la disminución de la producción de los campos agrícolas que hoy son altamente rentables , por lo que “ se van a crear nuevos conflictos mundiales ” por la disponibilidad de agua o la tenencia de la tierra que no esté inundada .
El experto de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México ( UNAM ) dijo que desde 1900 a la fecha la temperatura del mundo subió 0.7 grados , pero subir a 2 grados centígrados para el año 2100 implicaría para México perder 25 % de las especies actuales y que el nivel del mar suba entre cuatro y seis metros .
Gay consideró que la postura que mantuvo México en la reciente Cumbre de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Clima en Copenhague fue “ esquizofrénica ” puesto que respaldó la iniciativa de países de la Unión Europea de limitar el aumento de la temperatura media del planeta a 2 grados centígrados “ sin pedir nada a cambio y en contra de la postura de otros países con economías similares de desarrollo como China , India y Brasil ” .
Ante un grupo de periodistas dentro del diplomado que organiza el Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnología del Distrito Federal , que se desarrolla en la Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México , el investigador reveló que a pesar de que los diferentes escenarios de impacto sobre el cambio global en el mundo y en países como México , son de inundaciones y extinción de especies de flora y fauna , si la temperatura promedio sube por arriba de los 2 grados , la delegación del gobierno mexicano insistió en apoyar esa iniciativa que respaldaron sólo los países europeos .
“ Debería haber estado del lado de China , de India o Brasil , que tienen economías similares ” .
NEW YORK — Human rights defenders from Russia to Sri Lanka were themselves targets of vicious abuses in 2009 , Human Rights Watch said Wednesday in its annual world report .
HRW ’s executive director , Kenneth Roth , introduced the 624 - page report by saying abuses against defenders of human rights represented a backlash by governments feeling the pressure .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Attacks on rights defenders might be seen as a perverse tribute to the human rights movement , but that doesn?t mitigate the danger , ” Roth said .
“ Under various pretexts , abusive governments are attacking the very foundations of the human rights movement . ”
The report highlights the daylight kidnapping and murder of Natalia Estemirova , who investigated abductions , torture and illegal executions in Chechnya — most of them by Russian and Russian - installed Chechen forces .
Her murder came after a prominent human rights lawyer , Stanislav Markelov , was shot dead in central Moscow , and was followed by the murder of two charity workers in Chechnya and the gunning down of an opposition and civic activist in neighboring Ingushetia .
Other countries where human rights monitors were murdered included Afghanistan , Burundi , Kenya and Sri Lanka , HRW said .
Authoritarian countries such as Mynamar and China also saw repression , while Eritrea , North Korea and Turkmenistan were so abusive that “ no domestic human rights movement can function , ” HRW said in a statement launching the report .
ADVERTISEMENT
In addition to violent attacks , countries including China and Iran used the disbarment of lawyers , faked criminal charges , or — as in Russia and Azerbaijan — libel laws to silence dissent , HRW said .
Sudan and China in particular regularly close human rights groups , while Iran and Uzbekistan “ openly harass and arbitrarily detain ” rights defenders .
Another government singled out is Israel where human rights defenders “ have experienced a more hostile climate than ever before after documenting abuses committed by Israel , as well as Hamas . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
HRW also criticized the United States , saying that despite President Barack Obama ’s pledge to close Guantanamo Bay and end torture , Washington is maintaining military commissions for some terrorist suspects .
That and “ continuing to hold suspects indefinitely without charge or trial … ( risk ) perpetuating the spirit of Guantanamo , ” Roth said .
ADVERTISEMENT
He called for prosecution of all “ those who have ordered , facilitated , or carried out torture and other ill - treatment , ” he said .
Roth said the only hope for human rights defenders in dangerous countries is international support .
“ Governments that support human rights need to speak out , to make respecting human rights the bedrock of their diplomacy — and of their own practices , ” Roth said .
ADVERTISEMENT
HRW also decried what it called a concerted attack on the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) following the issuing of a war crimes arrest warrant against Sudan ’s President Omar al - Bashir , whose forces are accused of atrocities in Darfur .
“ Instead of applauding the ICC for taking action to redress the mass murder and forced displacement … , the African Union resolved in July not to cooperate in executing the arrest warrant , ” HRW said .
Human Rights
Watch also highlighted :
— China ’s “ harsh crackdown ” on ethnic violence in the Uighur - majority Xinjiang province .
— Cuba , where the switch from Fidel Castro to his brother Raul in 2006 “ has had little effect on Cuba ?s dismal human rights record .
Cuba remains the one country in Latin America that represses virtually all forms of political dissent . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
— The Democratic Republic of Congo where the government and rebel forces were responsible for a “ dramatic increase in violence against civilians . ”
The report said “ at least 2,500 civilians were slaughtered , over 7,000 women and girls were raped , and more than one million people were forced to flee . ”
— Iran ’s crackdown following the June 2009 presidential election where “ ordinary protestors and prominent opposition figures faced detention without trial , harsh treatment including sexual violence and denial of due process . ”
— Iraq where “ conditions in Iraq remain extremely poor , especially for displaced persons , religious and ethnic minorities , and vulnerable groups such as women and girls , and men suspected of homosexual conduct . ”
— Israel and Gaza where civilians were the targets of military assaults , particularly in the intense Israeli assault on Gaza a year ago .
If you found a suspicious lump in your neck , you ’d never put off dealing with it with the excuse :
This is the loveliest neck in the world , and I do n’t want to tinker with it .
Sure , hospitals are expensive and serve tasteless food .
Yes , surgeons can accidentally leave a clamp behind , and nobody likes blood .
But burying one ’s head in the sand is what ostriches do  and that ’s what we Americans are poised to do if we miss this chance to reform our sick health care system .
The debate about health care in recent months has focused on the shortcomings of the reform proposals .
Critics are right to be disappointed that the legislation does n’t curb malpractice suits and does n’t do more to change the basic fee - for - service structure that incubates rising health care costs .
But just think for a moment about the far costlier option that now may lie ahead of us : sticking with the status quo .
いいから殺せ。後はこっちでなんとかするから
昨日 、Twitter でUNIXについて語り合っていたら、色々と面白いフィードバックを頂けたので紹介したいと思います。
これは衝撃でした。 サングラスで金メッシュ入りのヒゲ男性が電車の中で「いいから殺せ。大丈夫。後はこっちでなんとかするから」と言っていたらビビりますよね。
( 余談ですが 「 ヒットマン事件簿」を思い出しました)
この発言が発生するトリガーとなったのが以下の発言でした。
みなさまノリノリで、リアルゴルゴ発言以外にも、こんな発言が登場しました。
IT 業界って怖いですね〜（棒読み）
何でそうなった ？
そもそもの発端は、私が現在執筆中のLinuxネットワークプログラミング書に書いているコラムのための質問でした。
Wiresharkやtcpdumpを利用したパケットキャプチャによる通信プログラムのデバッグを解説する際にプロミスキャスモードとは何かという話を書いていたのですが、その最後にちょっとしたコラムを書くためのブレストとしてTwitterで質問をしました。
で、結局出来上がった原稿は以下のような感じです。
Twitterでコラムの内容を見たいと発言されている方がいらしたので、出版前ですが晒してしまいます。
コラム：ぁゃιぃ UNIX用語 ( ☆ 「 あやしい 」の部分は、xa xya イオタ xi です。 )
プロミスキャスモードを 「無差別モード」と訳す場合が多いのですが、この「Promiscuos」という単語は性的な意味を含む英単語なのでご注意下さい。
たとえば、 「 promiscuous party 」 を日本語訳すると 「 乱交パーティ」になります。
UNIX 系の技術用語には非技術者から見ると変なものも色々あります。
プロセスを終了させるコマンドやシステムコールは殺すという意味を持つ「kill」です。
また、同じ名前のプロセス全てを終了させるコマンドで「killall」というのもあります。
さらに、プロセスには親子があり、wait()によって親が看取ってないプロセスはゾンビになります。
これらを組み合わせると、「親が発狂してしまったので子供がゾンビになってしまった」という会話もあり得ます。
さらに、プログラムを異常終了させるための標準Cライブラリ関数にabort()がありますが、このabortという英単語には「中絶」という意味があり、日常会話ではあまり推奨されないかも知れません。
物理メモリ上のデータを一時的に仮想的にメモリとして扱われる別の記憶媒体へと移す行為をswap(スワップ)もしくはスワッピング(swapping)というのもあります。
バックグラウンドで動作するプログラムであるデーモン(daemon)も悪魔という意味が広義では含まれます。
daemonはdemonとは別で、実際にはより広い精霊を含めた存在ですが、両方を同じように扱う人がいますし、テキサスでBSDデーモンシャツを着ていたら悪魔崇拝者と間違われたという笑えないネタもありました。 ( daemonに関し て はChapter 10 参照 。Chapter 10には 「 監獄」という意味を持つjailも登場します)
技術用語も色々ですね。
なお、これはまだ提出前の原稿段階なので最終的に書籍に含まれるかどうかは定かではありませんし、てにをは修正など、文章の校正が多少変更される可能性もあります。
あらかじめご了承下さい。

Mr Josipovic has pledged to help the state 's efforts to tackle corruption
The opposition Social Democrat , Ivo Josipovic , has won Croatia 's presidential election by a wide margin .
Mr Josipovic won 60.3 % of the vote in the second round run-off , beating the mayor of Zagreb , Milan Bandic .
Correspondents say the result was expected , but the margin of victory even larger than polls had predicted .
Mr Josipovic has pledged to lead an " uncompromising fight against corruption " and to help the government complete EU membership talks this year .
The 52 - year - old law professor and classical music composer succeeds Stipe Mesic , who will step down in February after 10 years as president .
' More just Croatia ' Addressing his supporters in Zagreb on Sunday evening after the official results were announced , Mr Josipovic said his victory was for " all honest people regardless of their voting preferences " .
I deeply believe that all of us want to live in a country in which work is rewarded and crime punished , in a country of social security and justice
Ivo Josipovic
" This is a victory which we can all celebrate because it is my deep belief that all of us want a better and more just Croatia , " he said .
" I deeply believe that all of us want to live in a country in which work is rewarded and crime punished , in a country of social security and justice . "
His opponent , Mr Bandic , was tarnished by corruption allegations during the campaign .
The BBC Balkans correspondent , Mark Lowen , says that as president , Mr Josipovic will have very little say in policy making , but will hope to take the country into the EU by 2012 , becoming the bloc 's 28th member .
Zagreb mayor Milan Bandic has been hit by corruption allegations
He has been criticised for lacking charisma , but is likely to co-operate both with Brussels and the Croatian government , led by Jadranka Kosor , which has been urged to tackle corruption if its EU hopes are to be fulfilled , our correspondent says .
Croatians have been largely unenthused by this election , reflected by the low turnout of 50.3 % , slightly up on the first round , he adds .
Frustrated with widespread corruption , they have also been hard hit by the global financial crisis , with Croatia 's economy likely to show barely any growth this year .
Unemployment remains at around 16 % .
Our correspondent says the new president will be hoping to restore popular faith in politics , as well as steer Croatia towards calmer and cleaner waters .

The Wall Street Journal reports that health - care stocks " fell after the Senate ’s approval of the health bill . "
Insurance giants " WellPoint , Humana and Aetna were among the health - care sector ’s decliners Thursday .
WellPoint dropped 1.3 % , while Humana fell 1 % and Aetna was also off 1 % . "
Keep in mind these stock fell when over all the stock market was up on Thursday .
Dow was up 53 points .
So why no sensationalized headlines ?
Why no feined outrage bloggers ?
Of course anyone with half a brain knows healthcare stocks are down 30 - 50 % from 3 or even 2 years ago and the recent run up more or less tracked the run up of the stock market in general .
But none of that matters when people try manufacture the news with the story they want to tell ( ie. heathcare stocks up = we were screwed )
Mold and mildew may be doomed .
Researchers are closer to understanding how these and other fungi grow .
" Fungi have a big impact on our dinner plate , " said Dr. Brian Shaw , Texas AgriLife Research plant pathologist .
" We tend to think that getting food on the table is easy .
But fungi are major disease - causing organisms for both plants and animals .
With more research , we can find new ways to compete with them . "
Commonly known fungi are molds , mildews , mushrooms and yeast .
Anyone who thinks humans are not in an all - out war with pathogenic fungi need only know this :
Some 70 percent of the major disease - causing organisms are fungi , according to Shaw .
That fact alone has researchers like Shaw going to great lengths to discover how to combat the negative aspects of fungi .
Shaw , for one , is challenging existing scientific knowledge with new observations on how fungal cells grow .
At a recent meeting of the International Fungal Biology Conference in Ensenada , Mexico , Shaw demonstrated with unique movie footage his observation that fungi cells grow and are shaped using both outward and inward flow of growth materials .
" I 'm pushing a revolutionary concept , " Shaw acknowledged .

Basically , fungi make a structure called a spore that helps the organism disperse .
Each spore has a cellular marker that tells the spore to germinate , Shaw noted .
But researchers have puzzled over what makes the spore germinate and grow into the structures characteristic of fungi .
Often a fungus is a parasite , meaning that it latches onto a plant or animal to live .
Researchers want to find out how to make the fungus stop growing without harming the animal skin or plant cells on which the fungus grows .
A closer look shows that fungi are made of thread - like cells called hypha .
Magnified , the individual threads look like the outline of a blimp .
Growth of the fungi is confined to the apex or end of the hypha cell .
That 's different from the way animal or plant cells grow , Shaw said .
A common thought for 50 years has been that the hypha direct their growth to the apex of their cell through outward flow of growth material forming a longer and longer blimp - like shape .
This is called exocytosis .
But Shaw found that there is a region of the cell at the growing apex of the hypha that directs material inward .
That process is known as endocytosis .
He discovered this with the help of a student who took microscopic photos of the growing cell every 30 seconds for six hours .
That yielded a video that demonstrated growth .
A movie from this project can be seen at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119409055/suppinfo.
" We think the hypha is recycling material , " he said .
" It is growing outward toward a marker at the cell apex , but is also recycling that marker inward .
We call this the ' apical recycling model . ' "
Shaw 's work , supported by a National Science Foundation grant and the U.S. Department of Agriculture , has been done on the common lab fungus Aspergillus nidulans .
It is not a pathogen , but information from Shaw 's research translates to disease - causing fungi and will help researchers learn how to stop their harmful growth on plants and animals , he said .
Shaw said it is the balance between exocytosis and endocyotosis that results in growth of fungus and the shape of the cell , and researchers who understand how they grow can find better ways of stopping or curing fungal diseases .

What 's new in Linux 2.6.33
by Thorsten Leemhuis
A promising open source driver for NVIDIA graphics hardware , a replication solution to prevent server down times , " ATA Trim " support and a host of new and improved drivers are some of the most prominent improvements in Linux 2.6.33 .
Two and a half months after the release of Linux 2.6.32 , Linus Torvalds has released version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel .
Among the most important long - term advances is probably the open source KMS graphics driver for GeForce graphics hardware .
While the driver does n't yet offer any 3D support and has for now been classified as an immature staging driver , it already offers more features than the X.org open source driver most Linux distributions currently configure for NVIDIA graphics chips .
However , the graphics driver is only one of more than ten thousand major as well as minor changes in 2.6.33 .
For instance , the Linux kernel is now capable of " ATA Trim " , which improves the performance and lifespan of SSDs .
Also new is the DRBD ( Distributed Replicated Block Device ) replication solution , which is mainly used in high availability environments and can be roughly described as a " RAID1 over the LAN " .
Speaking of RAIDs : Write barriers now make software RAIDs managed via mdadm more crash resistant , but also more sluggish .
The developers made further extensive changes to the KVM virtualisation solution and the tracing infrastructure around ftrace .
In the usual Linux fashion , the new kernel version also comes with numerous new and improved drivers – among them several drivers for VMWare hypervisors and drivers for storage and Wi-Fi chips by various manufacturers .
The ramzswap framework previously known as compcache has been added to the staging area .
Ramzswap compresses the data on a virtual swap device and stores it in the working memory , which is more efficient .
The following Kernel Log offers an overview of these and many other new features of the freshly released Linux version .
Even Linux users who do n't usually have anything to do with their distribution 's kernel will sooner or later benefit from these improvements , as future Linux distributions will be based on Linux 2.6.33 or its successor , ensuring the widespread availability of the improvements integrated by the kernel developers in the past few weeks .

Picture the situation in Haiti : families living on top of sewage - contaminated rubbish dumps , with no reliable sources of food and water and virtually no access to health care .
This scenario depicts the situation in Haiti before the earthquake that catapulted this impoverished and conflict - ridden country into the international headlines .
Now the latest target of humanitarian relief , international organisations , national governments , and non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) are rightly mobilising , but also jostling for position , each claiming that they are doing the most for earthquake survivors .
Some agencies even claim that they are “ spearheading ” the relief effort .
In fact , as we only too clearly see , the situation in Haiti is chaotic , devastating , and anything but coordinated .
Much is being said elsewhere about the performance and progress of relief efforts in Haiti .
It is crucial that the immediate needs of the Haitian people are urgently met .
But it is scandalous that it took a seismic shift in tectonic plates for Haiti to earn its place in the international spotlight .
Political rhetoric is familiar : domestic and international point - scoring during times of crisis and disaster is a common game played by many governments and politicians .
But this dangerous and immoral play has many losers , especially since the rules include judging the needs of desperate people according to subjective perceptions of worth .
For example , just think back 5 years to the dismal international response to the catastrophic earthquake in Pakistan .
Additionally , over the past 2 weeks alone , flooding has displaced 30 000 people in Kenya and 4000 people in Albania , and in Yemen , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Somalia hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by further fighting .
All international agencies , including the World Food Programme , have recently withdrawn from Somalia — one of the most violent countries in the world with a population size similar to Haiti .
It is unimaginable that international agencies and national governments might one day compete for attention in leading a Somali humanitarian relief effort .
The reasons for their current inaction are most un-humanitarian .
We have repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that when viewed through the distorted lens of politics , economics , religion , and history , some lives are judged more important than others — a situation not helped by the influence of news media , including ourselves .
This regrettable situation has resulted in an implicit hierarchy of crisis situations further influenced by artificial criteria , such as whether disasters are natural or man-made .
As this week 's special issue on violent conflict and health shows , * the health needs of people affected by conflict are repeatedly neglected .
Politicians and the media make easy targets for criticism .
But there is another group involved in disaster relief , which has largely escaped public scrutiny — the aid sector , now undoubtedly an industry in its own right .
Aid agencies and humanitarian organisations do exceptional work in difficult circumstances .
But some large charities could make their good work even better .
The Lancet has been observing aid agencies and NGOs for several years and has also spoken with staff members working for major charities .
Several themes have emerged from these conversations .
Large aid agencies and humanitarian organisations are often highly competitive with each other .
Polluted by the internal power politics and the unsavoury characteristics seen in many big corporations , large aid agencies can be obsessed with raising money through their own appeal efforts .
Media coverage as an end in itself is too often an aim of their activities .
Marketing and branding have too high a profile .
Perhaps worst of all , relief efforts in the field are sometimes competitive with little collaboration between agencies , including smaller , grass - roots charities that may have have better networks in affected counties and so are well placed to immediately implement emergency relief .
Given the ongoing crisis in Haiti , it may seem unpalatable to scrutinise and criticise the motives and activities of humanitarian organisations .
But just like any other industry , the aid industry must be examined , not just financially as is current practice , but also in how it operates from headquarter level to field level .
It seems increasingly obvious that many aid agencies sometimes act according to their own best interests rather than in the interests of individuals whom they claim to help .
Although many aid agencies do important work , humanitarianism is no longer the ethos for many organisations within the aid industry .
For the people of Haiti and those living in parallel situations of destruction , humanitarianism remains the most crucial motivation and means for intervention .
* This special issue of The Lancet is published to coincide with the international conference Violent conflict and health in a globalized world as part of a collaborative effort with The Journal of the Danish Medical Association and Social Science and Medicine , both of which have published their own theme issues on conflict
Cast member Hugh Jackman poses at an industry screening of " X - Men Origins : Wolverine " at the Grauman 's Chinese theatre in Hollywood , California April 28 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Mario Anzuoni
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - FBI agents on Wednesday arrested a New York man on charges that he uploaded a copy of the movie “ X - Men Origins : Wolverine ” to the Internet before its May theatrical release , a spokeswoman said .
FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the probe continues into how Gilberto Sanchez , 47 , of New York City obtained the copy he posted to Megaupload.com in the spring .
When the leaked movie made it to the Web , officials from Twentieth Century Fox , the unit of News Corp that was behind the film , expressed their dismay out of a concern that it would undermine the box office appeal of “ Wolverine . ”
Sanchez , who was arrested at his home , was charged with unlawfully uploading a copyright work to the Internet , which carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine , the FBI said .
He allegedly used Internet handles such as “ SkillfulGil . ”
“ X- Men Origins : Wolverine , ” which starred Hugh Jackman and was the latest in a franchise of films based on the “ X - Men ” comic books , made $ 373 million at worldwide box offices .

Introduction
At their Graphics Technology Conference ( GTC ) last September 30th , NVIDIA announced their next - generation graphics architecture , codenamed Fermi .
We reported on it for you here , here and here in a three - part series .
At the GTC , graphics performance was not the focus of Tesla Fermi .
Rather the conference was emphasizing NVIDIA ’s new architecture as a revolutionary General Purpose Processor that takes much more advantage of their new Fermi GPU ’s abilities of superfast parallel processing over their current architecture .
NVIDIA ’s goal is to dominate the professional market with their Tesla GPUs .
Now that Fermi GF100 GPUs for NVIDIA ’s new video cards are finally in mass production , we will be looking at how NVIDIA intends to dominate gaming .
To summarize the new architecture , Fermi boasts a brand new shader core whose compute clusters comprise a single shader multiprocessor ( SM ) .
Each stream processor has a fully - pipelined integer arithmetic logic unit ( ALU ) and floating point unit ( FPU ) .
Each SM can dual - issue two independent instructions per clock to two different warps .
Each instruction is run by a 16 - way SIMD block that handles single - precision Floating Multiply - Add Instruction ( FMAs ) .
The Fermi memory hierarchy is also new , sporting a new unified L2 cache that serves all of the SMs without partitions .
In addition , a new unified memory space allows each SM to not only communicate with its own local registers and shared memory , but now with L2 cache and beyond .
The GF100 features 768KB unified level - two cache as well as a rather complex cache hierarchy .
In addition , many other GPU - compute areas of performance are improved over NVIDIA ’s current Tesla architecture GPUs , GT200 .
The GF100 hardware can sustain peak Single Precision ( SP ) and Double Precision ( DP ) FMA instruction throughput .
Atomic instruction throughput is maximized over the current generation and Fermi is backed by ECC which is absolutely necessary for GPU computing .
This all comes together to support a new type of multi- threading technology which improves the efficiency of the 512 cores working together .
The entire Fermi family is compatible with DirectX 11 , OpenGL 3.x and OpenCL 1.x application programming interfaces ( APIs ) .
The new chips are finally in mass production using 40nm process technology at TSMC .
Let ’s go ahead and see what is new and improved with GF100 .

Trustworthy and reliable pet sitter available in the area to watch your pets .
Your pet will be in good hands and treated with care while you are away .
Rates vary - email to discuss .
From Me to **********@**********.org
Hey ,
I am away on vacation with my girlfriend for two weeks and completely forgot about her pet fish .
Would you be able to go to my house and feed him every day ?
Normally I would n't let a stranger go into my house , but I am desperate and you seem trustworthy .
What is your rate ?
I can pay you online via PayPal , or just give you cash when I get back .
Mike
From Jennifer ********* to Me :
Hi Mike ,
Of course I can take care of your fish but I have a few questions first :
- Where do you live ?
Is there a spare key / garage code / whhatever so I can get in ?
- What kind of fish is it and how big is the tank ?
( If it is a small fish bowl then I can care for the fish at my house )
- Any special instructions for feeding the fish ?
My rate for small pets such as fish is $ 10 per day .
Feel free to call me if you wish to discuss this over the phone .
My number is 610-***-****.
Jenny
From Me to Jennifer *********:
Jenny ,
I live at 211 *******
St ( near the Acme shopping center ) .
The fish is a guppy but it lives in a 55 gallon tank , so you probably can't move it .
It just needs one pinch of fish food in the morning and at night ( in the jar above the tank ) .
I do n't have a spare key or garage code , so you are going to have to break a window to get in .
I have a garden in the backyard where you can find a rock .
I would prefer if you did n't break any of the front windows because they are new .
I 'd suggest breaking the kitchen window in the back of the house .
Now when the window breaks , the alarm is probably going to go off .
I think the alarm code is 1988 , but I 'm not entirely sure .
It is protocol for the alarm company to send the police when a window is broken , so just tell the police that I hired you to take care of my fish .
When can you be over there ?
I have n't fed the fish in over a day so I am sure he is really hungry .
Mike
From Jennifer ********* to Me :
What ?
That is crazy - I 'm not gonna smash a window !
From Me to Jennifer *********:
Jenny ,
Why do n't you feel comfortable breaking a window ?
Do n't worry , I was going to get that window replaced with a wall anyway so my girlfriend can't look outside while she is doing the dishes .
If you are afraid that you are n't strong enough to break the window , I have a sledgehammer in my shed .
The shed is in the backyard and is unlocked .
It is on the wall with the shotguns .
You can easily break any window with that thing .
I almost forgot , if the police come , I need you to hide some weed and a bong that I left on the kitchen counter .
Just put the weed in your pocket so they do n't notice it when they are talking to you about the alarm , and maybe stuff some flowers in the bong so they think it is a vase .
Mike
From Jennifer ********* to Me :
I do n't feel right smashing your window bc how would I explain that to the police ?
And now you want me to hide your drugs ?
Do you want me to go to jail ?
Think about what you want me to do and then ask yourself if you would do it in my situation ..
I do n't think you would !
From Me to Jennifer *********:
Jenny ,
Think about how Gary ( the guppy ) feels right now .
He is starving , and will most likely die if someone does n't feed him soon .
How selfish of you to put your own interests before the life of another .
Please , just do it for Gary .
If he dies , my girlfriend is going to be pissed at me .
The last time I accidentally killed one of her pets , she would n't have sex with me for a month .
Do you know how expensive it is to pay an escort service for sex ?
Please do n't make me go through that again .
If you are afraid of the police , I 'll understand .
I have a criminal record too , so I get why you do n't want to deal with them .
How about you smash the window , run in , feed the fish , and run out before they get there ?
It will probably take them at least five minutes to respond to the alarm .
Mike
From Jennifer ********* to Me :
No !
You are an idiot !
I do n't have a criminal record you damn moron and I plan on keeping it that way .
Do n't try to guilt me about your fish because its your own stupid fault for forgetting about him !
Just explain to your gf that you are a jackass and forgot to take care of the fish !
From Me to Jennifer *********:
Jenny ,
When we get back home and I find the dead fish , I 'll have no choice but to explain to my girlfriend that I hired you to take care of the fish and you let him die .
I will give her your phone number and let you two sort things out .
Mike
From Jennifer ********* to Me :
Do n't you fucking dare you stupid mother fucker !

OTTAWA–Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused Christian aid group KAIROS of being anti-Semitic and disclosed that 's why the group suddenly lost its federal funding .
In a speech in Jerusalem about what he said was Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's government 's leading position combatting the enemies of Israel , Kenney lumped KAIROS – a Toronto - based ecumenical group that works for social justice abroad – in with what he described as other anti-Semitic organizations .
He said this is why Ottawa recently ended 35 years of funding for KAIROS , which encompasses Anglican , Catholic and other mainstream Canadian Christian churches .
" We have de- funded organizations , most recently , like KAIROS who are taking a leadership role in the boycott , divestment and sanctions campaign " against Israel , he told the Global Forum for combatting anti-Semitism .
A spokesperson for KAIROS , which has tried to get answers from the Harper government on the group 's funding , expressed shock .
Executive director Mary Corkery said Kenney 's statement was based on incorrect information about her group 's positions and raises serious questions about the politicization of the aid process by the Conservative government .
" If any group that criticizes an action by the government of Israel is called anti-Semitic by the government of Canada , that 's very serious . "
" You cannot label someone anti-Semitic because they criticize a government , " she said .
" That 's outrageous . "
The public needs to have a national debate about this approach to handling aid funding , Corkery said .
KAIROS was stunned by Kenney 's remarks because International Cooperation Minister Bev Oda told the public and Parliament the group lost its funding because of shifting priorities at the Canadian International Development Agency .
Corkery denied that KAIROS favours a boycott of Israel or advocated divesting funds from Israeli corporations .
" We have taken positions that critique actions of the Israeli government , as have people in many organizations , " Corkery said .
" We have raised issues that we think cause suffering among people .
But we have never spoken out against the state of Israel or tried to harm Israel . "
Alykhan Velshi , Kenney 's director of communications , said the minister 's words " speak for themselves . "
The federal Conservatives have taken steps to " disentangle " the government from groups that are anti-Semitic or anti-Israel , he said .
Until late November , when KAIROS learned it was cut off by Ottawa , the group had hoped to receive $ 7 million in funding over several years .

The $ 7.1 million for which the group had applied – $ 1,775,000 a year for four years – works out to about 0.04 per cent of the development agency 's annual official development assistance budget , which was $ 4.73 billion in 2008 , according to the Library of Parliament .
KAIROS would have used the money to help resettle people who have lost their homes and livelihoods because of rising sea levels , and at a legal clinic in the Congo that assists rape victims , among other projects , Corkery said .

Activists and farmers ' groups oppose India 's meetings on the commercial release of genetically modified aubergine .
From IPS , part of the Guardian Environment Network
As India 's central government begins a series of public meetings across the country this month on the commercial release of genetically modified ( GM ) brinjal – or aubergine - in this country , activists and farmers ' groups are mobilising to oppose such a plan .
The meetings are a response by Union Minister for Environment Jairam Ramesh to a storm of protests generated by the approval issued by the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee ( GEAC ) in October last year for the commercial cultivation of the genetically modified ' brinjal ' – also called ' aubergine ' – to resist pests with a gene from the soil bacteria ' Bacillus thuringiensis ' ( Bt brinjal ) .
The environment ministry 's first hearing , held Wednesday in the eastern city of Kolkata , ended up in a shouting match between Ramesh and the scientists , activists and local citizens present , who were opposed to the introduction of Bt brinjal .
While
Bt brinjal is the first GM food crop to be introduced in India , the South Asian country already grows GM cotton spliced with insect - resistant genes form the same
Bt bacterium , which has been blamed for serious crop failures and mass suicides by farmers in the cotton - growing belts of Vidarbha ( Maharashtra state ) and Andhra Pradesh .
Leading the resistance to the introduction of Bt brinjal is international food security campaigner Vandana Shiva , a biosafety expert who helped develop the Biosafety Protocol , an international treaty that became operative in September 2003 under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity .
Shiva told IPS that the GEAC approval was based on a " scientifically unsound report at the level of food and agricultural systems " presented to it by the Maharashtra Hybrid Seed Company ( MAHYCO ) , a subsidiary of the United States - based agribusiness giant Monsanto , and its partners at the University of Agricultural Sciences in Dharwad , Karnataka state and the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University at Coimbatore district in the state of Tamil Nadu .
The GEAC , which is under the environment ministry , is tasked to regulate research , testing and commercial release of GM crops , foods and organisms .
" The GEAC panel did not address the real alternatve to chemical agriculture , which is biodiverse organic farming , which controls pests at the systems level by enhancing pest - predator balance and by growing crops with pest and disease resilience , '' Shiva said .
" Bt crops are a continuation of a non-sustainable strategy for pest control , which , instead of controlling pests , creates new pests and super pests .
With
Bt cotton a proliferation of aphids , jassids , army bug and mealy bug has resulted in a 13 - fold increase in the use of pesticides in the Vidarbha region , '' Shiva explained .
Studies conducted by the non-government organisation Navdanya in Maharashtra – which , among others , promotes awareness of the hazards of genetic engineering – have shown that where 92 crores ( 20 million U.S. dollars ) worth of pesticides were used in 2004 , by 2007 farmers were spending 1,326 crores ( 71 million dollars ) annually on pesticides .
There were many inconsistencies in the MAHYCO / Monsanto 's presentations , said Shiva .
" When the company wants to avoid risk assessment and liability , the argument is that the GM plant is ' substantially equivalent to the non-engineered parent organism ' .
But when it comes to claiming novelty to gain intellectual property rights and patents , the argument turns to ' substantially inequivalent ' to the parent organism , '' Shiva argued .
Other known risks posed by Bt brinjal range from genetic pollution and contamination through cross-pollination in the fields to the possibility of allergies developing among consumers .
Indian farmers are typically smallholders and there is very little chance of them being able to protect their fields from cross-pollination .
" Liability systems need to be evolved first to make GM crop companies pay for economic damages caused , especially to organic farmers , " Shiva said .
The next scheduled public hearing on the controversial BT brinjal will be held in Bhubaneshwar , Orissa state on Jan. 16 and a third in Ahmedabad , Gujarat on Jan. 19 .
Similar meetings will be held in Hyderabad on Jan. 22 , in Bangalore on Jan. 23 , in Nagpur on Jan. 27 and in Chandigarh on Jan. 30 .
Opposition to Bt brinjal and other GM crops is already growing among farmers ' groups , the Union Health Ministry and even state governments such as Kerala's .
Already , mass petitions have begun to pour into Ramesh 's office .
One of them , from the village of Chengua in Orissa , declares : " We reject the approval of Bt brinjal .
It does not have the approval of our Jaiv Panchayat ( ' living democracy ' movements , a community - level institution ) , and it will not be allowed to enter our fields and kitchens .
We traditionally save our own seeds and consider the same as sacred . ''
Kerala , run by an opposition Marxist government , has already banned all GM crops in the state on the grounds that it could cause erosion of biodiversity and endanger the diversity of crops , for some of which India is the centre of origin .
Brinjal is among food crops considered native to India .
Cited in the Kerala ban are " irreversible and deleterious human health effects from GM crops / foods and adverse effects on other living organisms '' and " the possibility of systematic monopolisation of seed and other resources by a handful of large corporate bodies , to the extent that even future public research is jeopardized and farmers ' a priori rights are completely violated . ''
Opposition is also coming in from doctors ' groups under a network called ' Doctors for Food and Biosafety ' , which , in a statement released Monday , said that " the obsolete technology used in Bt brinjal incorporating antibiotic resistant markers is likely to have disastrous implications for developing countries like India which are struggling with communicable disease burden . ''
The doctors have suggested that the introduction of Bt brinjal could jeopardise national health programmes against drug - resistant tuberculosis .
An independent analysis of the Indian situation by Dr Judy Carman , director of the Institute of Health and Environmental Research in Australia , which will be submitted to the Indian Supreme Court , shows that " if GM brinjal comes into the Indian food supply , then every Indian will be eating it , resulting in 1.15 billion being Indians exposed to the GM brinjal .
Because of the number of people exposed , if GM brinjal is later found to cause illness , it could cause significant economic and social problems for India . ''
India is among the world 's largest vegetable growers , with an annual production of 87.53 million tonnes , representing a 14.4 percent share of the world 's output .
Declared Shiva : " 2010 is the year of biodiversity and we are celebrating it by protecting our indigenous vegetable biodiversity and protecting our organic vegetable growers . ''
A waterfall is definitely one of the many awe inspiring wonders that nature has given us .
They are , indeed , a sumptuous spectacle of the might of nature .
There are many astoundingly beautiful waterfalls in the world , but for the purposes of this list , it is restricted to natural falls – not manmade falls .
You may be surprised to find that the number one spot does not go to the falls you are expecting .
10 Huangguoshu falls China
China ’s most famous waterfall grabs the number 10 spot on this list .
A rare case of a heavyweight cascade completely surrounded by greenery .
With an impressive width of 81 m and height of 74 m it is claimed to be Asia ’s largest waterfall .
9 Angel Falls Venezuela
With a height of 979 m Angel Falls stands the tallest on this globe .
This record holder deserves this spot on the list , not because of its unbelievable height ( there are plenty of tall waterfalls out there ) but because of the grand manner in which it cascades down , a dynamic display of falling water .
8 Yosemite falls USA
Another brilliant showcase of incredible height , this 739 m waterfall looks a lot alike its Venezuelan counterpart , with the same handsome or even better display of falling water .
For that reason , it would be unjust to exclude this one .
7 Gullfoss Iceland
Iceland in ratio to its size contains the most ravishing waterfalls .
To illustrate , take Gullfoss .
Misleading as it drops down to a crevice , this 32 m high and 20 m wide waterfall is nothing short of mighty .
6 Shoshone falls USA
Dubbed the Niagara of the west , it is no surprise that this one bags the number 6 spot .
With an awesome width of 274 m and a height of 64 m which incidentally is higher than Niagara , this is one remarkable waterfall .
Its threatening looks make it a must include .
5 Jog falls India
Progress one step bigger and badder and you get Jog falls .
During the Indian season of monsoon it changes to its boldest and most formidable form .
It has a height and width of 273 m and 472 m respectively .
4 Dettifoss Iceland
Europe ’s most powerful waterfall measuring 100 m wide and 44 m tall .
When all the Icelandic glacial ice melts in summer Dettifoss simply blows your mind .
3 Victoria falls Zambia / Zimbabwe
Neither the widest nor tallest , but Victoria falls with its dimensions of 1700 m width and 104 m height is the largest sheet of falling water on earth .
Its local name Mosi - Oa - Tunya means smoke that thunders .
It happens to form the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe .
2 Niagara falls Canada/ USA
This is one that everyone will have been expecting to see on the list .
Niagara Falls is arguably the world ’s most celebrated waterfall .
Its height is 53 m and it forms the border between the USA and Canada .
The views are marvelous from both sides and would be ( for many ) an automatic choice for the number one spot .
But … not on this list .
1 Iguazu Falls Argentina / Brazil
The Iguazu Falls is the mother of all waterfalls .
Another border forming falls , this time between Argentina and Brazil , this natural beauty is a symbol of power and boasts a series of impressive waterfalls each one having the height of between 64 m to 82 m .

For decades , politicians in Washington D.C. insisted that “ globalism ” and “ free trade ” would be good for us .
Well , it turns out that “ globalism ” and “ free trade ” were good for the wealthy because they could pay someone in a foreign nation 1 dollar an hour when they used to have to pay an American 20 dollars an hour to do the same job .
Globalism and free trade were also good for American consumers because they could go down to Wal - Mart and pay 20 cents less for plastic crap made in China than for similar stuff made in the United States .
But “ globalism ” and “ free trade ” have turned out to be an absolute disaster for hard working middle class Americans .
Tens of millions of really good jobs have been sent overseas and they are simply not going to come back .
This is causing many Americans to start asking this question : Has the American Dream been outsourced ?
Well , yes , it has .
Unemployment is shooting through the roof in the United States while U.S. corporations continue to send millions of jobs to places like China , India , Mexico and Brazil .
Now it has come out that even several states with some of the highest unemployment rates are outsourcing their food stamp services to call centers in India .
Michele Brown , a 52 - year - old underemployed woman living in Florida was absolutely livid when she found out that her questions about that state ’s food stamps program were being answered by a worker in India .
“ That really put me over the edge , ” ABC News recently quoted Brown as saying .
“ It ’s not right because we need the work here .
People are in a bad way here . ”
That truth is that Brown has every right to be upset .
Why are states that have massive unemployment problems having calls about their food stamp programs answered by someone in India ?
But it is not just happening in Florida .
ABC News is also reporting that this is also happening in West Virginia and in Tennessee among other places .
Anything to save a buck , eh ?
The truth is that “ globalism ” and “ free trade ” have allowed the rich to get richer but have caused the poor to get poorer .
After all , how can an American worker making 15 dollars an hour compete with someone making 1.50 an hour in another country ?
It is getting harder and harder for hard working Americans to make a living .
The reality is that the once mighty American middle class is slowly being ground into the dirt .
The politicians insist that we have now entered a “ jobless recovery ” ( whatever that is ) , but most Americans are not nearly so optimistic .
According to one new survey , 88 % of Americans believe that the U.S. economy is still in a recession .
And it is .
Unfortunately , things are only going to get worse .
Meanwhile , the economic turmoil that we have experienced already is causing tremendous social chaos in many areas of the United States .
Homelessness in rural and suburban America is severely straining shelters this winter as the economy continues to decline and as the official unemployment rate hovers near double digits .
So is there any hope that all of this will turn around any time soon ?
No .
In fact , some of our major cities are seeing businesses close at an alarming pace .
In the area around Sacramento , California one out of every seven businesses has already closed and a whole bunch more are getting ready to close their doors .
This is happening in America ?
Yes , this is happening in America .
It would help if the financial powers would start opening their wallets and start putting Americans back to work , but that simply is not taking place .
In fact , the latest numbers indicate that the majority of large corporations in the U.S. are hoarding cash and are hiring very few new workers .
The Federal Reserve continues to tout a “ jobless recovery ” and is predicting that unemployment will stay high for at least the next two years .
But the American people do n’t have two years to wait .
Families are hurting and people are losing their homes .
Unfortunately , the American people are not going to get a “ bailout ” like Wall Street did .
That Wall Street bailout was supposed to “ trickle down ” to the rest of us , but we all know how that goes .
The truth is that the financial powers in the U.S. and the political fatcats in Washington do not really care about the American people .
The fact that the American Dream is rapidly being outsourced means very little to them .
Mostly what they care about is making even more money and holding on to their positions .
So who is going to look out for the interests of the American people ?
That is a very good question .
We have come to a time when you are going to have to look out for your own interests .
Incredibly hard times are coming , so now is the time to make sure that you and your family are prepared for what is ahead .
Burnout Epic Fail
Featured 02/10/2010
I give this a 10 out of 10 on the fail scale .
Getting your business education from school is important , but you also likely have a few idols in the business world to whom you look for guidance when it comes to making it big in the industry .
Learning from those who have achieved their own success is an excellent way to enhance your knowledge of business as well as find motivation for your own success .
Read on to learn about 25 biographies you should read that share insight to leaders in business throughout history into modern day .
Intel has posted a detailed , 25 - page rebuttal to the antitrust complaint that the FTC filed against the chipmaker this past November .
It can be paraphrased as : " We deny almost all of the charges , except for the charges that are bogus because the FTC does n't even understand the basics of the processor business . "
But much more interesting than the Intel rebuttal ( which , like the FTC complaint , is eminently worth reading for educational value ) is what some of the material in the document appears to reveal about the depth of AMD 's mismanagement over the past decade .
Specifically , the filing quotes some 2004 comments from former AMD marketing chief Henri Richard , who had some surprisingly disparaging things to say about AMD 's processors in an internal memo :
" [ I ] f you look at it , with an objective set of eyes , you would never buy AMD .
I certainly would never buy AMD for a personal system if was n't working here , " Mr. Richard allegedly declared to his fellow AMDers .
He apparently went on to characterize AMD as " pathetic " for " selling processors rather than platforms and exposing a partial story , particularly in the commercial segment , that is clearly inferior to Intel 's , if we want to be honest with ourselves . "
And then comes the kicker : AMD 's products have a reputation as a " cheap , less reliable , lower quality consumer type product . "
Given that in 2004 , AMD's Athlon was soundly beating the pants off of an aging Pentium 4 that had run smack into the power wall and had yet to be displaced by the Core architecture , Richard 's comments seem astoundingly disconnected from anything approaching reality .
When winning looks like losing
In 2004 , AMD had secured a seemingly permanent spot as the processor of choice across the spectrum of builds in the Ars system guide , a spot that it only recently relinquished with the arrival of Intel 's Nehalem architecture .
Anand Lal Shimpi captured the PC scene 's consensus on the Intel vs. AMD horserace in the opening paragraph of his review of the Athlon 64 4000 + , published on October 19 , 2004 :
It 's been a good year for AMD ; they 've been making money ( not as much as Intel , but at least they 're in the black ) and ask the majority of PC enthusiasts and they 're recommending AMD chips .
There 's obviously good reason ; the Athlon 64 , while not priced as aggressively as AMD 's chips in the past , ends up offering better performance than the Pentium 4 , for less money .
What more could you want ?
Not only was AMD ahead in the enthusiast market , but its enterprise platform held a solid price / performance and performance / watt lead as well .
In fact , over the course of 2004 and 2005 , AMD 's enterprise story grew so compelling that Dell 's glaring failure to offer AMD servers during this timeframe went from being a mystery to something of a standing joke about Intel 's vise grip on the top computer makers .
Indeed , AMD did n't definitively lose the enterprise server race until the launch of the Nehalem Xeons in the middle of last year , when Intel 's lineup finally overtook AMD 's server offerings in all the platform - level performance and power metrics that matter .
( AMD lost the lead in the desktop and enthusiast market well before then . )
It 's possible that there is some mitigating context in which the comments from Richard quoted in the Intel filing are n't as completely backwards as they seem on their face , but I can't imagine what such a context would be .
One possibility that might make sense is if the communication that Intel cites was from 2004 , but the remarks were originally uttered two or three years earlier .
The only other way that these comments seem at all rational to me is if Richard knew better , but he wanted to shift the blame for AMD 's difficulty in raising its profile away from his marketing department and onto the engineers .
Whatever the ultimate source or context for these remarks , if they really do reflect sentiments that Richard openly disseminated within AMD in 2004 , then they 're also fairly damning for an AMD upper management that did n't know enough to send him packing .
The engineering talent at AMD can fairly be said to have schooled Intel on its home turf during this period , and they definitely deserved better than this kind of talk from management .
So , in a roundabout way , Intel 's use of Richard 's communications does indeed help it make the case that AMD 's troubles were ( at least partly ) due to its own incompetence .
But it was n't technical incompetence , as Intel and ( apparently ) Richard would have it , but managerial and marketing incompetence .
In the period in question and sometime thereafter , AMD held the performance lead and had superior products from a price / performance perspective in many of the main desktop and server segments that mattered ; those of us watching always wondered why the company had such a hard time selling them .
Maybe now we know why .
Richard is now the marketing chief at Freescale , the semiconductor company that Motorola spun off in 2004 .
HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Michael Widenius , the creator of the MySQL database , said he is turning his vocal campaign against Oracle ’s planned takeover of Sun Microsystems to China and Russia because the European Commission appears set to clear the deal .
The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service last week continued its review of the $ 7 billion deal , asking for input from interested parties , and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce has yet to approve the deal .
“ They are powerful , self - confident and open - source - friendly countries and they have every right and opportunity to do a better job on this than the EU , ” Widenius said in a statement .
Chinese regulators have been flexing their anti-monopoly muscle in deals by global companies , blocking Coca - Cola Co ’s proposed purchase of China Huiyuan Juice last March and placing conditions on approval of InBev ’s acquisition of Anheuser - Busch , and Panasonic ’s buy of Sanyo Electric .
Widenius , one of the most respected developers of open - source software , left Sun last year to set up his own database company , Monty Program Ab .
Sun bought MySQL for $ 1 billion in 2008 .
EUROPE TO CLEAR THE DEAL
The European Commission initially objected to Oracle ’s acquisition of Sun , saying it was concerned Oracle ’s takeover of the MySQL database could hurt competition in that market .
But the Commission signaled in mid-December that it would likely clear the deal by its January 27 deadline after some of Oracle ’s largest customers said they believed the takeover would not hurt competition .
MySQL has been a rare major newcomer to the global database market -- dominated by technology heavyweights Oracle , IBM Corp and Microsoft Corp -- pushing down prices of databases and their maintenance .
Widenius , whose HelpMySQL campaign has collected 30,000 signature against the deal , said the European Commission “ may clear the acquisition any moment ” as the regulator focused on Sun ’s problems from a delayed takeover to justify the approval .
Oracle has said Sun is losing $ 100 million a month waiting for the sale to close .
The acquisition would transform Oracle from a maker of software into a technology company that sells computers and storage equipment preloaded with its programs .
Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison is betting the combination will give his company an edge over rivals such as IBM , Hewlett - Packard Co , Microsoft and EMC Corp .
Leave it to Copenhagen .
While other bike geeks fight over guerilla - painted bike lanes , or shine them on the street with laser gadgets , or dream of floating them in mid-air , the City of Copenhagen and the bike advocacy group ibikecph installs a simple , low - tech fix that makes riding in the famously bike - friendly city even easier .
The idea is a pair of railings , one low , one high , for cyclists stopped at intersections to balance on .
You grab one and rest your foot on the other , so you can push off faster when the light turns green instead of rolling slowly through traffic fumbling with your pedals .
The text reads : “ Hi , cyclist !
Rest your foot here … and thank you for cycling in the city . ”
Ride around any city enough and you ’ll take to balancing on signposts ( in Copenhagen they ’re rumored to be rubbed smooth by so many cyclists ’ hands ) .
These new railings play right into that behavior , but make it easier and safer–a great example of a city adjusting its infrastructure to what cyclists naturally do .

London , England ( CNN ) -- Earthquake - devastated Haitians need donations of cash -- not clothes , food , medicine , or other relief supplies , as well intended as they might be , aid groups said Thursday .
Such " in-kind " donations can at best take up valuable space in cargo shipments and waste aid workers ' time in sorting through the items , charities said .
At worst , the food or medicine could be unusable or even dangerous .
" Sending donated goods oversees is an appealing idea because it makes you feel like you 're really helping while at the same time recycling things that are no longer of any use to you , " writes former aid worker Saundra Schimmelpfennig in her blog about the impact of aid .
" Unfortunately inappropriate donations can do more harm than good and it often costs more to ship used goods than to buy new goods locally . "
Full coverage | Twitter updates
Schimmelpfennig has worked for the Red Cross and describes herself as a leading expert in the 2004 post - tsunami recovery efforts in Thailand , where she says she saw the impact of aid from the perspectives of donors , villagers and aid workers .
Her blog , " Good Intentions are Not Enough , " explains why cash donations are often much better than sending goods to a disaster - stricken area .
In a list of the " Dos and Don'ts of Disaster Donations , " Schimmelpfennig explains that " after the tsunami tons of used clothing were donated , much of it inappropriate to the climate and culture . "
They included winter hats , coats and gloves .
" Donated goods can also clog ports , preventing more immediate relief items from getting through , " she writes .
" Ports can only hold and process so many goods and often the port authorities have difficulty sorting through everything arriving to get it processed and out the doors . "
Many of the items people want to donate -- such as blankets , shoes , food and even medicine -- can be bought locally or regionally , said Florian Westphal of the International Committee of the Red Cross .
Doing that cuts down on the cost of transporting the items to the disaster zone , and helps put money into the local economy , he said .
Such is the case in Haiti , said Matt Wingate , a senior emergencies adviser for Save the Children in London .
There are parts of the island that were relatively unaffected by the earthquake , and there was virtually no damage in neighboring Dominican Republic .
" Materials that are available locally , either in Haiti or on the island within the Dominican Republic , are better purchased locally because of the very obvious transport cost , which can often dwarf the cost of the materials many times over , " Wingate told CNN .

Schimmelpfennig described how , after the Asian tsunami , a group of students shipped donated school supplies to Thailand .
It cost more to clear customs and ship the items to the affected area than it would have cost to buy them at the local marketplace , she said .
Donations of goods can sometimes waste valuable time on the ground .
After Hurricane Mitch hit Central America in 1998 , 15 pallets of " random medicine " was sent to the region , but " critical time was wasted sorting through the medicine and throwing three - quarters of it away , " Schimmelpfennig said .
Baby formula -- another popular donated item -- can be unnecessary if a community only breastfeeds their children .
It could also be dangerous if the formula is mixed with contaminated water .
By the same token , medicine can be unnecessary and even harmful .
" In practically every country there will be Ministry of Health protocols , government regulations , about the use of drugs .
Those are going to be applied throughout the health system that you 're trying to support , " Westphal said .
" It 's much easier based on that knowledge , based on the information you receive about what 's really needed , to actually buy the right kind of drugs and medical equipment rather than having it sent out . "
All drug donations should be based on an expressed need , according to World Health Organization guidelines .
If they do n't match the need , the risk is that the donations will have to be thrown away .
" What do you do with hundreds of pounds of unusable drugs ? " asks Schimmelpfennig .
" Do you throw them out and risk garbage sorters taking them out and selling them on the street to kids ?
Do you flush them down the sink which risks the drugs getting into the ground water ? "
The WHO also recommends that all drugs be labeled in a language easily understood by those in the destination country .
" While well intentioned , these donations could cause more harm than good if the wrong medicine or the wrong dosage is prescribed due to language barriers , " Schimmelpfennig says .
Aid groups say they do n't want to quash those good intentions , but they want donors to realize why cash is so much better than goods in - kind .
" What you really want to be doing as much as possible is actually address the real needs of people on the ground , " Westphal said .
" That 's got to be the priority , and obviously cash gives you much more flexibility in terms of making sure that relief items you provide really correspond to what people need and what people are used to . "
Charities and aid groups often know the situation in the disaster zone and can make the best assessments of what people need , Westphal said .
The U.S. - based Center for International Disaster Information , which promotes education about disaster response , says financial contributions entail no transportation cost and are the most flexible .
" Changes in conditions often cause changes in the victims ' urgent needs , " the group said .
" Relief organizations can't convert a used clothing donation into medicine , for instance . "
Save the Children often groups cash donations together , enabling the charity to save money by buying in bulk , Wingate said .
" Often , if not always , gifts are made with the best possible intention , and generosity should n't be underestimated at all , " he said .
" But people after an emergency do n't just need anything -- they need specific items .
They do n't just need any old rubbish .
These are people that need to be treated with dignity , and we need to make sure that they 're given what they need . "

Cato's Micheal Cannon has an important new study out today looking at the effects of ObamaCare across the income scale .
What he finds is that low - wage workers would be hit the hardest :
House and Senate Democrats have produced health care legislation whose mandates , subsidies , tax penalties , and health insurance regulations would penalize work and reward Americans who refuse to purchase health insurance .
As a result , the legislation could trap many Americans in low - wage jobs and cause even higher health - insurance premiums , government spending , and taxes than are envisioned in the legislation .
Those mandates and subsidies would impose effective marginal tax rates on low - wage workers that would average between 53 and 74 percent — and even reach as high as 82 percent — over broad ranges of earned income .
By comparison , the wealthiest Americans would face tax rates no higher than 47.9 percent .
Over smaller ranges of earned income , the legislation would impose effective marginal tax rates that exceed 100 percent .
Families of four would see effective marginal tax rates as high as 174 percent under the Senate bill and 159 percent under the House bill .
Under the Senate bill , adults starting at $ 14,560 who earn an additional $ 560 would see their total income fall by $ 200 due to higher taxes and reduced subsidies .
Under the House bill , families of four starting at $ 43,670 who earn an additional $ 1,100 would see their total income fall by $ 870 .
Cannon 's complete study can be found here .
Update : Reading through Cannon 's study , it 's worth remembering that , on the campaign trail , Obama accused Sen .
John McCain of offering " a plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy . "
He also said that McCain 's plan " wo n't help reduce costs ; it could actually drive costs up . "
But as Cannon notes , current reform legislation is also likely to make insurance premiums more expensive :
One of the things we enjoy most about a certain genre of comics is their sheer , ass - kicking absurdity ; blind ninja lawyers who dress up like the devil , Norse thunder gods who turn into frogs , and alcoholic robots who fight zombies in alternate universes .
And while many people -- outside of comics , at least -- may drift away from this sort of wild , outrageous storytelling as they grow older , little kids are all about it .
Which is probably why " Axe Cop , " the story of a cop who finds an axe and teams up with a flute - playing dinosaur soldier ( who later turns into a giant avocado with a unicorn horn ) is so great -- it 's actually written by a 5 - year - old named Malachai Nicolle , and then drawn by his more artistically sophisticated 29 - year - old brother , Ethan Nicolle .
While the main site has apparently gone down due to very high levels of " Axe Cop " Appreciation , there 's a temporary site hosting the five - part series , and well as the extremely comic - booky issue zero , which contains the secret origin of Axe Cop and a retconned memory - wipe worthy of " Identity Crisis .

BAGRAM AIR BASE , Afghanistan  Secretive branches of the military ’s Special Operations forces have increased counterterrorism missions against some of the most lethal groups in Afghanistan and , because of their success , plan an even bigger expansion next year , according to American commanders .
The commandos , from the Army ’s Delta Force and the Navy ’s classified Seals units , have had success weakening the network of Sirajuddin Haqqani , the strongest Taliban warrior in eastern Afghanistan , the officers said .
Mr. Haqqani ’s group has used its bases in neighboring Pakistan to carry out deadly strikes in and around Kabul , the Afghan capital .
Guided by intercepted cellphone communications , the American commandos have also killed some important Taliban operatives in Marja , the most fearsome Taliban stronghold in Helmand Province in the south , the officers said .
Marine commanders say they believe that there are some 1,000 fighters holed up in the town .
Although President Obama and his top aides have not publicly discussed these highly classified missions as part of the administration ’s revamped strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , the counterterrorism operations are expected to increase , along with the deployment of 30,000 more American forces in the next year .
The pandemic has taken a serious toll in Afghanistan .
So far , more than 38,000 people have tested positive for the virus , out of 100,000 tested samples .
Nearly 10 per cent of confirmed cases are among health ...

A 14 - year - old boy was charged Monday with raping a 12 - year - old girl in the stairwell of an El Cerrito middle school , and the principal and vice principal have been placed on administrative leave while police and school officials investigate the alleged crime .
El Cerrito police will focus their investigation on the alleged sexual assault , while West Contra Costa Unified School District officials look into how such a crime could have occurred on the Portola Middle School campus during the school day , officials said .
The boy allegedly raped the girl about 2:40 p.m. Thursday at the school at 1021 Navellier St. , police Cmdr. Michael Regan said .
The stairwell was empty because class was in session , he said .
The two students , who apparently know each other , had passes or reasons not to be in class , he said .
He declined to discuss other details of the alleged assault .
Another student who entered the stairwell and witnessed the incident reported it to a school resources officer , Regan said .
Police arrested the suspect at his home in Richmond about 8 p.m. Thursday .
He was booked into juvenile hall in Martinez and charged Monday with rape and false imprisonment .
Marin Trujillo , a spokesman for the school district , said principal Denise VanHook and assistant principal Matthew Burnham had been placed on paid administrative leave , in keeping with a district policy adopted after the recent gang rape outside Richmond High School 's homecoming dance .
" The purpose is to allow an investigation to take place , " Trujillo said .
Investigators will look into why the students were not in class , what plans existed to supervise them , and why those plans were not followed .
" We 're shocked that this could have happened during school hours , " Trujillo said .
VanHook , reached at home Monday night , said she could not comment , and that she had not been apprised of the investigation 's findings or progress .
" I'm in the dark as much as you are , " she said .
Scott Brown ’s upset victory last week in Massachusetts follows last fall ’s Republican wins by Chris Christie in New Jersey and Rob McDonnell in Virginia .
Something is happening , all across the country .
Even in New York — where Ed Mangano and Rob Astorino won the Nassau and Westchester county - executive races last November .
And even in New York City , where the GOP picked up City Council seats the same day .
Nationally and here at home , voters are disillusioned by one - party rule — and are holding Democrats accountable and electing Republicans .
We GOP state senators are seeing something new :
For the first time in memory , Republicans from all walks of life — upstate , in the suburbs and in the city , too — are reaching out to us , seeking to run .
Many have never run for office — but they ’re angry at Democrats who promised change and failed to deliver .
Whether the issue is health care and national security in Washington or taxes and spending in New York , Republicans , independents and even Democrats are rising up and saying enough is enough .
As we ’ve seen in New York , one - party rule breeds arrogance and contempt for taxpayers .
Democrats control every statewide office and both houses of the Legislature .
They took control of the state Senate just over a year ago , after campaigning on a message of change .
But the only change people have seen is for the worse .
The one - party rulers have stuck New Yorkers with new taxes and fees , bloated budgets and wasteful spending .
Businesses are leaving the state because of the hostile climate .
And people are voting with their feet , moving to Florida and other states that do n’t tax you from cradle to grave .
Just two years ago , New York ’s budget totaled $ 118 billion .
The budget proposed last week by Gov. Paterson spends more than $ 135 billion .
That ’s a $ 17 billion rise in spending over a two - year period — at a time when state revenues are collapsing .
The governor proposes another $ 1 billion in new taxes and fees on top of the more than $ 10 billion in higher taxes and fees that Democrats approved last year .
All of this amid a recession , when countless New Yorkers are having to make do with less .
To make matters worse , Democrats in the Senate and Assembly are already saying they ’ll add even more spending to the governor ’s budget , which will only lead to more taxes and greater misery .
Like we did last year , Republicans will reject any budget that hikes taxes and spends beyond our means .
We believe job creation should be the top priority , not an afterthought .
Will the Democrats reject our ideas , as they did last year ?
Last week in Albany was telling .
Democrats had a chance to prove they could work with Republicans and do something right — and again they blew it .
At issue was a bill to boost New York ’s chances to compete for as much as $ 700 million in federal Race to the Top funds for our schools — a measure that likely would have passed with votes from Republicans and Democrats .
But the bill was n’t to the liking of the leaders of the Democratic machine — so the party leaders refused to allow it to come to a vote , stopped us from acting on behalf of New York taxpayers .
Such partisan behavior has no place in government .
In Albany or Washington , Massachusetts or New Jersey , taxpayers want elected officials from all parties to work together and get things done .
They want us to listen to them and respond to their problems , not make things worse .
With every state office up for election this fall , the people will have a tremendous opportunity to take back their government .
The battleground will be the state Senate .
Voters across New York face a clear choice : Continue one - party Democratic rule , or restore bipartisan governance that ’s responsive to the taxpayer .
We ’ve seen the consequences of one - party rule in Albany : More taxes , more spending — and more people unemployed .
That just wo n’t cut it anymore .
Scott Brown ’s dramatic victory proved that angry voters can bring about historic change even in the bluest of states .
Change is definitely coming to New York , and this time it will be for the better .
Dean Skelos , the New York state Senate minority leader , represents Nassau County .
Ben Nelson on healthcare mandates : Congress gets the constitutional authority in the “ same place ” that gives states the right to mandate car insurance
Senator Ben Nelson– Democrat from Nebraska , and the man whose vote for healthcare reform was secured after his state received a nice little kickback — was asked : “ where in the Constitution do you think that Congress gets the authority to create an individual mandate ? ”
Just like everyone else who was asked this question , he struggled to come with an acceptable answer .
He responded , “ probably the same place that states have the authority to require , mandate if you will , compulsory auto insu–liability insurance . ”
This could be one of the most constitutionally ignorant answers yet , although it is hard to top Senator Burris , who made up the “ general health ” clause to defend the constitutionality of the issue at hand .
Senator Nelson apparently does not know the difference between state and federal laws , he should probably look it up because that “ place ” he vaguely mentions does not exist in the constitution .
Article 1 Section 8 of the constitution– where the infamous “ general welfare ” clause resides– lays out the specific enumerated powers of congress , they are as follows :
To borrow money on the credit of the United States ;
To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations , and among the several States , and with the Indian Tribes ;
To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization , and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States ;
To coin Money , regulate the Value thereof , and of foreign Coin , and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures ;
To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States ;
To establish Post Offices and Post Roads ;
To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries ;
To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court ;
To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas , and Offenses against the Law of Nations ;
To declare War , grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal , and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water ;
To raise and support Armies , but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years ;
To provide and maintain a Navy ;
To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces ;
To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union , suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions ;
To provide for organizing , arming , and disciplining the Militia , and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States , reserving to the States respectively , the Appointment of the Officers , and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress ;
To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten Miles square ) as may , by Cession of particular States , and the acceptance of Congress , become the Seat of the Government of the United States , and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be , for the Erection of Forts , Magazines , Arsenals , dock - Yards , and other needful Buildings ;
And
To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers , and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States , or in any Department or Officer thereof
I did n’t see anything in that list that said congress or the president could force the American people to buy any goods or services .
That means the constitutional authority does not exist and the 10th amendment states the following :
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people .
So you see Senator Nelson , if a power is not granted to the federal government than the power belongs to the states .
That is the case with the flawed argument that you and others have made about automobile insurance .
While states can mandate automobile insurance , the federal government cannot .
And while the individual states can mandate healthcare coverage– as does the people ’s Republic of Massachusetts – the federal government cannot .
This should be a simple concept for our elected officials to understand , but sadly they either do not understand , or they do not care , what their authority is and who gives it to them– WE THE PEOPLE !
We have reached a point in this country where not only do our elected officials not care about what the constitution says they can and cannot do , many of them do n’t even understand the document that they are supposed to uphold .
Senator Nelson is not alone in his ignorance , for he is not the first to confuse state laws with federal laws ; Mark Warner of Virginia claimed that mandating healthcare insurance was the same as states requiring people to have driver ’s licenses .
Others have also used the car insurance argument to make their case , including the president .
The people who are supposed to protect and defend the constitution are destroying and perverting it .
It is time to take our country back .

I Wish My Drawings Would Come To Life …
The samples of adenocarcinoma were widely supplied , the researchers say Dozens of cancer studies may be thrown into doubt by the discovery that researchers inadvertently used the wrong type of cancer cells .
The " cell lines " , according to the Journal of the National Cancer Institute , were supplied as samples of oesophageal cancer .
However , tests show they contained other types of tumour , including lung and bowel .
The Dutch researchers say this could put major trials of drugs in doubt .
Many experimental studies on cancer use laboratory - grown " cell - lines " , meaning that dozens of studies may rely on cells originally taken from a single patient .
As a national culture collection we , together with other national collections , exhort research scientists to always work with authenticated cell lines of known provenance
Health Protection Agency spokesman
New drugs can be tested on these cells to see if they have an effect before they are tested on real patients .
The problem of " false " - or contaminated - cell lines , is not a new one , and there have been calls for scientists to take more care verifying they have the right sort of cells before continuing with their experiments .
If not , they run the risk that their findings , positive or negative , may be misleading .
The latest example of the problem involved samples widely supplied as oesophageal adenocarcinoma cells , a particular type of cancer affecting the gullet which carries food from the mouth to the stomach .
In fact , they came from tumours of the lung , bowel and stomach , said researchers from the University Medical Centre in Rotterdam .
They wrote : " Experimental results based on these contaminated cell lines have led to ongoing clinical trials recruiting patients , to more than 100 scientific publications , and to at least three cancer research grants and 11 US patents - which emphasises the importance of our findings . "
Widespread use of these cell lines could threaten the development of new treatments , they said .
In particular , use of the drug sorafenib for some oesophageal cancer patients should be reconsidered , since the wrong cell line was used to assess its potential .
Specialist suppliers
However , writing in the same journal , Professor Robert Shoemaker of the National Cancer Institute in Maryland , said he suspected that a similar study using the right cell lines would support the use of sorafenib .
In the UK , one of the main funders of cancer studies , Cancer Research UK , has said that it uses DNA testing to check its cell lines .
The Health Protection Agency also operates an extensive cell culture collection and a spokesman said it urged scientists to , where necessary , pay for tests to check their cell lines .
He said : " The use of wrongly identified human cancer cell lines is a problem that was first recognised more than 20 years ago .
" We draw attention to this danger on our website , which includes an ever - expanding list of those cell lines known to be incorrectly identified , or cross - contaminated with a cell line of a different type .
" As a national culture collection we , together with other national collections , exhort research scientists to always work with authenticated cell lines of known provenance . "

Anyone who watched last night 's tilt against the Penguins got to see an example of the type of hit that the NHL says it is against .
In the third period , Penguins defenseman Sergei Gonchar hit Wild forward Cal Clutterbuck in the head , earning Gonchar a five minute major for interference .
What we did not have last night was video .
Today we do .
So , let 's look at the video and have it out .
Before we make the jump and start the debate , please try to keep this civil .
Obviously this is a Wild blog , and I trust I know what most of you are thinking .
Still , try not to go too far off the reservation .
First , here is the video :
At the 32 second mark , we get a pretty good look at it .
Another angle is included in a more lengthy highlight reel from the game .
Find it HERE .
I am doing my best to put on my objectivity hat here , because I have firends on both sides of the aisle on this one .
Looking at it , objectively , it looks like a dirty hit .
Clutterbuck does not have the puck , and is behind the play .
Fedotenko has the puck closer to the corner , and Clutterbuck moves in between Fedotenko and Gonchar , with Fedotenko making a play to move the puck back toward the corner .
Clutterbuck looks like he sees Fedotenko make the play , despite Fedotenko missing the bouncing puck , and Clutterbuck pulls up on the hit he is about to lay on Fedotenko .
A split second later , after Clutterbuck is turning up the boards , and before he can even turn his head , Gonchar 's forearm is squarely in Clutterbuck 's face .
Now , some last night , and still today are saying Gonchar launched himself into Clutterbuck .
I get into this debate every time there is a hit like this , and I still do n't see it .
Gonchar 's skates leave the ice , sure , but not until Clutterbuck is going down to the ice .
Inertia carries Gonchar down with Clutterbuck .
Gonchar does however , most definitely target Clutterbuck 's head .
There is no question there , is there ?
Gonchar most certainly hits Clutterbuck behind the play , and is targeting him while he is not looking at Gonchar , but instead looking at the puck carrier .
Can we agree on that ?
Doubtful , but it certainly looks that way to me .
Looking over a handful of Philadelphia Flyers blogs or Washington Caps blogs would garner the opinion that Gonchar is a dirty player .
I will save that judgment for others to make .
He has never been suspended , at least from what I can find ( please post any corrections to that in the comments ) .
Gonchar also looks to not be pleased with himself as he goes to the box .
Does that forgive the hit ?
No , but he shows remorse immediately .
Could be that he was sorry he put his team on a five minute penalty kill while down by one in the third period .
Or it could be that he truly felt sorry for making the hit .
Until we invent the machine that reads thoughts , we will never really know .
We have now reviewed the hit , and I have broken it down a bit , from my perspective .
Let me now tell you what I feel will happen .
Absolutely nothing .
Look at Down Goes Brown's NHL Suspension Flow Chart .
He has the superstar effect in play .
Is he Alexander Ovechkin or Sidney Crosby ?
No , he is n't .
But he is still a superstar .
Hockey fans across the country know who he is , and that makes him a star .
He has never been suspended before .
Case closed .
Gonchar got a five minute major penalty .
They did not assess him a game misconduct , nor a match penalty .
Could they have ?
It 's a judgment call , but I think the gamer would have been called for here .
Match penalty assumes intent to injure , which can be debated all day , but we do not truly know .
It certainly was retaliatory , targeted the head , and came away from the play .
If the league is serious ( I almost got that out with a straight face ) about removing head shots , they would hand Gonchar a suspension .
I would say two games to match the suspension of Ovechkin earlier in the year .
At least one game is warranted .
The odds of him being suspended are not good .
More likely he gets a stern talking to from Colin Campbell .
OK , here we go .
Hockey Wilderness readers , PensBurgh readers , and all other comers .
What say you ?
1. Dirty hit ?
2. Should Gonchar be suspended ?
3. Does Gonchar get suspended ?
( If so , how many games ? )
One other twist I forgot to include is the quote from Clutterbuck to Russo last night :
" He better hope he retires at the end of the year , I 'll tell you that , " Clutterbuck said , a cut on the bridge of his nose .
" Somebody 's going to hurt him before the end of the year .
Someone will .
It 's not going to be me , but someone will . "
Not sure I agree with the sentiment , but he was probably pretty heated at that point .
Probably should have saved his feelings for today , but anyone who has ever talked to the guy knows , he just is n't going to do that .

EL SEGUNDO , Calif . --
At age 25 and with 4 1/2 years of pro experience , Detroit Red Wings goaltender Jimmy Howard is not a typical rookie .
But despite having played his first game for the Red Wings more than four years ago and having four full seasons with the AHL ’s Grand Rapids Griffins under his belt , Howard is an NHL rookie .
And just past the halfway point of the season , Howard has emerged as a candidate for the Calder Trophy , which awarded to the league ’s top first - year player .
“ The most important part of the season is the second half , ’’ Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said .
“ If he plays as well the second half , he certainly has to be a guy people talk about for the Calder . ”
Howard is eighth in the NHL in goals - against average ( 2.19 ) and fourth in save percentage ( .924 ) .
Coming off a 51 - save performance in Thursday ’s 2 - 1 victory in Los Angeles , Howard will make his eighth consecutive start Saturday night in San Jose , when the Red Wings wrap up a four - game West Coast trip .
The top three Calder candidates might be goalies .
A pair of backups are having strong seasons .
Washington ’s Semyon Varlamov is 12 - 1 - 2 , with a 2.21 GAA and .924 save percentage .
Boston ’s Tuukka Rask is 10 - 4 - 2 , with a 1.92 GAA and .933 save percentage .
No rookie skater has overly impressive statistics .
The New York Islanders ’ John Tavares , who was last year ’s top overall draft pick , leads rookies with 16 goals and 28 points .
The last Red Wing to win the Calder was goalie Roger Crozier in 1966 .
Howard , however , is n’t concerned about individual honors .
His is focused on winning games and getting his team back into a playoff spot .
“ I ’ve gotten the chance and I ’m trying to make the most of the opportunity , giving the guys a chance to win , trying to outplay the other goalie , ” Howard said .
“ As quickly as things have happened , they can go away just as fast .
I try not to think about anything else except doing my job . ”
Howard had only one start in the first eight games and he did n’t do well , losing 5 - 3 to the St. Louis Blues in Sweden on Oct.
3 . He looked even worse in his third start , a 6 - 5 shootout loss in Edmonton on Oct. 29 .
But when Chris Osgood got sick with the flu in mid-November , Howard got a chance to run with the starting job .
His turning point was a 3 - 1 win against Vancouver on Nov. 12 , the first game Howard stole for Detroit , which was sluggish after playing in Columbus the night before .
“ I was talking to my buddy a couple of weeks before that and I was like , ‘ All you need is one good game and I ’ll be off the ground running , ’ “ Howard said .
“ A lot of confidence came beating a guy like ( Canucks goalie ) Roberto Luongo , who ’s considered by some to be the best in the league .
It was an awakening for me that I can play in this league and play on a consistent basis . ”
Said Holland : “ He went eyeball - to - eyeball with Roberto Luongo and since then his confidence got better and better .
He ’s consistently solid to good every game , rarely gives up a bad goal . ”
Howard has earned the confidence of teammates and coach Mike Babcock .
“ His work ethic is really good .
He does a lot of stuff after practice , taking a lot of shots , ” Kris Draper said .
“ He ’s getting rewarded right now with hard work and we have a ton of confidence in whoever is in net for us .
Right now , Howie ’s getting a great opportunity and making the most of it . ”
Said Babcock : “ You got to give ( goaltending coach ) Jimmy Bedard a ton of credit , and Chris Osgood , because they ’re doing a real good job in helping him and supporting him . ”
Babcock ’s focus is winning now , not worrying about getting Osgood , who has n’t played since Dec. 20 , prepared for the playoffs .
“ We ’re on the outside , so what do we got to do ?
We got to win , ” Babcock said .
“ So you got to put whoever ’s in the best situation to allow you to win . ”
After Ty Conklin excelled as Osgood ’s backup , going 25 - 11 - 2 , the Red Wings could have re-signed the veteran free agent in July and traded Howard while waiting for prospects Daniel Larsson and Thomas McCollum to develop in Grand Rapids .
But they stuck with their plan , letting Conklin go and standing behind the man labeled their goalie of the future when they drafted him with their first pick in 2003 ( second round , 64th overall ) .
Now , they are reaping the rewards .
“ Jimmy has been as big a story as we ’ve had the first half , ” Holland said .
You may have heard that Larry Kudlow , the former Reagan economic adviser , diehard supply - sider , and CNBC host , is considering running against Chuck Schumer for U.S. Senate from New York .
How can Kudlow hope to match the fund - raising prowess of the incumbent Schumer ?
Thanks to the Supreme Court ’s decision on corporate contributions in the Citizens United case , we got it covered , a top Kudlow supporter and pal tells TPMDC .
“ People who are worried about their taxes , particularly medium - and large - size businesses , would be more interested in helping Larry Kudlow than Chuck Schumer , ” John Lakian says .
( REAL SIMPLE.COM ) --
When it came to change , my father had it licked .
His motto was simply " Do n't let it happen to you . "
He proudly wore the same tie he'd had since college .
He moved house just three times -- ever .
But his town and his life were epicenters of low upheaval .
For most of us , change is an unavoidable fact , something I ( re ) discovered when , several years back , I lost my job in a shrinking industry .
Far from ruining my life , that seismic shift gave me the chance to do two things I had always hoped to do : live in India and learn a new language ( Hindi ) .
In the process , I discovered a lot about how to survive when head - rattling transformations are thrust upon you .
Here are some of the tricks I picked up along the way .
1 . Do n't just do something ; sit there .
If you 're facing a massive rescaling of your life , your first impulse will be to go into a whirring spin of activity , which is exactly what I did right after I was fired .
I later discovered there 's a lot of value to sitting quietly instead .
In the realm of language learning , there 's a stage called the silent period : Adults may try to avoid going through it , but if you take a kid and plop her down in Paris for a spell , she 'll naturally clam up for a few months .
When she opens her mouth , her French will have flowered .
Making sense of a major change is a lot like that .
You need to allow yourself a fallow period before you can blossom .

2. Mother yourself a little .
When familiar routines suddenly dissolve , it can seem as if all your supports are gone .
For a while after I lost my job , I had the sense that I was in free fall .
It 's crucial , while absorbing the shock of the new , to make yourself feel well taken care of .
Prepare nutritious meals for the week ahead .
If you can spare the cash , have someone come in and clean the house .
Yes , you need to take some time for yourself , but do n't let the pizza boxes pile up .

3. Ignore your inner reptile .
There 's a part of the human mind that is often referred to as the " lizard brain , " because it existed in even the earliest land animals .
The lizard brain is concerned with survival ; it likes the tried and true , so it 's likely to pipe up right now , flooding you with adrenaline warnings of " Danger ! " as you veer off course .
This was a handy function to have when deviating from the familiar path to the watering hole may have led to an encounter with a saber - toothed tiger .
But in the modern world it 's like a misfiring car alarm : pointless and annoying .
4. Silence your inner know - it - all , too .
When I interviewed the eminent linguist Alton Becker , I asked what makes someone good at languages .
It helps not to be too smart , he said , explaining , " Smart people do n't like having their minds changed , and to learn a language , you have to change your mind . "
If you 're so smart that you can't rethink your positions , all your IQ points wo n't do you much good when your life is turned upside down .
Becker 's advice applies across the board .
5 . Seek out new perspectives .
Zen practitioners cultivate the " do n't know " mind ; they work to assume they do n't know anything and in that way see the world fresh .
This is a great way to approach change -- as an opportunity to start anew , to consider all possibilities .
Ask naive , wide - eyed questions of anyone who is doing anything you might be interested in trying .
Listen seriously to arguments you might once have dismissed .
Real Simple.com : How to Make Good Decisions
6 . Try something new and slightly scary .
Why ?
Because now is the time to explore what it is that you really like .
Catch yourself off - guard and see what happens .
At a time when I was feeling most stuck , I spontaneously volunteered to get up onstage at an open-mic storytelling evening in New York City .
The experience was elating and terrifying and showed me that I wanted to lead a more creative life .
7 . Be skeptical of common wisdom .
It 's dangerous to live in the aggregate , especially when you 're trying to figure out your next move .
One year , everyone knows you need an M.B.A. to succeed at anything .
The next , they 're saying that there are no jobs out there anyway , so do n't even try .
In my case , everyone but I knew that you can't learn a language at age 43 .
But since no one alerted me to that fact , that 's what I set my sights on .
8. Learn to live with uncertainty .
When I began learning Hindi , my teacher encouraged me to get out and practice with native speakers in New York .
I wound up asking a waiter for love ( pyar ) when I 'd meant to request a cup ( pyala ) .
But in that way I inched into a new language .
That anxious feeling does not signal that you 're doing something wrong , only that you 're trying something new .
9 . Say " really ? " a lot .
When you start to turn this sudden shift in your life to your advantage , you might shake up a lot of people , especially the ones who are n't happy with how they 're living .
To them , your efforts to move forward may feel like a glaring searchlight that needs to be switched off and fast .
To their descriptions of the terrible fates that will surely befall you if you dive headlong into a new life , respond with " Really ? "
Alternatively , " Oh , yeah ? " works , too .
10 .
Shed your old skin .
Discard physical clutter , tired ideas , old routines .
Seeing things through another 's eyes can help .
I had that chance when the Hindi school I enrolled in asked me to list my daily requirements .
I could honestly have said , " For the past 62 days , I 've eaten pineapple sandwiches for breakfast : toast , butter , canned pineapple ( sliced , not crushed ) .
Bedtime : white - noise machine ( surf , not rain ) , four pillows ( two hard , two soft ) . "
Instead I wrote , " None . "
It 's only when you have cast off what has been weighing you down that you can finally move on .

Computer game Cross Days was originally announced for February 27 , 2009 .
It is January 2010 , and Cross Days is still not out .
The story follows Yuuki Ashikaga , a freshman at Sakakino Academy who navigates high school infatuations .
Back in 2008 , it was announced that the visual novel would contain 3D animation .
The February 27 release date was later pushed back to April 24 .
That release date was then pushed to June 26 .
To improve the game 's quality , the release date was then changed to November 20 ... and then December 18 .

Once again , the game was not up to par with what Cross Days developer Overflow was aiming to release .
The release date was listed as TBA .
A release date was then announced , January 29 of this year .
( You know where this is going ! )
That release date was moved to March 19 , 2010 .
GRAND TOTAL : SIX DELAYS .
While Cross Days has yet to reach anywhere near Duke Nukem Forever 's decade - plus , the title 's constant delays are quickly becoming a joke .
The developer appears to repeatedly postponing the game to release the best product possible .
Or could it be something else ?

Overflow announced in December 2008 that it was synchronizing SOM , a hands - free - you - know - what - machine with Cross Days .
According to Overflow , the machine moves in real time to corresponding on screen motions during " climax scenes . "
Perfectionism or masturbation — one of them could very well be the culprit for all these delays .

エロゲ『CrossDays』発売延期の歴史、２月２７日→４月２４日→６月２４日→今夏→１１月２０日→１２月１８日→未定→１月２９日→３月１９日（現在） [ はちま起 稿 ]
Today , December 10th , is the International Human Rights Day and for the first time , we have a guest writer on The Road .
Barbara Becker wrote this gripping article about Aminatou Haidar , a lifelong campaigner for the rights of the people in Western Sahara , occupied by Morocco since 34 years .
“ If you are neutral in situations of injustice , you have chosen the side of the oppressor . "
Barbara Becker is a principal of EqualShot .
The views expressed in this piece are solely her own and are , in no way , meant to reflect the opinions of her clients .
A month ago , I had the good fortune of spending a week at the side of this often called “ Sahrawi Gandhi , ” Aminatou Haidar .
Aminatou and I share many things : we ’re both 42 , we ’re both mothers of two young children , we laugh at the same stories , and we both love the shrimp dish at our hideaway DuPont Circle restaurant .
We are , as Aminatou says , like sisters .
And while we both call ourselves human rights activists , our day to day work is conditioned entirely by our life experiences .
A product of the U.S. , my brand of human rights activism is all but removed from the day to day horrors of abusive regimes .
I develop strategic campaigns for human rights organizations and advocates like Aminatou , making sure their issues are heard in the media and in the corridors of Capitol Hill .
Aminatou , on the other hand , is in the thick of it .
For over twenty years , she has led the nonviolent struggle to free the people of Western Sahara from Morocco ’s 34 - year occupation .
In 1988 , both parties agreed to settle the dispute through a UN - administered referendum that would allow the people of Western Sahara to choose between independence or integration with Morocco .
The vote still has not been held , and UN facilitated peace talks have stalled over disagreements , including who qualifies to participate in the potential referendum .
During this time , Aminatou has spent nearly five years in prison for her peaceful activism , much of it in solitary confinement undergoing repeated torture .
I have seen the pictures of Aminatou bloodied and scarred .
As I write this on my laptop in a coffee shop in New York , Aminatou is lying back against cushions on the floor of a waiting area in Lanzarote airport , in Spain 's Canary Islands , fading in and out of wakefulness .
I am writing because Aminatou ’s life is literally in peril , and this keyboard is , frustratingly , one of my only tools to bring attention to my colleague and friend .
The details of her circumstance are straightforward .
After Aminatou ’s visit to the U.S. to receive the 2009 Civil Courage Prize from the Train Foundation , she boarded a connecting flight in the Canary Islands to return home to her family in Laayoune , the main city in the Moroccan occupied zone of Western Sahara .
As she had many times before , she declared Western Sahara as her country of origin on the immigration entry form .
This time , though , Moroccan authorities seized her Moroccan passport ( Morocco administers all travel documents for Western Saharans ) , held her for interrogation , and — claiming she had renounced her Moroccan citizenship — summarily deported her to the Canary Islands .
Spain allowed her entry against her will and without travel documents , but insisted she could not travel back to Laayoune because she had no passport .
It is a direct violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , signed by Morocco in 1979 , for anyone to be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his or her own country .
According to a statement by the New York City Bar , this amounts to a breach of Morocco 's international law obligations .
Now Aminatou is , in effect , stateless .
She has refused an offer of a Spanish passport , insisting that she will not be a “ foreigner in her own country . ”
The Moroccan Government refuses to reinstate her passport until she publically apologizes for her “ act of treason . ”
Hunger strikes are last resorts , never to be taken casually – particularly if you have a perforated ulcer and the other residual maladies Aminatou carries with her as a result of the years of beatings .
According to Wikipedia , after three weeks of non -stop fasting , the body enters into " starvation mode , " at which point the body mines the muscles and vital organs for energy , and loss of bone marrow becomes life - threatening .
Aminatou is prepared to take this hunger strike “ to the death . ”
When I last managed to reach her by cell phone , she told me that her body was failing , but her will was as strong as ever .
Mostly , she was preoccupied with the well - being of her children , whom she speaks with by cell phone every day .
Pressure has mounted on Spain to resolve the situation , and Aminatou ’s plight has ignited the attention of the media there .
Filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar has lead protests in her name and the actor Guillermo “ Willie ” Toledo has set up a makeshift office in the airport to be near her .
By stalling in this crisis , Morocco ’s standing in the international community is called into question .
The situation clearly undermines the ongoing negotiations between Morocco and Western Sahara mediated by U.N. Special Envoy Christopher Ross .
And many policy watchers have begun to ask how the U.S. should relate to a solid ally whose human rights record is better than the norm in the region , but is now heading in the wrong direction .
This week Senator Patrick Leahy called the situation “ unacceptable ” and urged President Obama to defend those whose fundamental rights are denied , wherever it occurs .
Senator Russ Feingold and Representative Donald Payne , chairmen of the Senate and House Subcommittees on Africa , also expressed deep concern Hanging on the wall of my office is a quote from Archbishop Desmond Tutu which reads , Remaining silent or ambiguous for fear of damaging our long - standing relations with Morocco is simply unconscionable .
It is urgent for the United States to help resolve this situation by asking Morocco to return Aminatou ’s passport and allow her to return to her family .
We must be firm in asking Spain to intercede with Morocco to ensure her safe return .
It is also time for the U.S. to use its influence in the United Nations to reaffirm support for the negotiations and the long - overdue referendum on self - determination for the people of Western Sahara .
U.S. citizens should express their concern to their elected officials , as well as signing an open letter to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights .
Amnesty International has also launched a letter writing campaign to Secretary of State Clinton and another to government officials in Morocco .
People like Aminatou capture our imaginations and give us hope that the path to peace -- wherever it may be -- is achievable through non-violent measures .
Simply put , we must ensure that one of the world ’s rare role models , lives to carry out her life ’s mission surrounded by her family and her people .

Why do people vote against their own interests ?
Americans voicing their anger at the healthcare proposals at a " town hall meeting "
The Republicans ' shock victory in the election for the US Senate seat in Massachusetts meant the Democrats lost their supermajority in the Senate .
This makes it even harder for the Obama administration to get healthcare reform passed in the US .
Political scientist Dr David Runciman gives his view on why there is often such deep opposition to reforms that appear to be of obvious benefit to voters .
Last year , in a series of " town - hall meetings " across the country , Americans got the chance to debate President Obama 's proposed healthcare reforms .
What happened was an explosion of rage and barely suppressed violence .
Polling evidence suggests that the numbers who think the reforms go too far are nearly matched by those who think they do not go far enough .
But it is striking that the people who most dislike the whole idea of healthcare reform - the ones who think it is socialist , godless , a step on the road to a police state - are often the ones it seems designed to help .
In Texas , where barely two - thirds of the population have full health insurance and over a fifth of all children have no cover at all , opposition to the legislation is currently running at 87 % .
Anger Instead , to many of those who lose out under the existing system , reform still seems like the ultimate betrayal .
Why are so many American voters enraged by attempts to change a horribly inefficient system that leaves them with premiums they often cannot afford ?
Why are they manning the barricades to defend insurance companies that routinely deny claims and cancel policies ?
It might be tempting to put the whole thing down to what the historian Richard Hofstadter back in the 1960s called " the paranoid style " of American politics , in which God , guns and race get mixed into a toxic stew of resentment at anything coming out of Washington .
But that would be a mistake .
Drew Westen argues that stories rather than facts convince voters
If people vote against their own interests , it is not because they do not understand what is in their interest or have not yet had it properly explained to them .
They do it because they resent having their interests decided for them by politicians who think they know best .
There is nothing voters hate more than having things explained to them as though they were idiots .
As the saying goes , in politics , when you are explaining , you are losing .
And that makes anything as complex or as messy as healthcare reform a very hard sell .
Stories not facts
In his book The Political Brain , psychologist Drew Westen , an exasperated Democrat , tried to show why the Right often wins the argument even when the Left is confident that it has the facts on its side .
He uses the following exchange from the first presidential debate between Al Gore and George Bush in 2000 to illustrate the perils of trying to explain to voters what will make them better off : Gore : " Under the governor 's plan , if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare , your premiums would go up by between 18 % and 47 % , and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he 's modelled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries . "
Bush : " Look , this is a man who has great numbers .
He talks about numbers .
LISTEN TO THE PROGRAMME Turkeys Voting for Christmas BBC Radio 4 , Wednesday 27 January at 2045 GMT
Or listen via the iPlayer " I 'm beginning to think not only did he invent the internet , but he invented the calculator .
It 's fuzzy math .
It 's trying to scare people in the voting booth . "
A clear difference in the type of language used , even though Mr Bush , too , went on to talk numbers : " Under my tax plan , that [ Gore ] continues to criticize , I set a third -- the federal government should take no more than a third of anybody 's check .
But I also drop the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent because by far the vast majority of the help goes to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder .
" If you 're a family of four in Massachusetts making $ 50,000 you get a 50 percent cut in the federal income taxes you pay .
It 's from 4,000 to about 2,000 .
Now , the difference in our plans is I want that 2,000 to go to you , and the vice president would like to be spending the 2,000 on your behalf . "
Mr Bush won the debate .
With Mr. Gore 's statistics , the voters just heard a patronising policy wonk , and switched off .
For Mr Westen , stories always trump statistics , which means the politician with the best stories is going to win :
" One of the fallacies that politicians often have on the Left is that things are obvious , when they are not obvious .
" Obama 's administration made a tremendous mistake by not immediately branding the economic collapse that we had just had as the Republicans ' Depression , caused by the Bush administration 's ideology of unregulated greed .
The result is that now people blame him . "
Reverse revolution Thomas Frank , the author of the best - selling book What 's The Matter with Kansas , is an even more exasperated Democrat and he goes further than Mr Westen .
He believes that the voters ' preference for emotional engagement over reasonable argument has allowed the Republican Party to blind them to their own real interests .
The Republicans have learnt how to stoke up resentment against the patronising liberal elite , all those do - gooders who assume they know what poor people ought to be thinking .
Right - wing politics has become a vehicle for channelling this popular anger against intellectual snobs .
The result is that many of America 's poorest citizens have a deep emotional attachment to a party that serves the interests of its richest .
Thomas
Frank thinks that voters have become blinded to their real interests Thomas Frank says that whatever disadvantaged Americans think they are voting for , they get something quite different : " You vote to strike a blow against elitism and you receive a social order in which wealth is more concentrated than ever before in our life times , workers have been stripped of power , and CEOs are rewarded in a manner that is beyond imagining .
" It 's like a French Revolution in reverse in which the workers come pouring down the street screaming more power to the aristocracy . "
As Mr Frank sees it , authenticity has replaced economics as the driving force of modern politics .
The authentic politicians are the ones who sound like they are speaking from the gut , not the cerebral cortex .
Of course , they might be faking it , but it is no joke to say that in contemporary politics , if you can fake sincerity , you have got it made .
And the ultimate sin in modern politics is appearing to take the voters for granted .
This is a culture war but it is not simply being driven by differences over abortion , or religion , or patriotism .
And it is not simply Red states vs.
Blue states any more .
It is a war on the entire political culture , on the arrogance of politicians , on their slipperiness and lack of principle , on their endless deal making and compromises .
And when the politicians say to the people protesting : ' But we 're doing this for you ' , that just makes it worse .
In fact , that seems to be what makes them angriest of all .

The party ’s over for Naomi Brilliant .
The social butterfly whose rock ’n ’ roll events at Roshambo , her Sonoma winery , attracted droves of San Francisco hipsters  typically in silly costumes  is plowing under the vines she inherited from her grandfather to grow vegetables .
She ’s sold the last of her Roshambo wine .
After 10 years in overdrive trying to convince her generation that wine is a blast , “ I realized I was n’t having any fun doing this any more , ” Ms. Brilliant , 37 , said in an interview .
It ’s a head - snapping move for the saucy , tattooed hostess who last June drew 700 fans to her tasting room in the Carneros region of Sonoma for her annual Rock - Paper - Scissors Tournament , the most famous of Roshambo ’s attempts to reach beyond the confines of the traditional wine industry .
In part she ’s a victim of the recession that ’s threatening dozens of small wineries .
The profits at Roshambo ( a name for the children ’s game rock - paper - scissors ) evaporated as sales dwindled from a high of 10,000 cases in 2005 .
Last year , Ms. Brilliant reduced production to 1,000 cases and decided to make no wine during the 2009 harvest , selling all the grapes .
Here ’s the Tennessee Court of the Judiciary ’s public censure in the case ( paragraph breaks added ) :
PUBLIC CENSURE
May 1 , 2009
The Honorable Durwood G. Moore
Dickson County General Sessions Judge
Post Office Box 217
Charlotte , Tennessee 37036
In re : Complaint of Benjamin J. Marchant vs. Judge Durwood G. Moore
Dear Judge Moore :
This shall serve as a public censure pursuant to your agreement with the Investigative Panel of this Court .
This censure relates to your conduct as General Sessions Court Judge on January 2 , 2009 .
On this date at approximately 1:30 p.m. Mr. Marchant was a spectator in your courtroom .
He had come to observe the court proceedings as he had a friend who had court business and he was there to provide that individual a ride at the conclusion of your court proceedings .
While he sat in your court you observed him and ordered your bailiff or police officers in the courtroom to take Mr. Marchant into custody and to administer a drug test on his person .
Mr. Marchant was neither a litigant , a defendant or a person who had business before the Court and was a citizen observer .
Mr. Marchant at your direction was seized by police officials and required to provide a urine sample which was drug tested .
When the drug test was revealed to be negative Mr. Marchant was released .
The ordering of the seizure of Mr. Marchant and this testing were illegal and neither statutory nor constitutional basis existed for your conduct .
Your conduct in ordering a spectator to submit to a drug screen violated Canon 2A which requires a judge “ to respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the Judiciary . ”
This conduct also violates Canon 3 B ( 2 ) which requires a judge to be “ faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it . ”
The conduct also violated Canon 3 B ( 4 ) which requires a judge to be “ patient , dignified and courteous with litigants , jurors , witnesses , lawyers and others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity . ”
This conduct also violates the due process rights of Mr. Marchant to privacy and freedom under both the United States Constitution and the Tennessee Constitution .
Your conduct in this matter has detrimentally affected the integrity of the Tennessee Judiciary and undermines public confidence in the administration of justice .
This public censure represents the highest degree of judicial discipline authorized by law short of the Court seeking a judgment recommending your removal as a judge from office .
In the future you are to accord all citizens who appear in your court their constitutional rights and they shall not be seized on your suspicion for unauthorized drug tests .
Each individual who appears before you shall be afforded their due process rights and shall be properly charged and noticed before any adverse action is taken against
them .
Sincerely yours ,
Don R. Ash
Presiding Judge
Court of the Judiciary

cc : Investigative Panel
Disciplinary Counsel
The Beauty Shop , 966 South Cooper , Memphis , Tennessee :
We arrive back in town late after a jaunt to Graceland Too , the unmissable home of Elvis ’s number one fan , over the border in Mississippi .
We need proper , non -junk food .
So we head to the gentrified East side of town .
The Beauty Shop is quite a pricey eatery and cocktail bar but , hey , it was converted from the very beauty parlour Priscilla Presley used to frequent .
You can dine under genuine retro hair dryers .
I have the Scottish spotted salmon with new potatoes and heirloom cherry tomatoes .
The portion is a little mean , but what a lovely Mediterranean contrast to the junk food - fest of late .
Matt ’s fillet mignon with maple bacon , black peppercorn and mustard seed crust is good , although do you really need to mess this much with a beautiful steak ?
And the truffle oil Parmesan fries are disgusting .
Why , oh why , Americans , must you overdo it ?
Icesave collapsed last October
Iceland 's parliament has approved plans to repay 3.8 bn euros ( £ 3.4bn ) to savers in the UK and the Netherlands .
The money will go to the British and Dutch governments , who partially compensated savers when the Icesave online bank failed .
More than 320,000 savers lost out when the bank collapsed in 2008 .
A bill on the measure , narrowly approved against strong opposition , was seen as crucial to Iceland 's bid to join the EU and rebuild its economy .
The bill was passed by 33 votes to 30 .
The Icelandic government had threatened to resign if the measure was rejected .
" Approving the bill is the better option and will avoid even more economic damage , " Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson said during the debate .
" History will show that we are doing the right thing . "
But the bill 's opponents argue ordinary Icelanders should not have to pay and say the compensation amounts to some 12,000 euros for each citizen on the island nation of 320,000 .
A poll taken in August suggests that 70 % of Icelanders were against the Icesave deal .
An original agreement - negotiated with the British and Dutch governments - was approved in August .
But subsequent amendments negotiated by the prime minister were rejected in both countries , forcing a fresh vote .
Under the new deal the money - which represents 40 % of the country 's gross domestic product - will be repaid gradually , staggered until 2024 .

How to Invest Now With Little Money to Start
Let ’s assume you have no more credit card debts ; you make regular student loan payments and you ’ve already got your emergency fund in place .
In fact , you ’ve been ready to invest for the last six months or so , but you ’ve hesitated – perhaps wisely – because you know the market ’s already gone up 60 % since March of 2009 .
You ’ve also been hearing talk of a double - dip recession and you ’re worried about the escalating federal debts .
But you ’re supposed to get started investing as soon as possible , right ?
Time is on your side .
And you know you should n’t market time , so what ’s the matter with just jumping in ?
Aunt Sally ’s doing well with her PowerShares China fund – maybe you should just put some money in that and ride it out while you figure out what you should really be doing with you money ?
There will always be mixed messages in market news .
This is how markets function – one party thinks it ’s the right time to sell a stock , while another party thinks it ’s the right time to buy .
The important thing is to focus on what you need and what value you can get for your money today .
With all those caveats out of the way , here are my suggestions for anyone just looking for a smart , sensible way to get started in investing now .
We will assume that you are starting with $ 10,000 to invest .
If your capital is different , the advice should still hold .
Starting Investing With $ 10,000
$ 10,000 can be a lot of money .
Since some Canadian mining stocks ( to take one example ) rose 100 , 200 and 300 % ( and more ) off the March 2009 lows , you can imagine what $ 10,000 could do if invested in the right vehicles .
I ’m not suggesting you look at Canadian mining stocks , however .
That story ’s already finished .
What you need to do is figure out
asset allocation the sectors to invest in and the vehicles for investing in them
This means figuring out what portion of your portfolio should be in fixed income vs. growth , whether you will invest in the entire market or just key sectors like healthcare , and whether you will use mutual funds , ETFs , or buy shares directly through a broker .
For simplicity ’s sake , and for just getting started , I ’d recommend that , for now , you just limit your portfolio to ETFs .
Protect your portfolio
You want some portion of your portfolio in investments that are not very volatile and have little downside risk .
Usually this is bonds , but recently there is growing hesitation over bonds since their rally might also be done ( it ’s called a “ crowded trade ” ) .
Investments such as Money Markets , GICs or CDs ( Certificates of Deposit ) are n’t helpful right now either , since they pay next to no interest .
I ’d take your age , turn it into a percentage figure , and then use that as a guideline for what % of your $ 10 k to put in this category .
It ’s not a hard and fast rule , so if you have reason to believe you ’re comfortable taking on a bit more risk , you can lower the amount .
So if you ’re 30 years old , you might think about allocating anywhere from 25 - 35 % of your portfolio here .
My suggestions right now : low - beta ( i.e. , low volatility ) healthcare or pharmaceutical stocks like Johnson & Johnson , that pay good , rising dividends .
You might also still consider a corporate bond fund , since these pay higher yields .
Do n’t put all your money in a “ high - yield ” bond fund , however , without knowing what it ’s made of – it could be largely “ junk ” bonds ( bonds with low credit ratings ) , or it could include quite a few decent corporate bonds , too .
If you are comfortable with and can understand how derivatives work , online options trading can also provide a great way to hedge against risk of loss or volatility .
Just remember that derivatives trading is fraught with risk and you know what you are doing .
Buy an ETF focusing on “ income ” or “ fixed income . ”
It should pay you distributions at least quarterly .
Make sure the MER is low , preferably close to 0.5 % or lower .
Allocate about $ 2500 to this portion of your portfolio .
Domestic Growth
Because you know your own country best , you have an advantage over international investors because you are familiar with many of the companies and you might have access to better research about them .
It ’s also easier to buy companies ’ stock listed on domestic exchanges .
Depending on where you live , I ’d advise you to have a bit less or more in this category than usual .
If you ’re in the U.S. , you should definitely ( in my opinion ) be “ underweight ” ( i.e. own much less than usual ) American equities .
The economic fundamentals just are n’t supporting U.S. growth anytime soon .
That said , there are several U.S. companies that do most of their business abroad ( think IBM and Coke ) and these could be good choices .
If you live in Brazil or Vietnam , however , you can afford to be heavy on your own market because your own domestic economy is experiencing good growth and will be for some time to come .
Buy an ETF that tracks the main index of your country .
In Canada , this is the S&P / TSX 60 – so you want the iShares ETF that replicates this index ( XIU ) .
Depending on where you live , I ’d allocate about $ 2000 - $ 4000 to this portion of your portfolio .
International Growth
Right now foreign equities should be the bulk of your portfolio .
Pick a mix ( say , 50 - 50 ) of companies with a history of paying out good dividends and increasing them on a frequent basis and combine these with a handful of companies poised for heavy growth – some tech stocks , telecommunications stocks , health care stocks and pharmaceuticals ( all industries that are expected to do well over the next year ) .
Because you ’ll be less familiar with international stocks , I ’d buy them through ETFs which help diversify your growth and currency risk .
Visit the websites of iShares , Vanguard , Barclay ’s and PowerShares to get a sense of the ETFs available .
Check their expense ratios and try to get the cheapest ones possible for the ETF class you ’re interested in .
Buy one ETF that tracks the “ total world index ” ( Vanguard has one of these ) , or buy two ETFs – one for international dividends , one for pure international growth .
I ’d allocate about $ 5000 , or around 50 % of your portfolio here .
For Americans , I ’d probably go with about $ 6000 .
Everyone Has To Start Somewhere
You wo n’t get investing “ right ” your first time around .
It takes time to learn everything and you need to allow yourself chances to make mistakes .
But I would n’t wait on the sidelines until you think you “ know enough ” to jump in .
Put some money in and just start learning .
The options mentioned here are all conservative choices that will do you well if you keep a few things in mind :
Buy and hold – the quickest way to start losing money is to start timing and trading .
Do n’t do this if you ’re a beginner .
Keep fees low – go with ETFs that have very low Expense Ratios , like 0.3 % or 0.5 %
Buy passive ETFs only – do n’t buy “ actively managed ” ETFs , do n’t buy leveraged ETFs .
The original ETFs were simple and just tracked indexes .
This is what you want to do , too .
Another option , for someone who really just wants to cautiously dip their toes in the water , would be to pick a stock you know well and think should do well – and just open up a brokerage account and buy a few shares of it .
This allows you to learn about the process of using a brokerage and tracking your stocks / ETFs without laying a lot of money on the table yet .
You can get comfortable with the feeling of having some money in the markets without yet putting it all in .
Once you ’re comfortable that you know what you need to know , then invest your $ 10,000 in two or three stages .
For example , on February 1 you might put $ 5000 into two ETFs .
On March 1 , you might put in the other $ 5000 .
This will also allow you to benefit ( or take advantage of ) from changes in the direction of the market ( if the market drops in February , you can buy it cheaper in March ; if the market rises in February , at least you got half of your portfolio in at the lower price ) .
If you have any questions about getting started , feel free to ask me here or email me through my blog .
There are some other options for you , too .
I look forward to hearing from you !

When I was in grade school in the 1950s , I was usually the only fat kid in class .
Today nearly 1 child in 3 is either overweight or obese , according the the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation .
We did n't used to be so fat ...
I 've seen the difference with my own eyes ... and so have you if you 've lived long enough .
There 's an eye - opening progression map that demonstrates that our collective fatness is new .
( See video below . )
We seem to be powerless against this huge problem , but I promise you , I wo n't leave you without real solutions .
First let 's deflate a few myths
We are n't fat because of TV's or Gameboys .
Allow me to suggest to you that those props are a result rather than the cause obesity .
If a child is highly energetic and healthy , he 's going to be bored by TV and Xboxes .
He 'll want to run around outside instead .
But today 's children are less healthy and their energy levels are lower than the children of previous generations .
As a result , the less energetic child finds solace in watching TV and sitting in front of a computer .
There are three undiscussed reasons for our fatness
We are n't the only ones who are putting on the pounds quickly , by the way .
Look at any chicken , cow or pig ... the ones we eat every day .
Those animals are packing on the pounds like nobody 's business .
Back in the day , a chicken might weigh two pounds after 16 weeks of life .
Now they weigh twice that .
The chickens do n't have access to Ho Ho's , donuts , ice cream , chocolate chip cookies and the like .
But they still pack on the pounds .
That 's because they are being given HORMONES .
Guess what happens to you if you eat chicken , beef or pork from an animal that has been given hormones TO MAKE HIM FAT all his or her life ?
Yup .
We swallow tiny bits of those hormones - daily - for years !
But it 's not just meat .
Non organically raised fruits and vegetables also get doused with some of the fake estrogens .
That 's right , you 'll be swallowing some nasty hormones that can make you larger than you want to be .
These hormones are called xenoestrogens .
I call them fake estrogens .
These fake estogens are also found in plastic wrap , beauty products , laundry detergent , softeners etc .
The list of products we use sometimes daily is too long to include here .
The list probably increases as time passes .
The second real cause of our fatness
In the early 1970s Coke , Pepsi and the rest of the soft drink makers stopped using sugar and replaced it with high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS . )
Many , many foods are also now loaded with HFCS now .
That 's no biggie , right ?
Both sugar and HFCS bad for you , that 's for sure .
But HFCS might as well be renamed " Have some Fat in the ' Can , ' Sucker . "
That 's because HFCS increases a hunger hormone in your body .
The hormone is called Ghrelin .
So you eat the HFCS food , AND you end up eating everything else because you 're still hungry .
Real cause # 3 is a real Lulu
You probably do n't remember the first time you were given antibiotics .
Most likely you had a stuffed up nose and ears , so your mom took you to the pediatrician .
To get the full explanation on why antibiotics make us fat , you 'll want to see my hub on food cravings .
But here is the shorthand explanation .
Antibiotics promote yeast growth in our body .
Yeast live on sugar and so does our brain .
This is true for both men and women .
When the yeast , which is in our intestines and therefore gets first dibs on any sugar , eats up the sugar that our brain needs , your brain will tell you , " Hey , I 'm DYING up here !
Get me some food with some sugar in it ! "
So off you go to the kitchen to snack on some cookies or ice cream , or whatever it is that suits your fancy .
Result ?
Weight gain .
That 's why in all 50 US states we have a situation where at least 55 % of the adults are overweight .
A mere 25 years ago , only four states fell into that category .
That 's a twelvefold increase !
The trend is not going to stop .
In fact , the obesity crisis will continue to grow worse .
There is no end in sight .
And it will continue so long as we blame the wrong things for our collective fatness .
The result is that some day soon there will be too many sick people to be able to take care of them effectively .
There are some things we can do to correct the situation .
The first is to only eat meat that has no added hormones in it .
Some grocery stores carry hormone free meat .
For example , Publix carries " Greenwise " beef and chicken .
Maverick is another hormone free meat .
If yours does n't , ask them to start .
Also the supplement DIM helps to reverse the effects of too much fake estrogen in our systems .
So do supplements that contain indole - 3 - carbinol .
Both of those products are available at health food stores .
The excess of fake estrogens helps to explain why girls are reaching puberty earlier than before while boys are seeing a delay .
In later life these bad estrogens cause cancer , hair loss and thinning , and a lower sex drive , to name just a few of the problems .
As for the HFCS , it 's going to be tough to change our habits until we end our yeast overgrowths .
I 've seen lots of people who have reversed their yeast problems with a combination of olive leaf extract , glutamine , caprylic acid and PB - 8 ( an excellent probiotic . )
All of those are available at health food stores .
For children , I would use a line of products called Threelac .
They have different products for different ages of children .
My entire progam is discussed in another one of my hub pages .
Once the yeast is back under control , the desire to eat those foods made with HFCS in them goes away effortlessly .
I mean it ... it is effortless ... no will power is required whatsover .
With this you 'll have the solution for you and your family .
The next step will be to tell everyone you know because if we do n't , the US is on a slippery slide to ruin through obesity and the resulting arthritis , diabetes , cancer , Alzheimer 's , etc .
This is no joke , and it 's not hyperbole .
Childhood obesity has tripled in the last 25 years .
Those children will be fatter than we are presently when they grow up .
And there will be more obese Americans ... even more than there are now .
We are n't that healthy as a nation today .
Today 's children can expect to be sicker than today 's adults with chronic diseases striking them at even younger ages than we see now .
How does the US survive if half the 40 - year old 's become disabled by their obesity and disease ... the same diseases that are now striking people when they are 60 or 70 ?
So we must act and act quickly to save not only our families but our communities and our country .
Do n't wait for the next guy to step forward .
You are the next guy .
Please leave a comment with your thoughts .

If we are to save our nation , we need to get the word out fast .
About the author
( NewsTarget ) A terrorist attack exactly one month after 9/11 occurred in Tampa , Florida .
But these terrorists were from the FDA , state health services bureaucrats and local sheriffs .
The target of this attack was two highly successful , inexpensive experimental alternative cancer clinics using aloe vera extract .
Some who were responding favorably to the treatments were now cut off and effectively sentenced to death by the federal and state governments .
The aloe vera extract the clinics used was developed by Ivan Danhoff , MD , PhD , considered the aloe vera authority out of Texas .
He was going through the bureaucratic hoops to obtain an INDstatus , and he was going to use the data from the clinics , attended by Dr. Daniel Mayer and nutritionist Joseph Di Stefano .
They had used his aloe extract on 100 cancer victims assigned to hospice .
Ninety - four of them survived with no side effects from the treatments .
Overall , the clinics ' recovery rate was 80 percent .
Unfortunately , they were shut down before Dr. Danhoff could submit the clinics ' results .
The FDA had responded to complaints Those cancer victims were thrilled at responding favorably to treatments that cost $ 1200 for the duration , 25 to 40 treatments .
Just one chemotherapy treatment costs as much or more !
During the raid , one of the patients complained , " We 're all adults here on our free will .
Why do n't you get out of here and leave us alone ? "
An FDA agent replied , " This will be your last treatment ! "
That patient and several others were denied effective treatments over business complaints from the cancer industry !
There are over 300 aloe vera species on earth .
But thespecies has been the favorite for study in scientific literature today .
The main focus in ongoing research is a group ofthat contain the healing agents known as .
They all have different healing potentials .
The polymannan sizes range from small to medium to large and very large .
Each one has a level of healing that corresponds in magnitude with its size .
It 's the very large molecular weight and long chain polymannans that Dr. Danhof extracted for use on cancer patients .
Injecting the large molecule extract was necessary because it is very difficult to absorb through the digestive system .
Another aspect of these polymannans , especially the larger ones , is their capacity for organizing the immune system .
These polymannans provide a detection capacity for cells to determine exactly what is needed for various pathogenic invaders .
Without them , the cells are shooting wildly in the dark , and that can lead to damaging cytotoxic autoimmune responses .
From researcher Dr. Ivan Danhof : " The very large molecules are immune modulating , which have a powerful healing effect on AIDS , cancer and many different immune system disorders .
It is also this large molecule that causes the body to produce a natural chemical , tumor necrosis factors , which functions to shut off the blood supply to tumors .
"
In this Medical Mafia atrocity , the FDA was satisfied with closing the clinic down and disallowing the aloe extract 's use .
No one went to jail .
But there was the " collateral damage " of patients unable to receive more treatments and at least eight dying within a year .
Even worse , the Medical Mafia had crushed yet another cancer cure that is effective , without side effects , and much less costly .
The " War on Cancer " is a war on cancer cures .

HOWARD ZINN , my hero , teacher and friend , died of a heart attack on Wednesday at the age of 87 .
With his death , we lose a man who did nothing less than rewrite the narrative of the United States .
We lose a historian who also made history .
Anyone who believes that the United States is immune to radical politics never attended a lecture by Howard Zinn .
The rooms would be packed to the rafters , as entire families , black , white and brown , would arrive to hear their own history made humorous as well as heroic .
" What matters is not who 's sitting in the White House .
What matters is who 's sitting in ! " he would say with a mischievous grin .
After this casual suggestion of civil disobedience , the crowd would burst into laughter and applause .
Only Howard could pull that off because he was entirely authentic .
When he spoke against poverty , it was from the perspective of someone who had to work in the shipyards during the Great Depression .
When he spoke against war , it was from the perspective of someone who flew as a bombardier during the Second World War , and was forever changed by the experience .
When he spoke against racism , it was from the perspective of someone who taught at Spelman College during the civil rights movement , and was arrested sitting in with his students .
Howard Zinn and Dave Zirin at the 2009 Campaign to End the Death Penalty convention ( Eric Ruder | SW )
And of course , when he spoke about history , it was from the perspective of having written A People 's History of the United States , a book that has sold more than 2 million copies and changed the lives of countless people .
Count me among them .
When I was 17 and picked up a dog-eared copy of Zinn 's book , I thought history was about learning that the Magna Carta was signed in 1215 .
I could n't tell you what the Magna Carta was , but I knew it was signed in 1215 .
Howard took this history of great men in powdered wigs and turned it on its pompous head .
In Howard 's book , the central actors were the runaway slaves , the labor radicals , the masses and the misfits .
It was history writ by Robin Hood , speaking to a desire so many share : to actually make history instead of being history 's victim .
His book came alive in December with the debut of The People Speak on The History Channel , as actors , musicians and poets brought Zinn 's book to life .
Howard was asked once whether his praise of dissent and protest was divisive .
He answered beautifully :
Yes , dissent and protest are divisive , but in a good way , because they represent accurately the real divisions in society .
Those divisions exist -- the rich , the poor -- whether there is dissent or not .
But when there is no dissent , there is no change .
The dissent has the possibility not of ending the division in society , but of changing the reality of the division .
Changing the balance of power on behalf of the poor and the oppressed .
WORDS LIKE this made Howard my hero .
I never thought we would also become friends .
But through our mutual cohort , Anthony Arnove , Howard read my sports writing , and then gave his blessing to a book project we called A People 's History of Sports in the United States .
We also did a series of meetings together , where I would interview Howard on stage .
Even at 87 , he still had his sharp wit , strong voice and matinee - idol white hair .
But his body had become frail .
Despite this physical weakness , Howard would stay and sign hundreds of books until his hand would shake with the effort .
At our event in Madison , Wis. , Howard issued a challenge to the audience .
He said , " Our job as citizens is to honestly assess what Obama is doing .
Not measured just against Bush , because against Bush , everybody looks good .
But look honestly at what Obama 's doing , and act as engaged and vigorous citizens . "
He also had no fear to express his political convictions loudly and proudly .
I asked him about the prospects today for radical politics , and he said :
Let 's talk about socialism ... I think it 's very important to bring back the idea of socialism into the national discussion to where it was at the turn of the [ last ] century before the Soviet Union gave it a bad name .
Socialism had a good name in this country .
Socialism had Eugene Debs .
It had Clarence Darrow .
It had Mother Jones .
It had Emma Goldman .
It had several million people reading socialist newspapers around the country ...
Socialism basically said , hey , let 's have a kinder , gentler society .
Let 's share things .
Let 's have an economic system that produces things not because they 're profitable for some corporation , but produces things that people need .
People should not be retreating from the word socialism , because you have to go beyond capitalism .
Howard Zinn taught millions of us a simple lesson : Agitate .
Agitate .
Agitate .
But never lose your sense of humor in the process .
It 's a beautiful legacy , and however much it hurts to lose him , we should strive to build on Howard 's work and go out and make some history .

I do remember the headlines .
The headlines were screaming , George Michael , he is in trouble again .
It 's not the details I remember .
I do n't really remember , for example , that it was a pot bellied unemployed truck driver he'd been caught in the bushes and I do n't remember that he'd left the keys in his car .
I only remember what he was quoted as saying to the paparazzi who caught him that day , This is my culture , that 's what he said , and that I remember .
I remember it very well , as it struck me hard and I could n't forget it .
This is my culture , he said , and if it was his culture , I knew I was thinking , if it was his culture it must be my culture .
Gays in the bushes : cottaging they call it over there , cruising , anonymous sex .
And George Michael , caught by the paparazzi , does n't deny it all , he does n't apologize , and he does n't even look shamed .
No , he shouts back at the rest of the world , this is how we live , this is how we live , you do n't get it , but that does n't matter because this is n't your world and this is n't your culture .
His remark that day , , captured for me the struggle I see taking place within the gay community , between the gays and the queers , between assimilation and separation , between domesticity and promiscuity .
A struggle between those who shudder at the drag queens in the pride parade ( we 're not all like that , they say , we live regular lives just like you do , we are normal ) and those who sneer at marriage ( we do n't need the trappings of the heteros , we are different , we are queer ) .
I feel this struggle , I sense it all around me , and when George Michael said fuck off , this is my culture , I knew he had touched something , something explosive and unresolved .
And I was filled with some amount of admiration for his cheekiness and perhaps even his bravery .
I think of myself as rather normal .
I have a job , I pay my taxes , I am in bed at a reasonable hour , I mean for God 's sake I even have kids .
I 'm rarely in bushes with unemployed potbellied truckdrivers .
I support gay marriage , I really do , and I would work to support it , but still , sometimes , I do wonder if marriage , respectability , recognition , fitting in , is really the goal of the struggle we find ourselves in .
I think about it sometimes when I see the hookup ads that begin " I am a straight acting , masculine ... , " I think about it and I wonder if it is n't the femboy who can't possibly pretend to be straight , the inevitable target of the bullies , who should n't be celebrated .
And I think about it when I see the men in leather , stocky , hirsute , doing unmentionable things in small groups , and in their own way turning our culture 's ideas of masculinity upside down and all around .
And I think about it when I meet a single gay man , in his fifties , riding a bicycle instead of a car , in an open relationship with a much younger man , living outside of conventional morality in the most respectable manner imaginable .
Defending George Michael ?
Well , really , he does n't need me to defend him and he would n't want my defense anyway .
Defending a grown man who smokes too much dope and spends too much time in the reeds , well , it 's a little strange , but there 's something worth defending about him , nevertheless .
It 's my culture , he declares .
Maybe not , maybe not exactly so , but he got some part of it right and he made damn well sure we all knew it .
Coping with depression made Craig Rennebohm want to rescue others from their own sense of aloneness .
" None of us function without the help and support of others , " he says .
Craig Rennebohm has been walking the streets of downtown Seattle for more than 20 years .
He knows where to find a free meal , what the requirements are to get into each shelter , and where someone can go to get a shower .
He knows what time the overnight shelters close in the morning and when the day shelters open .
Rennebohm knows how to navigate these downtown survival services not for his own use but for his service to the most vulnerable of the homeless population : those suffering from mental illness .
As a mental health chaplain , Rennebohm reaches out to the " least of these " brethren in hopes of accompanying them to healing .
Real Change joined Rennebohm one morning as he walked downtown looking for people who are traumatized , in a major depression , or maybe manic or delusional .
Those in such a mental state may be impaired in their ability to find the services they need , follow the rules to prevent themselves from winding up in jail , and interact in a comfortable and productive way with others .
Even for those with full capabilities , the services are not always evident or easy to figure out .
As we walked , Rennebohm pointed out a free clinic and hygiene center tucked off the main streets , displaying virtually no signage .
With years of experience Rennebohm has learned how to reach out to the most isolated of people , such as the person standing on the edge of a meal site , too uncomfortable being around others to stand in line .
He does this by creating a safe space , introducing himself as a fellow human being , listening to the person 's story , and offering his assistance .
He may introduce someone to a service provider or stand with them in line .
Downtown he walks people to the free clinic and tells them when the meal programs start .
In a given day he accompanies a handful of people who he 'll follow up with next time on his daily street walks .
An ordained minister with the United Church of Christ , Rennebohm founded the Mental Health Chaplaincy in Seattle in 1987 .
In addition to direct outreach on the streets , the program involves education and training in faith communities and advocacy work .
Rennebohm got interested in helping those with mental illness while serving as a pastor at Pilgrim Congregational ( now All Pilgrims Christian Church ) , where the congregation reached out to the Capitol Hill neighborhood 's homeless population .
He noticed that some of the people had trouble receiving services because of their mental illness .
Later , while furthering his studies , Rennebohm worked in a psych unit and saw that people who were stabilized were sometimes released back onto the streets .
Rennebohm 's empathy for those with mental illness stems from his own experience .
In his mid-20s he had a major depressive episode and felt utterly alone .
" I can't describe what that experience of nothingness was like , " says Rennebohm .
He needed someone to reach out and pull him back from the brink , and for him that someone was his pastor , Dick Price .
" None of us function without the help and support of others , " he says .
He calls our need for community " primal . "
Without the accompaniment he received , Rennebohm is sure he too would have ended up on the streets , or even have disappeared by suicide or some other means .
In his current work he seeks to provide the companionship he knows is essential to healing , and he encourages others to welcome those with mental illnesses into their communities as well .
Part of the work of the Mental Health Chaplaincy is to mobilize faith communities through education and training to provide community and companionship for people with mental illness .
Education is the first step , says Rennebohm , for people to understand the causes and individual experiences of various mental illnesses , from depression to bipolar disorder to schizophrenia .
For those who are unsure or even scared of the idea of talking with someone suffering from a mental illness , he suggests volunteering at a place where people are being served , such as at the Community Lunch on Capitol Hill where Real Change met with him .
The atmosphere was jovial and welcoming with a team of teenagers volunteering their clean - up services and a health clinic giving out free flu shots .
While religious organizations can provide a community supporting people as they move toward health , Rennebohm emphasizes that these alone cannot meet the needs of people suffering from mental illness .
" This is a public responsibility .
It 's a public health issue , " he says .
Looking back on the history of mental health care , Rennebohm sees a system failure .
As mental health institutions closed , community mental health centers were supposed to open in order to meet people 's needs for outpatient services , along with programming to connect people with housing and education opportunities .
But " less than a quarter of the community mental health centers envisioned in the 1960s were ever built , " says Rennebohm .
He blames this on a change in political will in the early ' 70s which cut funding for the centers and emphasized the criminal justice system as a means of social control .
The results can be seen locally .
" The King County jail is still the biggest mental health center in King County , " he says .
It 's an example of how the mental health care system is turned around , with people not receiving treatment until they are at their worst .
This is the complete opposite , he says , from other branches of medicine : from how doctors measure a person 's blood pressure , for instance , and use preventive measures if it's too high , rather than wait until the patient suffers a heart attack .
Similarly , Rennebohm does not think the answer is to have more outreach workers like him walking the streets of Seattle , attending to people experiencing the equivalent of a heart attack .
Instead he'd like to see a mental health care system that prevents people from getting pushed to the margins of society in the first place .
Over his years of service in downtown Seattle , Rennebohm has seen the affordable apartment buildings torn down and the shiny new office buildings go up .
He has seen the outdoor meal site pushed from City Hall Park to its current location under the freeway .
He has seen the homeless population redlined out of the downtown corridor .
He points out a sign under a bridge at Yesler and Fourth that lists " rules of conduct " for use of the public city sidewalk .
They include prohibitions on sitting , lying down , and leaving any personal property unattended .
Rennebohm asks why there are no rules of conduct for the treatment of homeless people .
As our walk comes to an end , Rennebohm says hello to a man standing by a public phone .
He has known this man for years and has encouraged him to come to the community lunches .
It is progress , Rennebohm says , just that this man recognizes him and can have a basic exchange of words .
While trying to get people the care they need in all areas , including treatment programs and medication , Rennebohm recognizes that illnesses of the brain cannot be solved with a simple pill .
" Medicine can re-balance the biochemistry of the brain , but medicine alone can't help people understand their illness , and medicine alone can't restore love in a life filled with fear , " says Rennebohm .
You can learn more about the Mental Health Chaplaincy , including information about Rennebohm 's book about his work , " Souls in the Hands of a Tender God , " at www.mentalhealthchaplain.org.

Labour has attempted to increase mobility by devoting resources to improving the general rate of academic success among disadvantaged children .
Those programmes failed to deliver – hence Tony Blair 's welcome decision to focus also on the gifted and talented .
Abandoning that strategy will have the same result as the attack on grammar schools : it will do nothing for the less able , but will mean that many exceptional children from poor backgrounds never reach their potential .
That is not an achievement of which Labour can be proud .

EUROPE : Transition Brings AIDS

from IPSnews.net
By Claudia Ciobanu
July 31 2008
Poverty and social displacement , increased availability of drugs , and chaos in the healthcare systems that accompanied transition from state socialism to the market economy have contributed to the spread of HIV in Eastern Europe .
Russia and the Central Asian countries that were once a part of the Soviet Union are today the worst hit by large numbers of new HIV infections .
According to UNAIDS ( the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS ) , between 2001 - 2007 the number of people living with HIV in Eastern Europe and Central Asia increased by 150 percent , from 630,000 to 1.6 million .
More than half of the new cases were diagnosed in Russia , and over 20 percent in Ukraine .
In most other countries in Eastern Europe , the HIV epidemic peaked in 2000 - 2001 .
Since then , efforts to stabilise the epidemic have achieved partial success .
" Transition has led to economic and social dislocation , creating an environment that allows illicit drug markets , drug injecting , and related HIV risk to thrive , " wrote Tim Rhodes , a researcher in public health sociology at the Imperial College London , in a 2005 study on the HIV epidemic in Eastern Europe .
According to Rhodes , heightened availability of injectable drugs like heroin , and the globalisation of western drug cultures coincided with the weakening of public health infrastructures , erosion of local communities , migration and mixing of populations , and increased economic hardship .
All this contributed to the rapid spread of HIV .
The Baltic states ( Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania ) reported eruptions of HIV epidemics around 2001 .
Most of the cases were discovered among drug users , usually young men from urban areas .
While the number of new HIV cases has decreased since , the epidemic has spread to wider sections of society , with women increasingly at risk .
Of the three Baltic states , Estonia has been worst hit .
By the end of 2007 , 6,364 HIV cases had been registered in Estonia , which has a population of 1.3 million .
UNAIDS estimates that the real number of HIV positive Estonians could be twice that .
With 1 percent of the population infected with HIV , the country has the one of the highest proportionate incidence of the virus in Europe .
According to the 2004 study ' HIV and AIDS in Estonia ' by Jury Kalikov and Arnaud Wasson - Simon , the exceptionally violent spread of the epidemic in Estonia came because of the late introduction of needle exchange programmes ( 10 months after the HIV epidemic was declared ) , lack of continuous treatment for uninsured HIV positive patients , and because government structures left too much of the responsibility with NGOs .
Similar problems in the management of the epidemic can be found in other countries in Eastern Europe , like Bulgaria and Romania .
While Bulgaria has not faced a massive outbreak of HIV , the incidence of new cases has risen from 49 new cases in 2000 ( in a population of eight million ) to 91 in 2006 .
Bulgarian NGOs have called for more needle exchange points and for centres offering opiate replacement treatment for heroin users .
Romanian NGOs have made similar demands .
" Needle exchange programmes are not sufficient as they are conducted only by NGOs with few financial resources , " says Nicoleta Dascalu , programme manager at ARAS , the Romanian Association against AIDS .
" More methadone substitution treatments for heroin users are available lately , but they still do not cover all the needs . "
Romania is an exceptional case in Eastern Europe because the first HIV epidemic was discovered there in the early 1990s , forcing authorities and NGOs to mobilise sooner than in other countries .
At the time , thousands of children were found to have been infected with HIV in hospitals and orphanages in the period 1987 - 1991 because of untested drug transfusions and the use of non-sterile syringes .
Many of them had been simultaneously transmitted the viruses of hepatitis B or C .
According to the 2008 national report of the HIV / AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Department in Romania , at the beginning of 2007 health authorities were monitoring 7,000 HIV positive adolescents , considered to be long time survivors after being infected in the period 1987 - 1991 .
In all , 16,877 cases of HIV infections had been recorded by 2007 , in a population of 23 million .
Since 2004 , says the report , the epidemic has stabilised , with the incidence of new cases decreasing slightly , and among children , significantly .
But national health institutions still have a long way to go .
Nicoleta Dascalu from ARAS told IPS that most of the funds for HIV prevention programmes are currently coming from the Global Fund to Fight HIV , Tuberculosis and Malaria .
NGOs remain the most important actors in charge of HIV prevention , and in offering psychological and social assistance .
Many of the country reports on HIV submitted to UNAIDS in 2008 emphasise the need to better coordinate the various state and civil society actors involved in fighting the HIV epidemic .
Since a large part of the funds and guidance for HIV prevention and care are now coming from United Nations ' agencies and the Global Fund , there is concern about the ability of national bodies to fully take charge of these programmes .
While similar risk factors as in Eastern Europe have been present in Central Europe , countries like the Czech Republic and Hungary have managed to prevent large HIV epidemics .

RZA : KUNG FU CURES PERVERSION !

RZA ( feat .
Inspectah Deck ) “ You Ca n’t Stop Me ”
[ audio : http://www.minneapolisfuckingrocks.com/mp3/rza%20-%20you%20cant%20stop%20me%20now%20feat.%20inspectah%20deck.mp3]
RZA will release Bobby Digital ’s Digi Snacks on Tuesday on Koch .
Who was the first person in Los Angeles to beat you in a game of chess ?
My homeboy Harvey — an O.G. kid , an older dude .
He ’s a good player — a hard guy to beat !
It took me about a month .
I had to study .
The GZA was beating me for a while , but I did n’t know he was studying !
And his son Kareem — he digs me — he pulls me to the side like , ‘ Hey , Ra , you know why my dad keeps beating you ?
He ’s got a book he studies !’
So I started studying .
I been studying for two years .
It ’s harder to learn chess as an adult because you ’ve got a certain way of thinking .
But with the guy from the Hip - Hop Chess Federation , I ’ve been able to — maybe I started with a rating of 1100 and right now I ’m closer to 1400 .
Which is still class C .
Did moving to L.A. have anything to do with working with Dr. Dre ?
Actually , I had decided to be a composer —
Film scores ?
Yeah , and I was going through a divorce and I needed to change my philosophy .
I love the feeling and vibe out here .
How I felt as a person when I woke up in the morning .
I did n’t feel like ‘ I ’m RZA from New York ! ’
I was like a normal person for a while .
So I decided to come out and give myself five years to start a new career .
End up as a movie director .
I ’ve been living here for two - and - a - half years .
You ’ve been keeping a low profile .
I ’m out but I ’m not paparazzi out .
I ’ve been acting in films already and been studying with Tarantino for six years .
He ’s a great teacher .
He ’s got films I never heard of .
He introduced me to different directors , some of whom are extremely boring , but there ’s a reason why , and some are extremely incredible .
I ’m out here to improve myself , improve my family and improve the image of hip - hop in film .
In the early days , Samuel Jackson said he did n’t think hip - hop guys should be actors .
‘ They ’re not actors — they ’re rappers ! ’
And I think he ’s right .
A lot of us did n’t have talent .
But some of us do .
We need to find the ones and not just take the name of the month .
Look at someone like Mos Def who has talent — give him a chance !
I think I did a good job because I try to do a good job .
I thought back to what he said — I do n’t wanna be another name on that list !
Also the directors do n’t know our culture .
They do n’t know how to make us look good .
Look at Method Man .
He ’s in a lot of movies , but I ’ve never seen him in the role that I know he could do .
I know his talent , but — no disrespect — I ’ve never seen a director capture it .
Only in one scene — in Soul Plane where he ’s got the parachute and the helmet and he ’s about to jump off the plane .
That ’s typical Method Man !
That thirty seconds there — he needs a movie like that .
‘ Just be you . ’
Are you trying to do in film what you did in music ?
Exactly — it ’s a whole different medium with whole different players , but if I make it , I ’ll be proud of it .
Maybe I could a few good movies that stand the test of time — I ’ve got albums that stand the test of time and I wanna make some films like that !
I ’ve always had a visual mind !
When I made an album , I wanted people to put it in the CD player and have a movie with me , but they could n’t see the pictures .
They had that in their own mind !
Now with a movie — you do see with your eyes , but there are other things you ca n’t see .
You ca n’t taste the film , ca n’t smell a film — only see and hear .
But if it ’s done right , like a good horror movie , it ’ll last for weeks .
When I first saw Evil Dead , I had nightmares for weeks .
‘ Jack of spades !
Queen of hearts !’
I remember watching that movie with Ol’ Dirty Bastard .
I watched it first , and I told him , ‘ I dare you to watch it !’
He watched it and I fell asleep and he stayed up and was scared to shit !
That ’s how you know — that ’s a good fucking film !
You might watch it now and still get shook !
Is that trailer for the new Bobby Digital album for a video or for a whole movie ?
The video — I did a whole video for ‘ You Ca n’t Stop Me . ’
The album is Digi Snacks because it ’s a snack pack of Bobby Digital ’s world .
Not only music and sounds , but also the comic background , the sci - fi background , the black - exploitation background .
Look at the artwork — a girl with an afro , an Asian girl , Bobby sitting in the big king ’s chair and then the villains —
Raven , Hawk , Eagle and Crane , the four birds of prey that I use as my enemies .
Bobby Digital ’s life - long nemeses .
That adds a comic element to it — as well as martial arts .
I ’m planning a comic book , a video game — I ’m already talking to people .
I want fans to be aware of these things .
You said in one interview that the more mathematics you put in an album , the less the media wants to support it .
Is that why you ’re presenting this as a ‘ fun ’ album ?
Sort of .
I do n’t think I consciously wanted to tone it down the way I toned it down .
I ’m not touching on every subject .
On 8 Diagrams , I got a song called ‘ Sunshower ’ thanking Allah , thanking God , speaking on it .
In today ’s climate , shit — some people think it ’s anti-American to have respect for Allah and Muslims .
But it ’s not anti-American .
Just in today ’s society with the media exposure calling them ‘ radical Islamics ’ and all that shit — it makes it like we have to hold our breath on that .
But to speak truth — my heart — I take that chance .
As Bobby Digital I have more fun — I did a song with David Banner and it ’s having fun , talking shit , not being so serious .
It ’s just entertainment .
I still agree with KRS ONE — edutainment !
Some of the songs are for entertainment purposes only — smile , laugh , dance , do whatever you want !
‘ Love Is Digi Part 2 ’— drink a 40 , bitches on your dick , fuck it , yo !
Having fun !
That ’s one thing I forgot about MCing — being a member of Wu Tang , and not just a member — being the Abbot .
I ’d lead by example .
Serious , focused — you never see me laughing .
Then I did a few films and learned how to separate characters from myself .
I can tell a joke !
I did a show in London recently — just me by myself .
In the middle of the set I told a joke — it took four minutes to deliver .
I ’ll give you the short version — there ’s a black man , a white man and a Chinese man —
Is this about supplies ?
No , no — they ’re all sent to hell , and the devil says , ‘ Whoever can put his dick in my hand and it does n’t melt , I ’ll set you free . ’
The white man steps up , his dick melts — ca n’t set him free .
Chinese man , his dick melts — ca n’t set him free .
Black man puts his dick up in the devil ’s hand and it do n’t melt .
‘ Why do n’t it melt ? ’
‘ Milk chocolate melts in your mouth , not in your hand ! ’
I did the whole moving - around big - dick - small - dick on stage and the audience died laughing .
They do n’t expect that from RZA .
They expect a song called ‘ 12 Jewels ! ’
As Bobby Digital — as a character , I take the opportunity to express different things .
Are you warming to the world as you age ?
Yeah — guaranteed .
As a kid , you do n’t understand people .
As a teenager , it ’s all you .
You do n’t even care about your parents — you rebel !
And as a man , you realize understanding , patience , you do n’t be so rebellious — I agree with that .
Going back to 8 Diagrams — you heard Raekwon say , ‘ I want an album that ’s punch - you - in - the - face music !
I do n’t wanna be hippies !’
I understand because I was part of the punch - in - the - face music — I said ‘ Bring the ruckus ! ’
‘ Nothing to fuck with !’— that ’s my shit !
But we become more .
I did an album with Raekwon that ’s full of punch - in - the - face shit !
My character there is Bobby Steels — even my lyrics is violent !
But Wu Tang was n’t the platform — as a man , I can find other platforms .
But as a kid , I ’d agree with him .
You said before that the plan was for Raekwon to pull in the thugs and GZA to get the nerdy college kids — who is Bobby Digital supposed to get ?
I think I got the geeks .
How is that different than the nerds ?
You can be a geek without being a nerd .
In the old days , you had to be both .
Now you can be a geek — be into computers and video games and comics — and still live in the projects !
I never realized I was a geek until one day a lady from Germany who was hanging around Wu Tang said , ‘ You know , RZA , you ’re actually a geek .
You read comics , you play video games , all these beat machines and computer shit — you ’re a geek ! ’
And then the engineer said , ‘ He ’s a geek and I ’m a geek , too ! ’
And he ’s the last person to be a geek , but when there ’s a new Reason or Logic 7 , we geek for that !
We ’re geeks in our own way .
So those people — comic book readers , people who have fantasies in mind , and then basic b- boys who love witty lyrics and not tough gangsta - money lyrics .
And now that I act in movies , I ’m attracting a lot of women .
Movies do get the girls .
I been cool with women my whole life — my first album was Ooh I Love You Rakeem — but now it ’s a different thing !
Grown women — could be a lawyer .
A college professor .
What was her discipline ?
Economics and finance .
Did she tell you to diversify your bonds ?
She wanted to diversify a few things !
But damn , this movie shit is really serious — in London , these real fucking pretty blondes —
’ We love you , we love your afro ! ’
Oh shit , that ’s crazy !
What kind of actor would you want to be in twenty years ?
My agent and lawyer think because of my respectable personality , I ’m geared to be the next Morgan Freeman .
A distinguished guy !
The difference between Morgan Freeman and other actors — he played God in a movie and nobody felt offended he was God !
He ’s got a different kind of gentleman thing about him .
I ’m studying and trying my best to see what life brings .
Maybe I ’ll be a comedian at the end of the day !
Look at Ice Cube — the most dangerous man in America — in the world !— at one point , and now he makes family comedies .
What do you think of that ?
It ’s beautiful .
He ’s got children and a family and he ’s not seen as a threat , you know what I mean ?
One thing about being black and coming from the ghetto — we ’re expected to raise our children like that .
‘ What up , little nigga !
Give that little nigga some beer !’
Teaching kids how to fight at the age of six — it ’s expected of you !
I ’d rather raise a scientist — rather raise a nerd .
Someone who helps society , not a threat to society .
To me Ice Cube is playing a role and making people laugh — and it gives his children a better chance !
Not ‘ fuck America , fuck the police , ’ all that — they are n’t going through those struggles , so they ’ve got a different perspective .
You know if something is wrong , you still stand up .
Denzel did American Gangster — he killed many families as Frank Lucas — but his next role was The Great Debaters — dealing with civil rights .
There ’s a balance .
Is this why you ’re working with Young Dirty ?
He ’s right here !
Listen to the lyrics — that ’s what we say !
For the kids !
Ghost ’s lyrics —
‘ My seeds marry his seeds / that ’s how we keep Wu Tang money all up in the family … ’
But we ai n’t doing it .
Ol ’ Dirty ’s family , why do they not receive checks from every member ?
Not just me because I ’m his cousin .
But I ’m living up to my word to the best of my ability .
I can definitely help Ol ’ Dirty ’s son .
I told Dirty when he was alive that I ’d do it — we all told each other that !
I got another brother the world do n’t even know — Wise Allah .
He died for the Wu and he helped us , and you never hear about him because he helped by doing negative things , but he helped and he lost his life .
He got a son and I ca n’t be his father , but every once in a while I ’ll kick him nice clothes , help them pay the rent , make his day a little better growing up in the ghetto — that ’s what it ’s all about !
I ’m from the ghetto !
I ’ll tell you a story from when I was young .
I remember one day in the house .
We had no food .
And the energy check came — what Welfare sends you to help pay bills .
$ 150 .
We were so hungry , and my mother came in with joy —
‘ The energy check !’
She went and got groceries and we ate good — Kool Aid was made — wow , $ 150 changed the whole household !
And when I got famous and shit — I stopped doing it because I ’m in California now , but for almost five years in a row , I ’d go back to the same neighborhood and for twenty or thirty doors , I ’d slip a hundred - dollar bill under the door .
Just random doors ?
Yeah , and the family that got $ 100 had a meal no matter what !
Someone ate good !
You think maybe that do n’t mean much — not even a pair of sneakers — but it puts food on the table .
I get paid ten to fifteen thousand a day but I know how it feels .
That ’s what the Wu spirit was about at the beginning , and to be working with Young Dirty Bastard is to try and live out our true spiritual confessions to the world and ourselves .
And if Young Dirty Bastard is on his feet and successful , he ’s got thirteen brothers and sisters he could help !
I ’ve got eleven and they ’ve all got a better chance for life because of me .
Maybe he ’ll be the one in his family to give them a chance at a better life .
What is it that made you build this giant thing that ’s defined your life and so many other lives ?
What was different that did n’t let you just live an easy life ?
When you ’re in hell , yo — you see you and your people in hell , and then you get out of hell .
I did it by platinum albums — started making money .
One thing that happened — my mother called on tour and said some guy came to the house , like ‘ Can I speak to Bobby ? ’
This is in winter and he was freezing cold , almost dead of frostbite — he ’d walked thirty miles to find the house .
And I ’m like , ‘ What are you talking about ? ’
I ’m nervous — is this a thief ?
Burglar ?
‘ Who ’s in the house ? ’
‘ Some white guy — he says he ’s a Wu Tang fan and he wants to speak to the Abbot . ’
He says his father ’s bad , he had a whole bad story , and she put me on the phone and I talked to him for fifteen or twenty minutes , and I guess that ’s all he wanted .
He ate his meal and left .
What did you say ?
Too much to get into — basically encouragement .
Words of wisdom .
Whatever question he needed , I answered .
This is like ’ 95 .
You see these things happening and you see how you influence the world — it made me go more into my studies to go farther and do better .
So when Wu Tang were first getting famous and shit , a lot of us were getting girls , getting money , getting cars .
I would get books and equipment .
Build a studio .
Why ?
Popa
Wu told me .
‘ We built a school in Harlem and it saved brothers ’ lives .
You ai n’t going to build a school , but a studio — give brothers a place to go ! ’
Sometimes there would be twenty guys in there and the other Wu would be mad — they do n’t know these niggas !
But it saved that nigga from going to jail , saved him from getting shot — the same it saved them .
In the old days — the story comes from different members .
‘ I ’d come to your house to hang out , and everybody was locked up but me because I was at your house making music !’
Meth told me the day I called him over to sign a contract saved his life — his friends went without him to the weed spot , and they were killed !
Now in California , it ’s the same thing — me and my buddy Shavo got a studio in the Valley .
Shavo ’s a white dude from System Of A Down , but he ’s my buddy — he accepts my struggle like I accept his .
He ’s got niggas from Compton and Long Beach in the studio hanging out and doing music with us !
One dude last year — Doc Doom from Black Knights — was coming to the studio every day and I was n’t giving him money at first .
I usually pay them at the end of the week — $ 1,000 or $ 500 that makes them feel like they got a job , and maybe they ’ll end up on a soundtrack or something and maybe they wo n’t , but it helps pay rent .
But I would n’t give him money because he was robbing niggas and smoking crack — I did n’t wanna put money in his hand .
Then one day — ‘ I need money , I gotta pay bills . ’
So boom — $ 1,000 .
Then I do n’t see him for six fucking days .
I ’d told him he ’d better be in the fucking studio Saturday .
Sunday morning I find out — Doc Doom , six bullets , dead .
But at the same time , he had a place to go where that would n’t have happened to him .
So why do I do this ?
For me , I realized what made me go bad was nobody gave me a chance — nobody !
I asked my sister to invest in the company in the beginning and she would n’t give me money .
I realized all it takes is a chance !
So I try and give people a chance .
All it takes is one — you can change a nigga ’s life !
If you can give someone another day — another hour — on earth , that ’s a great deed !
Do n’t get me twisted — it ’s getting more serious and harder and I ’m getting older .
I got children , baby mothers — it ’s harder to give time to the world .
I ’m telling brothers , ‘ I ’m not 25 years old — I got kids that need me more than you all need me — they have a right to me !’
As you get older , it gets like that .
You ca n’t be a soldier in the field .
Even police offiercs .
When they ’re older , what do they do ?
They tend the fucking office because they can’t walk the beat !
What was the hardest test Yan Ming gave you in China ?
The hardest was no sex .
So I just did more kung fu .
Kung fu is the only thing that ’s second in line to sex when it comes to body energy and all that shit — kung fu cures perversion !
We had like sixty students and all these girls were pretty , and after the second week classmates started doing it with each other , and I ’m out getting drunk with no women .
I had to go train harder !
That was my test — that ’s what he wanted me to do !
Back home , though — it was over !
The girl who took your virginity also taught you to play chess — which do you wish had happened sooner ?
I think both were on time .
Eleven is kind of too young to be devirginized .
I would not suggest that to none of my children !
I did n’t have the mind for that shit .
But I grew up in a different time .
You had to get shit early !
By the time you were thirteen , you were basically on your own in this world .
My brothers carried guns at 11 or 12 .
I ’m not proud , but it ’s true .
Now I ca n’t imagine my eleven - year - old son with a fucking gun .
I can imagine him with a joystick — that ’s it !
Did you really make an actual Bobby Digital super - suit and super-car ?
That was real !
And Dirty was helping me !
Me and Dirty were living together .
1998 in Battery Park , Manhattan , and Dirty — the feds were out to kill him .
I had so much love for him and shit that I wanted to help protect him , and I had a feeling overcome me that I was a superhero — somebody to help the world !
So I had my brother order a Level 4 fucking vehicle — what the president rides in .
You can shoot it with an AK and it keeps moving .
After he hit a deer , it did n’t even dent the car !
The deer flew way in the air and not even a dent on the paint !
It was a Suburban .
I still got it .
It weighs nine tons .
It ’s parked at my brother ’s house in New Jersey .
And the suit I built but one of my employees sold it to a drug dealer .
Some drug dealer in Brooklyn got it .
That ’s funny !
A $ 20,000 suit — Level 4 bulletproof and knife - proof .
You could n’t stab or shoot me .
Head to toe .
It had a few other toys I do n’t like to talk about .
I do n’t wanna describe it too much — that nigga who got , he got it !
I had a briefcase to go with it as well — to block bullets !
We were just buggin ’ out !
We was getting high , too .
Do n’t get that twisted .
We were partying hard .
There ’s a certain mentality .
When you ’re a kid , you wonder why guys like Bill Gates do n’t spend the money to become Batman for real .
As someone who had the chance , why did n’t you do it ?
I got children of my own , you know what I mean ?
Domestic problems at home .
If you start coming home at night from helping all your fans and people and then you ’ve got problems at the house , that will kill any man ’s spirit .
Say you ’re Bobby Digital , you ’re RZA , and your girl fornicates on you — you feel like shit .
‘ Who the fuck ?
How the fuck ? ’
And say it ’s some nigga who sells weed — ‘ I ’m a millionaire and you ’re fucking with a regular motherfucker ? ’
That takes a lot from your spirit .
That slowed me down , and then the passing of my mother — the two big blows of the year 2000 .
It really kept me back a few years — I had to go and find myself again .
I never told anybody that .
You got an exclusive on that one !
And I think that ’s enough right there .

Just in time for Martin Luther King Day , zombie portrait artist Grayson Castro created this stunningly horrific painting that will probably scare supporters on both sides of the aisle entitled “ Zombie Laureates Earn Their Prize . ”

A teenager was jailed for 20 months today for killing a man with a single punch in an unprovoked attack .
Darryl Church was just 17 years old when he walked up to William McNaught and threw a deadly punch .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The blow twisted Mr McNaught 's neck , rupturing a vital artery and severed the flow of blood to his brain .
The 24 - year - old was unconscious before he hit the ground in Abbeymead Avenue , Abbeymead , Gloucester on 9 May last year .
Church , now aged 18 , of Curlew Close , Abbeymead , was sent to a young offenders ' institution for 20 months after admitting manslaughter at an earlier hearing .
Bristol Crown Court heard today that Church was given a 12 month referral order in April 2008 after being convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm .
He was just 16 when he punched another teenager at a party fracturing his jaw and again rendering him unconscious .
At that time the altercation started with an argument over a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey between the victim and one of Church 's friends .
In a chilling similarity , Mr Justice Burnett said today that the fatal blow to Mr McNaught came after a previous confrontation between Mr McNaught and the same friend .
Mr McNaught had been on a night out with his fiancee Nicole Brown and friends .
He had been drinking heavily , sparking an argument between him and Miss Brown who left him in a nightclub to go home .

Mr McNaught was found to have alcohol levels in his blood that would have been more than three times the legal drink drive limit .
After falling and hitting his head on a fence , Mr McNaught was being driven home by his sister and a friend and asked the driver to pull over when he saw Church and his group of friends drinking on the street .
Mr McNaught did not know Church but wanted to speak to his friend and so got out of the car .
Prosecutor Julian Kesner said that as he approached the group he had his hands by his side in a non-threatening way but was pushed away .
Church then walked over and threw his body weight behind a single punch to the left side of Mr McNaught 's head .
Despite attempts to save his life , Mr McNaught was declared brain dead in hospital the next day and his life support machine was turned off .
In interviews Church at first denied he had hit Mr McNaught but then agreed that he had punched him because he thought " we were in trouble , that he was going to start " .
Mr McNaught 's mother Janet said in a letter written to the court : " William 's death has devastated and broken our hearts .
" I have tried to come to terms with William 's sudden and violent end but I continue to struggle .
" The act that took him from us was so mindless and vicious I can not accept it .
" Darryl Church will have to live with what he did for the rest of his life as will we .
" No amount of time will be paid for what we have lost .
" Darryl Church needs this time to consider his actions and behaviour and to truly understand the consequences of what he did . "
Martin Steen , mitigating , said : " This has been a devastating blow to both families .
" The defendant has asked me to apologise to the family for their tragic loss , if there was anything that he could say or do to put matters right he would take those steps .
" But there is not and he will live with the shame and guilt for the rest of his life . "
Sentencing , Mr Justice Burnett said : " This case demonstrates the inherent danger in punching anyone in the head .
" Often it is the subsequent banging of the head on the ground when someone falls that causes a fatal injury but sometimes , as here , the blow itself causes damage which is fatal .
" You did not intend to cause serious injury but that provides no consolation for Mr McNaught 's family who have described their incomprehension at the mindless and vicious thing you did . "
As the sentence was read out Mr McNaught 's family left the public gallery in tears .
Mr McNaught was living in Kingsholm , Gloucester , at the time of his death but was born in Glasgow where he spent his early childhood before moving to Cheltenham with his parents Alan and Janet .
After their separation he moved back to Glasgow , attending Drumchapel High School , to live with his father until the age of 18 when he went back to Gloucestershire to live with his mother .
He had 14 brothers and sisters and his funeral at Gloucester Cathedral in July was attended by more than 150 people .
I previously mentioned shortcuts to run / debug a class as a Java app / JUnit test .
But have you ever tried to rerun the last application you launched in Eclipse using F11 or the toolbar , only to find out it ’s running the currently active class or selection in Package Explorer ?
Well , that ’s because Eclipse ’s default is to run the selected resource or active editor if it ’s launchable ( eg. if it has a main method or is a JUnit test ) .
Luckily , there is a preference you can change to force Eclipse to always run the last application you launched .
So now you can avoid the confusion and rest assured that it ’ll do what you want it to do .

How to run the last launched application
The answer lies in a preference hidden on the Run / Debug page :
Go to Window > Preferences > Run/Debug >
Launching .
.
Select the option Always launch the previously launched application .
It ’s located at the bottom of the dialog .
The preference should look something like this :
Now you ’re free to press F11 , Ctrl +F11 or click the Run / Debug icons on the toolbar with confidence , knowing it ’s going to run what you expect it to run .
One question arises :
How do you quickly run a class as a specific application ( eg. a JUnit test ) if you ca n’t press F11 to run it ?
You have some options available :
The fastest way is to use keyboard shortcuts .
Eclipse allows you to launch classes using a keystroke , including JUnit tests , Java applications , etc using Alt + Shift+X .
Alternatively , right - click on the class and select Run As .
The submenu will show available options for launching the class .
Lastly , you could click the pulldown arrow on the run / debug icons in the toolbar and select Run As .
The submenu once again shows available options for launching the class .

In the TV show LOST ( of which I ’m a big fan ) Oceanic Flight 815 crashes on a tropical island in the South Pacific .
The survivors soon find themselves cured of chronic illnesses .
They heal quickly from minor accidents .
Even infertility vanishes .
Well , I ’m going to show you why I think “ The Island ’s ” healing powers are n’t all that fantastical at all .
Plus , find out how you can get the same health benefits whether you live in Bermuda or Norway .
First off , let ’s look at Rose Henderson — the African American lady whose cancer disappeared upon arriving on The Island .
She came from Buffalo — which lacks sunlight .
Dark skinned people need more sunshine than whites if they are to produce sufficient vitamin D ( Dr. Roby Mitchell taught me that ! ) .
So when Rose got stranded in the sunny South Pacific , her vitamin D skyrocketed .
Vitamin D has been proven to help your immune system fight off cancer cells big time .
But even if you are as white as a snowman , it ’s still impossible for you to get enough vitamin D from the sun in the winter .
So make sure you are doing one ( or all ) of the following :

Hosting Reviews – Why Use Host Wisely ?
Finding a reliable web host can be one of the most challenging processes .
You not only have to carefully select hosts based off things like their refund policies and uptime guarantees , but also their customer friendliness and the extra services they provide .
That makes this process both risky to your funds and your time , which are two things that you can't waste if you 're one of the countless people who rely upon their website to facilitate business or to establish an income .
Host Wisely offers you an alternative place to learn about every quality of a potential web host .
You 'll learn about uptime guarantees , money - back refund policies , how well a given web host handles customer support , the reliability of hosts , what features that host provides , and everything else you would need to know before committing to any particular host .
Let 's take a quick look at what web hosting is to better understand why reading web hosting reviews is imperative before you try one .
Web Hosting – What Is It , and Why Do You Need It ?
The Internet is an overwhelmingly large network of computers , smart phones and other devices connected to one another .
Websites allow for them devices to have a centralized hub for delivering information , interacting with one another , purchasing products and countless other actions .
Web hosting allows you to rent the hardware and software required to run a web host .
It gives your round - the - clock access to the information you wish to publish , which means that it can be key in facilitating business or simply developing a presence for an idea or a brand .
What you may be surprised to learn is that you could set up your own web host , but chances are that it would be woefully inadequate compared to even the cheapest professional solution .
You would need to build a redundant system , rent a very costly space on a data server and ensure that your host stayed accessible as often as possible .
Web hosts not only take care of these things for you , but they also allow you to do so in a cost - efficient way by taking advantage of the economics of scale .
Renting from a web host tends to be considerably cheaper and easier to maintain due to this .
Now that you understand what web hosting is and why you need it , let 's explore the different types of hosting that most hosts provide .
Shared Hosting
Shared hosting uses one server for many different websites .
While the administration of these websites tends to be separated and there is a layer of protection to keep data protected , the resources are shared by each website as it needs it .
That means that this type of hosting tends to have the lowest entry fee .
You can acquire shared hosting for anywhere from $ 3 to $ 10 a month .
Another quality of shared hosting is the need for service to regularly be reviewed by a support team .
This ensures that one customer is n't using all the resources and that everything continues to operate smoothly .
If one customer does use too many resources , it can negatively affect the performance of other websites on the same machine .
This can lead to unexpected downtime , scripts failing to load and numerous other difficulties .
This is one of the big reasons why finding a reliable host is important .
Shared hosting should be sufficient enough for most individuals and small businesses with a low to moderate amount of traffic .
VPS Hosting
Virtual private machines act much like an intermediate between shared and dedicated hosting .
They are arranged much like shared hosts , but they have significantly more resources and each website is its own instance .
While one website can still negatively affect other websites on the same machine , VPS hosting tends to be more stable due to the fact that each website has a set amount of resources that it can use .
The other major advantage of a VPS hosting plan is the fact that you gain many of the higher level technical commands .
Some VPS hosts allow you to use SSH to login to your web host , which can make administration significantly easier , or to modify your web server 's running environment , which is necessary for some plugins and scripts .
VPS hosting tends to be adequate for medium businesses with moderate to high amounts of traffic and companies interested in light web app development .
Dedicated Hosting
The last major type of hosting is dedicated hosting .
As the name implies , it 's the kind of hosting that dedicates all the resources of any given server to just one website .
You may even find dedicated hosting that dedicates the power of several machines .
Most hosts grant you full access to the server when you employ dedicated hosting .
This allows you to customize it , to tweak it , and to optimize it for your website 's specific needs .
The downside of this incredible amount of customization is that most hosts do not include support with dedicated hosting unless you purchase managed hosting .
This means that you often have to pay an additional fee on top of the fees associated with this robust level of hosting .
Dedicated hosting is designed for large websites and businesses interested in heavy application development .
Hosting for Frameworks
The last major thing to understand about hosting is how frameworks like Drupal , Magento and WordPress fit in to the picture .
These frameworks are designed to make your life easier by giving your website enhanced functionality or by making it easier to administrate your website .
While they tend to be optimized for efficiency , some frameworks require more computing power than others due to the fact that they require accessing fresh copies of dynamic data while supporting a larger amount of users simultaneously .
eCommerce solutions like Magento are an example of this .
Dedicated and VPS hosting align themselves well with the needs of eCommerce frameworks .
Frameworks designed for running static websites or blogs tend to require significantly less power .
Drupal , Joomla and WordPress are examples of frameworks that can be further optimized to use caching , which in turn lowers how much processing power is required to run them .
Shared hosting tends to be sufficient for smaller websites running these frameworks .
VPS hosting will provide the most cost - efficient solution for websites with more traffic and websites that require a more reliable service .

Raising the bar : health care nullification and interposition
December 29 , 2009
That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare , that it views the powers of the federal government , as resulting from the compact , to which the states are parties ; as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting the compact ; as no further valid that they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact ; and that in case of a deliberate , palpable , and dangerous exercise of other powers , not granted by the said compact , the states who are parties thereto , have the right , and are in duty bound , to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil , and for maintaining within their respective limits , the authorities , rights and liberties appertaining to them .
Any act , order , law , statute , regulation or rule restricting the ability of New Hampshire citizens to contract with healthcare professionals or facilities for the provision healthcare services or to contract with corporations providing health insurance authorized by the State of New Hampshire for health insurance is unconstitutional , void and of no force .
Any attempt to enforce such a law is an affront to the Sovereignty of the States and their Citizens .
Any officer , agent , or employee of the United States or employee of any corporation providing services to the United States who prevents , attempts to prevent , interferes with , or withholds medical services from a legal resident or inhabitant of New Hampshire or withholds medicines or medical treatment from a legal resident or inhabitant of New Hampshire based upon a law , statute , regulation or rule of the United States without the consent of the General Court of New Hampshire shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor .
Any officer , agent , or employee of the United States or employee of any corporation providing services to the United States who prevents , attempts to prevent , interferes with , voids or penalties for a contract between a legal resident or inhabitant of New Hampshire and a health insurance provider authorized to business in New Hampshire based upon a law , regulation or rule of the United States without the consent of the General Court of New Hampshire shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor .
By Michael Boldin
When a state ' nullifies ' a federal law or regulation , it is passing legally - binding legislation that makes the federal act in question void and inoperative , or ' non-effective , ' within the boundaries of that state ; or , in other words , not a law as far as the state is concerned .
Current nullification efforts around the U.S. have states passing laws that effectively defy federal laws and regulations on firearms , marijuana , identification cards and more .
In 2010 , we expect to see similar legislation in response to Health Care , No Child Left Behind , Federalization of the Guard and more .
The most asked question is  once such a law is passed , what next ?
In the Virginia Resolution of 1798 , James Madison wrote of the principle of interposition :
Here Madison asserts what is implied in nullification laws  that state governments not only have the right to resist unconstitutional federal acts , but that , in order to protect liberty , they are " duty bound to interpose " or stand between the federal government and the people of the state .
It is on these principles that New Hampshire State Representatives Itse , Ingbretson , Dumaine , Comerford , and Villeneuve have raised the bar for the 10th Amendment Movement with their introduction of House Bill 1648 ( h/t Chris Lawless ) Not only does the bill make restrictions of health care choices unconstitutional , it expressly prohibits interference in these choices by federal agents and requires state agencies to interpose as a protection .
From the text of the legislation :
While many people are calling on State AG's to sue the federal government over the Constitutionality of national health care , many others take the position that going to federal courts in the hope that they 'll limit the power of the federal government is likely a lost cause .
But for those that pursue such court action , the real question remains 
If the " Supremes " rule against the Constitution as they have so many times before , will they give up at that point , or will they follow in the footsteps of medical marijuana activists around the country ?
The latter faced down nearly the entire federal apparatus  federal agencies who did n't recognize state law , countless federal raids and arrests , and a Supreme Court that ruled against their cause in 2005 .
Even with such stacked odds , they persisted in their state - level efforts , and today , enough states have medical marijuana laws that the federal government is unable ( or unwilling ) to oppose them .
With legislation giving support to their cause by requiring state interposition in their defense , will health freedom activists have the same courage ?
Only time will tell . ©

“ Throw in a minute , you ’ll get a throw in a minute ” as we predict right again
So , to start with the important bit – the bit that kept me out all night with Billy the Dog celebrating our massive winnings – 2 - 0 to the Arsenal was the score predicted and 2 - 0 was what we got .
Several bookies ushered us out of their shops and we are having to place bets as far north as Tottenham High Road ( although it is a rather distasteful part of the countryside , and I do with the civil authorities would either clean it up or call in the military ) but we got the bets on and made our fortune .
A billion thanks to Phil Gregory for that prediction , and profound apologies too for not putting Phil ’s name at the top – entirely my error .
And thus on to the game itself .
Watching from the upper tier behind the goal at the north end is a perfect way to understand the Stoke – Delap long throw .
The throw is long and powerful – but comes in two formats – one is the more conventional crescent shape – a gentle arc that goes a long way .
The other comes out almost straight with extraordinary power .
So everyone ’s attention ( including the lino and ref ) is on this unique approach – and not on what happens off the ball .
The plan is simple : one or two players ( not the same one each time ) stand in front of the keeper ( Almunia on this occasion ) and back into him at the exact moment the ball is thrown at speed .
The lino misses it because he is looking along the line to see if the feet of the thrower are in the right place .
The ref misses the hanky - panky because he is watching where the ball gets to .
The throw in comes in , and other Stoke players charge forward .
The keeper is impeded and there is a chance of the ball going in the net because of the melee .
Thus it is not the long throw itself that causes the issues ( although dealing with a ball travelling in a straight line about seven feet off the ground is troublesome , ) but the hidden activity in front of the keeper .
The ref knows as we all know from the game against the KGB , impeding the goal keeper is an offence which should stop play .
But he does n’t see it .
Watch Arsenal Live Streams With StreamFootball.tv
It was alarming that it took some time before Almunia got his defence organised in a way to resist this ploy – putting an Arsenal player between himself and the Stoke players .
It leads to some pushing and shoving and this of course is dangerous in the penalty area .
Who knows which way the ref is going to award the foul ?
But the real trick is for the goalkeeper to stand far forward of where he really wants to be , with the Arsenal player in front of him .
The keeper then backs off to his actual chosen position while our defender blocks the move by the Stoke players .
As a result a lot of the impact is lost .
That was one thing I learned at the game .
But I was also puzzled .
The Stoke keeper Sorensen came out at half time , in the rain .
He did a bit of a warm up and then just stood there , at the end he would be defending , nattering to someone .
So the Stoke subs were right down the other end of the pitch , and Sorensen and pal were just standing there .
Does he do this every game ?
I remember once the Everton keeper walking out half way through half time and sitting down in his goal , leaning up against the post – I think that was a protest against the manager .
He was the famous Everton keeper who is now quite fat – ca n’t remember his name .
Anyway , back to events .
Terrace highlight was some new chanting most of which I am not going to repeat here , but “ Throw in a minute , You ’ll get a throw in a minute , Throw in a minute , You ’ll get a throw in a minute ” did bring a smile to the lips .
( As you will have realised I am a sour faced old bugger and it takes a lot to make me smile ) .
We won something like 10 - 3 in terms of shots on target ( Eboue saved one in the first half ) , and it was a nice game by and large .
Arshavin as a centre forward is fun – simply because just as most defences do n’t know how to deal with a Stoke Delap throw in so I doubt that most will have a clue where Arshavin is , since they will be looking over his head .
( I say this on the basis that he and I share one attribute – we are both 5 feet 8 ) .
But the injuries …
Diaby
Rosicky
Eduardo
Van Persie
Walcott
Djourou
Clichy
Gibbs
Traore
Bendtner
That ’s a fair old team – no keeper out at the moment but I am sure we can injure one soon .
Still at least for this week ’s game we can put out the reserves for a run around .
And in Ramsey we do have one hell of a player .
I have n’t checked this but I think he has played some part in virtually every game – what a hell of a bargain for £ 5 m .
Maybe he ’ll have to be centre forward since we do n’t have any others left .
One final point of detail , before the advert .
Our chosen exit from the ground is over the north bridge , past the Arsenal underground station , and then double back to the station where the police barriers permit .
In case you do n’t know what I am talking about , the point is that the police put up temporary barriers so that you can approach the underground station from two sides in ordered queues , and to get to one of them you have to walk past the entrance and back .
Where the barrier gap is , is decided by the police .
Yesterday they decided to put the barrier gap exactly where the road had flooded through the heavy rain .
So to get into the queue you had to either take a flying leap ( undiginified in a gent of my advanced years ) or wade through the water .
Why ca n’t the Met employ intelligence officers to look out for things like that ?
( Sorry dumb question )
That ’s it .
500 games of Wenger ( brilliant piece by him about the English fanatical love of the ceremony while totally forgetting the essence of the meaning behind it ) , 100 games at the Ems , and 100 years since our first game over Tottenham Hotspur .
All in one week .
Not bad eh ?

" I 've flown in fighter jets with the Red Arrows and been bounced around in super - quick powerboats but nothing compares to the experience of sitting alongside Colin .
It was truly awesome and in all honesty I have to confess the experience was better than sex .
I have never felt so invigorated in my life . "
-- Eddie Irvine - 2002 .
Talking after a run with Colin McRae in his Ford Focus WRC car .
In 1457 , the inhabitants of a small French town witnessed a gruesome murder of a little boy .
The perpetrator , a female , snuck into the house while the child ’s mother was out and mutilated the little boy while he lay in bed .
The townsfolk found the perpetrator covered in blood and placed her on trial .
They found her guilty and then she was hung by an executioner .
This story may not seem surprising — a murder followed by trial and — but what distinguishes it is that the perpetrator was not a human but a pig .
And that the townsfolk pressed criminal charges instead of making bacon suggests that they were n't just looking to end a threat , but to find someone to blame .
Though we may scoff at the foolishness of French peasants , recent research suggests that when bad things happen , people universally look for something to someone to blame .
And when people can't hold livestock accountable , they often find another , more powerful agent - God .
Scholars have proposed numerous reasons why many people believe in God : Shielding us from the , explaining celestial motions , or even making us moral .
New research coming out of our lab , however , suggests that what compels us to believe in God is n’t a desire to explain unexplainable events per se , but unexplainable moral events .
There is something special about receiving harms or help that lead us to see a higher purpose .
So , when a tree falls in the forest without explanation we might shrug it off , but when that tree fall on our brother , we ask God “ Why ? ! ”
In one study , we described a scenario in which a family went for a picnic in the bottom of a ravine .
Mid -way through the picnic , water suddenly rushes through the gorge ; half of participants read that the cause was unexplained or that it was due to an evil dam worker upstream .
These two conditions were crossed with another manipulation , which told readers that the family either escaped with soggy sandwiches or perished in the flood .
Only in the case where the cause was unexplained and the family died , did people think that God had a hand .
This suggests that people believe in God most strongly for suffering , rather than salvation .
For though we may thank God for good things , it ’s the things that go wrong that we really ponder over .
It is when we ’re victims of disease or misfortune that we really search for someone to blame for our woes .
Nowhere is this more apparent than after Hurricane Katrina , when leaders across the country suggested that God sent the storm to punish people for their evil ways .
This idea that suffering leads to belief in God was further confirmed in a study that looked at religious belief and suffering on a state by state basis .
Those states that had a higher “ suffering index , ” a composite death rate , disease rate , and rate also believed more in God .
Of course , questions of religious belief are complex , but this suggests that the more you suffer , the more power you ascribe to the Almighty .
SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - A Chinese woman is seeking extensive plastic surgery to look like U.S. actress Jessica Alba , mainly because she hopes to win back her boyfriend who she said always wished she looked more like the Hollywood star .
Xiaoqing gives an interview to Reuters in the Time Plastic surgery clinic in Shanghai February 4 , 2010 .
The 21 - year - old , who would only give her name as Xiaoqing , is seeking extensive plastic surgery to look like U.S. actress Jessica Alba , mainly because she hopes to win back her boyfriend who she said always wished she looked more like the Hollywood star .
The hospital has agreed to do it for free to showcase their surgery skills .
REUTERS / Nir Elias
The 21 - year - old , who would only give her name as Xiaoqing , said she was devastated after she broke up with her lover , an ardent fan of the actress who has starred in hit movies such as “ Fantastic Four ” and “ Into the Blue . ”
Xiaoqing , who works at an Internet firm in Shanghai , said that during their 18 - month - long relationship , her 28 - year - old boyfriend had been obsessed with Alba , adorning their apartment with her photographs and talking about her constantly .
She said that while her boyfriend had not forced her to look like Alba , he always hinted that the wanted her to resemble his favorite star and even bought her a blonde wig to wear .
A month ago , Xiaoqing left her boyfriend , whom she did not name , because his Alba obsession became too much for her .
But now she says she ca n’t get over the break - up and wants him back .
“ When I broke up with my boyfriend , I was very sad , ” she told Reuters at the Shanghai Time Plastic Surgery Hospital which has agreed to help her fulfill her wish .
“ My friends ... kept consoling me but it did not work , so they suggested I do plastic surgery to look like her ( Jessica Alba ) . ”
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The hospital said Xiaoqing would need multiple surgeries to alter her eyes and nose so that they would resemble Alba’s .
They also agreed to do it for free to showcase their surgery skills .
Hospital director Jiang Shan said he had personally spoken to Xiaoqing and advised her to think seriously about the procedure .
“ If she wants to look much better than she does now , for example if she wants her skin to look smoother and her overall facial facade to look more beautiful , I think we are able to help her fulfill her wishes , ” Jiang said .
“ But if she wants to totally look like Jessica Alba , I would think she is still not confident of herself and that she needs to solve this problem psychologically . ”
Shortly after the break - up , Xiaoqing posted a comment on a local web forum asking for help to win her boyfriend back .
She said that despite the many bloggers who advised her against having cosmetic surgery , she was keen on it .
“ As a member of the younger generation in this country , I have a choice to decide what I want in life , ” she said .
“ I have never been able to let him go .
If in the end he still does not accept me after I undergo the plastic surgeries , I will give up .
I will then choose to let go , start afresh and live life by myself , ” she added .
Xiaoqing said she would speak to her mother , who lives in Hubei province , while visiting home during the annual lunar new year holiday before making a final decision .
The hospital said it was not unusual for young women such as Xiaoqing to undergo cosmetic surgery to look like celebrities .
The government estimates billions of yuan are spent each year by Chinese on plastic surgery , which is seen by many as a way to boost job or marriage prospects in a highly competitive society .
Red Bull designer and top F1 aerodynamicist Adrian Newey believes the proposed ban on double diffusers in 2011 wo n’t make it easier for F1 cars to overtake .
Speaking at the Watkins Lecture at Autosport International he said :
I do n’t think [ double diffusers ] affected the overtaking .
It gave us more downforce and made the cars about a second a lap quicker .
That does n’t change whether the car ’s going to overtake or not , there ’s no difference in the aerodynamic wake which is what affects the ability of the car behind to overtake .
Adrian Newey
He said F1 should not slip back into the practice of introducing piecemeal changes to the regulations as it had during the “ narrow track ” era of 1998 - 2008 :
The regulations we had for 2009 were the subject of a lot of research by the Overtaking Working Group .
It ’s questionable whether they worked or not , but the process , I think , was correct .
What ’s now happening is we ’ve gone back to these piecemeal modifications – banning double diffusers or getting rid of barge boards .
For me , it ’s very frustrating that it ’s not being thought out .
[ It needs ] a clear goal and proper research .
So often in Formula 1 , things are changed with very little research .
Adrian Newey
He echoed the view of Sam Michaels and Paddy Lowe that the role of circuit design needs to be looked at .
Newey has similar concerns about the ban on refuelling during races :
I think the ban on refuelling is another example of that where … maybe it will be good for the racing , but it was not thought out .
Some people thought “ we could save a ?�?
�100,000 here by cutting the cost of flying the refuelling rigs around the world .
But if that destroys the spectacle and the racing becomes more boring as a result of that and people start turning their televisions off , then that was n’t ?�? �100,000 well saved .

THE NAGAS ; AN INTRODUCTION
The recording of tribal civilisations ; the Nagas .
There are four major types of human society : hunting and gathering , tribal , peasant and industrial .
For most of human history , hunting and tribal societies were the only ones in existence .
Today very few such societies remain ; most have been totally destroyed during the last hundred years .
The recording and understanding of these alternative social systems are important as a corrective to the assumptions of our industrial society .
The destruction of such societies has been so rapid that little has been salvaged , and the few records that survive are rapidly dwindling : the photographs and manuscripts are deteriorating and those with personal experience are now elderly .
This videodisc seeks to develop one way to reconstruct and preserve some of these precious records and to make them available for present and future generations .
One of the few areas in the world where acute observers have documented , over a period of more than a hundred years , the workings of an assembly of tribal societies is on the north - eastern frontier of India .
These involve the British contacts with the so - called Naga tribes of the Assam - Burma border .
In many ways the Nagas , who numbered about half a million people at any one point in the period covered by this videodisc , are representative of the forest dwelling tribesmen who once inhabited large areas of South - east Asia , the Pacific , South America and Central Africa .
A combination of circumstances has given us a particularly rich record of Naga culture .
Firstly , the precipitous mountains and thick forest , as well as the warlike head - hunting reputation of the peoples deterred outsiders from entering the area until very late .
The period of contact , starting effectively in the 184Os , was unusually gradual , lasting over a century until Indian Independence in 1947 .
It was only with the Second World War and the combined influence of missions , education and economic growth that the situation changed profoundly .
Little research has been possible in Nagaland since 1947 , and the bulk of the material on the present videodisc therefore relates to the period up to that date .
Thus we have for the Nagas a series of historical records spread over a century , each analysing aspects of a set of tribal societies sufficiently isolated to maintain much of their ancient social systems , yet with a loose attachment to the British Empire .
This encouraged outsiders to try to understand the traditional ways of life in order to administer and adjudicate the expanding Empire in the north - east .
The relative lateness of the contact means that the second fifty years of documentation were within the era of photography and the last few years within that of the moving film .
The involved interest of the District Officers as collectors and analysts ensured the survival of large numbers of artefacts .
All this provided the context which made study and recording possible , but only good fortune brought to the Naga Hills a series of very gifted observers .
These men and women became so involved with the Nagas that they assembled large collections of all kinds of material despite linguistic and practical difficulties .
Although we are forced to look at the Nagas through alien and outsiders ' eyes , over the shoulders of the observers , there is enough material to glimpse a world that has now practically vanished .
Here we will try to provide a very brief description of a few of the outstanding features of Naga society as they described it .
A few of the central features of Naga society .
A number of features made the Nagas particularly interesting to European observers .
There was first their mysterious history .
First mentioned by Ptolemy in about 15O A.D. , it was clear that the Naga tribes had only coalesced recently in the patterns which the British discovered .
After millennia of wandering , a number of different ethnic groups had ended up in the hills of the Eastern Himalayas .
Strange coincidences of culture and language through the Pacific led some scholars to suggest that the Nagas were an off - shoot of groups which had originally descended from the central Asian plateau .
Their burial customs , ornamentation , agricultural practices and even games and crafts , linked them strongly to the tribal peoples of Borneo and the Philippines .
Here was a culture which might provide clues to some of the great migrations in human history .
Equally intriguing was their contemporary material culture .
Like many tribal groups who practice the labour - efficient methods of swidden ( slash and burn ) cultivation of rice , the Nagas had a great deal of leisure , and large surpluses of grain .
They used this to develop an elaborate and beautiful world in the forests .
They were expert craftsmen and artists , making their social and cultural patterns explicit through ornamentation and display .
Through colour and pattern in their material culture the Nagas revealed their social and ritual status .
From the earliest period of contact , visitors were struck by the Nagas ' carved and thatched houses , woven cloths and wooden carvings , distinctive hairstyles and body tattoos , and their songs and dances .
European attitudes were more mixed about other aspects of Naga society .
Nakedness , youth dormitories and a relaxed attitude to sexual experimentation aroused more ambivalent reactions .
Yet by the turn of the century their uninhibited way of life , their physical attractiveness , and their personal loyalty and frankness , had won the hearts of many observers and administrators .
It had not always been thus .
The antipathy of the Nagas to the colonial expansion of the British resulted in an Angami Naga rebellion in 1878 .
The suppression of this revolt was followed by the expansion of the ' administered areas ' ( where Nagas paid taxes and supplied labour ) in the 2Oth century .
But the development of British ' indirect rule ' and its pragmatic tolerance perhaps explains why by 1944 many Nagas opted to help the British in repelling the Japanese advance into India .
Other features of Naga society also attracted attention , including their political systems ranging from autocratic chiefs to almost pure democracy in neighbouring tribes , and their ecological adaptation to a harsh terrain .
In the elaborate terraced rice cultivation of the Angami Nagas and the shifting cultivation of most of the other Naga tribes , it was possible to see traditional systems of agriculture in undisturbed operation .
One had some picture of how men must have lived in forests over hundreds of thousands of years .
Each stage of the agricultural operation and its close interweaving with ritual and taboo was noted by the observers .
Two outstanding features of the varied cultures particularly drew attention , the Naga concern with death and with the human skull .
Although exuberantly alive , what gave real meaning to Naga society was death and the manner of dying .
Despite the absence of written records , through myth and particularly in material memorials , the names and deeds of ancestors were to be remembered .
Most dramatically , this was done through the erection of massive stones , dragged by teams of villagers through the jungle and erected as the culmination of grand ' feasts of merit ' to celebrate the power and deeds of great men .
The world which was only vaguely remembered in the standing stones of Europe or the Pacific was still alive among the Nagas .
All of Naga life had its ritual aspect : all activities , from simple household and economic tasks up to dancing and feasting , had a mystical or religious significance .
The spirits which controlled the realities of Naga life , disease , human and crop fertility , rain , needed constant attention .
The human head , the seat of wisdom and the human soul , was the repository and conductor of power .
This was true , irrespective of whether the head was that of a child , a man , a woman , alive or dead .
He who owned another 's head gained prosperity in this world , the esteem of his fellows , and a guaranteed happiness in the after - world .
The best way to own a head was to take one by force .
Forest tribal peoples , for instance the peoples of New Guinea or the Amazon , are often very war - like .
To seize the wealth and labour of other groups is a more congenial way to affluence and power than by hard work in agriculture .
There is no political organisation above the level of the clan or village to prevent war .
In this world of a war of all against all , the Nagas added the ritual importance of head - hunting .
Life was given its central purpose by the quest for heads .
Boys would not become men without the ritual tattooing only to be undertaken after a successful head - hunt ; girls would not be attracted to men without the splendid head - hunting dances and decorations .
Success and merit in every field depended on heads .
This presented administrators and anthropologists with one of their major challenges .
By the turn of the century , they were well aware of the logic of the system and could recognise that if head - hunting were rapidly abolished ( as it had been in other parts of the Empire ) it would be the equivalent of destroying money , markets and the profit motive in a capitalist society .
There would be little point to life any more .
Yet the western conscience could not condone the cruelty , nor was the ' pax Britannica ' very plausible in a world of almost ceaseless feuding .
So the observers tried to study , modify and re-shape the institution , while the Nagas tried to incorporate the observers into their world .
The mutual relations between these strikingly different , yet admiring and basically tolerant points of view , run through the literature .
They pose the broadest questions concerning ethical relativism , the preservation or destruction of alternative modes of thought and deed , the rights to interfere .
These problems were exacerbated by the growing number of Christian missionaries in the hills who were trying to convert the Nagas from their supposedly ' heathen ' religion , morality and social customs .
Out of this conflict of two civilisations based on entirely different premises there came thousands of images and descriptions of the Nagas .
This videodisc gives access to many of those images .
Since Independence in 1947 there have been great changes and only a part of what is represented here has survived .
Google maintains that the ruling contradicted a European Union directive on electronic commerce that gives service providers safe harbor from liability for the content they host .
But prosecutors argued that because Google handled user data — and used content to generate advertising revenue — it was a content provider , not a service provider , and therefore broke Italian privacy law .
It prohibits the use of someone ’s personal data with the intent of harming him or making a profit .
“ To say this is about censorship has a big media effect , but is false , ” said Alfredo Robledo , one of the prosecutors .
“ This is about finding a balance between free enterprise and the protection of human dignity . ”
Still , the upshot of the ruling , if it prevails on appeal , is that Google will be expected in Italy to monitor the content it hosts .
Mr. Echikson , the Google spokesman , said that would be impossible considering that 20 hours of video are uploaded to its site every minute .
The American ambassador to Italy , David Thorne , said he was “ disappointed ” by the ruling .
“ We disagree that Internet service providers are responsible prior to posting for the content uploaded by users , ” he said in a statement , adding that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had said that “ free Internet is an integral human right that must be protected in free societies . ”
Mr. Robledo said that a company like Google could easily find ways to monitor its content , and that it should not profit from advertising revenue generated from content that violated privacy laws .
He said if Google had found a way to create filters in China , it could do the same in Italy , not to monitor political content “ but to protect human dignity . ”
Google disagreed .
“ If company employees like me can be held criminally liable for any video on a hosting platform , when they had absolutely nothing to do with the video in question , then our liability is unlimited , ” said one of the three executives , Mr. Fleischer .
I 'm not interested in talking about Greg Clark or making comparisons to the West ; if need be compare it to other black Caribbean nations , such as Jamaica or Barbados .
It 's much worse and in terms of social indicators it is also worse than many places in Africa .
Why ?
Here a few hypotheses ( NB : I do n't endorse all of them ) :
1. Haiti cut its colonial ties too early , rebelling against the French in the early 19th century and achieving complete independence .
Guadaloupe and Martinique are still riding the gravy train and French aid is a huge chunk of their gdps .
2. Haiti was a French colony in the first place and French colonies do less well .
3. Sugar cane gave Haiti some early characteristics of " the resource curse , " dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries .
4. Haiti was doing OK until the Duvaliers destroyed civil society , thus putting the country on a path toward destruction .
It is a more or less random one - time event which wrecked the place .
5 . Hegel was correct that the " voodoo religion , " with its intransitive power relations among the gods , was prone to producing political intransitivity as well .
( Is n't that a startling insight for a guy who did n't travel the broader world much ? )
6 . For reasons peculiar to the history of the slave trade , Haitian slaves came from many different parts of Africa and thus Haitian internal culture has long had lower levels of cohesion and cooperation .
( The former point about the mix is true , but the cultural point is speculation . )
7. Haiti has higher than average levels of polygamy ( but is this cause or effect ? )
8 . In the early to mid twentieth century , Haiti was poorly situated to attract Chinese and other immigrants , unlike say Jamaica or Trinidad .
It is interesting that many of the wealthiest families in Haiti are Lebanese , such as the Naders .
Overall I do n't find this set of possible factors very satisfactory .
Is it asking too much to wish for an economics profession that is obsessed with such a question ?
If you are looking for some cross-sectional variation to ponder , consider the fate of Haitians in Suriname ( they make up a big chunk of the population there ) , Haiti vs. Santiago , Cuba , pre-Castro of course , or why early Haitian migrants to Montreal have done better than later migrants to Miami and Brooklyn .
I 've played with finance .
yahoo. com 's feed of CSV stock ticker data before and recently had an idea that was so simple that I 'm surprised that no one 's done it before : why not write a script that passes along a request for this data but converts the result to RDF before returning it ?
So I did .
I supposed it might count as a semantic web service .
A URL like http://www.rdfdata.org/cgi/stockquotes.cgi?symbols=BUD,IBM,SNE asks for recent ticker information about the stock symbols listed in the comma-separated value list .
The stockquotes.cgi script adds the parameters to the appropriate stub to create a URL like http://download.finance.yahoo.com/d/quotes.csv?f=sl1d1t1ohgv&e=.csv&s=BUD,IBM,SNE, uses this URL to retrieve the CSV results , converts them to RDF / XML , and sends that back to the original requester with a MIME type of application / rdf+xml .
The whole script , with white space and comments , was n't even 100 lines .
You can click the first link in this paragraph to see an example of it in action .
I have n't done anything with the rdfdata.org domain name in a while , so I thought that would be a nice place for this .
I 've already used this little web service in a work - related demo that combines and cross-references RDF data from multiple sources , because after all , that 's one of the things that RDF is so good at .
Is this a " semantic web service " ?
All it does is convert the data returned by a Yahoo feed into a different syntax and pass it along .
I did throw together a little ontology to name the properties , but it does n't add a lot of semantics .
On the other hand , my script 's output syntax is based on a semantic web standard , and it makes the data easier to use in semantic web applications , so I suppose it might count as a semantic web service .
I hope this is useful to others , and I hope that more people look for opportunities to convert live feeds of useful data in simple formats into live feeds of RDF .
A diplomatic offensive against Britain 's oil exploration off the Falkland Islands intensified today as Argentina prepared to stake its case to the head of the UN backed by regional allies including Brazil .
The Argentinian president , Cristina Kirchner , said a summit of 32 countries in Mexico had endorsed a document accusing Britain of flouting international law by permitting drilling to begin this week .
The Rio Group summit made no immediate official statement , but Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez and Nicaragua 's Daniel Ortega demanded the UK hand back the Falklands to Buenos Aires .
The Argentinian foreign minister , Jorge Taiana , is due to meet the UN secretary - general , Ban Ki-moon , in New York today .
The UN has called for talks between Britain and Argentina but has little power to intervene without the backing of the security council , where the UK can veto substantive resolutions .
The sovereignty standoff flared this month over the arrival of a rig , the Ocean Guardian , which is to drill offshore for oil and gas deposits .
Last night , Brazil 's president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , criticised the UN for not pushing more forcefully to reopen the debate over the islands , which Argentinians call Las Malvinas .
" What is the geographic , the political or economic explanation for the UK to be in Las Malvinas ? " he asked .
" Could it be because the UK is a permanent member of the UN 's security council where they can do everything and the others nothing ? "
Today 's
Times newspaper said a resolution was set to be tabled in the UN general assembly condemning Britain for allowing the owner of the British rig , Desire Petroleum , to begin drilling 60 miles north of the islands after Argentina announced new shipping controls .
The defence minister , Bill Rammell , said the government would take " whatever steps are necessary " to protect the islands , which had a " legitimate right " to develop an oil industry within their waters .
At the Rio Group summit , Argentina presented a statement quoting the Mexican president , Felipe Calderón , as saying that " the heads of state represented here reaffirm their support for the legitimate rights of the republic of Argentina in the sovereignty dispute with Great Britain " .
Kirchner ruled out any plans to try to keep the British boats or rigs out .
" We do not believe in methods like blockades , " she told reporters .
But in her speech at the summit she reiterated Argentina 's claim to the islands and blamed the Foreign Office for fanning tensions .
" When in these last few days England decided to install an oil rig offshore and Argentina – in exercise of its domestic law – made decisions as a sovereign state , the Foreign Office floated the idea of a potential war threat by Argentina .
" I would say that is ridiculous , cynical , because few countries have shown more signs of peaceful intentions than Argentina after the advent of democracy , " she said according to an English translation of her speech posted on the presidency 's website .
Jan Cheek , a member of the Falklands legislative assembly , said she was " not surprised " by the Latin American countries ' statement , as they had historically tended to back Argentina in the dispute .
She said on BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : " Argentina does regularly take this issue to the UN but it has very little effect on us , mainly because what they are seeking is to make us a colony of Argentina while we have freely chosen , through self - determination , to be an overseas territory of the UK . "
Analysts said Buenos Aires scored a diplomatic victory in mustering regional solidarity but that the practical effects were negligible .

US President Barack Obama has expressed his support for Tibetan rights in talks held at the White House with the Dalai Lama despite objections from China .
The meeting comes amid tension in US - Sino relations , with disputes simmering over US arms sales to Taiwan , claims of Chinese cyber - spying and trade deals .
China , which views the Dalai Lama as a separatist , said the meeting was a " violation of US policy on Tibet " .
The US downplayed China 's concerns but kept the meeting low key .
The closed talks were held at the White House 's Map Room instead of the more official Oval Office , in an attempt to signal to China that it was a private , not a political meeting .
' Champion of democracy '
Afterwards , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the president expressed his " strong support " for Tibetan identity and the protection of Tibetans ' human rights in China .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
The real test of US - China relations will not be the Dalai Lama but what happens on sanctions against Iran
Read Mark 's thoughts in full Mr Obama praised the Dalai Lama 's commitment to nonviolence and " his pursuit of dialogue with the Chinese government , " the spokesman said .
Despite American attempts to keep the visit low profile , the Dalai Lama spoke to reporters immediately outside the West Wing of the White House in comments that were broadcast live on international television .
He said he told Mr Obama of his admiration for the US as a " champion of democracy , freedom , human values " and creativity .
The White House had defended the decision to receive the Dalai Lama , saying he was " an internationally respected religious leader " .
Mr Obama avoided meeting the Dalai Lama in Washington last year ahead of his own first state visit to Beijing .
US - CHINA TENSIONS
Google - China denies being behind an alleged cyber attack on the US search engine Taiwan - a US sale of $ 6.4bn ( £ 4bn ) of defensive arms to Taiwan has angered Beijing Tibet - China says a US meeting with the Dalai Lama would " undermine relations "
Trade - rows over imports and exports of meat , media , car tyres and raw materials Iran - the US fears China will not back tougher sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear programme Climate - the US is disappointed at China 's tough position at the Copenhagen Summit
Flip - flop diplomacy
The US - China power balance Your views on the meeting China 's foreign ministry quickly condemned the meeting .
Spokesman Ma Zhaoxu was quoted by Xinhua news agency as saying : " The US act grossly violated the norms governing international relations .
" It also went against the repeated commitments by the US government that the US recognises Tibet as part of China and gives no support to ' Tibet independence ' . "
The foreign ministry had warned the US to call off the Dalai Lama 's visit to " avoid any more damage to Sino - US relations " .
It said it now expected Mr Obama to take steps to put relations back on track .
China , which sent troops into Tibet in 1950 but has long claimed it as its own , considers the Dalai Lama a separatist .
Beijing tries to isolate the spiritual leader by asking foreign leaders not to see him .
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule and has since been living in India .
Relations between the US and China have become frayed in recent months with US arms sales to Taiwan , a row over internet censorship and US criticisms that China holds its currency artificially weak to boost its exports .
The Dalia Lama has met every sitting US president since 1991 , with each visit drawing Chinese ire .
But George W Bush 's meeting with the Dalai Lama in 2007 was the first time a sitting US president had appeared in public with the exiled Tibetan leader .

Can you direct me to reception , please ?
WHEN America 's space agency , NASA , announced its spending plans in February , some people worried that its cancellation of the Constellation moon programme had ended any hopes of Americans returning to the Earth 's rocky satellite .
The next footprints on the lunar regolith were therefore thought likely to be Chinese .
Now , though , the private sector is arguing that the new spending plan actually makes it more likely America will return to the moon .
The new plan encourages firms to compete to provide transport to low Earth orbit ( LEO ) .
The budget proposes $ 6 billion over five years to spur the development of commercial crew and cargo services to the international space station .
This money will be spent on “ man-rating ” existing rockets , such as Boeing 's Atlas V , and on developing new spacecraft that could be launched on many different rockets .
The point of all this activity is to create healthy private - sector competition for transport to the space station — and in doing so to drive down the cost of getting into space .
Eric Anderson , the boss of a space - travel company called Space Adventures , is optimistic about the changes .
They will , he says , build “ railroads into space ” .
Space Adventures has already sent seven people to the space station , using Russian rockets .
It would certainly benefit from a new generation of cheap launchers .
Another potential beneficiary — and advocate of private - sector transport — is Robert Bigelow , a wealthy entrepreneur who founded a hotel chain called Budget Suites of America .
Mr Bigelow has so far spent $ 180 m of his own money on space development — probably more than any other individual in history .
He has been developing so - called expandable space habitats , a technology he bought from NASA a number of years ago .
These habitats , which are folded up for launch and then inflated in space , were designed as interplanetary vehicles for a trip to Mars , but they are also likely to be useful general - purpose accommodation .
The company already has two scaled - down versions in orbit .
Mr Bigelow is preparing to build a space station that will offer cheap access to space to other governments — something he believes will generate a lot of interest .
The current plan is to launch the first full - scale habitat ( called Sundancer ) in 2014 .
Further modules will be added to this over the course of a year , and the result will be a space station with more usable volume than the existing international one .
Mr Bigelow 's price is just under $ 23 m per astronaut .
That is about half what Russia charges for a trip to the international station , a price that is likely to go up after the space shuttle retires later this year .
He says he will be able to offer this price by bulk - buying launches on newly man-rated rockets .
Since most of the cost of space travel is the launch , the price might come down even more if the private sector can lower the costs of getting into orbit .
The ultimate aim of all his investment , Mr Bigelow says , is to get to the moon .
LEO is merely his proving ground .
He says that if the technology does work in orbit , the habitats will be ideal for building bases on the moon .
To go there , however , he will have to prove that the expandable habitat does indeed work , and also generate substantial returns on his investment in LEO , to provide the necessary cash .
If all goes well , the next target will be L1 , the point 85 % of the way to the moon where the gravitational pulls of moon and Earth balance .
“ It 's a terrific dumping off point , ” he says .
“ We could transport a completed lunar base [ to L1 ] and put it down on the lunar surface intact . ”
There are others with lunar ambitions , too .
Some 20 teams are competing for the Google Lunar X Prize , a purse of $ 30 m that will be given to the first private mission which lands a robot on the moon , travels across the surface and sends pictures back to Earth .
Space Adventures , meanwhile , is in discussions with almost a dozen potential clients about a circumlunar mission , costing $ 100 m a head .
The original Apollo project was mainly a race to prove the superiority of American capitalism over Soviet communism .
Capitalism won — but at the cost of creating , in NASA , one of the largest bureaucracies in American history .
If the United States is to return to the moon , it needs to do so in a way that is demonstrably superior to the first trip — for example , being led by business rather than government .
Engaging in another government - driven spending battle , this time with the Chinese , will do nothing more than show that America has missed the point .
It is characteristic of Google ’s approach to relationships , one senior phone exec told me this week : " They do n’t know what hurt they ’re doing , and they do n’t care . "
It ’s nothing personal , guys .
Today , some of the biggest tech companies in the world , who thought they were Google ’s closest partners , will begin to understand how , say , copyright holders have felt for some time now .
For the first time , I suspect , they ’ll be enjoying that recurring tingle of amazement and disbelief that ( as Chris Castle explained here ) , Google would even try and pull off such a stunt .
It took EMI Publishing six months to realise that Google had claimed digital rights to its songs , for example .
But even if the decision to shaft its closest Android partners and biggest customers is an aberration , a one - off , a fling that Google will later regret - then the size of the parties involved means it ’s going to have lasting repercussions .
Even before Google started competing with it head on this week , the mobile industry was already wary of the Mountain View Chocolate Factory , and its inclination to hoover up every morsel of service revenue .
Now complaining about that may be a bit hypocritical , you might think , if you look at how much of a transaction operators such as Docomo have traditionally retained , and how much they want to keep now .
But look at the alternative , Google told the networks and device makers .
That Mr Jobs does n’t leave anything on the table .
And besides , we Do No Evil .
Wakey wakey , networks
If you ’re scratching your head wondering what the big deal is , then I suggest you do a quick news search on the number of stories containing the phrase ‘ Google superphone ’ .
Imagine how this looks to a punter .
There are over a dozen Google phones .
Only one is a real Google phone .
Only one is a Google superphone .
And you can only get that from Google .
Wo n’t Sony Ericsson , Motorola , Acer and Samsung be feeling pleased today ?
Sony Ericsson ’s X10 has a fairly identical spec ( plus Sony branding ) or better – but it ’s not a ‘ superphone ’ .
And not the ‘ real thing ’ .
If you thought there was a level playing field , you ’ve been mugged .
If you ’re looking for a differentiator , similarly , you ’ve been mugged .
As we discussed earlier , there may be some semantic wiggle room for Google – but it ’s a Bill Clinton defence .
Andy Rubin not only questioned the definition of sexual relations but also what ‘ make our own hardware ’ means ( phnarr ! ) .
Maybe even what ‘ is ’ is .
So despite nods and winks to the contrary , Google is now selling a Google - branded ‘ superphone ’ , alongside its Google ad programs and Google - created software platform .
This is no surprise .
If networks are surprised that Google can turn around and shaft them – then they can’t have been paying close attention to company strategy in recent times .
They certainly were n’t reading El Reg , where we ’ve been joining the dots for you for years .
The evidence was already abundant that Google envisaged a value chain without operators or ISPs .
In Google ’s vision of the future , there are no $ 80 bn - a- year turnover giants like Vodafone .
Instead , masts are merely a dumb transmission network , most likely operated by a monopoly incumbent ( such as Arqiva for UK TV and radio ) , which must be regulated ( out of necessity ) by an equally dumb transmission network regulator .
With the value of copyright also reduced to zero , ( the other arm of Google ’s mighty lobbying effort is to kneecap creators and rightsholders , ) then the only internet company that could possibly make money would be Google - since it would be the only internet company .
Good , honest lobbying
Google has lobbied for this for years now ; it 's also why Google has its own private internet .
Googlenet already carries 10 per cent of the net ’s traffic internally , and this is a testbed for replacements for the open protocols we use today such as http and dns .
And it sure as hell is n’t neutral .
Google has no obligation to open this to anybody else .
The huge data centres are simply the physical manifestation of the private internet – like the vast ventilation towers at each end of the Holland or Rotherhithe Blackwall Tunnels .

The British Library has unveiled a new automated storage facility and the BBC's Phil Bodmer has been given a look around .
Much of the sorting and carrying at the futuristic £ 26 million building at Boston Spa in West Yorkshire is carried out by robots .
The additional storage building will eventually house approximately seven million items from the UK national collection .
The world is facing ecological bankruptcy , the report warns Continuing global economic growth " is not possible " if nations are to tackle climate change , a report by an environmental think - tank has warned .
The New Economics Foundation ( Nef ) said " unprecedented and probably impossible " carbon reductions would be needed to hold temperature rises below 2C ( 3.6 F ) .
Scientists say exceeding this limit could lead to dangerous global warming .
" We urgently need to change our economy to live within its environmental budget , " said Nef 's policy director .
Andrew Simms added : " There is no global , environmental central bank to bail us out if we become ecologically bankrupt . "
None of the existing models or policies could " square the circle " of economic growth with climate safety , Nef added .
' No magic bullets '
In the report , Growth Is n't Possible , the authors looked at the main models for climate change and energy use in the global economy .
Magic bullets - such as carbon capture and storage , nuclear or even geo-engineering - are potentially dangerous distractions
Dr Victoria Johnson ,
Report 's co-author
They then considered whether economic growth could be maintained while " retaining a good likelihood " of limiting the global average temperature to within 2C of pre-industrial levels .
The report concluded that a growth rate of just 3 % , the " carbon intensity " of the global economy would need to fall by 95 % by 2050 from 2002 levels .
This would require an average annual reduction of 6.5 % .
However , the authors said that the world 's carbon intensity had " flatlined " between 2000 and 2007 .
" For each year the target was missed , the necessary improvements would grow higher still , " they observed .
The findings also suggested that there was no proven technological advance that would allow " business as usual " to continue .
" Magic bullets - such as carbon capture and storage , nuclear or even geo-engineering - are potentially dangerous distractions from more human - scale solutions , " said co-author Victoria Johnson , Nef 's lead researcher for the climate change and energy programme .
She added that there was growing support for community - scale projects , such as decentralised energy systems , but support from governments was needed .
" At the moment , magic bullets ... are getting much of the funding and political attention , but are missing the targets , " Dr Johnson said .
" Our research shows that to prevent runaway climate change , this needs to change . "
The report concluded that an economy that respected environmental thresholds , which include biodiversity and the finite availability of natural resources , would be better placed to deliver human well - being in the long run .
Tom Clougherty , executive director of the Adam Smith Institute , a free - market think - thank , said Nef 's report exhibited " a complete lack of understanding of economics and , indeed , human development " .
" It is precisely this economic growth which will lift the poor out of poverty and improve the environmental standards that really matter to people - like clean air and water - in the process , as it has done throughout human history , " he told BBC News .
" There 's only one good thing I can say for the Nef 's report , and that 's that it is honest .
Its authors admit that they want us to be poorer and to lead more restricted lives for the sake of their faddish beliefs . "

Do you know what 's lurking in your garden pond ?
OK , so it may well be frozen over right now , but have a look at the pictures above .
See anything familiar ?
Although I think I could just about identify parrot 's feather , having spent ages fishing it out of my own pond , but I would n't have had a clue about the others .
The government 's new Be Plant Wise campaign ( or scotland.gov.uk / beplantwise if you 're in Scotland ) is warning that five non-native aquatic bullies - floating pennywort , New Zealand pigmyweed , water - primrose , parrot 's feather and water fern – are invading British waterways , wiping out native species and disrupting water sports and boating .
Water pennywort is choking Britain 's waterways .
Photograph : Getty
According to the charity Pond Conservation , two thirds of our garden ponds are harbouring one or more of these species ( In wild ponds the figure drops to one in 10 . )
They can grow at a prodigious rate , too floating pennywort can grow up to 20 cm a day in the wild and water primrose can double in size every 15 - 20 days , choking patches of water and crowding out native species .
For instance , an infestation of New Zealand pigmyweed at the National Trust - owned Horsepond in Corfe Castle , Dorset is blamed for the loss of the great crested newt in that area .
Another perhaps less obvious peril is that a thick mat of pennywort or water primrose on the surface of a pond can look like a solid surface to livestock ( and your own children , come to that ) .
Even if your pond 's in glorious isolation in your back garden miles from the nearest waterway , there are many ways these pernicious little devils can spread , particularly if you dispose of plants and pond or fish tank water carelessly .
If you want to eradicate non-native plants from your plant , the compost heap seems the obvious place , but you need to make sure that the plant is absolutely dead and no fragments are left to spread themselves about .
With land - based pernicious weeds , I 'd usually recommend immersing them in a bucket of water for several months before composting , but clearly that is n't going to work for aquatic plants .
If you wait until the summer , you could remove the plants and spread them out in the baking sun next to the pond ( hard to imagine right now , I know ) which may also allow any creatures hiding within to escape back into the water , too .
Once dry and dessicated , adding them to the centre of a hot compost heap should finish the job .
I did wonder about adding them to your green waste bin , as municipal - scale composting techniques should kill such plants off with ease but I 'm still trying to find out if that 's permitted – I 'll update this post once I find out .
Update : Jeremy Iles of Pond Conservation who said he does n't see why invasive pond plants should n't be disposed of in municipal compost schemes .
He also poured cold water ( excuse the pun ) on the idea that leaving plant material you fish out on the ground next to your pond will allow creatures to escape back into the water .
Newt larvae , mayflies , caddis and other soft - bodied pond dwellers can't move about on dry land unsupported by water , and even if they could , their habitat wo n't be there any more .
" It 's a kind and sympathetic idea but in reality it 's probably only putting off the inevitable , " he says .
Do you know what plants are growing in your pond ?
What 's the best way of disposing of non-native invasive species like the water primrose ?

Homosexual bait and switch is a technique used by covert homosexuals in order to convert heterosexuals to homosexuality , or at least , question their heterosexuality .
Covert homosexuals will heavily alter their personal appearance in order to disguise their gender .
These covert homosexuals will enter " meaningful " relationships with heterosexuals of the same sex without ever disclosing their own true gender .
These homosexuals do a convincing job by utilizing deceit and powerful mind - control techniques .
Only when the victim thinks they are in love does the covert homosexual reveal their true identity .
At this point , the victim is too emotionally attached to the homosexual to leave them , giving the homosexual the upper -hand .
Coercion into a counterfeit same - sex marriage is not uncommon .
Even victims that somehow escape a homosexual 's grasp usually go through withdrawal which causes some to suffer a homosexual relapse .
The term homosexual bait and switch can also be used to describe other things ; such as J.K.
Rowling retroactively stating that a popular character , Dumbledore , from the Harry Potter series is homosexual .
More than 5 m British households have been overcharged by gas suppliers such as E.ON and British Gas to the tune of £ 454 m , according to a new survey .
They are owed an average of £ 89 because many companies have not reduced their direct debit charges after cutting tariffs this year , claims comparison site moneysupermarket.com .
More than four million of the affected households have not asked for their cash back , resulting in £ 363 m being unclaimed .
Almost 2 m other households were in debt to their suppliers by an average of £ 151 – a total of £ 280 m – the survey found .
But that means that overall , suppliers owe British consumers £ 174m .
Scott Byrom , utilities manager at moneysupermarket.com , said : " In 2008 we saw gas giants holding £ 225 m of their customers ' cash ' on float ' and while it is encouraging to see this has decreased by more than £ 50 m this year , there is still cause for concern .
This year bill payers have welcomed price cuts on online energy tariffs across the board ; however it 's unsurprising customers are still finding themselves in credit with their gas supplier , as direct debit arrangements may not have been updated to reflect these price changes . "
Trade group the Energy Retail Association said that it was normal for consumers to be in credit towards the end of the summer , when they had used less energy .
It said : " This research is misleading as it does n't reflect the fact that people use different amounts of energy at different times of the year .
So it is common for customers to be in credit towards the end of the summer , when they have used less energy , and then to owe their energy company money during the winter months when they have the heating on and use more energy .
" People like being able to choose how they pay and a regular direct debit payment keeps bills relatively stable over the course of the year and helps people to budget .
Customers can of course at any time request a refund or pay off any money they owe . "
ASH in UK Comes Clean on E - Cigarette Health Debate
COLLEYVILLE , TX , - “ e-cigarettes , which deliver nicotine without the harmful toxins found in tobacco smoke , are likely to be a safer alternative to smoking . ”
Action on Smoking and Health ( ASH )
In their October briefing , ASH in the United Kingdom has released a favorable position on electronic cigarettes which is nearly 180 degrees to the position ASH in the United States has taken .
ASH ’s UK Position on E- cigarettes
“ ASH supports a harm reduction approach to tobacco , that is , we recognize that whilst efforts to help people stop smoking should remain a priority , many people either do not wish to stop smoking or find it very hard to do so .
For this group , we believe that products should be made available that deliver nicotine in a safe way , without the harmful components found in tobacco .
Most of the diseases associated with smoking are caused by inhaling smoke which contains thousands of toxic chemicals .
By contrast , nicotine is relatively safe .
Therefore , e-cigarettes , which deliver nicotine without the harmful toxins found in tobacco smoke , are likely to be a safer alternative to smoking .
In addition , e-cigarettes reduce secondhand smoke exposure since they do not produce smoke . ”
Kyle Newton of eCigarettesChoice.com is elated at the release .
“ This is the second piece of good news for the E cigarette industry this week .
The first was Governor Schwarzenegger ’s refusal to ban E cigarettes in California .
It is a David vs. Goliath battle for us against organizations that are well - funded by companies who stand to lose a huge market share to the E cigarette . ”
On the other side of the big pond , ASH , USA has hammered the electronic cigarette industry unmercifully in its public claims against the product .
But throughout this entire finger pointing , they have failed to produce any scientific research which tested the electronic cigarette and could trump the positive data “ real ” tobacco researchers have published .
ASH , USA and spokespersons of other health organizations continue to make weak accusations stating that they “ do n’t know what ’s in them ” and that , because flavors are involved , “ children may be attracted to them ” .
While a spec of truth may be found in any of these statements , they appear to lean more towards gross exaggeration or pure fiction .
Kyle claims , “ Not one US electronic cigarette dealer I know of would knowingly sell to those under the legal age of smoking . ”
Misleading statements continue to be made by health organization PR representatives who are well - educated on this subject , yet choose to ignore the widely publicized Health New Zealand ’s tests on the Ruyan electronic cigarette that list the ingredients and give the electronic cigarette the green light .
When confronted with Health New Zealand ’s report , they claim that the study was not independent because it was paid for by the electronic cigarette maker which is the industry norm .
Prominent doctors and tobacco researchers , including Dr. Michael Siegel at the Boston University School of Public Health , Dr. Joel Nitzkin of the AAPHP Tobacco Control Task Force , and Dr. Brad Rodu , Endowed Chair , Tobacco Harm Reduction Research University of Louisville continue to publish unbiased scientific benefits of the electronic smokes that counter the misleading information
It may be impossible to please these health organizations since their resistance to e cigarettes may be affected by their addictive funding from the manufacturers of smoking cessation products .
A better harm reduction alternative to smoking tobacco does not appear to be their priority or they would be partnering with the e cigarette industry .

David Beckham 's recent Christmas address on his blog was a heavily vetted , lifeless lump of words .
" Good to spend some time with the family in the lead up to Christmas . . . have a great Xmas everybody . . . yadda yadda . . . blah - de - nothing . " I paraphrase .
Half the world away , meanwhile , in a humble hotel room in Ankara , his former England teammate Darius Vassell was blogging his heart out .
In listless , lonely streams of consciousness , the 29 - year - old fading star was documenting a sleepless night .
" Lying awake in bed , the sound of the air conditioning is like the engine room to a train of stressful thoughts . . . relentless . "
What 's that – a football blogger actually blogging ?
And , hold on , was that a simile ?
Last year was n't great for the Sutton Coldfield - born player .
After blossoming as a regular England player under Sven - Göran Eriksson in the mid-noughties , he finished last season as Manchester City 's ninth - choice striker – pushed down the pecking order by a cavalcade of big - money players after the club was taken over by an Abu Dhabi consortium .
When his contract expired in July , Vassell was shown the door .
His next move changed everything .
Rather than signing for a lesser Premier League side , Vassell was wooed by the millionaire chairman of Ankaragucu , a habitually struggling team based in the Turkish capital .
He was the club 's highest - profile signing in its 100 - year history and , when he arrived at Ankara airport , 3,000 fans were there to meet him .
As a shocked Vassell emerged through the arrivals gate , they festooned him with scarves .
The bemused star was hustled out of the terminal , where 50 buses and 250 cars tailed him to his hotel .
A video of the furore appeared on YouTube , much to the amazement of football fans in the UK .
But five months later , an uninspiring return of three goals in 11 appearances has left Vassell 's new club in all sorts of turmoil .
Beset with financial problems , in November Ankaragucu failed to pay Vassell 's hotel bill and he was evicted .
Which is when he began sharing his loneliness with the internet , starting his second post with a short poem : " People want money , people want goals , they want me to stay , but i'm missing my home .
The smile on my face , disguises the case , I bury the truth deep down in my soul . "
His outpourings quickly struck a chord .
For expat Brits , he became an unlikely touchstone – readers from Japan and Russia have written to thank Vassell , telling him of their own long - distance lives .
Turkish fans have also been quick to respond with practical help – translating the incessant local press reports about Vassell 's future for him ( rumours surfaced again this week that he is about to be sold to another Turkish club ) ; explaining local customs such as sacrificing goats ; and congratulating him on getting engaged to his partner Amani – who is , of course , back home in England .
Snippets from Vassell 's blog

I feel like there is something stirring , boiling . . . something about to happen .

I watched a goat get sacrificed at training camp a few months back ; it was at this moment i realised i am an animal lover . . .
I think the sacrificing of goats is normal here but i wonder if some people find it hard to witness like me .
Anyone want to comment or elaborate ?
I know that this is done at Eid , but when else am i likely to encounter ?

Had a much needed break and am proud to announce my engagement to my beautiful partner Amani . . .
I also managed to setup a live webcam of my dog 's bedroom . . .
His terminal illness may mean it 's the last time i will see him , so i spend extra time saying goodbye and ensuring he will be looked after .
It 's almost like a movie and i'm playing the lead role , heading off to war and saying bye to my family in a backdrop of tear jerking music , while the audience eats their popcorn . . .
The cold London air reminds me to wear my scarf as i travel back to Turkey .
As i tie my yellow and blue Ankaragucu scarf around my neck i realise it's too tight a fit , and contemplate whether this is a metaphor or am i just being too cynical .
I leave the scarf in the car .
Can one of my fans please send me a new scarf ?
The one i had was given to me on the day i arrived in Turkey .
Recently , I enjoyed a healthy debate with a friend of mine who claimed that ours is a Christian nation , thus we ought to be comfortable with blurring the lines between church and state such as displaying the ten commandments in courtrooms , promoting school prayer , and praying at government - sponsored events like school board meetings and high school football games .
The basis of her argument is simply that our founding fathers were Christian and the evidence of their faith is easily revealed by their many references to God in all our founding documents .
She went on to argue that taking Christianity out of these public institutions is to chisel away at the core beliefs of our nation .
Our debate was not about the existence of God , the delights of Christianity , or the blessings of spirituality .
We stayed focused on the line between church and state , mostly .
I asked what ought to be done with the non-Christians : the Muslim , the atheist , the Jew , etc .
She said that non-believers still have access to everything that America provides for all of its citizens : civil rights and liberties , presumption of innocence in a court of law , a free public education , bill of rights stuff like having guns and screaming at trees , ambulances that show up when you call 911 , the right to vote , and so forth and so on .
No citizen is denied the bounty of our nation because of their beliefs .
She asked me if I could think of one legal right or privilege denied to the non-Christian in our nation .
Certainly , I replied , there are none .
Every citizen is afforded the same rights and privileges under the law .
She continued by stating quite eloquently that this nation is clearly a Christian nation – that most of our citizens are Christian , that our founding fathers practiced Christianity , and they even took steps to ensure that we , the people , suffered no threat to the freedom of religion , and that our worship may not be trampled upon by an oppressive government .
Therefore , any effort to censure public prayer , the public display of scripture , or similar expressions of belief ought to be considered a violation of our rights .
She asked me if it was fair that a majority of people be denied their ability to worship as they please because a few among us do not believe as the majority do .
She noted that the vast majority of people in that football stadium , in those school board meetings , in those courtrooms are Christians – and since this nation was founded as a Christian nation , and since the majority of us are Christian , we should affirm and celebrate our national religion and express it publicly and frequently .
I , having listened and pondered her words , asked her if ours was also a White nation .
A White nation ?
She replied , stunned .
A White nation , I said .
We are a nation with a White majority , founded by White men who owned slaves , with guiding documents that repeatedly reference slavery , and we deny no rights or privileges to non-Whites in our laws and practices .
Why should n’t we get on public address systems and celebrate our Whiteness ?
Why should n’t we be able to affirm how great it is to be White at football games and school board meetings .
How about posting in every courtroom the top ten reasons why being
White is really , really awesome ?
She understood that my example was tongue - in - cheek , but played my game anyway .
Being
White is not a choice , she argued .
You are born that way .
You ca n’t change it .
Religion is something you choose , or at least it ’s something you could change if you wanted .
So religion is a choice ?
Indeed , it is .
Something you choose ?
I asked .
Yes , of course .
And if you make the correct choice , you get all sorts of bonuses ( like judges and teachers and elected officials and referees who clearly take your side from the get - go ) , but if you make the incorrect choice , you only get the basic package ( like the right to vote and scream at trees ) , but the impartiality of your court case , your complaint to the city council or school board , or even your football game might be a little iffy if you reveal that you are n’t a Christian .
She stopped me in my tracks .
Just because an elected official posts the ten commandments , for example , does n’t mean that he would be biased against non-Christians , she said .
What if a judge posting a sign in his courtroom that said “ I love attractive blondes with large breasts ” but when confronted about it assured everyone that he could remain impartial in the trial of Pamela Anderson v. Susan Boyle .
Do you think he could be completely impartial ?
Of course not !
Why the hell would he be dumb enough to post a sign like that , she stammered .
Because the majority of Americans choose to worship attractive blondes with large breasts , I replied .
But I do n’t have the choice to be blonde or have big breasts , she argued !
You do in America , I said with a smile .
— — — — — — — — — ———————-
Being in the “ majority ” might make it easier to deny others their freedoms , but it does n’t make it right .
Let ’s reconsider whether it ’s necessary for our courts , our classrooms , and our public spaces to declare a preference for one thing while promising impartiality for its opposite .
Doing so does n’t deny you your rights , it restores them for those whom you serve under an oath of impartiality .
If we really believe in freedom and justice for all , let ’s eliminate the signs and chants that are little more than asterisks on the Bill of Rights .
It might be true that we COULD change if we wanted to please the majority , but it ought not to be a requirement for justice in America – be it breasts or beliefs .
I want my money back .
I 'm down here drowning in your fat .
You got me on my knees praying for everything you lack .
I ain't afraid of you .
I 'm just a…

FLORHAM PARK , N.J. 
Eight minutes into the most recent game between the Jets and Indianapolis  long before the Colts pulled their starters and started a controversy  a 30 - year - old reserve Jets linebacker named Bryan Thomas blocked an extra point .
The lost point did not make much difference in the game that the Jets would win on Dec. 27 , 29 - 15 , but the information gathered from that special - teams play may help the Jets beat the Colts in the American Football Conference championship game on Sunday and get to the Super Bowl .
The Jets have not allowed a field goal in the playoffs in five attempts .
Cincinnati’s Shayne Graham and San Diego ’s Nate Kaeding were criticized for their inaccuracy the past two weeks , but the Jets are not bashful about saying they might have had something to do with those five missed kicks .
Some teams are passive about the way they attempt to block kicks .
The Jets are not .
“ This team comes hard every time , ” said Mike DeVito , a defensive tackle who is part of that Jets ’ unit .
“ We take it just like any defensive play .
I think that catches the other team off - guard .
I ’m sure when the Colts are watching film , they can see all the pressure we ’re putting on .
They know it ’s coming .
They ’ve got to get it off quick . ”
The Israeli government is reported to have quietly approved the fast - track immigration of 7,000 members of a supposedly “ lost Jewish ” tribe , known as the Bnei Menashe , currently living in a remote area of India .
Under the plan , the “ lost Jews ” would be brought to Israel over the next two years by right - wing and religious organizations who , critics are concerned , will seek to place them in West Bank settlements in a bid to foil Israel ’s partial agreement to a temporary freeze of settlement growth .
A previous attempt to bring the Bnei Menashe to Israel was halted in 2003 by Avraham Poraz , the interior minister at the time , after it became clear that most of the 1,500 who had arrived were being sent to extremist settlements , including in the Gaza Strip and next to Hebron , the large Palestinian city in the West Bank .
Dror Etkes , who monitors settlement growth for Yesh Din , an Israeli human rights group , said there were strong grounds for suspecting that some of the new Bnei Menashe would end up in the settlements , too .
“ There is a mutual interest being exploited here , ” he said .
“ The Bnei Menashe get help to make aliyah [ immigration ] while the settlements get lots of new arrivals to bolster their numbers , including in settlements close to Palestinian areas where most Israelis would not want to venture . ”
The government ’s decision , leaked this month to Ynet , Israel ’s biggest news website , was made possible by a ruling in 2005 by Shlomo Amar , one of Israel ’s two chief rabbis , that the Bnei Menashe are one of 10 lost Jewish tribes , supposedly exiled from the Middle East 2,700 years ago .
He ordered a team of rabbis to go to north - east India to begin preparing Bnei Menashe who identified themselves as Jews for conversion to the strictest stream of Judaism , Orthodoxy , so they would qualify to immigrate to Israel under the Law of Return .
The Bnei Menashe belong to an ethnic group called the Shinlung , who number more than one million and live mainly in the states of Manipur and Mizoram , close to the border with Myanmar .
They were converted from animism to Christianity by British missionaries a century ago , but a small number claim to have kept an ancient connection to Judaism .
DNA samples taken from the Bnei Menashe have failed so far to establish any common ancestry to Jews .
The immigration of the Bnei Menashe following Mr Amar ’s ruling was quickly halted after the foreign ministry expressed concerns that it was causing a diplomatic falling out with India , which has laws against missionary activity .
Ophir Pines - Paz , the interior minister in 2005 , who opposed what he called the “ clandestine ” arrival of the Bnei Menashe , said in an interview last week : “ I was against a policy that sends [ Jewish ] immigrants to the settlements .
I hope that could not be the case today with a settlement freeze in place .
I want to believe that is the case . ”
However , the Bnei Menashe have won two powerful right - wing sponsors : Shavei Israel , led by Michael Freund , a former assistant to Benjamin Netanyahu , the Israeli prime minister ; and a religious group known as the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews , which draws on wide support from evangelical Christians in the United States .
Mr Freund began lobbying for the immigration of the Bnei Menashe to Israel while he was an adviser to Mr Netanyahu during his previous premiership , in the late 1990s .
Mr Freund is believed to have used his connections in the current government to push the group ’s case again .
Arik Puder , a spokesman for Shavei Israel , refused to comment , saying the organization had decided to keep “ a low profile ” on the decision to bring the Bnei Menashe to Israel .
It is believed that Shavei Israel is concerned that the government may come under pressure to reverse its decision if there is too much public scrutiny .
According to Ynet , Israel is planning to avoid diplomatic complications with India by sending groups of Bnei Menashe to Nepal for a fast - track conversion .
The brand of Judaism the Bnei Menashe have been exposed to during their “ Jewish education ” in special camps in India was indicated by Rabbi Eliyahu Avichail , who has worked closely with the tribe since the early 1980s .
He said he believed in the biblical prophecy of a coming apocalypse – one shared by “ End of Days ” evangelical Christians – in which “ all the world is against Israel ” in a battle to be decided in Jerusalem .
“ I believe we are very close to the time when the Messiah will arrive and we must prepare by making sure that all the Jews are in the Land of Israel .
There are more than six million among the lost tribes and they must be brought to Israel as a matter of urgency . ”
Shimon Gangte , 33 , who was helped by Mr Avichail to come to Israel 13 years ago , is among 500 Bnei Menashe living in Kiryat Arba , an extremist settlement whose armed inhabitants regularly clash with Palestinians in neighboring Hebron .
He said : “ It is important that the 10 tribes are brought here because the time of the Messiah is near . ”
Mr Gangte added that the Bnei Menashe were attracted to the West Bank because life was cheaper in the settlements than in Israel and the settlers “ give us help finding housing , jobs and schools for our children ” .
Mr Etkes of Yesh Din said “ past experience ” fed suspicions that the Bnei Menashe would be encouraged to settle deep in the West Bank , adding that the so - called settlement freeze , insisted on by the United States as a prelude to renewed peace talks , was having little effect on the ground .
“ There is no freeze because it is being violated all the time .
The settlers had lots of time to prepare for the freeze and spent the four to five months before it in a frenzy of construction activity . ”
Shavei Israel lobbies for other groups of Jews to be brought to Israel , including communities in Spain , Portugal , Italy , South America , Russia , Poland and China .
Israeli peace groups were outraged in 2002 when Shavei Israel placed a group of 100 Peruvian immigrants , whose ancestors converted to Judaism 50 years ago , in the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the West Bank .

Two - year parental leave provisions in new '' family friendly ' ' workplace laws could unintentionally hurt women 's careers , some academics and business groups have warned .
A new right for couples to request that unpaid parental leave be doubled , and for parents of young children to request flexible work arrangements , are '' legal changes that may lead to major social change ' ' , University of Sydney professor of employment relations Marian Baird said .
ACTU president Sharan Burrow hailed the provisions , contained in the National Employment Standards that came into force on Friday as a ' ' crucial breakthrough ' ' for families .
But employer groups fear the changes will cause significant disruption to small businesses .
And Professor Baird said that while the new rights would increase work options for women once they returned from maternity leave , the changes could exacerbate the silent discrimination against women who break their careers to have children , even though it is illegal .
two - part blog entry on the state of the mortgage market , and it only reinforces my belief that the crisis is n't over and that both the housing and the banking sectors are going to get much worse .

Mike Konczal has an excellent two–part blog entry on the state of the mortgage market , and it only reinforces my belief that the crisis is n’t over and that both the housing and the banking sectors are going to get much worse .
Konczal describes the government ’s HAMP loan - modification program as “ a long , stressful process which appears to leave nobody better off ” , and highlights this chart :
The key thing to note here is the bottom , darkest line : while delinquencies and initiated foreclosures have been rising , there ’s a limit to how many foreclosures can actually be completed , and that limit seems if anything to be falling .
What this says to me is that while we are n’t going to see a wave of foreclosures , we are going to see a large and more or less constant number of foreclosures for the foreseeable future — with all the gratuitous value destruction that implies .
Konczal also looks long and hard at the banks ’ refusal to write down the principal on their loans , despite the fact that if you modify a loan so that it remains seriously underwater , you ’re pretty much guaranteeing an extremely high redefault rate .
After all , negative equity is pretty much the best single predictor of delinquency .
Why are the banks behaving like this ?
I think the obvious answer is the right one : they ’re holding these loans on their books at much more than they ’re really worth , and they ca n’t afford to take the write - downs which would accompany principal reductions of roughly the same magnitude as the decline in housing prices .
This kind of head - in - the - sand behavior can only possibly work if housing prices suddenly rebound in the next couple of years , and that ai n’t gonna happen .
Both the Bush and the Obama administrations tried to put together programs to deal with the banks ’ toxic residential real - estate assets : the original TARP was one , the PPIP was another .
Neither went anywhere , and as a result the problem is just as bad now as it ’s always been .
Remember that , when you look at the enormous 2009 bank bonuses , and ask yourself whether any of them will be clawed back if it turns out that last year ’s profits were dwarfed by the write - downs that banks should have taken and did n’t .

BOSTON — Can things get any worse for Detroit ?
First , a suspected Islamic terrorist tries to blow up an airplane over the city ( with a bomb in his underwear , no less ) .
Then this week General Motors — the company that helped put the motor in Motor City — said sales in China surged 67 percent in 2009 , even as the U.S. auto industy collapsed , further decimating Detroit 's economy .
GM sold more than 1.8 million cars and trucks in China , just below what it sells in the U.S .
To rub Sichuan hot bean paste into the city 's wounds , those China sales were led by Buick — a stodgy brand that , for years in the U.S. market , GM has been trying to rid of the old man smell .
Even a pre-scandal Tiger Woods could n't turn that trick : GM and Woods parted ways in 2008 after a nine - year marketing partnership that featured the young , hip and ( then ) wholesome golfer .
But Buick is n't the company 's only happiness in China lately .
GM and its joint venture partners also saw big sales jumps in cheaper " microvans " ( think really small minivans ) and pick - ups , which play well in China 's vast rural areas .
GM now owns a 13.4 percent market share in China , the world 's fastest - growing market for automobiles — not bad for a bankrupt company that took $ 50 billion in U.S. bailout money last year .
GM 's success in the dragon is the result of several factors .
The first , of course , is China 's rapid growth , which has created a large and growing army of consumers ready to get behind the wheel .
Fueled by big government incentives , China 's overall auto market grew a staggering 50 percent last year , for the first time dethroning the U.S. as the largest vehicle market in the world .
U.S. consumers bought 10.5 million cars and trucks in 2009 .
The Chinese bought 13 million .
While that number is expected to drop significantly this year as Beijing 's incentive programs wind down , China is now critically important for automakers worldwide .
" There 's no question that China will become the world 's largest auto market as long as the economy keeps growing , " Kelly Sims Gallagher , a professor at Tufts University , told the Washington Post this week .
Here 's why :
In the U.S. there are 850 cars for every 1,000 people .
In China , there are currently 35 cars per 1,000 people .
That 's a lot of room for growth .
Now factor in China 's population of 1.3 billion people and its rapidly growing middle class , and you can see what GM , Ford , Volkswagen , Hyundai , Changan , Shanghai Automotive Industry and other global and local automakers are fighting over .
But economic growth does n't entirely explain GM 's success in China .
The missing piece ?
Smart marketing , particularly of Buick — something the company is n't exactly famous for in Detroit .
In China , General Motors has done a superb job of pitching Buick as a cool , even sexy , luxury car .
It 's not viewed as something your grandfather would drive .
Instead , GM positioned Buick as an aspirational brand that fits in perfectly with China 's national go - go race to modernity .
As a result , the Buick has become a symbol of the country 's rising prosperity — a fun , four - wheeled , tactile embodiment of Deng Xiaoping 's famous phrase , " To get rich is glorious . "
GM recognized that important trait in China 's newly prosperous consumers .
It then gave the brand just the right marketing push , as evidenced by this 2009 TV spot for its Buick Regal Turbo that features a pair of prosperous Shanghai hipsters :
Of course , plenty could still go wrong for GM in the dragon .
Local or other global automakers could produce better vehicles , driving GM out of the market .
Its domestic and other global problems could sink the overall company .
China Inc. could crash , as was predicted this week by James S. Chanos — a hedge fund investor who made his fortune by foreseeing bad things ( like Enron 's collapse ) where almost everyone else sees promise .
Then , of course , there is the question of how to cope with the environmental impact of millions upon millions of new cars hitting Chinese roads every year , belching CO2 into the planet 's atmosphere .
But until then , GM will try to capitalize on its early gains in China .
It 's expected to add 10 new products in the country this year , including a redesigned minivan .
GM will also update its existing model line - up , including sleeker versions its HRV compact car , and yes , its popular Buick Excelle .

Robertson : Haiti ' cursed ' since Satanic pact
The Rev. Pat Robertson , on his CBN broadcast today , offered his own explanation of the earthquake in Haiti :
" Something happened a long time ago in Haiti , and people might not want to talk about it , " he said .
" They were under the heel of the French ... and they got together and swore a pact to the devil .
They said , ' We will serve you if you 'll get us free from the French . '
" True story .
And the devil said , ' OK , it 's a deal , ' " Robertson said .
" Ever since , they have been cursed by one thing after another . "
His words , which refer to a piece of Haitian folklore about the country 's founders , come around the 6:00 mark in the report above , which also includes interviews with missionary groups active in the country .
( via Political Carnival )
UPDATE : Via Tapper , a Haitian minister has some of the background to the legend .
The minister , Jean Gelin , writes :
Everywhere you go , from your television screen to the Internet , what you are most likely to find is a reference to a spiritual pact that the fathers of the nation supposedly made with the devil to help them win their freedom from France .
As a result of that satanic alliance , as they put it , God has placed a curse on the country some time around its birth3 , and that divine burden has made it virtually impossible for the vast majority of Haitians to live in peace and prosperity in their land .
Surprising , right ?
The satanic pact allegedly took place at Bois - Caïman near Cap - Haïtien on August 14 , 1791 during a meeting organized by several slave leaders , under [ Dutty ]
Boukman ’s leadership , before launching what would become Haiti ’s Independence War .
This brutal period lasted 13 years until the last survivors of the French expeditionary forces , dispatched to Saint - Domingue with the sole purpose to re-establish slavery , were allowed by Dessalines to leave the island and return to Napoleon .
Those who made it safely to France wrote and reported about the utmost bravery and supreme courage of Haiti ’s indigenous army .
Gelin writes , rather seriously , that he sees no evidence for the pact .
Rachel Maddow calls out Beck for editing her criticism of him on her show and making sure his viewers did n't see Rachel calling him out for his bullshit .
I had said before that Dylan Ratigan was wasting his time engaging Beck .
That 's because Ratigan actually thought it would be a good idea to either bring Beck on his show or go on Beck 's show .
I do not think when Beck lies about one of them they should let it go unchallenged and am glad Rachel Maddow pointed out Beck 's hypocrisy here and how he edited her segment .
Engaging him is a complete waste of time .
He 's not going to come on MSNBC any time soon and he sure as hell is n't going to bring either Ratigan or Maddow on his show any time soon and if he did they'd be in some debate box where he could hit the mute button any time he wanted instead of live on his set .
It 's useless to even pretend like that might happen in any fair manner , ever , as Ratigan proposed .
Calling him out for his bullshit is not .
Although I would love to see the idiot try to debate Rachel in person if he was n't just allowed to yell over her , cut her mike or filibuster the entire time .
I would imagine it would be much like Beck bringing a toy knife to an assault rifle fight if he actually had to debate Rachel Maddow on any subject and those were the rules of the game .
I hope Rachel does n't spend too much time on this pissing contest with Beck though because in the end , too much time spent on this serial liar is just a waste of energy .
Fox does n't care how much he lies and neither do his brain dead viewers .
Well enough to point it out and move along .
Der 3D - Drücker genießt eine äußert große Popularität in den letzten paar Jahren .
Er wird nicht nur in der Auto - Industrie verwendet , sondern auch in anderen Bereichen , die einen öffentlichen Nutzen haben .
Im Jahre 2015 gelang es schließlich der Universität für Technik aus Eindhoven , eine 3D - Brücke herzustellen und zwar durch die Verwendung vom 3D - Printer .
Die Ingenieure der Universität , zusammen mit dem weltweit berühmten Bauunternehmen BAM haben eine 800 Meter lange Brücke hergestellt , die zwei Uferseiten verbindet .
Doch die Geschichte der Herstellung ist eine besondere Angelegenheit .
Wie die Brücke entstand
In Amsterdam wurden , bevor es zu der Eindhoven - Brücke überhaupt kam , vor einigen Jahren auch bestimmte Teile einer Brücke gedrückt und zusammengesetzt .
Doch bei der Eindhoven - Brücke ist es anders .
Die Teile werden erstmal vorgefertigt und dann in Gemert zu einer Brücke zusammengefügt .
Sie wird also nicht an Ort und Stelle gedruckt .
Die Brücke besteht somit aus mehreren Segmenten , die zwar nicht gleich erkennbar sind , jedoch in der Tat als solche aufgebaut sind .
Durch die besondere Technologie , die bei der Herstellung benutzt wurde , kann die Brücke eine Belastung von bis zu 2 Tonnen aushalten .
Sie ist ursprünglich für Fahrradfahrer und Fußgänger gedacht und für deren Aufbau hat man 6 Stunden gebraucht .
Vorteile der Brücke
Der größte Vorteil besteht darin , dass eine auf diese Art und Weise entstandene Brücke auf jeden Fall besser für die Umgebung , bzw .
die Natur ist , da nur sehr wenig Materialien benutzt wurden .
Es entsteht also wenig Müll .
Die gedruckte Brücke wurde , um für eine größere Stabilität zu sorgen , mit bestimmten Materialien verstärkt , die jedoch nur an wenigen Stellen benutzt worden sind .
Man muss also gestehen , dass diese Brücke schon etwas Besonderes ist .
Es ist aber nicht die einzige 3D - Brücke in der Welt , aber in den Niederlanden schon .
Und um dieses Projekt weiterzuführen , wird erwartet , dass bis zum Ende des nächsten Jahres in den Niederlanden eine 3D - Stahlbrücke hergestellt wird , mit deren Herstellung schon angefangen wurde .
Der Aufbau und die Variationen
Eins der Besonderheiten dieser 3D - Brücke ist deren Aufbau .
Sie wird nämlich Schicht nach Schicht aufgebaut , sodass der Beton genug Zeit bekommt , um sich auszuhärten .
Somit gewinnt man an Stabilität .
Ein Roboter ist für den ganzen Zusammenbau verantwortlich , denn er legt die Teile aneinander und verwendet für das Gießen des Betons eine Düse , die auch durch den 3D - Printer hergestellt worden ist .
Das Drucken ist viel schneller als das normale Gießen einer Brücke und weil dafür keine Verschalung notwendig ist , gibt es auch keine Abfälle , die entstehen .
Und noch eine wichtige Sache : Da weniger Beton für die Herstellung verwendet wird , fällt auch der Kohlendioxid weniger an .
Somit handelt es sich bei dieser Brücke um eine äußerst gute Alternative für die Umwelt .
Sie ist außerdem sehr stabil und bietet eine lange Lebensdauer , da sie Technologie und Kreativität vereint .
L'opposizione e i sindacati : « Pura propaganda .
Dica cose serie »
Brunetta : « Ai giovani 500 euro al mese »
Palazzo Chigi : « Posizione personale »
Il ministro : « Agire sulle pensioni di anzianità , Tremonti è d'accordo » .
Governo : « Posizione mai concordata »
Renato Brunetta ( LaPresse ) MILANO - Cinquecento euro al mese per i giovani , agendo sulle pensioni di anzianità , per aiutarli così a uscire di casa .
È la proposta anti-bamboccioni che il ministro della Pubblica amministrazione , Renato Brunetta , ha avanzato durante la puntata di Domenica In su Raiuno .
Ma in serata viene smentito duramente da Palazzo Chigi : « Quella del ministro Brunetta è un'idea del tutto personale , una posizione mai concordata all ' interno del governo » , dice una nota ufficiale .
BAMBOCCIONI - « La verità - ha detto Brunetta , tornando sul tema del fenomeno dei " bamboccioni " - è che la coperta è piccola e quindi non ci sono risorse per tutti .
Secondo me si deve agire sulle pensioni di anzianità , quelle che partono dai 55 anni di età .
Facendo in questo modo si potrebbero trovare risorse che consentirebbero di dare ai giovani non 200 ma 500 euro al mese » ha spiegato il ministro , sottolineando che su questa proposta «è d'accordo anche il ministro Tremonti » .
In tv Brunetta ha riconosciuto che « una proposta del genere scatenerebbe le proteste dei sindacati , che sono quelli che difendono i genitori » , ma per il ministro si deve andare nella direzione di dare « meno ai genitori e più ai figli » .
« L' Italia - ha aggiunto il ministro - è piena di giovani perbene , che rischiano e che vogliono la libertà .
La colpa , se hanno la libertà tarpata , è nostra , dei loro genitori » .
LA NOTA - Dopo le dichiarazioni a Domenica
In di Brunetta , il portavoce del ministro della Pubblica amministrazione ha fatto delle precisazioni attraverso una nota : « Qualsiasi intervento a favore dei giovani come i 500 euro di sgravi , detrazioni sugli affitti , borse di studio , prestiti d'onore , incentivi per autoimprenditorialità e altro , ipotizzati oggi dal ministro Brunetta su Raiuno , va realizzato , come ha ben precisato lo stesso ministro , senza aggravare in alcun modo il deficit di bilancio della spesa corrente » .
« Le risorse necessarie - si legge ancora nel comunicato - vanno quindi reperite intervenendo interamente sulle anomalie e sulle distorsioni del sistema pensionistico e di welfare che , come noto , dà troppo ai padri e quasi nulla ai figli » .
« Su questa e altre ipotesi a favore dei giovani - conclude la nota - il dibattito è aperto e il ministro Brunetta ne parlerà nei prossimi giorni con i competenti membri del Governo , a partire dai ministri Tremonti , Sacconi , Meloni e Gelmini » .
REAZIONI - La proposta fatta da Brunetta in tv non è comunque piaciuta a Paolo Ferrero , portavoce nazionale della Federazione della sinistra .
« La proposta di dare soldi ai giovani togliendoli ai pensionati è delinquenziale .
Punta a scatenare una guerra tra poveri dentro un folle conflitto tra generazioni .
Si tassino i grandi patrimoni , le rendite e i redditi più alti » .
« Brunetta , nella sua voglia di comparire , ha affrontato un argomento drammaticamente serio con una proposta che suona come una battuta o una vera e propria sparata » , ha detto Filippo Penati , capo della segreteria politica
Pd e candidato presidente della Lombardia .
« Si facciano cose serie senza demagogie o proposte assurde » .
Per Antonio Di Pietro , leader dell ' Italia dei valori , « invece della riduzione delle tasse , arriva la promessa di 500 euro per i giovani da finanziare con le pensioni invece che con i soldi degli evasori .
A rimetterci sono sempre gli stessi , le fasce sociali più deboli , e il vantaggio è sempre dei soliti furbetti del quartierino » .
Nettamente contrari anche i sindacati .
Per il segretario generale dello Spi Cgil , Carla Cantone , « Brunetta , sempre in cerca di visibilità , ha esternato un ' altra delle sue boutade , in modo irresponsabile e provocatorio .
Non serve a nessuno in questo Paese alimentare contrapposizioni di tipo generazionale » .
Per Domenico Proietti , segretario confederale della
Uil con delega alla previdenza , l'idea di Brunetta « sembra una proposta che toglie ai poveri per dare ai poveri » .
PRO BRUNETTA - La maggioranza fa quadrato intorno a Brunetta .
« Contro le proposte di Brunetta si è levata un’assemblea di immobilisti e conservatori , di comunisti ideologici , verdi del no a tutto , sindacalisti desiderosi di mantenere una società ingessata » , ha commentato il portavoce del Pdl , Daniele Capezzone .
Il ministro della Gioventù , Giorgia Meloni , all 'Adnkronos dice che « da tempo auspichiamo e rivendichiamo la necessità di redistribuire con maggiore equità le risorse del welfare a favore delle giovani generazioni » .
« ABBIAMO TOCCATO UN NERVO SCOPERTO » -
In mattinata Brunetta era tornato a esprimersi sul tema dei " bamboccioni " anche ai microfoni di Rtl.
Ricordando le polemiche scatenate la scorsa settimana dalla sua proposta di far uscire « per legge » i diciottenni da casa , Brunetta ha detto : « L'ho detto per scherzo , come paradosso , ma è successa un ' ira di Dio perché evidentemente abbiamo toccato un nervo scoperto , che è quello del familismo da un lato e del bamboccionismo culturale prodotto dai nostri egoismi dall ' altro » .
Insomma , quella sulla ' legge anti-bamboccion ì era solo « una lucida provocazione » , mentre per Brunetta la vera colpa « non è dei giovani ma dell ' egoismo e della miopia dei genitori , che sono iperprotetti dal welfare e lasciano pochissimo spazio di lavoro e garanzie ai giovani , e in cambio se li tengono in casa » .
Per il ministro della Pubblica amministrazione , al di là delle polemiche , bisogna fare « un esame di coscienza , dare prospettive di libertà di scelta ai giovani e non di costrizione : non c'è lavoro , nelle università non ci sono campus e borse di studio , la preparazione delle università non è abbastanza buona .
Infine - ha detto Brunetta - tra pensioni di anzianità e welfare , tutta la stabilità va ai padri , mentre tutta la flessibilità rimane ai figli » .

Israel Gelfand , who made profound and prolific contributions to many areas of mathematics , including functional analysis , representation theory , operator algebras , and partial differential equations , died on Monday , age 96 .
Gelfand ’s beautiful theory of - algebras and related spaces made quite an impact on me as a graduate student in Princeton , to the point where I was seriously considering working in this area ; but there was not much activity in operator algebras at the time there , and I ended up working in harmonic analysis under Eli Stein instead .
( Though I am currently involved in another operator algebras project , of which I hope to be able to discuss in the near future .
The commutative version of Gelfand ’s theory is discussed in these lecture notes of mine . )
I met Gelfand only once , in one of the famous “ Gelfand seminars ” at the IHES in 2000 .
The speaker was Tim Gowers , on his new proof of Szemerédi ’s theorem .
( Endre Szemerédi , incidentally , was Gelfand ’s student . )
Gelfand ’s introduction to the seminar , on the subject of Banach spaces which both mathematicians contributed so greatly to , was approximately as long as Gowers ’ talk itself !
There are far too many contributions to mathematics by Gelfand to name here , so I will only mention two .
The first are the Gelfand - Tsetlin patterns , induced by an Hermitian matrix .
Such matrices have real eigenvalues .
If one takes the top minor , this is another Hermitian matrix , whose eigenvalues intersperse the eigenvalues of the original matrix : for every .
This interspersing can be easily seen from the minimax characterisation
of the eigenvalues of , with the eigenvalues of the minor being similar but with now restricted to a subspace of rather than .
Similarly , the eigenvalues of the top minor of intersperse those of the previous minor .
Repeating this procedure one eventually gets a pyramid of real numbers of height and width , with the numbers in each row interspersing the ones in the row below .
Such a pattern is known as a Gelfand - Tsetlin pattern .
The space of such patterns forms a convex cone , and ( if one fixes the initial eigenvalues ) becomes a compact convex polytope .
If one fixes the initial eigenvalues of but chooses the eigenvectors randomly ( using the Haar measure of the unitary group ) , then the resulting Gelfand - Tsetlin pattern is uniformly distributed across this polytope ; the case of this observation is essentially the classic observation of Archimedes that the cross-sectional areas of a sphere and a circumscribing cylinder are the same .
( Ultimately , the reason for this is that the Gelfand - Tsetlin pattern almost turns the space of all with a fixed spectrum ( i.e. the co-adjoint orbit associated to that spectrum ) into a toric variety .
More precisely , there exists a mostly diffeomorphic map from the co-adjoint orbit to a ( singular ) toric variety , and the Gelfand - Tsetlin pattern induces a complete set of action variables on that variety . )
There is also a “ quantum ” ( or more precisely , representation - theoretic ) version of this observation , in which one can decompose any irreducible representation of the unitary group into a canonical basis ( the Gelfand - Tsetlin basis ) , indexed by integer - valued Gelfand - Tsetlin patterns , by first decomposing this representation into irreducible representations of , then , and so forth .
The structure , symplectic geometry , and representation theory of Gelfand - Tsetlin patterns was enormously influential in my own work with Allen Knutson on honeycomb patterns , which control the sums of Hermitian matrices and also the structure constants of the tensor product operation for representations of ; indeed , Gelfand - Tsetlin patterns arise as the degenerate limit of honeycombs in three different ways , and we in fact discovered honeycombs by trying to glue three Gelfand - Tsetlin patterns together .
( See for instance our Notices article for more discussion .
The honeycomb analogue of the representation - theoretic properties of these patterns was eventually established by Henriques and Kamnitzer , using crystals and their Kashiwara bases . )
The second contribution of Gelfand I want to discuss is the Gelfand - Levitan - Marchenko equation for solving the one - dimensional inverse scattering problem : given the scattering data of an unknown potential function , recover .
This is already interesting in and of itself , but is also instrumental in solving integrable systems such as the Korteweg - de Vries equation , because the Lax pair formulation of such equations implies that they can be linearised ( and solved explicitly ) by applying the scattering and inverse scattering transforms associated with the Lax operator .
I discuss the derivation of this equation below the fold .
— 1 . Inverse scattering —
Let be a smooth real potential function supported on a compact interval ( for simplicity ) , and consider the potential wave equation in one spatial dimension
for the scalar field .
If the potential was zero , then ( 1 ) becomes the free wave equation , the general solution of ( 1 ) would be the superposition of a rightward moving wave and a leftward moving wave :
Now suppose is non-zero .
Then in the left region , solves the free wave equation and thus takes the form
for some , while in the right region , solves the free wave equation and takes the form
for some .
As for the central region , we will make the simplifying assumption that the equation ( 1 ) has no bound states , which implies in particular that as for any fixed and any reasonable ( e.g. finite energy will do ) .
From spectral theory , this assumption is equivalent to the assertion that the Hill operator ( or Schrödinger operator ) has no eigenfunctions in . )
Thus the wave is asymptotically equal to for large negative times , then evolves to interact with the potential , then eventually is asymptotic to for large positive .
When is zero , we have and .
For non-zero , the relationship between , and involves something called the reflection coefficients and transmission coefficients of .
We will not define these just yet , but instead focus on two special cases .
Firstly , consider the case when is the Dirac delta function and ; thus for large negative times , the wave consists just of a Dirac mass ( or “ photon ” , if you will ) arriving from the left , and this generates some special solution to ( 1 ) ( a bit like the fundamental solution ) .
( We will ignore the ( mild ) technical issues involved in solving PDE with data as rough as the Dirac distribution . )
Evolving the wave equation ( 1 ) , the solution eventually resolves to some transmitted wave ( which should be some perturbation of the Dirac delta function ) plus a reflected wave , which we will call .
This function can be thought of as “ scattering data ” for the potential .
Next , we will consider the solution to ( 1 ) for which and ; one can view this solution as obtained by reversing the roles of space and time , and evolving ( 1 ) from to ( with the potential now being a constant - in - space , variable - in - time potential rather than the other way around ) .
One can construct this solution by the Picard iteration method , and using finite speed of propagation , one can show that is supported on the lower diagonal region , and is smooth except at the diagonal , where it can have a jump discontinuity .
One can think of as a dual fundamental solution for the equation ( 1 ) ; it is also the Fourier transform of the Jost solutions to the eigenfunction equation ( 5 ) .
We claim that the scattering data can be used to reconstruct the potential .
This claim is obtained from two sub-claims :
Given the scattering data , one can recover .
, one can recover .
Given , one can recover .
The second claim is easy : one simply substitutes into ( 1 ) .
Indeed , if one compares the components of both sides , one sees that
To verify the first claim , we exploit the time translation and time reversal symmetries of ( 1 ) .
Since is a solution to ( 1 ) , the time - reversal is also a solution .
More generally , the time translation is also a solution to ( 1 ) for any real number .
Multiplying this by and integrating in , we see that the function
is also a solution to ( 1 ) .
Superimposing this with the solution , we see that
is also a solution to ( 1 ) .
Now when , vanishes ; and so this solution ( 2 ) is equal to for .
Thus , by uniqueness of the evolution of ( 1 ) ( in the direction ) , ( 2 ) must match the fundamental solution .
On the other hand , by finite speed of propagation , this solution vanishes when .
We thus obtain the Gelfand - Levitan - Marchenko equation
For any fixed , this is a linear integral equation for , and one can use it to solve from given by inverting the integral operator .
( This inversion can be performed by Neumann series if is small enough , which is for instance the case when the potential is small ; in fact , one can use scattering theory to show that this operator is in fact invertible for all without bound states , but we will not do so here . )
Now I ’ll discuss briefly the relationship between the data and more traditional types of scattering data .
We already have the fundamental solution , which equals for and for which .
By time translation , we have a solution for any , which equals for and for which .
Multiplying this solution by for some frequency and then integrating in , we obtain the ( complex ) solution
to ( 1 ) , which equals
for , and equals some function for , where
On the other hand , we can write the solution ( 4 ) as , where .
This implies that must be a multiple of the plane wave , thus for some complex number .
Substituting into ( 1 ) , we see that is a generalised eigenfunction of the Schrödinger operator :
from the asymptotics of ( 4 ) , we also see that for and for .
Thus we see that has an interpretation as a reflection coefficient for the eigenfunction equation ( 5 ) .
The " inconvenient truth " overhanging the UN's Copenhagen conference is not that the climate is warming or cooling , but that humans are overpopulating the world .
A planetary law , such as China 's one - child policy , is the only way to reverse the disastrous global birthrate currently , which is one million births every four days .
The world 's other species , vegetation , resources , oceans , arable land , water supplies and atmosphere are being destroyed and pushed out of existence as a result of humanity 's soaring reproduction rate .
Ironically , China , despite its dirty coal plants , is the world 's leader in terms of fashioning policy to combat environmental degradation , thanks to its one - child - only edict .
The intelligence behind this is the following :
- If only one child per female was born as of now , the world 's population would drop from its current 6.5 billion to 5.5 billion by 2050 , according to a study done for scientific academy Vienna Institute of Demography .
- By 2075 , there would be 3.43 billion humans on the planet .
This would have immediate positive effects on the world 's forests , other species , the oceans , atmospheric quality and living standards .
- Doing nothing , by contrast , will result in an unsustainable population of nine billion by 2050 .
Humans are the only rational animals but have yet to prove it .
Medical and other scientific advances have benefited by delivering lower infant mortality rates as well as longevity .
Both are welcome , but humankind has not yet recalibrated its behavior to account for the fact that the world can only accommodate so many people , especially if billions get indoor plumbing and cars .
The fix is simple .
It 's dramatic .
And yet the world 's leaders do n't even have this on their agenda in Copenhagen .
Instead there will be photo ops , posturing , optics , blah - blah - blah about climate science and climate fraud , announcements of giant wind farms , then cap - and - trade subsidies .
None will work unless a China one - child policy is imposed .
Unfortunately , there are powerful opponents .
Leaders of the world 's big fundamentalist religions preach in favor of procreation and fiercely oppose birth control .
And most political leaders in emerging economies perpetuate a disastrous Catch - 22 : Many children ( i. e. sons ) stave off hardship in the absence of a social safety net or economic development , which , in turn , prevents protections or development .
China has proven that birth restriction is smart policy .
Its middle class grows , all its citizens have housing , health care , education and food , and the one out of five human beings who live there are not overpopulating the planet .
For those who balk at the notion that governments should control family sizes , just wait until the growing human population turns twice as much pastureland into desert as is now the case , or when the Amazon is gone , the elephants disappear for good and wars erupt over water , scarce resources and spatial needs .
The point is that Copenhagen 's talking points are beside the point .
The only fix is if all countries drastically reduce their populations , clean up their messes and impose mandatory conservation measures .

North Syracuse , NY - A seventh - grader was suspended from school for creating a Facebook group page that libeled one of her Roxboro Road Middle School teachers in the North Syracuse school district , principal Steve Wolf said .
Twenty - five other Roxboro Road students are paying a price for becoming fans of the group by posting their profile pictures and their real names on the site , Wolf said .
They were ordered to go to after - school detention last Thursday , as well as today and Tuesday , Wolf said .
Some of the students posted derogatory comments on the Facebook page , while others did not , he said .
The content on the Facebook page was obscene in nature , as well as inappropriate , Wolf said .
“ It was done intentionally to hurt this teacher , ” Wolf said .
“ The kid was angry with the teacher .
It ’s unclear why . ”
Superintendent Jerome Melvin urged parents to be cautious of what 's on their childrens ' Facebook pages .
A concerned parent e-mailed Wolf last week to alert him of the Facebook page .
After school resource officer Deputy Christopher Dell looked into the allegation , school officials contacted the seventh - grade girl 's parents .
Her mother , who was unaware of the page , agreed to remove it immediately , Wolf said .
The student is expected to return to school this week .
“ Parents need to monitor what their children are doing .
That ’s not just on the computer or laptops , it ’s their cell phones , iPods and all types of technology that are able to access Facebook and the Internet , ” Wolf said .
“ Until the kids show they are mature enough to handle this , they should set their filters or parental controls available through their Internet provider to filter such content . ”

A new film based on Philip K. Dick 's posthumous , roughly autobiographical novel , Radio Free Albemuth , has begun some informal screenings around Los Angeles .
We saw the film , and spoke to writer / director John Alan Simon about representing the author 's ambivalent life .

Radio
Free is very independent in spirit as well as in style ; it 's hard to recall a feature film made with so few frills and so apparently small a budget .
This may suit the material :
The novel is one of Philip Dick 's most personal but least well known , and offers not one but two characters who stand in for Dick himself .
One , skeptical and hard - bitten , is played by an actor ( Shea Whigham ) who resembles the author almost uncannily — a working - class autodidact with a touch of Kerouac .
The second , sunny , gullible and in love with patterns and ideas , is Dick as he might have become had his life taken a more commercial turn .

Though there 's also a Nixon - like president , a conspiracy theory , and an odd pop-song subplot , the central narrative concerns the divine visions Dick also wrote about in the better know VALIS .
Here 's director Simon , a longtime Dick fan , talking about his journey .
io9 : Radio Free Albemuth is not an obvious Philip Dick novel to film -– it was n't even published during his lifetime .
What made you want to adapt it ?

There 's a simplicity and tenderness to the novel that I think makes it closer to PKD 's mainstream novels than most of his other science - fiction .
I 've always felt that it contains some of his strongest writing .
Radio Free Albemuth is the closest thing to an autobiography that he produced .
The writers who have fascinated me the most —
Dostoevsky , D.H. Lawrence , Henry Miller — never considered their art as something apart from their lives .
The worlds they created and stories they told were intended to be cathartic not only for their audiences but for themselves .

What appealed to me what my take on Radio Free Albemuth as Dick 's way to use his artistry to make sense of his own mystical , almost incomprehensible experiences in the form of a novel — a book in which he made himself one of the main characters .
Not the guy to whom these strange things are happening , but the skeptical best friend .
Advertisement
There 's a warmth and playfulness to the book and the writing that 's not always evident in his science - fiction work .
Religion , politics , dark humor , conspiracy theories , and metaphysics combine in an absolutely original way in this novel .
I 've never felt fully satisfied that any of the other movie adaptations — Blade Runner , Total Recall , Minority Report , Paycheck — captured the most important qualities of his work .
What kind of film aesthetic did you think best suited the book ?
Unlike most of his novels , the story of Radio Free Albemuth is modest in scale and scope .
No flying cars or cosmic battles .
That also appealed to me for the purposes of adapting to film .
Radio Free Albemuth also had a successful run as a play in several cities .
So I felt confident the " dramatic bones " were there to tell an important story .
I could easily see a movie like Drugstore Cowboy or Darren Aronofsky 's Pi coming together from this material .
I wanted to direct a project on modest budget that could be very faithful to the spirit of both the novel and Dick 's whole body of work , which I 've been reading for over twenty - five years now .

The movies that were the most influential for me have been mostly those of the 1970's —
The Conversation , Badlands , Serpico , even John Huston 's Fat City .
In that same mold was an early eighties movie that I really like called Cutter 's Way with Jeff Bridges and John Heard .
Losers living in Santa Barbara who stumble into a sexual - political conspiracy that they 're not equipped to handle .
As a former reporter , I 'm more drawn to real - world behavior than " movie " behavior , so I think I wanted to tell this story in as naturalistic way as possible given the strange quality of the visions themselves that are experienced by Nick Brady , the main character .

I knew that i had to shoot digitally for budgetary reasons , but I wanted a rich filmic look and ended up using the Thompson Viperstream camera , which David Fincher shot both Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button .
We made this movie on a 24 day schedule with close to forty locations and over 30 speaking parts , so it was very logistically extremely challenging .
Some of my favorites films are those of Sam Fuller and Nick Ray , who shot quickly and simply and found the right moments for aesthetic statements .
I did n't want any particular style to overwhelm the material in this case .
I focused on clear story - telling and I think the kind of retro-seventies , eighties style of the film suits the story .

Tell us a little about your use of music in the film .
The backdrop of Radio Free Albemuth is the music business in Los Angeles .
The main character , Nick Brady is a record store clerk who becomes a record company executive .
So music is even more important in this film than usual .

My personal background includes stints writing music reviews for the New Orleans Times Picayune and as a contributing editor to Downbeat magazine .
Whenever I write a script I 'm usually playing music and it often becomes the basis for the music I 'd like to use in the film .
I often thought that Robyn Hitchcock as the kind of pop music equivalent of Philip K. Dick and through an introduction by Alan Rickman , who 's a long time friend of co-producer Elizabeth Karr , we were able to show Robyn a rough cut and recruit him for seven songs in the film .
He also contributed to the score .

The only part that I cast immediately and purely intuitively was the part of Sylvia .
I met with Alanis Morissette after her agents at CAA gave her the script .
After three hours of very intense conversation , I simply offered her the part .
I thought she would be perfect as a kind of modern - day slacker version of Joan of Arc , which is how I describe the character of Sylvia .
What technical and logistical hurdles have to be cleared before the film 's release ?

We 're just in the throes of the final sound mix .
Then the soundtrack is laid back to the high definition master and then we 're really , finally finished .
The hardest aspect has been getting the CGI right on such a limited budget .
Editing was in many ways my favorite part of the process .
My friend , director Walter Hill recommended his own editor , Philip Norden , who happens to be a real science fiction fan .
Philip was nominated for an Emmy here in the U.S. for editing Walter 's mini-series Broken Trail with Robert Duvall .
Philip , like myself and so many others on the film , worked at a fraction of their normal salary " quotes " for the privilege of involvement with such interesting and provocative material .

Personally , I have more tolerance for the slower pacing of non-U.S. movies and experimental cinema .
I just saw the Romanian movie 4 Months , 3 Weeks , 2 Days , and for me it ' s an almost perfect film .
Do you have future plans regarding Dick 's work ?
My producing partner Chip Rosenbloom also have the film rights to Flow My Tears , the Policeman Said and VALIS .
Advertisement
I 've written a treatment for VALIS as a TV series that we may explore .
I also have a concept for VALIS as a sort of sequel to Radio Free Albemuth that would be challenging - but most likely not for me to direct .
I 'd done a spec script for Flow and at one point it was set up with Oliver Stone attached to direct and Tom Cruise to star .
That fell apart and I 've done re-writes for various other directors over the years .
But last year , in collaboration of Electric Shepherd Productions , we entered into a deal with the Halcyon Company , who optioned the book and my script .
Advertisement
I did a re-write which I turned in on the very same day that Halcyon went into bankruptcy over the Terminator franchise debt .
So , I 'm hopeful that in the next few weeks the Terminator financing will be resolved and we can all get back on track with making Flow My Tears , the Policeman Said — finding the right director and actors .

The plants work by generating pressure differentials between warm and cool air at the surface .
Four acres of solar panels sit around a 2,400 - foot - tall chimney , and above turbine - laden tunnels .
The panels heat the air closer to the chimney far faster than the air at the ends of the tunnels .
The warmer , less dense air then serves as a partial vacuum , drawing in the colder , denser air at the edges through the tunnels fast enough to spin the turbines and generate electricity .

Half a century after Jane Goodall began studying chimpanzees in Tanzania , she talks to her former student Charlotte Uhlenbroek about chimpanzee fire - dancing , the peril of bushmeat and the empowerment of local people
“ EVERYBODY studying animals in the wild today needs to be aware of the need for conservation and involving local people .
It ’s rather unfair because when I began my study there were probably over a million wild chimps and the equatorial forest belt stretched across Africa – I was very lucky to be able to concentrate purely on research . ” …

Simpler Scalability , Fault - Tolerance , Concurrency & Remoting through Actors
Akka - Scala Summit OSCON 2010 View more presentations from jboner .
News
Akka 0.9.1 is here .
Download it from http://github.com/jboner/akka/downloads
Akka implements a unique hybrid of :
Actors , which gives you : Simple and high - level abstractions for concurrency and parallelism .
Asynchronous , non-blocking and highly performant event - driven programming model .
Very lightweight event - driven processes ( create ~ 6.5 million actors on 4 G RAM ) .
Failure management through supervisor hierarchies with let - it - crash semantics .
Excellent for writing highly fault - tolerant systems that never stop , systems that self - heal .
Software Transactional Memory ( STM ) .
( Distributed transactions coming soon ) .
Transactors : combine actors and STM into transactional actors .
Allows you to compose atomic message flows with automatic retry and rollback .
Remote actors : highly performant distributed actors with remote supervision and error management .
Cluster membership management .
Scala and Java API .
Akka also has a set of add - on modules :
Persistence : A set of pluggable back - end storage modules that works in sync with the STM .
Cassandra distributed and highly scalable database .
MongoDB document database .
Redis data structures database .
Spring : Wire up typed actors in the Spring config using Akka 's namespace .
REST ( JAX - RS ) : Expose actors as REST services .
Camel : Expose actors as Apache Camel endpoints .
Comet : Expose actors as Comet services .
Security : Digest and Kerberos based security .
Microkernel : Run Akka as a stand - alone self - hosted kernel .
Akka can be used in two different ways :
As a library : used by a web app , to be put into ‘ WEB - INF / lib ’ or as a regular JAR on your classpath .
As a microkernel : stand - alone kernel , embedding a servlet container and all the other modules .
We believe that writing correct concurrent , fault - tolerant and scalable applications is too hard .
Most of the time it 's because we are using the wrong tools and the wrong level of abstraction .
Akka is here to change that .
Using the Actor Model together with Software Transactional Memory we raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications .
For fault - tolerance we adopt the " Let it crash " / " Embrace failure " model which have been used with great success in the telecom industry to build applications that self - heals , systems that never stop .
Actors also provides the abstraction for transparent distribution and the basis for truly scalable and fault - tolerant applications .

Activist Silvia Martinez of the Trans Network of Nicaragua ( REDTRANS ) was denied permission to travel to the United States .
Martinez has been issued visas in the past to other countries and MADRE , an international women ’s rights group and mother - type group to REDTRANS , has previously been allowed to bring other activist speakers to the United States .
MADRE also cited that Martinez met the eligibility requirements for a U.S. visa .
MADRE believes Martinez was denied a visa because she is transgender : “ This discrimination constitutes a violation of internationally recognized human rights , which the US is obligated to uphold . ”
The organization is urging people to write the U.S. embassy in Nicaragua through a convenient action alert , located here .
Update Feb. 10 , 2010 : I was wrong .
Recent discussions indicate that placing optional arguments in - line , as in my first example , is preferred .
In the future , Clojure may have destructuring support for this style .
For now , this post remains a useful guide to map destructuring .
Many languages , such as Python and Ruby , allow functions arguments to be passed as name - value pairs .
People often ask for the same thing in Clojure , and they end up writing something like this :
( defn foo [ a b & options ] ( let [ opts ( apply hash - map options ) ] ... ) ) ( foo 1 2 :optionA 3 :option B 4 )
That works , but it ’s not very efficient .
Every time you call foo , it has to construct a hash - map from its arguments .
That ’s a fair amount of overhead for what is usually a small map of options .
A better way is to use Clojure ’s map binding forms .
The syntax is tricky , but very powerful .
Let ’s look at the general syntax of Clojure ’s local binding form , let :
( let [ bindings ... ] expressions ... )
The bindings are pairs consisting of a binding form and an initialization expression .
The simplest binding pair is just name - value :
( let [ a 1 , b 2 ] ( list a b ) ) ;;=> ( 1 2 )
So far , so good .
You probably know that you can use a vector as the binding form to bind sequential things like lists , vectors , and even strings :
( let [ [ a b c ] " foo " ] ( list a b c ) ) ;;=> ( \f \o \o )
Moving on : A map binding uses a map as the binding form .
Well , duh .
Let ’s call it the binding map .
( catchy , no ? )
The keys of the binding map are the local variables you want to create .
The values of the binding map are keys in the initialization expression .
The locals will be bound to the values of corresponding keys .
How about an example ?
; binding form ; init expression ( let [ {a :keyA , b : keyB} {:keyA 1 , : keyB 2} ] ( list a b ) ) ;;=> ( 1 2 )
You can use the same technique for function arguments :
( defn foo [ {a : keyA , b : keyB} ] ( list a b ) ) ( foo {:keyA 1 : keyB 2} ) ;;=> ( 1 2 )
Notice that we ’re calling foo with a single argument , a map .
This may be slightly less pretty than having key / value pairs directly in the function arguments , but it is more efficient , since the compiler knows exactly how big the argument map is .
It ’s also more flexible , because we can construct the argument map elsewhere and then pass it to the function :
( def options {:keyA 3 , : keyB 4} ) ( foo options ) ;;=> ( 3 4 )
You can also mix normal , positional arguments with map arguments :
( defn foo [ a b {c : keyC , d : keyD} ] ( list a b c d ) ) ( foo 1 2 {:keyC 3 , :keyD 4} ) ;;=> ( 1 2 3 4 )
In the most common case , you probably want your local variables to have the same names as the keywords in the initialization expression .
Clojure has a shortcut for that , a special key in the binding map called , appropriately enough , : keys :
( defn foo [ { : keys [ a b]} ] ( list a b ) ) ( foo {:a 5 , :b 6} ) ;;=> ( 5 6 )
You can also supply a map of default values using another special key in the binding map , the : or key :
( defn foo [ { : keys [ a b c ] , : or {c 42}} ] ( list a b c ) ) ( foo {:a 7 , :b 8 , :c 9} ) ;;=> ( 7 8 9 ) ( foo {:a 20 , :b 30} ) ;;=> ( 20 30 42 )
Finally , what if you want to enforce a requirement that certain keys be present ?
Clojure 1.1 introduced a great way to do that with pre- and postconditions .
You can set a pre-condition that will throw an exception if a particular binding is nil :
( defn foo [ { : keys [ a b c ]} ] {: pre [ ( not ( nil ? c ) ) ] } ( list a b c ) ) ( foo {:a 1 , :c 3} ) ;;=> ( 1 nil 3 ) ( foo {: b 2} ) ;;=> java.lang.AssertionError : Assert failed : ( not ( nil ? c ) )
There are even more features of map binding that I have n’t covered here .
But this should give you enough background to understand the full documentation .
At the start of 2017 , Evan Thomas Weiss was n’t sure that he would make Figure , his long - awaited fourth full - length record under namesake Into It .
Over It .
But built slowly and kindly with the help of his friends , Figure became his commitment to do better and to be better .

Mr. Wiedmann recalls that the state premier at the time told him , “ If you could just do something to revive the zeppelins . ”
With those words to the wise , Mr. Wiedmann pursued the possibility of reviving production and eventually settled on a plan with the leaders of the foundation businesses .
The new zeppelin program wholly insulated Friedrichshafen against suggestions that it had abandoned the foundation ’s original purpose .
“ Since then , it ’s been quiet , ” he said .
There was still the little matter of what to do with the 250 - foot - long airships once they built them .
The reintroduced zeppelins have been used for a variety of purposes , including air - quality testing and crowd surveillance at public events .
They have carried roughly 80,000 tourists for gentle rides in the sky in many locales , including in Germany and Japan .
The fourth and latest model is now in London , captivating tourists with a bird ’s eye view of the city before the airship begins a slow journey on a cargo ship to its future home in the San Francisco Bay Area .
There , its new owners , Airship Ventures , intend for it to ferry tourists and carry scientific equipment aloft for testing and research .
Perhaps the unlikeliest mission for the new generation of zeppelins was treasure hunter .
The prototype ended up in Botswana , where the company DeBeers used it in diamond exploration .
That was also where the prototype met its demise last year , wrecked by a dust devil that hit the ship while it was on the ground .
In America , the zeppelin is still best known for the stunning 1937 Hindenburg disaster in Lakehurst , N.J. , which claimed the lives of 36 crew members and passengers .
But here in Friedrichshafen , the airships stand for the technological advancement on which the city prides itself .
Their oblong silhouette is found on everything from beer bottles and business cards to the jungle gym near the waterfront where children play .
The airships are proof that flying can still be a joy and a prod to the imagination .
The experience is singular enough that tickets start selling at $ 300 for half an hour ’s flight .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation can't believe it : the FCC 's network neutrality draft rules , if adopted in their current form , might give Comcast permission to flat - out block BitTorrent — precisely the scenario that led to the rules being drafted .
It 's a shocking claim , if true .
Could FCC Chair Julius Genachowski's big push for network neutrality actually authorize the very conduct it was ( ostensibly ) drafted to prevent , indiscriminate blocking of the bluntest kind ?
A massive loophole ?
The EFF is concerned about a particular pair of clauses in the current draft rules ( PDF ) for network neutrality .
Those clauses impose no obligation on ISPs to permit " the transfer of unlawful content " or the " unlawful transfer of content . "
In other words , ISPs do n't have to be " neutral " about illegal content , and those trafficking in it can't complain to the FCC is their content is slowed , blocked , throttled , folded , spindled , or mutilated .
If there was any doubt about this , another section of the draft rules make it clear : " Furthermore , we have no intention of protecting unlawful activities in these rules . "
Fred von Lohmann , an EFF copyright lawyer , sees danger here .
" That means that so long as your ISP claims that it 's trying to prevent copyright infringement , it 's exempted from the net neutrality principles and can interfere with your ability to access lawful content , use lawful devices , run lawful applications , or access lawful services , " he said last week .
Today , the EFF ramped up the rhetoric , saying that the rules have " a loophole that would theoretically permit Comcast to block BitTorrent just like it did in 2007 — simply by claiming that it was ' reasonable network management ' intended to ' prevent the unlawful transfer of content . ' "
But it 's important to remember that the rule is n't new .
The FCC's Internet policy statement ( PDF ) , drafted back in 2005 by a very different FCC , set out four " Internet freedoms . "
The first said that " consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice . "
The policy statement never provided protection for unlawful content .
It was this policy statement that was regularly cited in the Comcast case , when the ISP was accused of interfering with BitTorrent traffic , regardless of the content being transferred .
The company received a wet - towel - snap - to - the - backside from the FCC for its actions .
The other key point is that the new draft rules do not craft an exception to net neutrality for ISPs who are " trying " to stop unlawful content transmission ; the exception only applies to actual transfers of unlawful material .
Under the EFF 's reading of these provisions , an ISP could simply throttle all Web streaming video traffic on the grounds that some of it is unlawful .
An ISP could block access to BitTorrent .
Particular Web sites like The Pirate Bay could simply be blocked wholesale .
Services like Rapidshare could be axed on the same ground .
Access to Usenet could be curtailed .
In essence , anything could be blocked so long as ISPs could show they were " trying " to stop unlawful content .
Fortunately , this is n't what the draft rules say ; the exception only applies to content that is in fact unlawful .
The flip side of this is a positive statement : " The nondiscrimination principle would prohibit broadband Internet access service providers from favoring or disfavoring lawful content , applications , or services accessed by their subscribers . "
That 's pretty clear .
Any ISP that attempts to do something like block BitTorrent outright would quickly block " lawful content " and would run afoul of the new nondiscrimination principle .
The " reasonable " trump card
But von Lohmann 's a sharp lawyer , and he 's not crazy .
So what is he talking about ?
What appears to worry him is the fact that the exceptions both exist under the broader heading of " network management . "
And " network management " is defined as " reasonable practices employed by a provider of broadband Internet access service . "
Thus the worry — could an ISP get away with claiming that some particular block is " reasonable " ?
What if 70 percent of the content blocked was unlawful — would that be " reasonable " ?
What about 80 percent ?
90 ? 95 ?
Future administrations might well agree that throttling a P2P protocol is reasonable , given that some high percentage of its content is unlawful .
And you can bet that groups like RIAA and MPAA will try to make this happen .
The draft rules do address this scenario , though .
The FCC says that " it appears reasonable for a broadband Internet access service provider to refuse to transmit copyrighted material if the transfer of that material would violate applicable laws . "
But it adds that " such a rule would be consistent with the Comcast Network Management Practices Order , in which the Commission stated that ' providers , consistent with federal policy , may block ... transmissions that violate copyright law . ' "
In other words , this is n't quite a free for all in which the rules on being " reasonable " could be twisted to justify any practice .
The FCC provides explicit guidance on dealing with copyrighted works , and that guidance says clearly that ISPs cannot block an entire protocol like BitTorrent ( this was the Comcast order being referenced ) as they seek to stop the unlawful transfer of copyrighted works .
The rulemaking on net neutrality is ongoing , and the FCC was n't willing to comment officially on interpretations of the draft rules .
However , FCC sources did make clear to Ars that , in their view , the draft rules would not lead to the EFF 's nightmare scenario .
It is important to note that the FCC is conducting its rulemaking in order to learn about potential problems with its ideas , and the language of the rules may still be tweaked significantly .
What is crystal clear is that the draft rules do allow targeted ISP blocking of illegal content on P2P networks , assuming that the particular method of identifying such traffic passes legal muster ( i.e. , is n't classed as " wiretapping , " which is a potential pitfall of deep packet inspection methods ) .
As footnote 230 notes , " We also propose that broadband Internet access service providers may take action to counter unwanted or harmful traffic such as spam and malware , may decline to carry unlawful traffic , or may decline to carry traffic if the transfer of the content is prohibited by law , including copyright law . "
ANDREW SULLIVAN asks :
If Liz Cheney were not her father 's daughter , why would she be on the Sunday talk shows ?
Why is she added to ABC news ' roster ?
What experience does she have in journalism or government ?
Elizabeth Cheney actually has substantial experience in government .
She worked in the State Department for several years after college .
After law school in the mid-90s she worked for the World Bank 's International Finance Corporation and as a USAID officer at a few embassies .
The crucial moment , though , was in 2002 , when she was appointed deputy assistant secretary of state for near - eastern affairs .
At the time of the appointment , the Washington Post 's Dana Milbank wrote a piece on the pattern of nepotistic appointments in the Bush Administration , and Paul Krugman used Ms Cheney as evidence of a broad - based return of nepotism in American society .
Ms Cheney later served as principal deputy assistant secretary of state for near - eastern affairs .
( Her portfolio involved promoting democracy and civil society , and promoting America 's image ; the Bush Administration conceived of these two tasks as identical , which explains in large measure why it did such a lousy job of both . )
The problem with Ms Cheney is not inexperience , but family connections .
Her appointment to powerful State Department positions , like her husband Philip Perry 's appointment as general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security , was part of a self - reinforcing habit of nepotism and insularity that plagued George W Bush 's administration .
Mr Cheney famously appointed supremely loyal associates throughout the government , allowing him to exercise influence through vertical channels in the State Department , Defence Department , Department of Justice and elsewhere , and ensuring him a degree of power never before seen in a vice president .
But his reliance on such loyal associates ultimately trapped him inside an echo chamber of bad advice on issues such as torture and military intervention abroad .
The reason why you should n't appoint your daughter as your surrogate inside the State Department is n't necessarily that she lacks the relevant experience .
It is that your daughter is very likely to give you an inflated sense of your own genius , and that relying for strategic advice on a familial clique is likely to drive you into a blind corner of actions that only look defensible to people who are related to you .
I recently watched an interesting video lecture on stealing botnets .
A group of researchers at UCSB recently managed to take control over a part of Torpig botnet for 10 days .
During this time , they observed 180 thousand infections and recorded almost 70 GB of data that bots collected .
This data included submitted form information from all the websites the infected person had visited , smtp , ftp , pop3 , windows , passwords , credit card numbers and passwords from various password managers .
Here are the most interesting facts from the lecture :
Torpig uses a technique called " domain fluxing " to avoid being shut down by simply blocking the IP or the domain name of control center servers .
The idea is simple - depending on date and time the algorithm generates a domain name to connect to .
If the domain gets shut down , the bots will simply use a different domain after some time .
The researchers were able to take control over a part of the botnet by cracking the domain name generating algorithm and registering some of the domain names to be used for communication in the future .
The bad guys noticed that a part of botnet has been taken over and issued a software update to all bots to use a new domain flux algorithm , which used Twitter 's popular topics for the day to generate domain names .
It was no longer possible to predict the domain that would be used tomorrow .
When communicating with command & control server , the bots included a unique id field that was generated from machine 's hardware .
This allowed researchers to estimate the real number of unique computers infected .
Researchers saw 1.2 million unique IP addresses but only 180k unique machines .
The bots would steal financial data from 410 financial institutions ( top 5 : PayPal , Poste Italiane , Capital One , E* Trade , Chase ) , they would log credit card information ( top 5 cards : Visa , Mastercard , American Express , Maestro , Discover ) , and they would also steal all the passwords from browser 's password manager .
In a 2008 study Symantec estimated that credit card information is valued at $.10 to $ 25 per card in the underground market .
The bank account information is valued at $ 10.00 to $ 1,000 per account .
Using this study , researchers estimated that during 10 day period the amount of financial data bots collected were worth $ 83 k to $ 8.3 million .
Using various estimations researchers calculated that if the bots are used for denial of service the total bandwidth would be 17 Gbps .
Researchers observed that there was a fraction of people who'd fill out the phishing page and then immediately email the company 's security group telling that they may have been victims of identity theft .
Since Torpig was sending all the HTTP POST data and emails to command & control servers , researchers did statistics on emails and found out that 14 % of all captured emails were about jobs and resumes , 10 % discussed computer security / malware , 7 % discussed money , 6 % were sports fans , 5 % were worried about exams and their grades , 4 % were seeking partners online .
Researchers collected 300,000 unique credentials on 370,000 websites .
28 % of people reused their password on multiple domains .
There were 173,686 unique passwords .
Researchers converted the passwords in Unix format and tried to crack them with John the Ripper .
56,000 were cracked in less than 65 minutes using brute - force .
Using a wordlist 14,000 passwords were cracked in the next 10 minutes .
And another 30,000 passwords were cracked in the next 24 hours .
That 's 58 % of all passwords cracked in 24 hours .

That annual cap on benefits that was supposed to have been out of the bill but we found out was slipped back in ?
The one that the blogs raised hell about ?
It 's out , mostly .
The very first provision of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's Manager 's Amendment would explicitly prohibit insurers from imposing either annual or lifetime limits .
A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish — ( A ) lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary ; or ( B ) except as provided in paragraph ( 2 ) , annual limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary .
The regulation goes into effect in 2014 and prior to that they can still impose them on " non-essential benefits " and " the dollar value of essential benefits only as the secretary shall determine . "
So there will be government oversight from 2010 until 2014 , and up to the Secretary of HHS to determine the outlines of what 's allowed .
( As an aside , here 's an interesting catch by Jon Walker .
When Reid 's office said the CBO demanded this loophole because premiums would go through the roof without it , well , that 's not what the CBO says now . )

to increase funding for Community Health Centers is pretty much an unequivocal good for extending actual care -- not just coverage , but care - - to people .
The not quite unequivocal good but improvement is the medical loss ratio , the amount insurers spend out of every premium dollar that does n't go to care .
Rockefeller wanted it set at 90 % , it 's set at 80 % for individual plans , 85 % for group plans .
Insurers who exceed the limits would have to pay rebates to policyholders .
Except , there 's this problem as identified by Jon Walker .
On page 12 of the bill [ pdf ] : ( d) ADJUSTMENTS .
— The Secretary may adjust the rates described in subsection ( b ) if the Secretary determines appropriate on account of the volatility of the individual market due to the establishment of State Exchanges .
So the Secretary of HHS can gut this requirement at will .
But it 's better than not having it at all .

There is a critical fix to what was a big hole regarding national plans .
Originally the bill national plans in which insurers could sell policies in any of the states in the compact .
The insurer would only be subject to the laws and regulations in the state where it was based , and would n't have to comply with stricter regs in other states .
That 's been replaced by the OPM provision .

On a more serious , and progressive note , it also increases the Medicare payroll tax by 0.9 points for individuals making more than $ 200,000 per year and married couples earning above $ 250,000 , a much better financing choice than the excise tax ( which is still there ) .
Many of these issues are ones that the blogosphere , particularly Jon Walker at FDL , have been hammering on for weeks , which is instructive for future efforts .
Sometimes when you 're being exhorted to get on the " pass the bill " bandwagon , it makes sense to counter with " fix the bill . "
What 's still very problematic :
The Nelson amendment is marginally better than Stupak , but stil creates the same battleground , just moving it to the states .

The excise tax , ( which is not in the House bill ) which the CBO itself says will affect 19 % of people with employer - provided insurance in 2016 .
In 2019 , six years after this bill takes effect , the excise tax will affect one in five taxpayers making $ 50 - $ 75,000 per year , and the average tax impact on this bracket will rise to $ 1,100 a year in 2019 .
In addition , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS , another CBO - like organization ) predicts that the excise tax will actually make coverage worse for very little return in savings .
In reaction to the tax , many employers would reduce the scope of their health benefits .
The resulting reductions in covered services and / or increases in employee cost - sharing requirements would induce workers to use fewer services .
Because plan benefit values would generally increase faster than the threshold amounts for defining high - cost plans ( which are indexed by the CPI plus 1 percent ) , over time additional plans would become subject to the excise tax , prompting those employers to scale back coverage .
The savings ?
This excise tax , which would reduce the quality of millions of Americans ’ health insurance coverage , will technically " bend the cost curve " by just barely 0.3 % in 2019 .
All that for a measly 0.3 % reduction in national health expenditures .
To give you a comparison , CBO projects that Dorgan ’s drug re-importation would reduce spending on prescription drugs roughly $ 100 billion over the next decade ( I think the savings could easily end up 4 - 5 times that amount ) .
A $ 10 billion reduction in prescription drug spending compared to the total NHE spending last year , which was roughly $ 2.4 trillion in 2008 , would be a 0.4 % reduction in NHE .

In 2019 , six years after this bill takes effect , the excise tax will affect one in five taxpayers making $ 50 - $ 75,000 per year , and the average tax impact on this bracket will rise to $ 1,100 a year in 2019 .
The mandate remains , with a larger fine for those who do n't purchase coverage attached .
Perhaps that 's in response to the calculations done showing that it would be cheaper for people to pay the fine than to maintain coverage under the junk insurance plans that are still going to be allowed in the newly " reformed " system .
The exemption for those who can prove they can't afford coverage is maintained .

There is no public option of any kind in the Senate bill , no opt - out , no Medicare buy - in .
Just the two national private plans , one of which would be non-profit , that would be overseen by the Office of Personnel Management .
The CBO says it 's questionable whether " insurers would be interested in offering such plans is unclear , and establishing a nationwide plan comprising only nonprofit insurers might be particularly difficult . "
Note , even should a national non-profit be set up by an insurer , it is not the equivalent of the public option .

The primary issues of affordability -- what middle class consumers are likely to end up having to continue to pay for healthcare - - has n't been changed and is still too high .
The House bill is better in structuring its plans than the Senate - - that 's one key to push for in conference .
Then there 's what 's still murky , and that gets back to the insurance reforms and just how effective they will be :
California recently dropped an attempt to enforce its anti-rescission law against a major insurer , saying that it was financially outgunned by the insurer 's legal team .
The rescission law , according to the legislation , " shall not apply to a covered individual who has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud or makes an intentional misrepresentation of material fact as prohibited by the terms of the plan or coverage . "
Insurers today routinely claim that patients engaged in " fraud " or " intentional misrepresentation " when dropping them from coverage .
Much depends on who defines the terms in the bill .
It wo n't be the federal government .
There will be no federal agency tasked with overseeing the enforcement of the bill 's rules .
Rather , a Senate leadership aide told reporters in a briefing Saturday , individual states will police the new system .
That 's a task the California Department of Managed Health Care was unable to perform when battling Anthem Blue Cross , which has rescinded 1,770 policies since 2004 .
" In each and every one of those rescissions , [ Blue Cross has ] the right to contest each , and that could tie us up in court forever , " the department 's director , Cindy Ehnes , told The Associated Press .
A million - dollar fine was announced in March 2007 , but has not been enforced .
If the enforcement for these regulations falls on the individual states , and the individual states will have to litigate them , which could take a very long time in each case .
The regulations are unlikely to be uniformly enforced state to state -- some of them have extremely proactive insurance commissioners and strong regulatory structures in place , others do n't .
And in the states that do n't , do n't expect insurers to end some of these practices out of the goodness of their hearts .
Bottom line , Americans are still going to be forced to buy insurance that for too many people will be unaffordable .
As long as that 's the case , and until there 's a true alternative public option that provides people real choice , the insurance companies should n't get that one thing in the legislation they want : the mandate .

Other than the few hiccups described here , STO has been running quite well .
Which is good , considering the amount of users online .
There are also a few surprises that were n't available in the previous closed and open betas
We wo n't give any spoilers , but the new cut scene will make your inner
Trek fan " live long and prosper " .
It is said by some on the left that the Communist Party USA has no differences with President Obama .
Just to set the record straight : we do and we express them .
For example , we opposed the nearly unconditional Wall Street bailouts and deployment of more troops to Afghanistan .
We argued for a bigger stimulus package .
And we said the president should push the envelope more ; otherwise he runs the danger of the extreme right turning the popular discontent over the economic crisis against him , the Democratic Party , and the people ’s movement that supports his agenda .
Is n’t this what we saw in Tuesday ’s election in Massachusetts , where a right - winger was elected to the Senate ?
But in expressing our differences with the president , communists go to great lengths to state them in a constructive and unifying way .
We do n’t do it to score points or demonstrate our “ militancy . ”
We do n’t lose sight of the class nature of this struggle .
The main organizations of the working class and people are not always in sync with the president on every issue either .
But they do n’t turn their differences into an unbridgeable divide between them and him .
In fact , they consider him a friend and are mindful of the unrelenting attack , steeped in racism and other forms of division , coming from right - wing extremists , against our nation ’s first African American president – something that was so evident in the Senate election in Massachusetts .
The left has something to learn from the approach of these people ’s organizations .
We are too comfortable in our role as an exceedingly small , but “ principled and militant ” grouping in U.S. politics .
Such a posture , which could easily gain greater currency in the aftermath of Tuesday ’s election , may feel satisfying , but it wo n’t help us evolve into a political player that exercises a major influence on U.S. politics nor get us a flea hop closer to socialism .
In my view , the president has made mistakes , particularly his handling of the financial , jobs and health care crises , but he is n’t the main obstacle to social change ; he is not the “ enemy , ” or even an “ enemy . ”
President Obama is a reformer , not a socialist reformer , not a radical reformer , and not even a consistent anti-corporate reformer , but a reformer nonetheless whose agenda creates space for the broader people ’s movement to deepen and extend the reform process in a non-revolutionary period .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were Democratic Party regulars , but , with the help of a popular and sustained insurgency , both of them stepped outside of their comfort zone and morphed into change - makers , thus opening up space for substantive reform – Roosevelt with the New Deal and Johnson with civil and voting rights , Medicare , federal aid for education and the “ War on Poverty . ”
Unfortunately , Johnson ’s mistaken decision to escalate the war in Vietnam stained , perhaps irreparably , his presidency and historical legacy .
Barack Obama in my opinion has the same potential to “ grow on the job ” and enact reforms that measurably improve the lives of the American people and reframe our nation ’s place in the world .
Right - wing extremists and powerful sections of capital feel much the same .
Hence , the formidable opposition striving to sabotage , block or contain even the tiniest reforms by any means necessary .
To make matters much more difficult , the broad coalition supporting reform is not yet of sufficient size , strength and understanding to consistently elect people ’s candidates as well as guarantee passage of the president ’s reform agenda – let alone radical reforms such as sustainable and just economic development , a national “ profit - free ” health service , a massive full employment program with affirmative action and living wage guarantees , fully funded , integrated , quality public education from child care to college , and a new foreign policy that accents peace , cooperation , equitable relations and a commitment to end global poverty .
Until that movement is at such a level , it is premature to say what the political limits of this president are , or , to put it differently , smugly dismiss him as simply another Clintonian Democrat .
When our movement reaches the level of the popular upsurges of the 1930s and ’60s , we will be in a better position to say where he fits on the political spectrum and whether his views are elastic enough to accommodate more deep - going changes .
Do n’t think we will succeed if the Obama presidency fails .
If it fails , we will once again be fighting an uphill , defensive struggle as we were in the Bush and Reagan years , or worse .
Witness the election of Republican Scott Brown to the Senate .
There will inevitably be differences and tensions with this White House as we go forward .
In most instances , the differences will pivot around the pace and depth of reform ; in some instances , such as the decision to escalate the war in Afghanistan , the differences are more fundamental .
The role of the left is to help navigate these differences , while at the same time infusing energy and clarity and sustaining the strategic unity of the people ’s movement against the main enemy – right - wing extremism and powerful sections of big capital .
This admittedly is a difficult needle to thread , but , as we know from the experience of the 1930s and ’60s , it was done then .
And there is no reason to think that it ca n’t be done now .
In doing so , the left of our time will move into the center of U.S politics .
On the heels of its $ 1.5 million victory against a Queenslander for uploading a copy of New Super Mario Bros to the internet , Nintendo Australia has reportedly won a landmark lawsuit against a local distributor of the R4 cartridge which allows users to pirate Nintendo DS games .
Nintendo has not yet responded to a request for comment , and the other party , RSJ IT Solutions , who operates the gadgetgear.com .au website declined to comment on the matter .
The reported judgement has not yet been made available online .
But iTnews.com.au today reported that the Federal Court of Australia had today ordered that RSJ cease to sell the chip and pay Nintendo $ 520,000 in damages .
Two affiliated respondents , Patrick Li and James Li , were also named in the case , and ordered to pay Nintendo a further $ 100,000 .
The R4 cartridge — which is popular internationally — runs its own operating system for Nintendo ’s DS handheld device .
Individual games and other applications , some of them purporting to be legal , can be downloaded from the internet as small files and simply added to the chip ’s storage .
The cartridge is then slotted into the top of a Nintendo DS as any other cartridge would be .
It does not permanently modify the handheld console .
It is sold by a number of Australian and international distributors
The news comes as Nintendo Australia appears to be ramping up its fight against game piracy .
Last week it was revealed that it had successfully sued a Queensland resident for uploading to the internet a copy of its Wii game New Super Mario Bros a week before its Australian release in November last year .
The Queenslander — named by multiple media outlets as James Burt — has been ordered by the Federal Court to pay Nintendo $ 1.5 million .
At the time , Nintendo said it would pursue anyone who breached its intellectual property rights “ using all means available to it under the law ” .

On his radio show today Rush Limbaugh had a heart to heart talk with Obama where offered to guide Obama and be the father that he never had .
Limbaugh said , “ Let me be the father that you never had or never really knew , because I think you need some guidance . ”
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :

Limbaugh said , “ I penned a message to Obama that I would like to deliver now , because Mr. Obama I think it ’s time we had a heart to heart talk .
Let me be the father that you never had or never really knew , because I think you need some guidance .
It ’s time to man up .
It ’s time to grow up .
That speech last night was an embarrassment .
You could n’t focus .
You lashed out in all directions .
You refused to accept responsibility for your own actions , and you were angry , and he was , folks he was mad .
Being president is a big job .
It ’s a big responsibility .
You wanted the position , Barack .
You campaigned for it .
You told the public to trust you with it , and they elected you , and you ’re now president of the greatest country mankind has ever known , and yet you act like this was all coming to you , like you deserve it , that you are better than the people you are supposed to serve , and that you have no tolerance for debate or dissent . ”
What address was Limbaugh watching last night ?
He overlooked all of the reaching out that the president did , just so that he could label Obama the angry , unqualified , elitist , black man .
Did it ever occur to Limbaugh that his message came off like an old angry white guy who was trying to put a black man in his place .
It is laughable that Limbaugh , a man who has never had the guts to run for anything thinks that he is qualified to lecture the president .
We should play this rant of Limbaugh ’s in schools all around America to demonstrate to children the dangers of long term drug abuse , because Rush ’s mind is fried .
His message to Obama was more like a bad Saturday Night Live skit that airs after midnight than serious message to president .
I am sure that President Obama would rather have no father over a drugged out sleaze ball who left the reality the rest of us know long ago .

Although it is not yet official , Ubuntu ’s next release looks likely to include a music store service similar to Apple ’s iTunes .
The first hint that Ubuntu developers were considering a music store came in September last year when Canonical chief Mark Shuttleworth announced plans for Lucid Lynx , the next version of Ubuntu .
At the time Shuttleworth made vague references to an Amazon - and iTunes - like music store for the next release .
Since then the noise around an Ubuntu music store has grown into a coherent direction and a number of details suggest that the Ubuntu One Music Store is on track for possible inclusion in Lucid Lynx which is scheduled to be released in April this year .
The most obvious clue to the Ubuntu One Music Store is the wiki page outlining plans for the product .
Among other details , the wiki explains the Ubuntu One Music Store objective as such :
“ The Lucid music store project aims to deliver the ability to purchase music from within a desktop music player .
The overriding requirement of the project is to minimise engineering effort .
This will be achieved through the usage of off the shelf solutions with minimal modifications .
Only changes classified as blockers will fall within scope of this project .
No effort will be expended towards improving the user experience of the default off the shelf components . ”
The name of the music store – Ubuntu One – comes from the fact that the music store will be linked to Ubuntu One , the online cloud storage service provided by Ubuntu .
According to the specifications users will log into the music store using their existing Ubuntu One username .
Although the service will be linked to the Ubuntu One service users are expected to be able to use a number of existing desktop media players to access the store , including Rhythmbox and Banshee , as well as a Web - based interface .
Already a Rhythmbox plugin for the Ubuntu One Music Store is listed in Ubuntu ’s blueprints .
Amazon
With plans clearly in place to roll out a music store for Ubuntu the obvious question is whether Canonical will create a brand new music store specifically for the Ubuntu One Music Store or choose to partner with an existing service .
On the one hand it does n’t really make sense for Canonical to start from scratch with a new music store which is not core to its business .
On the other hand , an integrated music store could win a lot of fans for Ubuntu .
Assuming that Canonical does n’t build its own music store then it is safe to say that a likely partner will be Amazon , rather than Apple .
Apple has done everything it can over the years to thwart iTunes support for Linux , and each new iPod release appears to be designed to break compatibility with existing Linux iTunes connectors .
With that history in mind Apple is an unlikely partner for Ubuntu .
Amazon , on the other hand , already offers a version of its MP3 downloader for most popular Linux flavours , including Ubuntu , Debian , Fedora and OpenSuse .
This support could presumably be extended to incorporate an Ubuntu One Music Store .
The one catch , however , is that the Amazon MP3 store is limited at this point to US customers .
Ubuntu ’s Lucid Lynx will be released in April this year when questions around the Ubuntu One Music store will be clarified but for now it does appear that Ubuntu ’s music plans are more than just speculation .

The much - anticipated showdown between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather , tentatively scheduled for March 13 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas , has collapsed , Top Rank promoter Bob Arum told ESPN.com on Wednesday night .
" The fight 's off , " Arum , who promotes Pacquiao , said from Las Vegas .
The fight died after a last - ditch attempt at mediation between Top Rank and Golden Boy , which represents Mayweather , failed in an effort to determine the drug - testing protocol .
Pacquiao had agreed to move off his hard - line stance of refusing a blood test inside 30 days before the fight , but Mayweather would n't budge off his desire for random testing all the way until the fight , Arum said .
Nor would Mayweather agree to a public apology for remarks he made accusing Pacquiao of using performance - enhancing drugs , Arum said .
" I am very disappointed that we could not make this fight for the fans and I am angered because of the false accusations from Golden Boy and the Mayweather camp that I used some type of drugs , and that is why I have instructed our American lawyers to proceed with the lawsuit to clear my name , " Pacquiao said in a statement .
Arum said Pacquiao would move on and likely fight junior middleweight titlist Yuri Foreman on March 13 or March 20 .
The fight was to have been on HBO PPV , a sure blockbuster many believed would break the all - time pay - per- view record of 2.44 million buys set by Mayweather 's 2007 fight with Oscar De La Hoya , who owns Golden Boy Promotions .
But Arum said he had informed HBO PPV boss Mark Taffet that the fight was off .
Had the fight done the monster numbers organizers expected , it would have likely generated in the neighborhood of $ 200 million with the fighters receiving roughly $ 40 million apiece .
Richard Schaefer , the CEO of Golden Boy and the point person for the company on the negotiations , did not return multiple messages .
The sides had negotiated every point of the deal except for the drug testing procedures .
The fighters agreed to unlimited random urine testing , but Mayweather insisted on random blood testing as well , even though the Nevada State Athletic Commission , which would regulate the fight , requires only urine testing .
Pacquiao ( 50 - 3 - 2 , 38 KOs ) did n't want any blood testing but had agreed to take three blood tests : one during the week of the kickoff news conference , which would have taken place next week ; one random test to be conducted no later than 30 days before the fight ; and a final test in his dressing room after the fight .
Mayweather ( 40 - 0 , 25 KOs ) would have been subject to the same testing procedures .
When they could not come to an agreement on the drug testing , they enlisted the aid of a mediator , retired judge Daniel Weinstein , who successfully mediated a series of disputes between Top Rank and Golden Boy , which represents Mayweather , in June of 2007 .
At the center of the problem was ownership of the promotional rights to Pacquiao , who had signed contracts with both companies before eventually pledging his loyalty to Top Rank .
Under the settlement , Top Rank got Pacquiao's contract with Golden Boy retaining a small percentage .
With lawyers at their side , Top Rank 's Arum , company president Todd duBoef , Golden Boy 's Schaefer and De La Hoya , along with Mayweather adviser Al Haymon , spent nine hours in mediation on Tuesday in Santa Monica , Calif .
The sides struck a deal during the marathon session Tuesday , but it was contingent on getting the fighters to sign off , Arum said .
On Wednesday , they were back in their offices -- Golden Boy in Los Angeles and Top Rank in Las Vegas -- and worked the phones with their clients while still under Weinstein 's gag order not to talk to the media .
Arum said Pacquiao agreed to ease his demands on the drug testing window but Mayweather would n't .
Arum said Pacquiao agreed to shorten the window for a blood test to 24 days before the fight .
In order to receive a Nevada boxing license , Pacquiao took the standard annual blood test 24 days before his May 2009 fight with Ricky Hatton .
" Manny accepted what was on the table and Mayweather rejected it , " Arum said .
" Haymon and Schaefer tried to convince Floyd all [ Tuesday night ] and [ Wednesday ] and he would n't agree to it .
He did n't want the fight .
He never wanted the fight .
I always knew the fight would n't happen . "
The drug testing became a major issue when Floyd Mayweather Sr. , the father of the fighter , made several public remarks accusing Pacquiao of using performance - enhancing drugs without a shred of proof .
Mayweather Jr. later made similar remarks about Pacquiao using PEDs , even though Pacquiao denies it and has never failed a drug test .
" When the fight was offered , Manny accepted it with no hesitation , " Pacquiao adviser Michael Koncz told ESPN.com from the Philippines , where he was with Pacquiao .
" We 're not surprised .
We saw this coming once they started this drug bull ----.
It was a way for them to get out of the fight .
I do n't think Mayweather expected Manny to accept the challenge so quickly . "
The accusations led Pacquiao to file a defamation lawsuit last week in Nevada U.S. District Court against Mayweather Jr. , Schaefer , Golden Boy president De La Hoya , Floyd Mayweather Sr. , Roger Mayweather and Mayweather Promotions .
" The guys who should be most disappointed in the fight being off are Schaefer and De La Hoya because they went along with this guy [ Mayweather ] and ended up with gatz and a big lawsuit , " Arum said .
Said Koncz : " We agreed to move the drug testing to 24 days under the supervision of the Nevada commission and Mayweather still would n't budge .
So now what we 've done is give up maybe $ 40 million to take a stand for Manny 's principles .
We will proceed with the lawsuit in an effort to clear his name and tarnished image .
Even if they make a public apology it 's not enough .
Now they 'll have to prove to a judge that Manny is on drugs , which they wo n't be able to do because he 's not .
Manny is pissed off because he feels Floyd is a chicken and because he tarnished his reputation .
This is about principle .
We have nothing to hide . "
Golden
Boy also risks losing its share in Pacquiao 's contract , Arum said .
" There 's an arbitration which calls for them to lose any percentage of Manny 's promotional contract , something we asked for and had postponed , but now it will go forward , " Arum said .
" We did that two weeks ago before Manny filed his lawsuit .
It 's binding arbitration .
Our request was for Golden Boy to forfeit its interest in Pacquiao 's contract based on the fact that they had demeaned Pacquiao with their remarks [ alleging he used PEDs ] and that it violated the [ 2007 ] agreement between Pacquiao , Top Rank and Golden Boy . "
Arum now plans on moving forward with Pacquiao facing Foreman , who won his 154 - pound title on the Nov. 14 undercard of Pacquiao 's 12th - round knockout of Miguel Cotto to win a welterweight belt .
Pacquiao would move up in weight to try to win a title in his eighth division .
Pacquiao already holds the record , having won titles in seven divisions .
Mayweather could also still fight on another date in March , potentially against former junior welterweight titlist Paulie Malignaggi .
" We 're going to talk to the MGM because they 're out of a fight , " Arum said .
Arum added that the fight could also wind up at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas or perhaps in Dallas , where Cowboys owner Jerry Jones made a strong pitch to bring Pacquiao - Mayweather to his new stadium .

Talk about long haul : Arctic terns travel 44,000 miles EVERY year ... but they do have a pit stop near Britain
The arctic tern may only weigh a quarter of pound but the dauntless bird will travel the equivalent of three return trips to the moon during its lifetime .
Scientists including a team from the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) made the discovery after attaching tiny tracking devices to terns to map their mammoth migrations .
Arctic
Tern with a geolocator tracking device attached to its leg .
The bird was tracked on its epic journey from pole to pole
The results verified what has been suspected for decades , the small seabird makes an average journey of 44,000 miles each year , making it the longest annual migration in the world .
Arctic terns fly from pole to pole from their breeding grounds in Greenland to the Weddell Sea on the shores of Antarctica .
However , the birds do allows themselves a fuel stop of almost a month in a fish - rich area in the middle of the North Atlantic ocean .
They continue down the coast of north - west Africa but at the Cape Verde Islands half travel along the African coast while the rest cross the Atlantic and fly down the east coast of South America .
Migration patterns of the Arctic tern , from the breeding sites in Greenland and Iceland to the winter grounds at Antarctica .
The birds take a month - long break in the Northern Atlantic to refuel
The return trip north in spring is twice as fast in a giant ' S ' pattern .
The detour of several thousand miles takes advantage of prevailing global winds to help the birds preserve energy .
Study leader Carsten Egevang , from the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources , said : ' This study on seabird migration has given us an incredibly detailed insight into how long - distance migrants behave at times of the year when it 's normally impossible for us to follow them . '
Arctic terns can live up to 34 years .
When the scientists added up the total distance each bird flew during its lifetime they found it equalled three round trips to the Moon - or more than 1.25 million miles .
' This is a mind - boggling achievement for a bird of just over 100 grams , ' said Mr Egevang .
The cost of transitioning from proprietary software to open source could outweigh any benefits of making the switch , according to the Australian Government Information Management Office ( AGIMO ) .
AGIMO 's policy and planning division general manager Graham Fry told a Senate Estimates Committee hearing that scoping the potential for a platform change could cost more than it saves .
" Agencies are obliged to consider value for money on each occasion they apply a software , " he said .
" That means considering value for money between the alternatives of open source and proprietary software .
" If the cost of assessing it was greater than the cost of the software , you would have to think twice . "
The Government spent over $ 500 million on software annually , according to 2008 - 09 data from the senate 's Finance and Public Administration committee .
A 2007 AGIMO survey revealed that 68 percent of government agencies were either piloting or using open source software .
But further questioning from Greens Senator Scott Ludlam yesterday revealed research had not been undertaken since .
AGIMO took on notice a suggestion that the research be revisited .
Centrelink , the Australian Bureau of Statistics and National Archives of Australia were known to use open source products ; however , it was up to individual agencies to make procurement decisions , AGIMO said .
Greens spokesperson Senator Scott Ludlam had been pushing for the government to adopt open source software to promote openness and reduce costs .
While open source software may reduce licensing costs , the cost of support could be an issue .
" Open source does not necessarily mean no cost , " Fry said .
" There can not be an assumption that we would save by doing that [ converting to open source software ] . "

There has been an insurgency in Balochistan for more autonomy
The threats to Pakistan 's future do not just come from the recent wave of militant attacks , but also from discontent in communities around the country .
Gwadar is almost as remote a town in Pakistan as you can get .
On the coast of the country 's largest province , Balochistan , close to the Iranian border , it is nearly 2,000 km ( 1,250 miles ) from the capital , Islamabad .
Down on the shabby beaches , people earn a living the way they have done for generations , fishing and boat - building .
It might , at first , feel like it is a world away from the violence elsewhere .
But trouble 's simmering here too .
' Fight for rights '
In a small , dark , compound , we met members of various separatist groups - the Baloch National Front , Balochistan Republican Party and Balochistan Liberation Army .
The Pakistani government does n't do anything for us ... nobody cares
Shaukat ,
Gwadar fisherman
We hear their grievances , and their threats .
" What else do we have left , " says Rehman Arif , of the BRP , " except our guns , and to fight for our rights ?
" This region of Balochistan , which has seen civilisation for thousands of years , is being oppressed by Pakistan .
We 're ready to accept assistance from anyone in our fight .
We appeal to India for help . "
This public plea for help from the country 's sworn enemy will alarm Pakistanis .
So too might the fact that almost everyone we came across in the town supported moves for their province to break away from Pakistan .
" The Pakistani government does n't do anything for us , " says Shaukat , a fisherman .
" They only work for themselves .
We just labour hard , but nobody cares , " he says , before wading into the water and clambering onto his boat for another long day at sea .
Poverty here , and right across the province of Balochistan , is on the rise .
It is , once again , stirring decades - old feelings of resentment towards the country 's establishment .
Many Baloch feel they have been cheated , and that while Pakistan plunders their local resources , like natural gas , coal and copper , local people remain poor .
" We 've got nothing , " says Tariq Ashraf , a businessman in Gwadar 's old quarter .
" You can see all the children , look at them , look at the dirt , look at the houses .
The politicians just give us promises . "
Resentment The Prime Minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , has a new promise , and he has come to Gwadar to make it .
He tells us his government will develop the port , and bring business and jobs here , for the people of Balochistan .
Haji Saleh Muhammed says jobs do n't go to locals " They were not given their rights for the last 62 years [ since the creation of Pakistan ] , therefore we have launched a package with the title ' Aghaze Huqooq - i- Balochistan '
[ The beginning of the rights of the people of Balochistan ] .
That is why I am here . "
And it is not just the prime minister .
The entire cabinet flies in for , among other things , a meeting on a ship in Gwadar Port .
It was meant to provide a boost to the area , and help attract investment .
However , the sight of huge government convoys and reports of the millions of rupees of expenditure on the cabinet meeting did not impress some .
Many in Gwadar supported the separatist 's call for a strike .
Even with new development projects there is resentment .
Many here feel that any benefits that development brings will leave the area .
By chance , not far from the port , clutching a folder , we find Haji Saleh Muhammed .
" I am from Gwadar , I am a port crane operator , " he says .
He opens the file , that he says he always keeps with him , to show us his qualifications and certificates , received during 12 years working in Dubai .
" I came back to work in my city , but they have brought people from outside .
Karachi people are working here , I am just sitting around .
" Gilani says jobs will come here , but most will go to outsiders . "
On the beach , we even found a policeman who said the poverty and injustice had got so bad , he would lay down his life for Baloch independence .
Last chance Prime Minister Gilani reiterated to us his assertion that there was considerable evidence that India is already supporting the Baloch separatists , but accepted that the region had been neglected by Pakistan in the past .
However , he also insisted that the general picture is much better than it appears .
" Balochs are patriotic , 99.9 % support Pakistan .
There are maybe a handful of people who are towing the foreign agenda of somebody else - we are negotiating with them , " he says .
" The time will come when the people themselves will realise that we are on the right path , and they will start supporting us . "
Mr Gilani 's going to have to work fast here , because it feels like the last chance people are going to give the politicians to reduce poverty and inequality .
If they fail , Balochistan could quite easily become a focal point in Pakistan 's destabilisation .

Blessedly , 2009 did not turn out to be the utter catastrophe many once feared it would be — no bank runs , no bread lines , no sport - hunting of the rich .
But it ’s far from certain whether the worst has been truly averted , or , to use a phrase that became fashionable , the can was merely kicked down the road .
The signals are , at best , mixed .
Jobs are still being lost , if not at the same wildfire rate .
Many small businesses lack credit , not to mention customers .
So what lies ahead ?
Between the yahoos who tout every market uptick as the stirrings of the next boom and the doom peddlers who cling to their prophecies of societal breakdown , a consensus has cohered around what investment strategist John Mauldin , a hero of the blogosphere , calls “ the muddle - through economy , ” a protracted period of elevated unemployment rates and sluggish growth .
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke , who once spoke of “ green shoots , ” now describes the “ considerable headwinds ” that the economy faces .
Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius sees double - digit unemployment persisting through the end of 2011 .
Within this school of forecasters , a popular approach is to characterize the United States in terms of other countries ’ trademark miseries .
So we are Japan — a major Paul Krugman meme — staring down the barrel of our own “ lost decade ” of deflation , zombie banks , and cultural inertia .
Or we are Europe , afflicted by the “ sclerosis ” of high structural unemployment and gigantic government .
Or , as former IMF official Simon Johnson asserts , we are “ a banana republic , ” debasing our once - mighty currency by recklessly printing it to cover our debts .
But describing current conditions is only part of the game .
Correctly calling the next crisis is the great status bake - off of economics .
Which is why it was bracing to receive a recent investment newsletter from one of the most distinguished pessimists on Wall Street with this headline : “ On the Coming Shortage of Labor . ”
It was not a joke .
The bi-weekly newsletter , Grant ’s Interest Rate Observer , is published from a picturesque office on Wall Street overlooking Trinity Church .
The proprietor is a former journalist turned finance philosopher named James Grant , who — in addition to turning out the newsletter , which costs subscribers $ 850 a year , and hosting conferences at the Plaza Hotel that feature some of the sharpest minds in the investing business — has written six books , including a history of debt ( surprisingly engaging ) and a biography of John Adams ( better than David McCullough ’s , some say ) .
But his ample intelligence has often left him out of sync with the animal spirits that rule Wall Street .
Over a quarter - century in which the economy mostly boomed , Grant stayed mostly gloomy .
His view has been that the economy is a Frankenstein creation of cheap credit that drove up prices and instilled a false sense of prosperous stability .
At critical moments , such as the great collapse of the eighties boom , this analysis proved brave and useful , swelling Grant ’s subscriber rolls and turning him into a star of sorts .
But it also led to him advising caution and restraint as some of the most vigorous bull markets in history commenced .
Indeed , the nineties was not kind to pessimists .
“ In this business , ” he says , “ everything is cyclical , including one ’s evident IQ .
One goes from genius to moron all too quickly .
And so I went from being regarded as one of the brighter people on Wall Street to being , let ’s see , a perma - bear , and there was truth in that .
I was n’t supple enough , was n’t flexible enough .
I was in love with our story , which had been so successful , and did n’t see the world change . ”
Having made this mistake more than once , Grant is determined never to make it again .
The financial crisis ratified many of his core convictions about the pitfalls of debt and loose monetary policy , and the panic of people who did n’t see the crisis coming produced great opportunities for those who did .
The transition from bear to bull was difficult for Grant , but before 2008 was over , he was recommending to his subscribers that they shop for bargains , including , yes , houses in Detroit .
“ One year ago , we turned bullish on tradable bank debt , certain ‘ toxic ’ mortgages , junk bonds and other such unwanted debris , ” he says .
“ In March , we turned bullish on bank stocks .
And now we are bullish on the economy . ”
Grant ’s optimism is built on two pillars .
The first is his analysis of cyclical trends .
Like a rubber ball thrown against pavement , the U.S. economy has historically bounced back with a force roughly approximate to that with which it fell .
So the tepid recoveries of the early nineties and early aughts , the ones that preoccupy many analysts today because job growth was so torturously slow in both cases , were just the predictable aftermath of what Grant describes as “ toy recessions . ”
A better model for our present circumstances , he says , is the early eighties , when the economy was in shambles ( double - digit unemployment then , too ) and then suddenly , to the shock of learned people everywhere , staged a stupendous recovery .
Yes , there are seemingly unique impediments to such a recovery this time around — the indebtedness of U.S. consumers , to name one — but there are always such seemingly unique impediments , and the U.S. economy has repeatedly demonstrated the power to adapt .
This is especially true in the emotional , highly fraught area of unemployment .
In a worrying climate of dying professions , it ’s hard to get a grip on what takes their place .
“ Though we humans do our best , ” he wrote , “ we usually underestimate the capacity of market economies to reinvent the nature of work . ”
How exactly it will work this time , says Grant , we do n’t know .
We never know until after the fact .
Consider the now - conventional analysis of the U.S. economy over the last decade :
It was , we have had drilled into us , built on the swampy ground of real - estate speculation and the feverish spending of borrowed money .
Okay , sure .
But it was also about the explosion of information technology , the concomitant surge in productivity , and unprecedented access to low - cost labor , both domestically ( Latin American immigrants ) and globally ( Chinese ) , which lowered the prices of goods and services for all Americans .
These conditions , unlike the housing market , have not gone away .
Grant ’s second cause for optimism is an observation about human nature , summed up by an epigram he borrowed from the late British economist Arthur C. Pigou : “ The error of optimism dies in the crisis , but in dying it gives birth to an error of pessimism .
This new error is born not an infant , but a giant . ”
As peculiar as our economic circumstances may seem to us right now , the way people behave has a certain reassuring constancy — which is to say , we freak out and then we get over it .
Though economic forecasting is a major part of what his subscribers pay him for , Grant considers much of it a pseudo - intellectual parlor game .
“ Mindful that the future is a mystery , ” he wrote in recent newsletter , “ we do not pretend to know what nobody can know . ”
The past offers only so much help .
In the industrial history of the United States , there have only been about 30 economic recoveries , a minuscule sample size .
( If somebody touted a medical breakthrough based on a study of 30 patients , who would rush to sign up for this new wonder drug ? )
As for the data itself , consider that the dominant measure of economic activity , gross domestic product , is an antique that does a poor job of capturing the intangible investments that abound in the information economy .
The numbers that drive the markets up and down , like jobless figures , are glorified guesses subject to constant revision .
The latest issue of Grant ’s Interest Rate Observer notes that annualized GDP growth for the third quarter of 1983 has been revised ten times , including just this fall !
How much can we possibly know about the future if we ’re still unsure about 1983 ?
Grant , too , harbors deep concerns about what lies beyond the bounce - back .
He sees long - term problems in the government ’s massive efforts to save the economy , especially the low interest rates that Bernanke shows little inclination to raise .
“ Inflation is upon us , ” he says .
“ Not too much money chasing too few goods , but too much money .
The object of the money ’s desire varies from one cycle to another .
It could chase skirts , toothpaste , and automobiles , as it did in the seventies .
Or it could chase stocks , houses , or income - producing buildings , as it did a few years back . ”
Grant , in other words , has n’t forsaken pessimism so much as postponed it .
Hyper inflation could produce the kind of volatility that enables traders to make a killing while the rest of us suffer sticker shock in the breakfast - cereal aisle .
Then it ’ll be the sport - hunting vigilantes who are doing the chasing .

So , you want to know more about how to secure your wi-fi network .
You have taken a responsible first step toward keeping yourself and your business safe from cybercriminals .
In the modern era technology is evolving faster than anyone can keep up with and that means crime is also evolving just as fast .
Incidents of cybercrime are bound to keep increasing and that is why it is important to take measures to keep yourself safe .
It starts with your router .
Check the price on our favorite best seller here .
Your wi-fi is something that expands outside of your house and outside of your business which can give people an opportunity to get into your network and gain access to sensitive data .
Lucky for you there are a few easy steps you can take to protect yourself from such a thing .
This article is going to cover how you can secure your wi- fi network (s ) .

Importance of Wi-Fi Protection
Before we discuss how to encrypt your wi-fi , let ’s briefly examine why this is necessary .
In America , cybercrime is defined as a crime in which a computer system is targeted .
The attack can occur in a wide range of ways .
For example , you might be targeted by a phishing email or have had your network hacked .
Regardless of how the hack occurs , the consequences of being the target of a cybercrime can be devastating .
We can split those affected by cybercrime into two types of categories ; individual citizens and businesses .
Let ’s start by looking at how individuals can be affected by cybercrime .
With individuals increasingly incorporating technology into their lives they are potentially exposing themselves to a cyber- attack , where they can have personal information exploited .
A famous example of this was when celebrities had their personal accounts hacked .
This resulted in a hacker group releasing many compromising photos onto the internet .
Sadly , this problem is n’t limited to celebrities , if hackers are able to infiltrate your wi- fi they can steal your private information and may even be able to turn on your webcam remotely .
As you can imagine , finding out you ’ve been the victim of this kind of hack can be devastating and may even cause some people to develop mental health issues like depression .
By having strong wi-fi protection it will be harder for you to become the victim of a cyber- attack .
Now that we have a greater understanding of how cyber - attacks can affect individuals , let ’s have a look at how businesses may be affected .
Businesses are frequently moving online , storing more information in databases and relying more on technology .
This can leave them vulnerable to online cyber - attacks .
In fact , the Bureau of Justice Statistics surveyed businesses in 2005 and found that over 67 % of them had reported detecting at least one cybercrime .
They also found that businesses were likely to be a repeated target of hackers .
One of the most popular cybercrimes that businesses suffer is a ransomware attack .
This occurs when a hacker disables something , such as the ability to access a database , and makes the company pay to have access restored .
Because the payment is usually made in a virtual currency , like Bitcoin , the crime is virtually untraceable .
This can be very expensive , with the study conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics finding that 68 % of people targeted for a cyber theft attack lost over $ 10,000 after the attack .
Approximately 68 % of the victims of cyber theft sustained monetary loss of $ 10,000 or more .
Bureau of Justice Statistics
However , there is some good news .
The study also found that if businesses had an accurate way of detecting and defending themselves from cyber- attacks , they were better protected from attacks .
In fact , 34 % of businesses who detected cyber attacks lost less than $ 10,000 .
This shows how important having strong wi-fi protection is to businesses .
Technology has become an increasingly part of our lives , with many people using it to store important information .
As we ’ve discussed , if hackers can access your network they will be able to exploit this information and could potentially cost you a lot of money .
That ’s why protecting your wi- fi network is so important .
One of the best ways to protect this network is through using better encryption .
Using Better Encryption
This one is kind of a no - brainer and is easy to do .
Make sure that your network is password protected and that only those that need to know the password know the password .
If this is a home network , make sure that you and your family know the password and do not share it with anyone else .
Set up a guest wi-fi when you have guests over and have them connect to that instead of the primary home network .
If you are trying to protect your business network then make sure that every time an employee leaves your company , whether they are fired or not , that you change the network password .
Use a more secure password .
Do not be one of the lazy unfortunate souls who change their password to password123 and expect nobody to figure that out .
Your password needs to be long and a random collection of letters , numbers and symbols when allowed .
DO NOT leave your routers default password in place .
Change it as soon as you can .
A great way to test if your password is strong enough is to use a service called CloudCracker .
This service attempts to crack your password and if it can then that means a hacker can definitely do the same thing .
If CloudCracker gets your password that is a good indicator that you need to change it to something stronger immediately .
Securing Your Router
Your router is your first line of defense from cyber - attacks .
Whether you are leasing a router from your internet service provider or if you ’ve bought your own , the first thing you need to do is change the name of your router .
All routers come with a default name .
Your router will also come with a default password and as I said in the last section you need to change this password immediately .
Every couple of months check and make sure that your router has the most up to date version of the software .
It is probably a good idea to register the router with the manufacturer and sign up for notifications so that you get an email every time a software update is available .
Once a company moves on to a new version of software the old version because much easier to hack into .
Making Your Network Disappear
This one is simple and easy as well .
Anyone can change their SSID to hidden so that nobody can see your network .
The people who know the username and password can still login , but it wo n’t appear on the general list of wi- fi networks that everyone can see if they are in the area .
This definitely is n’t foolproof as someone who knows what their doing can still easily find your network , but it is still a layer of encryption worth having .
This can definitely deter novice hackers from breaking into your network .
Using a Firewall
Firewalls come in two different forms : software and hardware .
A firewall is used to monitor data going through a certain point and stop something if it looks suspicious .
A good way to picture a firewall is to imagine a wall that protects your home or business network .
That wall has a gate that only lets through trusted data and turns away anything that appears suspect .
Most routers come with a built - in firewall which monitors all data that goes through it .
Software firewalls are generally installed to a desktop or PC .
Using a VPN or Virtual Private Network
In layman ’s terms a virtual private network ( VPN ) is essentially a tunnel between two devices that lets you access the internet in a way that nobody can monitor what you ’re doing .
When using a VPN your IP address is replace with that of the VPN provider and that IP address could show any location across the globe .
This is a pretty cool service and definitely worth looking into to better protect your home or business network .
A VPN also comes in handy after you jailbreak a firestick so that your streaming activity can be hidden as well .
Benefits of Using a VPN
Hides your IP address Changes your IP address to one in a different location Encrypts your data transfers Hides your location Allows you to access websites blocked by governments
Selecting A VPN Provider
Setting up a VPN is quite simple once you select your VPN provider .
As with many other products , free does not always equal better when you ’re talking about a VPN .
It is highly recommended that you go with a paid service over a free one when selecting a VPN provider as you will definitely get what you pay for .
Shop around and do your due diligence before selecting one .
Tie all of these steps together and your home or business network will be much safer from cyber - attacks .
Even just taking a few of these measures will make a big difference , but remember the more layers of protection you have the better off you will be .

The cyber attacks against Google , Adobe and a raft of other top U.S. corporations late last year were by most accounts sophisticated and targeted attempts to steal proprietary data .
But lost in all of the resulting media hoopla over who the remaining victims were and whether Chinese hackers or indeed the Chinese government itself were responsible is the simple , terrifying truth that individual hackers now have access to the same arsenal of cyber weapons once reserved only for nation states .
The weapons at issue are , of course , botnets -- agglomerations of remotely controlled , hacked computers that are used for a variety of criminal purposes , from spam , to high - powered , distributed online attacks against virtual targets .
In these attacks , the botnets acted as a sort of " cloud " data collection and storage network .
I caught up recently with Roland Dobbins , a solutions architect with the Asia Pacific division of Arbor Networks , a company that specializes in helping customers defend against botnet attacks .
Dobbins said the Google incident a perfect example of how the botnet has enabled what he calls the democratization of espionage .
Brian Krebs :
What does that mean — " the democratization of espionage " ?
Roland Dobbins , Arbor Networks :
Well , ten to fifteen years ago , if you were going to be the target of state sponsored or corporate espionage , you yourself were going to be a government or a large corporation that had intellectual property or information that an adversary was going to have to invest a lot of time and effort to pry out of you .
What we have seen over the last five to seven years is that the botnet has democratized that process , so that now an individual can commit his own intelligence reconnaissance and espionage , whether at arms legth on behalf of a state , on his own , or whether he 's doing it for corporate espionage .
This whole process has tons of implications for national and corporate security , and for individual privacy .
For the attacker , the risk associated with launching these types of attacks has gone down quite a bit , too , no ?
Absolutely .
Whether or not you 're a nation state , botnets allow you to mount an operation of this type for almost no cost , and there is pretty much no physical risk .
In the spy world they talk about " black bag ops , " where the spy tries to break into the corporate campus or government building to steal information .
But with these attacks , there is no risk , and they can just keep trying and trying until they succeed .
What is the average Internet user supposed to take away from this ?
Because it 's so cheap through the use of botnets for bad guys to get this information , ordinary people are essentially the targets of espionage in a way that has never been true before in human history .
Their personal information is being targeted by folks who have resources that in many cases are beyond what nation states would have been able to bring to bear only ten years ago .
If you couple that with generational changes that we see , where younger people do n't seem to place the same importance on privacy as those of the older genertions - in a way they tend to overshare - if you couple that with the force multipler of botnets , this is a really big change , and this is really reflected in the attacks we 've seen talked about in the press lately .
Okay , now I 'm scared .
Well , that 's okay .
It just means if you are on the Internet , you have to assume that there are nation - state level adversaries targeting you to get your information and gain from it .
And you really have to have a ' wilderness of mirrors ' type of attitude , and be functionally paranoid to protect yourself these days .
This is a big change .
Because the Interent is ubiquitous , and because it's become such a big part of so many peoples ' lives , a lot of us have this feeling of being in that old Mad Magazine cartoon Spy vs .
Spy , only from the inside it 's not really that funny .
But it is a profound change in human civilization that we just have n't seen before , and companies especially need to wake up to this fact .

Posted by John , January 25th , 2010 - under Solar panels .
Tags : Climate change , Feed - in - tariff
It must have seemed like a good idea at the time .
Subsidise those individuals who put solar panels on their roofs .
The Rudd Labor Government paid up to $ 8,000 to those who did .
It was so successful ( or in revenue terms , costly , ) that Peter Garrett , the Minister for Environment , Heritage and the Arts in the Rudd Government , cancelled it .
Here in the ACT , the local Government passed a backbencher ’s bill to introduce a feed - in tariff which pays individuals and small businesses who provide electricity from their solar panels 50.5 cents per kilowatt hour generated .
This is almost four times the normal rate .
With a new scheme in place in New South Wales from 1 January the pressure will be on the ACT Government to at least match them and increase its feed - in tariff to their 60 cents per kWh .
The general community will subsidise the feed - in tariff through electricity price increases .
According to figures in the Canberra Times , in the first six months of the scheme almost 1000 providers were paid $ 261,000 in total .
This will cost all electricity consumers an extra $ 2.70 .
The subsidy will increase both because this is a six month figure over the shorter days and because the Government is considering extending the scheme to cover businesses who can produce more than 50 kWh .
And given the generosity of the scheme , the number of people in Canberra taking advantage of the feed - in tariff ( currently about one percent of all households ) is likely to increase exponentially from its low base and will continue to do so over the next few years , so the cost of the subsidy ( and hence the price of electricity to all households ) will rise rapidly .
With upfront costs of between about $ 12,000 and $ 25,000 to install cells on residential roofs ( depending on size , quality and the like ) the people who can afford these solar panels will not be poor or , as a generalisation , average income earners .
In other words the local Territory feed in tariff redistributes wealth ( currently at a small scale but likely to grow ) from those who ca n’t afford solar panels on their roofs to those who can .
This will be from the less well off ( and others like myself who think individualising responses to climate change is bad policy per se ) to the well off .
The Government has in place some mechanisms for ensuring some of the less well off do n’t pay the increase but this misses the point that those on average wages will not covered by such schemes .
Further it appears to be extremely costly in reducing greenhouse gases – about $ 500 a tonne .
No doubt these inequitable redistributive impacts and costs were part of the advice package that went to Government before it adopted the scheme .
The feed - in tariff reflects a very common ‘ common sense ’ view .
Climate change threatens us all , so we should all pay for it .
We should all do our bit so the argument goes .
Greenhouse gas emission flow from the way production is organised under capitalism .
It is the polluting companies who should pay for their pollution through lower profits , not ordinary working Australians through higher prices .
Imagine that approach , together with a government or governments which actually had a vision and action plan for massive renewable energy production through solar and wind farms , geothermal and tidal energy , and the outlines of a real solution become clearer .
The feed - in tariff in the Territory highlights the complexity associated with dealing with climate change in a policy vacuum and one dominated by the erroneous idea that the solution to the problems the market creates is the market .
Take for example the increased charge on all consumers to subsidise the well off to put solar panels on their roofs .
There may be an argument ( I put it no higher than that ) that such a surcharge is an excise and as such is only something that the Commonwealth can impose .
The benefits of the feed - in tariff go to the occupier , not the owner , of the property .
Often they will be the same person , but in rental situations ( both private and public ) they will not be .
The courts have held that an income stream in certain circumstances is property and able to be sold .
Is the owner of the solar panels which produce the electricity giving rise to the right to the feed - in tariff the owner of that income stream ?
If so , then the redirection of the income coming out of the feed - in tariff from the private owners to the occupants may be the acquisition of property without just compensation to those owners .
The Self - Government Act prevents such action by the ACT Government .
Of course , most private landlords would have factored the cost of the panels and the loss of the income stream into their rents .
These are increases the landlord friendly Residential Tenancies
Act would in all probability allow .
ACT
Housing might also be making the same calculations if it moved to put solar panels on public housing roofs .
The feed - in tariff raises income tax issues too .
In a private ruling the ATO has said the amount paid under a gross feed - in tariff is not income because there is no intention to make a profit .
This is wrong .
The intention to make a profit does not apply to income from property ( such as rent , dividends and interest ) .
Using the logic of the private ruling , negative gearing on rental properties should be disallowed .
Indeed it is likely that some owners who are occupiers may have borrowed to put the solar panels on their roofs .
They will in all likelihood be negatively geared on this investment and want to claim the payments are income so they can deduct the larger expenditures against the solar panel income and then other income .
The Tax Office should issue a public ruling on the issue to clarify the matter for all investors .
The ACT Government is considering expanding the scheme to in effect cover more and larger businesses .
This will increase the cost of the subsidy those without solar panels pay to those with solar panels .
Leaving aside the owner versus occupier issue , businesses receiving the feed - in tariff will be subject to income tax on the amount .
There will be the usual GST issues too .
If my analysis that the feed - in tariff is income is correct , this will have an impact on those occupiers ( often of public housing ) receiving the feed –in tariff who are also receiving pensions , student allowances and other government welfare payments from Centrelink .
Since the feed - in tariff income stream under the ACT legislation belongs to the occupier , this means that the occupiers will need to declare the income to Centrelink with a possible reduction in benefits and perhaps an increase in the rent paid ( according to a percentage of income formula ) .
So tenants with solar panels on their roofs are likely to pay 3 times – the solar panel income stream will be ( or , under current law , should be ) taxed , the landlord will increase the rent to cover his or her cost of the panels and loss of the income stream , and the occupiers ’
Centrelink benefits if they exist may be cut .
Inequitable redistributive results ; extremely costly greenhouse gas emission reductions ; possible excise , GST and income tax implications ; acquisition of property on just terms concerns ; penalising Centrelink clients .
These surely could n’t be the outcomes the ACT Government envisaged , let alone wanted , from its solar panel feed - in tariff scheme , could they ?

Tim Collings ' Arsenal Assessment : Arsene Wenger ’s Class Of 2010 May Not Graduate As Champions , But Will Certainly Entertain
Current crop are the most entertaining team of the decade ....
" Down Under " , the 1980s smash hit about a land where " beer does flow and men chunder [ vomit ] " , has earned millions of dollars for Men at Work and their record labels .
But its distinctive flute riff was plagiarised from an Australian folk tune composed for a Girl Guides competition 75 years ago , a court in Sydney ruled yesterday .
The Supreme Court found that the riff was unmistakeably similar to the four - bar children 's song " Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum Tree " , penned by a Melbourne teacher , Marion Sinclair , and now owned by a publishing firm , Larrikin Music .
The judge ordered the " Down Under " songwriters , Colin Hay and Ron Strykert , and the band 's labels , EMI and Sony BMG , to pay compensation and back royalties to Larrikin .
The sums have yet to be determined but lawyers said that they could run into millions of dollars .
" Down Under " , which has become an unofficial Australian anthem , sold millions of copies around the world after being released in 1983 .
The theme tune of the Australian yachting team which won the America 's Cup that year , it also featured in the closing ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics .
Adam Simpson , Larrikin 's lawyer , hailed the ruling as " a big win for the underdog " , and said the publisher would be seeking up to 60 per cent of the song 's earnings .
Hay , Men at Work 's lead singer , said that the judgment had " some pretty serious financial repercussions " .
The parties will return to court later this month to discuss costs .
" Down Under " and the album Business As Usual topped the British , Australian and American charts in early 1983 , and Men at Work won that year 's Grammy Award for Best New Artist .
Hay did not deny that the band 's flautist , Greg Ham , used two bars from the campfire favourite about the native Australian bird .
However , he said that they were added after the original song had been composed .
" I 'll go to my grave knowing ' Down Under ' is an original piece of work , " he said .
" It was a musical accident that happened . "
But the judge , Justice Peter Jacobsen , said that while the flute riff had a markedly different " feel " and musical context in " Down Under " , he had concluded that it " replicates in material form a substantial part of Ms Sinclair 's 1935 work . "
He said it was clear that Ham had deliberately plagiarised it " for the purpose and with the intention of evoking an Australian flavour " .
The movie Avatar gets the mining bit wrong .
And not by just a little – but then us villains are rarely understood , so what should we expect ?
OK so what is a popular , nay perhaps even genre changing movie got to do with technical talks about fossil fuel production ?
Well , fairly early in the movie it is made clear that the sole purpose for the plot is to mine “ unobtainium ” which is a mineral with all sorts of value .
Now I ’m not going to give away much of what goes on in this movie ( and I agree with most of that review by the way ) but the fallacy over how they mine the deposits on the planet is one of the lessons learned from the mining of the oil sands in Alberta , which is actually what I want to discuss a little today .
In the movie they use a variation on a bucket wheel excavator – which in today ’s world looks like this :
Bucket wheel excavators were , at one time , used for mining up at Fort McMurray where the large oil sand deposits are found in Northern Alberta .
However the reason that they were discontinued ( and which formed part of the plot of the book “ Athabasca ” by Alistair MacLean ) is that they are the single machine whose health totally controls production .
When they are working the mine is producing , and when they are n’t it is n’t .
( The plot of the movie was to disable the machine and thus stop oil production - possible where there was only one machine . )
The problem that really developed was that maintenance and repair of such a behemoth is such that it is more reliable and productive to rely on a multitude of smaller machines , with truck haulage , rather than the single large machine with conveyors .
As the mines have learned these lessons they have pensioned off or sold most of those they had .
Now , if some of the shovels have maintenance problems , with some dozen or more working at one time , then the drop in production is not nearly that significant .
You can see one of the problems in this picture of the teeth on the buckets .
( Since this is the one on display , I suspect that towards the end replacements were n't as frequent , but you can see how many teeth were missing , and these take significant time ( and money ) to replace ) .
Note the broken and missing teeth on the front of the buckets .
( The bright spots are hardened buttons to reduce side wear on the buckets as they cut through the abrasive sand . )
I first wrote about the oil sands back in June of 2006 and back then , the production was just over a million barrels of crude a day .
When Gail Tverberg wrote about her visit up there on The Oil Drum last August ( Part 1 and Part 2 ) , she noted that in 2008 production had risen to 1.2 mbd and that with current construction projects this would increase to 1.94 mbd .
The current Alberta Provincial web site expects that these projects will raise production to 3 mbd by 2018 -- which is down a bit from earlier projections .
There is some controversy that exists with regard to crude production from these mines , and the area in general .
There are basically three different processes that are currently being used for oil extraction , and it is only the first of these – the mining and processing of the sand , that I will discuss today .
The use of steam to recover oil from underground wells ( Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage – SAGD ) and the partial combustion of some of the oil to recover some of the remainder ( a process called THAI for Toe to Heel Air Injection ) will be written about in subsequent posts .
Part of the reason that the topic is controversial is due to the need for natural gas to create the steam used in the SAGD process , but there are other concerns that have arisen because the sand does contain some natural gas that can be drawn off and sold commercially .
Last October , the Energy Resources Conservation Board ruled that 158 wells that were producing natural gas from the sand should be shut - in ( that means closed ) since gas production from them might interfere with the SAGD process .
In particular the drop in pressure as the gas is removed may negatively impact subsequent SAGD production .
A hearing on this will be held early this year .
It is also a target for additional taxes and regulations in order to “ green ” the industry .
So what is there to green ?
Let me run through the process .
The oil sand lies below a relatively thin cover of vegetation , soil and rock , which is first removed and stockpiled so that it can be replaced , after mining is completed .
Once that has been done ( using the same large shovels and trucks that are used for mining the sand ) , the sand is mined using large shovels that can load a truck with 100 tons of material at a time .
Loading the truck , it will take 2 to 4 shovel loads to fill the truck bed , depending on its size
In the summer , when the temperatures are higher , the sand is easier to move , and thus dozers can be used to push down the material into the arc of the shovel , so that it does not have to reposition itself that often , and production from higher benches can be kept up .
Dozer loading shovel
The trucks are used to carry the material to the initial processing plant .
The sand is abrasive as well as being heavy , so that there is considerable wear on not only the teeth of the shovel , but also on the tires ( my head is about the height of the axle ) and on the beds of the trucks so that these have to be periodically replaced .
Relining the bed of a truck
The trucks are used to carry the mined material to a central processing plant within the pit , and it is first dumped into a primary breaker .
Tipping into the breaker
The oil sand is relatively soft , but contains layers of rock that have little oil in them .
These rocks are generally harder , so that they survive the crushing - which also means that they are bigger , and can be separated out and removed from the system , before the oil sand passes into a mixing tank .
In the mixing tank , the oil sand is mixed with hot water and agitated , which breaks it down into particles , since the individual sand grains are coated with a thin layer of water , under the intervening oil that ties it all together .
Mixing the sand with water
The resulting slurry is then passed to a pump station , that pushes the slurry through a pipeline , which carries it to the initial separator at the refinery .
Pump station and delivery pipeline
The pipe is about a mile long , and in the time that the sand passes through it the oil and sand are separated .
At the beginning of the refinery , the slurry is then pumped into a large tank .
Simplistically the sand settles to the bottom of the tank , the water lies in the middle ( where it can be drawn off for re-use ) and the oil floats on the top and can be drawn off to feed into the refinery .
Initial sand : oil separator
The heavy crude is treated in this initial refinery so that the resulting liquid can be sent as a sweet crude down to other refineries further south .
Upgrading refinery
Making sweet crude requires , among other things , removing the sulfur from the oil .
Sometimes sulfur can be marketed , but sometimes it must be stock - piled .
Because of the stockpiling , there are the start of " sulfur pyramids " being constructed around the refinery .
Start of a sulfur pyramid
Once the oil sand has been removed down to the underlying bed rock , the sand can be replaced and the land reclaimed .
Gail did a tour of some of the sites , and has posted pictures - unfortunately I did not have have that opportunity .
However , given the comments that this post has given rise to let me add one of those pictures to this post :
Reclaimed , but not yet approved land
As usual this has been an abbreviated explanation of a process .
Comments and questions might indicate where I need to explain things in more detail .
It ’s a new year , a time for both gazing into the future and reflecting on the past .
As you look back on the last year , how do you feel about the way it went ?
Do you have the sinking feeling that you are in the same place mentally / professionally / romantically / spiritually that you were 12 months ago ?
That the only thing that ’s changed is the date on the calendar ?
There are always a lot of tips given out this time of year about how to make and keep resolutions and make the next year better than the last .
But I have only one “ secret ” to impart : discipline .
It is the key to unlocking your potential and finally moving forward with your life .
The reason you still have n’t finished that book you started last January but have spent several hours surfing the internet every day ?
A lack of discipline .
The reason that you want to propose to your girlfriend or have kids but keep holding back ?
You ’re afraid you do n’t have the discipline to be successful at those endeavors .
The reason you ’re still just as fat as last time you ate that cream puff before making a new resolution ?
A lack of discipline .
The reason you have n’t made any progress on starting that side business , and your house is a dump , and you feel like your life is slipping away ?
No discipline !
Discipline is essentially the ability to put off what we want in the moment for what we want in the long run .
By now , almost everyone is familiar with the famous marshmallow experiment run by Dr. Walter Mischel .
Four year old children were each given one marshmallow .
They could either eat the marshmallow immediately , or , if they waited 15 minutes for the lab assistant to return , receive another marshmallow , thus doubling their prize .
The kids who were able to wait generally went on to become successful and well adjusted adults , while the kids who gobbled the first marshmallow had more trouble dealing with stress , frustration , and impulse control .
We all probably imagine ourselves as the kid who would have waited for the second marshmallow .
And maybe you would have .
But even the most disciplined among us have areas in our lives where we ’re failing .
Areas where we ’re just middling by and it ’s absolutely eating at us , knowing how much potential we have and how we ’re not utilizing it .
Everyone wants a secret or hack on how to be more disciplined .
But there is n’t one .
It is simply a matter of training your mind to do what you want it to do .
Of saying a resounding “ No ! ” to the things that waste your life and your time .
You decide what you really want out of life and you go for it .
That ’s it .
But here are some thing to think over to help your frame of mind , for as Dr. Mischel says , “ We ca n’t control the world , but we can control how we think about it . ”
Stop thinking of your “ flaw ” as part of your identity .
Part of why it ’s hard to make changes in our lives , why we find ourselves unsuccessful in changing our habits , is that we rationalize our weaknesses as simply part of “ who we are . ”
We assuage our guilt but adopting them as part of our identity , as part of our shtick .
We ’re the jolly fat guy who makes self - deprecating jokes and amazes people with how many slices of pizza he can wolf down .
We ’re the funny drunk who always gets totally plastered and cracks everyone up with our antics .
We ’re a night owl , dammit !
That ’s how we roll , burning the midnight oil !
We ’re the player , not because we ca n’t keep a girlfriend but just because we crush a lot !
We do so much rationalizing that it can be downright painful to change ; we feel like we ’re losing a part of ourselves .
Maybe our habits are n’t making us happy , but at least they give us the stability of an identity , the comfort of routine .
What happens when the fat guy slims down and the drunk gets sober ?
Who are we then ?
When it ’s time to shape up your life , it ’s crucial to replace your old identity with a new one ; it ’s the same concept that applies to changing your habits .
Instead of being the jolly fat guy , become the super fit , former fat guy who loves being active .
Instead of being a playah , become known as the guy women would love to date , a true gentleman .
Stop being haunted by the ghost of your mom .
Whenever part of you wants to become more disciplined , another part of you cries out , “ We do n’t have to follow anybody ’s rules !
Nobody puts baby in the corner ! ”
Your mind often identifies this voice as your inner-rebel , the part of you that feels an affinity for James Dean .
This voice flatters your identity .
You ’re not lazy , you ’re a rebel !
But the voice is really your eight your old self .
And he ’s crying out against mom ’s rules .
Whenever a man first leaves home , he begins to test his boundaries ; away from his parents ’ prying eyes , he is enamored with his new found freedom .
Many men , like myself , saw their grade point averages bottom out during freshman year of college for this very reason .
This is actually a healthy process ( provided you do n’t flunk out or get a girl pregnant or something ) .
Part of growing up is exploring and breaking your old rules and finding out how you want to live your life .
At first you want to eat the whole jar of cookies because you can !
No one can stop you !
But there has to come a point where you say , you know , eating the whole jar of cookies makes me sick ; it makes me feel like crap .
It ’s the place where you stop doing stuff just because you can , and start living the way you know is actually best for you and will make you happiest .
Mom ’s not looking over your shoulder anymore .
You are in control of your life , and you do n’t have to prove anything to anyone but yourself .
Freedom is not the end all be all .
The voice in our head that likes to derail our efforts at discipline loves to wave the grand flag of freedom in our faces .
You can choose to do whatever you ’d like - that ’s the ultimate in freedom !
You can sleep in until noon , and surf the internet instead of cleaning up , and stay out late instead of studying .
Why would you want to reign yourself in with a schedule or goals ?
What the freedom voice neglects to tell you is this : while everyone has the freedom to choose , you ca n’t choose the consequences of those choices .
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction .
There ’s no use fighting against the laws of the universe .
The only reward of unchecked freedom is freedom itself .
So you spent the day doing what you want - surfing the net in your underwear - what do you have to show for it despite an extensive knowledge of how the next Batman flick is coming along ?
Without the feeling of personal progress and the satisfaction of real , hard - earned achievements , freedom alone feels completely empty .
Fix your core values first .
Let ’s say one of your core values is family .
And let ’s say you ’re trying to lose weight while the relationship with your wife is crap .
What do you think the odds are of your success ?
Pretty dang low .
Think of your life like a stack of cups .
Your core values are the cups on the bottom , your foundation .
What if one of the bottom cups is removed or is missing ?
The rest of the cups will fall .
If you want to be successful in tackling other areas of your life , you ’ve got to build on a rock solid bedrock of core values .
It ’s just like building a house .
You ca n’t put in the jacuzzi before you ’ve built the foundation .
Train your discipline like you train your body .
Your self - discipline is just like the muscles in your body .
When you first start working out , you ’ll find that there ’s a maximum weight you can bench press .
You can try piling more weight on the bar , but it will just crush you .
That ’s your baseline strength .
As you regularly work out and incrementally add more weight , your baseline strength will increase and you ’ll be able to lift more weight and do more reps .
Your self - discipline works in the exact same way .
Right now you have a limited amount of self - discipline available to you .
If you spend it on one thing , you have less to spend on other stuff .
If you use your willpower in controlling your diet , you ’ll find it harder to reign in your spending .
But as you keep flexing your willpower in an area , your self - control will expand and you ’ll have more strength to discipline the other areas of your life as well .
So do n’t take on too much at once .
Pick an area of your life where you want to exercise more discipline and work on it until your self - discipline grows and you gain the self - control to take on more and more challenges .
In conjunction with this post , we published a manvotional : The Kingship of Self - Control .

Four “ butterflynauts ” have emerged on the International Space Station .
They are part of a suitcase sized educational experiment that was rocketed to space on Nov. 16 on space shuttle Atlantis as part of the STS - 129 mission .
Students of all ages and the public are invited to follow the tiny crew ’s development from larvae to adult butterflies in the microgravity of space .
In over 100 classrooms across the U.S. , students have set up habitats and are replicating the space experiment .
Their objective is to compare the growth and behavior of ground - based butterfly larvae and adult butterflies with those living in the microgravity environment of space .
New pictures and videos and Powerpoint slides are available almost daily .
A free Butterflies in Space teacher ’s guide can be downloaded from BioEd Online at the Butterflies in Space website here .
The project is sponsored by National Space Biomedical Research Institute .
Initial results show that there appears to be no difference in the development rates of these butterflies in a microgravity environment as compared to Earth ’s gravity , which is a fairly significant finding .
While microgravity environment has obvious impacts on human health and physiology , relatively little is known about how microgravity whould effect human growth and development .
While there are major differences between humans and butterflies , basic cellular divisions in follow similar processes .
Therefore , the success of the butterfly experiment in space indicates that a human embryo could potentially survive and develop normally in space even in the absence of gravity .
Sometimes , college basketball yields weirdness beyond what anyone could normally conceive .
Today is one of those days .
The story goes like this : Louisiana Tech was hosting Nevada Saturday at the Thomas Assembly Center , where Karl Malone Floor ( Malone attended Louisiana Tech ) adorns the playing surface .
The floor was apparently surfaced in December .
Nevada , as is frequent custom , brought its own chairs to the game and placed them in the middle of the floor in front of the Wolfpack bench for timeouts .
According to varying reports , the Mailman was on hand , and the Mailman does n't much like you scratching up his court .
Karl Malone was n't particularly thrilled with Nevada bringing small folding chairs onto " his " court during the media timeouts of Saturday 's Tech - Nevada basketball game at the Thomas Assembly Center .
Bringing chairs or stools onto the court during timeouts is standard practice all around the country , but Malone voiced his displeasure , and the Nevada staff was told staff to keep the chairs off the floor ( which was sanded and sealed in December ) .
Nevada continued to use its chairs throughout the rest of the first half , and may or may not have antagonized Malone by using some extra oomph when setting the chairs on the hardwood .
So during halftime Malone grabbed Nevada 's portable furniture and threw it in a dumpster outside the arena .
Allegedly .
That 's from Monroe ( La. ) News Star reporter Ethan Conley , who spoke with La . Tech deputy athletic director Bruce Van De Velde about the supposed altercation .
Van De Velde says the story is " a little bit embellished . "
He also added that Karl " takes a lot of pride in the floor , " but that he " did n't remove " any chairs .
Other reports differ : Nevada athletic director Cary Groth said she could n't confirm or deny whether the chairs were in fact delivered to the dumpster by Malone , only that when Nevada came back from halftime they were not there .
Whether Malone moved them or not , the mere mental picture of an angry , plaid - clad Karl Malone hauling plush sideline chairs out to the dumpster , muttering under his breath the whole way , is good enough for me .
I 'll never un - know this image , whether it actually ever existed or not .
I am totally cool with that .
It was to be a carefully choreographed farewell , an attempt to recover some grace and climb out of the political quicksand .
But Adam Giambrone ’s City
Hall office had armed him with only one page of a two - page speech , say two sources close to his campaign .
So with the eyes of the city upon him , he realized a page was missing .
Suddenly , he said “ Thank you , ” spun on his heels , and charged out a door and down a staircase surrounded by a phalanx of city staff and security .
“ He only had the first page , the second page was still in the printer , ” in his City Hall office , said a campaign source who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ At this very dramatic and stressful moment , with this speech he had worked so hard on , the end of it is missing , ” the source said , adding they were speaking out to make clear Giambrone was n’t stopped short by a lack of will or nerve or character .
Earlier , Giambrone had written the speech and emailed it to City Hall to be printed .
Later , staff redid it in a larger , easier - to - read 18 - point type and re-sent it .
But the bigger type bumped part of the speech onto a second page , which was apparently left in the printer , the source said .
It is n’t clear how much of the speech was missing – a reporter close enough to Giambrone to see the statement told colleagues he saw a TTC reference that comes after the part where Giambrone , the TTC chair , stopped reading .
In what was a carefully planned exit , security rushed Giambrone down and into a car waiting in the shipping and receiving area .
Inside with the shell - shocked councillor , campaign officials debated what to do about the unfinished speech .
They decided Giambrone should n’t go back into the lion ’s den .
His aide , Kevin Beaulieau volunteered to take a bullet and , after trudging upstairs with full speech in hand , started to read .
But even that did n’t go smoothly – Beaulieau at first said he would read it “ in Adam ’s voice ” but quickly switched to the third - person .

People keep saying “ Yes , the Climategate scientists behaved badly .
But that does n’t mean the data is bad .
That does n’t mean the earth is not warming . ”
Let me start with the second objection first .
The earth has generally been warming since the Little Ice Age , around 1650 .
There is general agreement that the earth has warmed since then .
See e.g. Akasofu .
Climategate does n’t affect that .
The second question , the integrity of the data , is different .
People say “ Yes , they destroyed emails , and hid from Freedom of information Acts , and messed with proxies , and fought to keep other scientists ’ papers out of the journals … but that does n’t affect the data , the data is still good . ”
Which sounds reasonable .
There are three main global temperature datasets .
One is at the CRU , Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia , where we ’ve been trying to get access to the raw numbers .
One is at NOAA / GHCN , the Global Historical Climate Network .
The final one is at NASA / GISS , the Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
The three groups take raw data , and they “ homogenize ” it to remove things like when a station was moved to a warmer location and there ’s a 2C jump in the temperature .
The three global temperature records are usually called CRU , GISS , and GHCN .
Both GISS and CRU , however , get almost all of their raw data from GHCN .
All three produce very similar global historical temperature records from the raw data .
So I ’m still on my multi-year quest to understand the climate data .
You never know where this data chase will lead .
This time , it has ended me up in Australia .
I got to thinking about Professor Wibjorn Karlen ’s statement about Australia that I quoted here :
Another example is Australia .
NASA [ GHCN ] only presents 3 stations covering the period 1897 - 1992 .
What kind of data is the IPCC Australia diagram based on ?
If any trend it is a slight cooling .
However , if a shorter period ( 1949 - 2005 ) is used , the temperature has increased substantially .
The Australians have many stations and have published more detailed maps of changes and trends .
The folks at CRU told Wibjorn that he was just plain wrong .
Here ’s what they said is right , the record that Wibjorn was talking about , Fig. 9.12 in the UN IPCC Fourth Assessment Report , showing Northern Australia :
Figure 1 . Temperature trends and model results in Northern Australia .
Black line is observations ( From Fig. 9.12 from the UN IPCC Fourth Annual Report ) .
Covers the area from 110E to 155E , and from 30S to 11S .
Based on the CRU land temperature . )
Data from the CRU .
One of the things that was revealed in the released CRU emails is that the CRU basically uses the Global Historical Climate Network ( GHCN ) dataset for its raw data .
So I looked at the GHCN dataset .
There , I find three stations in North Australia as Wibjorn had said , and nine stations in all of Australia , that cover the period 1900 - 2000 .
Here is the average of the GHCN unadjusted data for those three Northern stations , from AIS :
Figure 2 . GHCN Raw Data , All 100 - yr stations in IPCC area above .
So once again Wibjorn is correct , this looks nothing like the corresponding IPCC temperature record for Australia .
But it ’s too soon to tell .
Professor Karlen is only showing 3 stations .
Three is not a lot of stations , but that ’s all of the century - long Australian records we have in the IPCC specified region .
OK , we ’ve seen the longest stations record , so lets throw more records into the mix .
Here ’s every station in the UN IPCC specified region which contains temperature records that extend up to the year 2000 no matter when they started , which is 30 stations .
Figure 3 . GHCN Raw Data ,
All stations extending to 2000 in IPCC area above .
Still no similarity with IPCC .
So I looked at every station in the area .
That ’s 222 stations .
Here ’s that result :
Figure 4 . GHCN Raw Data ,
All stations extending to 2000 in IPCC area above .
So you can see why Wibjorn was concerned .
This looks nothing like the UN IPCC data , which came from the CRU , which was based on the GHCN data .
Why the difference ?
The answer is , these graphs all use the raw GHCN data .
But the IPCC uses the “ adjusted ” data .
GHCN adjusts the data to remove what it calls “ inhomogeneities ” .
So on a whim I thought I ’d take a look at the first station on the list , Darwin Airport , so I could see what an inhomogeneity might look like when it was at home .
And I could find out how large the GHCN adjustment for Darwin inhomogeneities was .
First , what is an “ inhomogeneity ” ?
I can do no better than quote from GHCN :
Most long - term climate stations have undergone changes that make a time series of their observations inhomogeneous .
There are many causes for the discontinuities , including changes in instruments , shelters , the environment around the shelter , the location of the station , the time of observation , and the method used to calculate mean temperature .
Often several of these occur at the same time , as is often the case with the introduction of automatic weather stations that is occurring in many parts of the world .
Before one can reliably use such climate data for analysis of longterm climate change , adjustments are needed to compensate for the nonclimatic discontinuities .
That makes sense .
The raw data will have jumps from station moves and the like .
We do n’t want to think it ’s warming just because the thermometer was moved to a warmer location .
Unpleasant as it may seem , we have to adjust for those as best we can .
I always like to start with the rawest data , so I can understand the adjustments .
At Darwin there are five separate individual station records that are combined to make up the final Darwin record .
These are the individual records of stations in the area , which are numbered from zero to four :
DATA SOURCE : http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/findstation.py?datatype=gistemp&data_set=0&name=darwin
Figure 5 . Five individual temperature records for Darwin , plus station count ( green line ) .
This raw data is downloaded from GISS , but GISS use the GHCN raw data as the starting point for their analysis .
Darwin does have a few advantages over other stations with multiple records .
There is a continuous record from 1941 to the present ( Station 1 ) .
There is also a continuous record covering a century .
finally , the stations are in very close agreement over the entire period of the record .
In fact , where there are multiple stations in operation they are so close that you ca n’t see the records behind Station Zero .
This is an ideal station , because it also illustrates many of the problems with the raw temperature station data .
There is no one record that covers the whole period .
The shortest record is only nine years long .
There are gaps of a month and more in almost all of the records .
It looks like there are problems with the data at around 1941 .
Most of the datasets are missing months .
For most of the period there are few nearby stations .
There is no one year covered by all five records .
The temperature dropped over a six year period , from a high in 1936 to a low in 1941 .
The station did move in 1941 … but what happened in the previous six years ?
In resolving station records , it ’s a judgment call .
First off , you have to decide if what you are looking at needs any changes at all .
In Darwin ’s case , it ’s a close call .
The record seems to be screwed up around 1941 , but not in the year of the move .
Also , although the 1941 temperature shift seems large , I see a similar sized shift from 1992 to 1999 .
Looking at the whole picture , I think I ’d vote to leave it as it is , that ’s always the best option when you do n’t have other evidence .
First do no harm .
However , there ’s a case to be made for adjusting it , particularly given the 1941 station move .
If I decided to adjust Darwin , I ’d do it like this :
Figure 6 A possible adjustment for Darwin .
Black line shows the total amount of the adjustment , on the right scale , and shows the timing of the change .
I shifted the pre-1941 data down by about 0.6C .
We end up with little change end to end in my “ adjusted ” data ( shown in red ) , it ’s neither warming nor cooling .
However , it reduces the apparent cooling in the raw data .
Post - 1941 , where the other records overlap , they are very close , so I would n’t adjust them in any way .
Why should we adjust those , they all show exactly the same thing .
OK , so that ’s how I ’d homogenize the data if I had to , but I vote against adjusting it at all .
It only changes one station record ( Darwin Zero ) , and the rest are left untouched .
Then I went to look at what happens when the GHCN removes the “ in-homogeneities ” to “ adjust ” the data .
Of the five raw datasets , the GHCN discards two , likely because they are short and duplicate existing longer records .
The three remaining records are first “ homogenized ” and then averaged to give the “ GHCN Adjusted ” temperature record for Darwin .
To my great surprise , here ’s what I found .
To explain the full effect , I am showing this with both datasets starting at the same point ( rather than ending at the same point as they are often shown ) .
Figure 7 . GHCN homogeneity adjustments to Darwin Airport combined record
YIKES !
Before getting homogenized , temperatures in Darwin were falling at 0.7 Celcius per century … but after the homogenization , they were warming at 1.2 Celcius per century .
And the adjustment that they made was over two degrees per century … when those guys “ adjust ” , they do n’t mess around .
And the adjustment is an odd shape , with the adjustment first going stepwise , then climbing roughly to stop at 2.4C .
Of course , that led me to look at exactly how the GHCN “ adjusts ” the temperature data .
Here ’s what they say in An Overview of the GHCN Database :
GHCN temperature data include two different datasets : the original data and a homogeneity - adjusted dataset .
All homogeneity testing was done on annual time series .
The homogeneity - adjustment technique used two steps .
The first step was creating a homogeneous reference series for each station ( Peterson and Easterling 1994 ) .
Building a completely homogeneous reference series using data with unknown inhomogeneities may be impossible , but we used several techniques to minimize any potential inhomogeneities in the reference series .
…
In creating each year ’s first difference reference series , we used the five most highly correlated neighboring stations that had enough data to accurately model the candidate station . …
The final technique we used to minimize inhomogeneities in the reference series used the mean of the central three values ( of the five neighboring station values ) to create the first difference reference series .
Fair enough , that all sounds good .
They pick five neighboring stations , and average them .
Then they compare the average to the station in question .
If it looks wonky compared to the average of the reference five , they check any historical records for changes , and if necessary , they homogenize the poor data mercilessly .
I have some problems with what they do to homogenize it , but that ’s how they identify the inhomogeneous stations .
OK … but given the scarcity of stations in Australia , I wondered how they would find five “ neighboring stations ” in 1941 …
So I looked it up .
The nearest station that covers the year 1941 is 500 km away from Darwin .
Not only is it 500 km away , it is the only station within 750 km of Darwin that covers the 1941 time period .
( It ’s also a pub , Daly Waters Pub to be exact , but hey , it ’s Australia , good on ya . )
So there simply are n’t five stations to make a “ reference series ” out of to check the 1936 - 1941 drop at Darwin .
Intrigued by the curious shape of the average of the homogenized Darwin records , I then went to see how they had homogenized each of the individual station records .
What made up that strange average shown in Fig.
7 ? I started at zero with the earliest record .
Here is Station Zero at Darwin , showing the raw and the homogenized versions .
Figure 8 Darwin Zero Homogeneity Adjustments .
Black line shows amount and timing of adjustments .
Yikes again , double yikes !
What on earth justifies that adjustment ?
How can they do that ?
We have five different records covering Darwin from 1941 on .
They all agree almost exactly .
Why adjust them at all ?
They ’ve just added a huge artificial totally imaginary trend to the last half of the raw data !
Now it looks like the IPCC diagram in Figure 1 , all right … but a six degree per century trend ?
And in the shape of a regular stepped pyramid climbing to heaven ?
What ’s up with that ?
Those , dear friends , are the clumsy fingerprints of someone messing with the data Egyptian style … they are indisputable evidence that the “ homogenized ” data has been changed to fit someone ’s preconceptions about whether the earth is warming .
One thing is clear from this .
People who say that “ Climategate was only about scientists behaving badly , but the data is OK ” are wrong .
At least one part of the data is bad , too .
The Smoking Gun for that statement is at Darwin Zero .
So once again , I ’m left with an unsolved mystery .
How and why did the GHCN “ adjust ” Darwin ’s historical temperature to show radical warming ?
Why did they adjust it stepwise ?
Do Phil Jones and the CRU folks use the “ adjusted ” or the raw GHCN dataset ?
My guess is the adjusted one since it shows warming , but of course we still do n’t know … because despite all of this , the CRU still has n’t released the list of data that they actually use , just the station list .
Another odd fact , the GHCN adjusted Station 1 to match Darwin Zero ’s strange adjustment , but they left Station 2 ( which covers much of the same period , and as per Fig. 5 is in excellent agreement with Station Zero and Station 1 ) totally untouched .
They only homogenized two of the three .
Then they averaged them .
That way , you get an average that looks kinda real , I guess , it “ hides the decline ” .
Oh , and for what it ’s worth , care to know the way that GISS deals with this problem ?
Well , they only use the Darwin data after 1963 , a fine way of neatly avoiding the question … and also a fine way to throw away all of the inconveniently colder data prior to 1941 .
It ’s likely a better choice than the GHCN monstrosity , but it ’s a hard one to justify .
Now , I want to be clear here .
The blatantly bogus GHCN adjustment for this one station does NOT mean that the earth is not warming .
It also does NOT mean that the three records ( CRU , GISS , and GHCN ) are generally wrong either .
This may be an isolated incident , we do n’t know .
But every time the data gets revised and homogenized , the trends keep increasing .
Now GISS does their own adjustments .
However , as they keep telling us , they get the same answer as GHCN gets … which makes their numbers suspicious as well .
And CRU ?
Who knows what they use ?
We ’re still waiting on that one , no data yet …
What this does show is that there is at least one temperature station where the trend has been artificially increased to give a false warming where the raw data shows cooling .
In addition , the average raw data for Northern Australia is quite different from the adjusted , so there must be a number of … mmm … let me say “ interesting ” adjustments in Northern Australia other than just Darwin .
And with the Latin saying “ Falsus in unum , falsus in omis ” ( false in one , false in all ) as our guide , until all of the station “ adjustments ” are examined , adjustments of CRU , GHCN , and GISS alike , we ca n’t trust anyone using homogenized numbers .

NOTE : Figures 7 and 8 updated to fix a typo in the titles .
8:30 PM PST 12/8 – Anthony
The Smoking Gun At Darwin Zero People keep saying “ Yes , the Climategate scientists behaved badly .
But that does n’t mean the data is bad .
That does n’t mean the earth is not warming . ”
Let me start with the second objection first .
The earth has generally been warming since the Little Ice Age , around 1650 .
There is general agreement that the earth has warmed since then .
See e.g. < a href= ”
http://www.iarc.uaf.edu/highlights/2007/akasofu_3_07/Earth_recovering_from_LIA.pdf”>Akasufo</a>.
Climategate does n’t affect that .
The second question , the integrity of the data , is different .
People say “ Yes , they destroyed emails , and hid from Freedom of information Acts , and messed with proxies , and fought to keep other scientists ’ papers out of the journals … but that does n’t affect the data , the data is still good . ”
Which sounds reasonable .
There are three main global temperature datasets .
One is at the CRU , Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia , where we ’ve been trying to get access to the raw numbers .
One is at NOAA / GHCN , the Global Historical Climate Network .
The final one is at NASA / GISS , the Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
The three groups take raw data , and they “ homogenize ” it to remove things like when a station was moved to a warmer location and there ’s a 2C jump in the temperature .
The three global temperature records are usually called CRU , GISS , and GHCN .
Both GISS and CRU , however , get almost all of their raw data from GHCN .
All three produce very similar global historical temperature records from the raw data .
So I ’m still on my multi- year quest to understand the climate data .
You never know where this data chase will lead .
This time , it has ended me up in Australia .
I got to thinking about Professor Wibjorn Karlen ’s statement about Australia that I quoted < a href= ” http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/11/29/when-results-go-bad/“>here</a>:
Another example is Australia .
NASA [ GHCN ] only presents 3 stations covering the period 1897 - 1992 .
What kind of data is the IPCC Australia diagram based on ?
If any trend it is a slight cooling .
However , if a shorter period ( 1949 - 2005 ) is used , the temperature has increased substantially .
The Australians have many stations and have published more detailed maps of changes and trends .
The folks at CRU told Wibjorn that he was just plain wrong .
Here ’s what they said is right , the record that Wibjorn was talking about , Fig. 9.12 in the UN IPCC Fourth Assessment Report , showing Northern Australia : Figure 1 .
Temperature trends and model results in Northern Australia .
Black line is observations ( From Fig. 9.12 from the UN IPCC Fourth Annual Report ) .
Covers the area from 110E to 155E , and from 30S to 11S .
Based on the CRU land temperature . )
Data from the CRU .
One of the things that was revealed in the released CRU emails is that the CRU basically uses the Global Historical Climate Network ( GHCN ) dataset for its raw data .
So I looked at the GHCN dataset .
There , I find three stations in North Australia as Wibjorn had said , and nine stations in all of Australia , that cover the period 1900 - 2000 .
Here is the average of the GHCN unadjusted data for those three Northern stations , from < a href=http://www.appinsys.com/GlobalWarming/climate.aspx>AIS</a>:
Figure 2 . GHCN Raw Data , All 100 - yr stations in IPCC area above .
So once again Wibjorn is correct , this looks nothing like the corresponding IPCC temperature record for Australia .
But it ’s too soon to tell .
Professor Karlen is only showing 3 stations .
Three is not a lot of stations , but that ’s all of the century - long Australian records we have in the IPCC specified region .
OK , we ’ve seen the longest stations record , so lets throw more records into the mix .
Here ’s every station in the UN IPCC specified region which contains temperature records that extend up to the year 2000 no matter when they started , which is 30 stations .
Figure 3 . GHCN Raw Data ,
All stations extending to 2000 in IPCC area above .
Still no similarity with IPCC .
So I looked at every station in the area .
That ’s 222 stations .
Here ’s that result : Figure 4 . GHCN Raw Data ,
All stations extending to 2000 in IPCC area above .
So you can see why Wibjorn was concerned .
This looks nothing like the UN IPCC data , which came from the CRU , which was based on the GHCN data .
Why the difference ?
The answer is , these graphs all use the raw GHCN data .
But the IPCC uses the “ adjusted ” data .
GHCN adjusts the data to remove what it calls “ inhomogeneities ” .
So on a whim I thought I ’d take a look at the first station on the list , Darwin Airport , so I could see what an inhomogeneity might look like when it was at home .
And I could find out how large the GHCN adjustment for Darwin inhomogeneities was .
First , what is an “ inhomogeneity ” ?
I can do no better than quote from GHCN : Most long - term climate stations have undergone changes that make a time series of their observations inhomogeneous .
There are many causes for the discontinuities , including changes in instruments , shelters , the environment around the shelter , the location of the station , the time of observation , and the method used to calculate mean temperature .
Often several of these occur at the same time , as is often the case with the introduction of automatic weather stations that is occurring in many parts of the world .
Before one can reliably use such climate data for analysis of longterm climate change , adjustments are needed to compensate for the nonclimatic discontinuities .
That makes sense .
The raw data will have jumps from station moves and the like .
We do n’t want to think it ’s warming just because the thermometer was moved to a warmer location .
Unpleasant as it may seem , we have to adjust for those as best we can .
I always like to start with the rawest data , so I can understand the adjustments .
At Darwin there are five separate individual station records that are combined to make up the final Darwin record .
These are the individual records of stations in the area , which are numbered from zero to four : DATA SOURCE : http://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/findstation.py?datatype=gistemp&data_set=0&name=darwin
Figure 5 . Five individual temperature records for Darwin , plus station count ( green line ) .
This raw data is downloaded from GISS , but GISS use the GHCN raw data as the starting point for their analysis .
Darwin does have a few advantages over other stations with multiple records .
There is a continuous record from 1941 to the present ( Station 1 ) .
There is also a continuous record covering a century .
finally , the stations are in very close agreement over the entire period of the record .
In fact , where there are multiple stations in operation they are so close that you ca n’t see the records behind Station Zero .
This is an ideal station , because it also illustrates many of the problems with the raw temperature station data .
There is no one record that covers the whole period .
The shortest record is only nine years long .
There are gaps of a month and more in almost all of the records .
It looks like there are problems with the data at around 1941 .
Most of the datasets are missing months .
For most of the period there are few nearby stations .
There is no one year covered by all five records .
The temperature dropped over a six year period , from a high in 1936 to a low in 1941 .

Think Antarctica and you think snow .
A vast and unending , featureless panorama of it .
Andrew McDonnell , a PhD student at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and MIT , traveled to the Palmer U.S. Research Station in Antarctica to see snow , but not on land .
Instead Mr. McDonnell was interested in the timeless undersea blizzard of particulate matter known as marine snow , the ghostly detritus of animals that descends the water column , sometimes taking months to reach the bottom .
Palmer Station sits on a drab pile of rocks on the western shore of the Antarctic Peninsula .
Here Adelie penguins are disappearing by the tens of thousands ( from 35,000 breeding pairs in 1973 to just 5,000 today ) , 85 per cent of the glaciers are receding and average winter temperatures have jumped 11 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 50 years .
In fact , on the miserable , sleeting 35 - degree day that Mr. McDonnell gave a talk at the Vineyard Haven Library this week , his sunbathing colleagues at the Palmer Station were enjoying a cloudless 36 - degree beauty .
Could there be a connection between these unusual changes on land and the submarine snowflakes Mr. McDonnell was investigating ?
Antarctica is an otherworldly place where the summer sun flirts with the horizon without ever quite dipping below , casting strange , oblique rays of twilight gold on the jagged mountains that jut 4,000 feet straight out of the sea .
Untouched by human influence for millions of years and protected by the Antarctic Treaty for peaceful scientific research , it is also a pristine laboratory for researchers in the natural sciences .
“ Geologists on my research vessel would go to the beach and come back with chests full of fossils , ” said Mr. McDonnell .
“ They would pick up fossils of giant sea snails a meter across which were just lying on the ground because no one had ever been there . ”
But Mr. McDonnell came to the Antarctic to study the carbon cycle .
The earth ’s atmosphere holds roughly 597 gigatons of carbon , but the deep ocean holds 37,200 .
If the world ’s rain forests are a carbon sink , then the world ’s deep oceans are a swimming pool .
Phytoplankton in the ocean locks up carbon and other elements by converting them to organic matter through photosynthesis .
When these animals die , they sink to the bottom , taking their carbon with them , and in doing so , changing the chemistry of the ocean around them .
This is what is known as a biological pump .
It is why some people have advocated fertilizing the surface of the earth ’s oceans to combat climate change , effectively accelerating the pump by kicking up a northeaster of marine snow .
On Mr. McDonnell ’s latest research voyage it was his job to measure how effectively this pump was operating in Antarctica , where seasonal changes in sea ice have disrupted the local ecology .
He did this by catching snow as it fell through the frigid depths and measuring it .
It turned out that Antarctic waters are not as productive as in years past .
The reasons are complicated but depend in part on the disappearance of sea ice , which the local ecosystem depends on , but are also due to ongoing global ocean acidification , which is caused by the sea ’s absorption of excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
This hinders the development of some ph-sensitive organisms ( oceans saturated with carbon dioxide are also able to absorb less carbon , leaving more of it in the atmosphere ) .
Ocean acidification harms plankton populations .
— Andrew McDonnell
When primary production in the form of plankton slows , animals up the food chain suffer , such as salps , krill and fish ; and later ; penguins , seals and whales .
Antarctica was n’t all work for Mr. McDonnell though .
He described playing Frisbee golf on a moraine once covered by glaciers , visiting abandoned Chilean research stations and placing bets on which parts of the landscape would disappear by which date .
Scientists are not as a whole a particularly optimistic bunch .
Mr. McDonnell gives talks about his research not only to raise awareness of the ecological issues facing Antarctica and the world at large , but to raise awareness of Antarctica itself .
— Andrew McDonnell
“ It ’s amazing to me how many people in the general public do n’t even know that it really exists , ” he said , adding : “ I saw this girl from high school who when I told her I was doing research in Antarctica said , ‘ Oh , that ’s up by like the North Pole , right ? ’”
He laughed : “ Well , not exactly . ”
Mr. McDonnell , who fell asleep most nights to the violent grinding sound of calving glaciers near Palmer , finally pulled up a slide of the Wilkins Ice Shelf , an area he visited last March .
“ We were offshore from Charcot Island here , which was connected to the continent by an ice bridge , ” he said .
“ When we got back to shore , by April Charcot Island was no longer connected to the mainland by this giant ice sheet because the ice shelf had disintegrated . ”
Wilkins is the tenth major ice shelf to collapse in recent decades .
“ For me that was quite a lesson , ” Mr. McDonnell said .
“ In my lifetime and in fact in my one trip to Antarctica the landscape was dramatically changing . ”
Dr Karl › Dr Karl 's Great Moments
In Science
Female hyenas have last laugh
Not until the 1930s could modern science easily tell the difference between girl and boy hyenas .
Dr Karl has been getting up close and personal with one of nature 's original gender benders .
Over the last few episodes , I debunked the three big myths about the spotted hyenas .
These myths are : that they are some kind of dog , when they 're actually a kind of cat ; that they have the most powerful bite for their weight , which they do n't ; and that they are loathsome cowardly scavengers , when they catch and kill 95 per cent of what they eat .
But Hyena
World gets even weirder .
Not only does the female spotted hyena outrank the male , but she also has an organ that looks exactly like the male 's penis .
Even stranger , this is what she gets pregnant through , and even gives birth through .
Hyenas are not solitary scavengers .
Instead , these sophisticated hunters live in complex clans of up to 80 members .
They live in communal dens , a collection of underground tunnels with many above - ground entrances .
They come together only for three occasions : kills , defending the territory , and to hang out at the communal den .
Their territory ranges from 40 to 1000 square kilometres .
There are very few female - dominated societies , but spotted hyenas have such a society .
The lowest status female outranks the highest status male .
The females are more aggressive than the males .
The high - ranking female cubs are off to a golden start in life .
A high - ranking hyena gets first access to the food , as well as more powerful allies and a better grade of protection .
As a result , she has a longer reproductive life , and more litters .
Her teeth are in better condition , because she gets first pick of the kill , and so she does n't have to crush bones that can damage her teeth .
Instead , she feasts on the best and most tender meat , unlike the lowly males .
Alpha females are younger when they first get pregnant , they get most of the matings , they have cubs more often and they have a greater survival rate for their cubs .
Even so , all the females have cubs , because they can pick and choose from the low - ranking males .
About 90 per cent of males leave the clan when they become sexually mature , around the age of two or three .
They then have to spend two years as a junior male , with no matings during that time .
They are the very lowest ranking animal in the clan , being bossed around by all the other males and females , and having the very last access to the food and females .
It 's a very hard life being a male spotted hyena .
Now it 's been known for a long time that there was something special about the sexual anatomy and physiology of the spotted hyenas .
Quite a few of the ancient writers declared that the spotted hyena was a hermaphrodite with the genitals of both sexes in one body , or that it could change its sex .
But it was only as recently as the 1930s that modern science examined hyenas .
The females have a clitoris that looks just like a penis , and through which they give birth !
The clitoris is so enlarged that it looks just like the male hyena 's penis ( the zoologists call it a ' pseudopenis ' ) .
The female spotted hyenas do have a vagina , but it does not open directly to the outside world .
Instead , it communicates with the outside world via the pseudopenis .
It is a true vagina , both in its appearance to the naked eye , and under a microscope .
But like the male hyena 's penis , the female pseudopenis has two ' corpora cavernosa ' and a single ' corpus spongiosum ' .
This means the female spotted hyena could have a genuine erection of its pseudopenis , just as the male could with his penis .
It is even as long as the male 's penis ( about 17 centimetres ) .
The female 's labia are fused together , and because it has two fatty pads , looks almost identical to a male 's scrotum .
Sometimes even hyena specialists cannot tell the difference between boy and girl hyenas , until what they thought was a boy gives birth .
The female spotted hyenas urinate , copulate and give birth through the pseudopenis .
Mating is impossible without the full cooperation of the female .
The male has to balance very precariously , because of the orientation of the pseudopenis .
Spotted hyenas are not solitary , skulking , cringing , cowardly scavengers .
Instead , they are sophisticated and skilled hunters that live in a complex female - dominated society .
The doting mothers are very caring , tolerant and affectionate , and probably invest more time and energy in their young than any other animal .
Unfortunately , spotted hyenas have such an undeservedly bad reputation that zoos do n't want to carry them , and conservation groups do n't want to adopt them ( After all , have you seen a hyena on a conservation T - shirt recently ? ) .
So we do n't get to see them at close quarters , and we do n't learn the real facts about these amazing gender - bending , role - reversing animals .

Houston is the home of Lakewood Church – the mega - church that meets in an old sports arena that seats tens of thousands every Sunday .
The leader of that church , televangelist and best - selling author Joel Osteen , gave the opening prayer as Houston inaugurated Annise Parker as mayor last week .
Parker took the oath on her grandmother ’s Bible , held by her partner , Kathy Hubbard .
That ’s right , Mayor Parker is a lesbian .
Osteen blessed the new mayor , praying at her inauguration : “ God , we just thank you for raising her up .
We honor her today and other elected officials . . .
We count it a joy and an honor to be here . ”
Osteen ’s presence was a bit puzzling to me .
True , he ’s probably Houston ’s most famous pastor , but he chose to deliver a positive prayer for his city ’s new mayor .
It ’s almost enough to warm my heart toward Osteen – who last year told the ladies on The View that homosexuality is not “ God ’s best ” for people .
Then I read a statement from Don Iloff Jr. , a spokesman for Osteen , on why he chose to pray at the event :
“ If you ask Joel he ’ll tell you ‘ when I can pray at an event over government leaders and in Jesus ’ name it ’s hard to resist , ' ” Iloff said .
Osteen prayed for the previous mayor , Bill White , at his inauguration .
“ Annise says she ’s a believer .
Let her stand before God ; that ’s kind of where Joel is , ” Iloff noted .
“ He ’s not going to tell homosexuals they ca n’t come to our church .
If the Holy Spirit convicts them , then they ’ll change . ”
Not to read too much into Iloff ’s statement , but what I hear is that Osteen took the opportunity mix politics , religion , and friendship evangelism all at once .
He got to pray “ in Jesus ’ name ” at a government event for an elected official who happens to be an open lesbian , who says she believes in God – but the Holy Spirit still has a chance to convict her heart and change her at some point .
But , hey , perhaps I ’m jaded and always tend to hear anti-gay messages when spoken by anti-gay people , even if it is spoken in pretty code .
Michael Jones over at Change.org celebrated Osteen ’s appearance at the inauguration : “ But give both Osteen and Parker some credit .
Today was a day for the history books for LGBT politicians , and also a day where a socially conservative evangelical leader and a progressive lesbian mayor found some common ground in celebrating a victory . ”
This was written before Iloff ’s made his comments .
After hearing from Iloff , I ca n’t shake the feeling that this was n’t so much about Osteen finding common ground with Parker as much as it was simply Osteen taking another opportunity to be in the limelight and for his spokesman to once again remind the world that gays , while welcome to worship and run the city , are still not “ God ’s best . ”
Boston Medical Center ( BMC ) surgeons are now offering patients an incisionless alternative to laparoscopic and traditional surgery for treatment of acid reflux or GERD .
Using the new procedure known as EsophyX TIF ( Transoral Incisionless Fundaplication ) , surgeons can repair or reconstruct the valve between the esophagus and stomach , effectively stopping GERD .
BMC is the only hospital in New England offering this new treatment .
GERD , also referred to as chronic heartburn , is reflux and regurgitation of the contents of the stomach into the esophagus that is frequent and severe enough to impact daily life and may even damage the esophagus .
It is one of the most common diseases , with more than 60 million Americans experiencing symptoms at least once a month .
Approximately 14 million Americans have GERD so frequent and severe that they experience symptoms every day .
Normally , after swallowing , a valve between the esophagus and stomach opens to allow food to pass into the stomach , then closes to prevent reflux of the food back into the esophagus .
With GERD , this valve is weakened or absent , allowing the acidic digestive juices from the stomach to flow back ( or reflux ) into the esophagus .
Using the EsophyX , BMC surgeons are able to pass surgical instruments together with an endoscope through a patient 's mouth and tighten or repair the weakened valve without making any incisions into the skin .
" Compared to laparoscopic or traditional surgery , patients treated via the endoscope have required less anesthesia and experienced less complication rates , shorter hospital stays and faster recovery , reduced patient discomfort , and no need for incisions , " said Miguel Burch , MD , Co-Director of Esophageal and Acid Reflux Disorders , Center for Digestive Disorders at BMC .
" Patients are typically able to return home and to normal activities the day following the procedure , " he added .
Complications associated with untreated GERD are well documented and can have a significant impact on quality of life and , in extreme cases , life expectancy .
Esophagitis can quickly become a chronic condition , and if the damage is severe , esophageal ulcers can form .
If left untreated , a potentially premalignant condition , Barrett 's esophagus , can develop and in a small percentage of patients this can progress to esophageal cancer .
" While over - the - counter medications may alleviate the symptoms , by decreasing production of stomach acid , they do n't solve the anatomical problem and reflux ( without acid ) can still continue causing injury but without symptoms to warn the patient , " said Hiran Fernando , MD , a cardiothoracic surgeon and director of minimally invasive thoracic surgery at BMC who performs the procedure jointly with Burch .
" For patients who are dissatisfied with pharmaceutical therapies and are concerned about the long - term effects of over - the counter medications , this procedure may be the answer , " added Fernando .
According to the BMC surgeons , anatomical correction is key to long - term prevention of GERD and disease progression .
Unfortunately , they say even laparoscopic surgical repair can be invasive and may be associated with side effects like gas bloat and difficulty swallowing .
For this reason , less than one percent of GERD patients currently choose invasive surgical therapy to treat their condition .
The almost - great escape : Panda cub Wen
Li makes break for freedom from nursery pen
Testing the boundaries is part of growing up .
So Wn Li the panda club was only doing what comes naturally when she struggled up the side of her playpen to explore .
First one paw appeared , then the other and finally she pulled herself up to the top .
I 'm going for it : Wen Li grips the sides of her playpen with her paws as she hoists herself up - while twin sister Ya Li ignores her in the background
This is tougher than it looks :
Wen Li gets one paw over the edge
I can taste freedom ! :
Wen Li gets her other front paw over - and goes for the back foot
Gotcha !
Wen Li actually makes it over the edge of her pen - but is quickly collared by her amused handler
Unfortunately , her sense of balance is still a bit wobbly and she toppled over the side , ending up with little more than an upside - down view of the inside of her pen .
The failed attempt did not appear to deter Wen Li , however .
She was later spotted in what seems to be her favourite position once more - dangling from the edge of her playpen again .
These images of Wen Li - and her apparently quieter and better - behaved twin sister Ya Li - were taken at the Chengdu Giant Panda Research Institute .
Wen Li and Ya Li were born on July 19 , 2009 .
Sister Act :
The failed escape does not appear to have deterred Wen Li , as she dangles from the edge of the pen once more - and sister Ya Li appears to be trying to get in on the fun
What 's in here ?
The boisterous Wen Li is distracted by the joys of exploring a plastic box
Just four pandas were born at the institute in 2009 , compared to 18 babies born in 2008 , researchers said .
The reason ?
Leading researchers believe the mothers at the institute were too ' exhausted ' to have any more babies .
The mischievous Wen Li's mother Li Li may have a thing or two to say about that .
Watch me , Mom !
Wen Li frolics with her mother , the ' exhausted '
Li Li
Greetings to my fans :
Wen Li is taken to be bottle fed at the nursery in China
Exclusive : Osama Bin Laden's Son Warns His Successors Will Be Worse Omar bin Laden says the U.S. will never catch his father .
DUBAI Feb. 11 , 2010  -- Osama bin Laden 's son has a chilling warning for those who are hunting his father with drones , secret agents and missile strikes .
From Omar bin Laden 's up - close look at the next generation of mujahideen and al Qaeda training camps he says the worst may lie ahead , that if his father is killed America may face a broader and more violent enemy , with nothing to keep them in check .
" From what I knew of my father and the people around him I believe he is the most kind among them , because some are much , much worse , " Omar bin Laden , who was raised in the midst of his father 's fighters , told ABC News in an exclusive interview .
" Their mentality wants to make more violence , to create more problems . "
Omar has turned his back on his father 's philosophy , a remarkable step for a man in an Arab culture where it is a sin to disobey his father and taboo to openly criticize him .
It was doubly significant for Omar bin Laden because his father had picked him to succeed him as the leader of jihad .
The son spoke out again recently after hearing his father in an audio tape praise the attempt by the so - called " underwear bomber " to blow up a jetliner over Detroit on Christmas Day .
" Attacking peaceful people is not being fair , it is unacceptable .
If you have a problem with armies or governments you should fight those people .
This is what I find unacceptable in my father 's way , " Omar told ABC News .
" My father should find some letter to send to all of these people , at least to tell them they should n't attack the civilians , " he said .
Omar is a clearly conflicted peacenik , bearing some signs of a loyal son and trying to explain his father 's hatred .
When asked whether there is anything his father likes about the United States , Omar says " their weapons , " and nothing else .
The son of Osama , however , had praise for the U.S. saying , " They do n't care what is your race , what is your skin , where you come from , this is very good . "
And despite the $ 25 million bounty on his father 's head and the ever - searching drones , Omar is confident that his father wo n't be caught and that no Afghan will turn him in .
" It 's been 30 years now since he started fighting there .
Who could catch him ?
No one ....
This is the country that whoever gets in is stuck , be it the armies or the mujahideen , " he said .
Omar says even he does not know where his father is .
Osama Bin Laden 's Sons Are ' Peaceful '
Although polls like the Pew Attitudes survey show steadily declining support for bin Laden in the Arab and Muslim world , Omar says he still hears vocal , if subtle endorsements .
" Nobody dares to say , ' I follow your father ' in public .
But I find it very often and everywhere , people say ' We like your father .
Your father is a hero . ' "
What 's not clear is whether Osama bin Laden 's children follow him .
Despite reports that some of Omar 's brothers fought and died in Afghanistan , Omar says the sons of Osama are " peaceful , " with no interest in their father 's war .
For years the whereabouts of his family were unknown , until headlines late last year suggested the family , minus Osama , had moved from Afghanistan to neighboring Iran .
As Omar tells it , up to 40 members of the bin Laden family , wives and children , used fake identity documents to cross the border along with hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the U.S. invasion .
They now live in a comfortable Tehran compound , but under house arrest .
" The Iranian government has showed very good caring to my brothers and sisters .
The only mistake is that until now they have n't been released , " said Omar , describing an upper crust lifestyle : swimming pool , tennis court , shopping trips , and horseback riding along the coast .
The children have had no access to formal education , and every foot they set outside the home must be chaperoned by Iranian security forces .
In November , Omar 's 17 - year - old sister Imam escaped from Iranian custody and fled to the Saudi Embassy , where he says she is still living .
Omar and Imam have spoken by phone , but Iran has so far refused to let her leave the country , and has n't responded to requests from Omar and his mother to see her and verify her identity .
Her lack of official identification documents is one reason Iran has said it wo n't give her an exit visa .
One younger brother , Bakr bin Laden , was allowed to leave in December .
" [ Iranian ] President Ahmadinejad and his Minister of Foreign Affairs know they should do the right thing ... they could release all of them if they wanted , " said Omar .
Most are being held against their will , though Omar 's wife , Zaina Al Sabah , says seven or eight of them have said they want to stay in Iran .
Osama bin Laden raised his family of five wives ( plus one marriage that was annulled ) and more than a dozen children in a way meant to make them tough and ready for the rigors of war .
He shunned air conditioning and refrigerators in the desert heat , banned toys and the kind of laughter that showed too many teeth , refused to wince when his men used Omar 's puppies as the victims in chemical weapons tests .
He would cane his children for the slightest misbehavior , at times hitting them so hard the stick would break .
Osama Bin Laden Urged His Sons to Be Suicide Bombers
" He did n't treat us differently than any of his followers .
He just expected us to act like everyone else , because he was the leader , " said Omar .
He and his brothers were given weapons training .
In a breaking point between them , Osama encouraged them to sign up for suicide missions , volunteering to blow themselves up .
" We were shocked .
Why would our father say something like this to us ?
After he went away we just talked about it and said this was never going to happen , this was not our way . "
Omar found the rare and substantial nerve it took to talk back .
" I objected , and said why did you do this ?
What is the point ?
He did n't respond .
We were not more important than his big goal ... and nothing would stop him from this . "
Today , Omar shrugs off the notion that his father had a cruel streak .
He sees the spartan treatment as part of Osama 's worldview .
In his book " Growing Up Bin Laden , " Omar notes the change in his father when he lands back in Afghanistan amid the violence of war and begins a rugged trip to a complex of barren caves in the Tora Bora mountains .
" I looked at my father .
He did not seem to mind the trying conditions , but seemed exhilarated by them , " Omar wrote .
He added with a grudging admiration , " No matter what , my father was a tough man . "
In Omar 's book , his father is infuriated with the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia , arriving to protect against an attack by Saddam Hussein in the first Gulf War .
( Omar says his father disliked the secular Saddam , and that there was " no contact , no connection " between the men . )
In August 1996 Bin Laden declared war on America from his Afghan cave , citing the fact that U.S. forces were still in the Persian Gulf .
His father 's pitch to the incoming mujahideen was different , focused on Arab discontent over the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , an issue with broader appeal .
They came in droves , a new generation of men seeking jihad , or holy war , against the infidels of the West .
Omar describes how during meetings of mujahideen in Kandahar , leaders would play videos of perceived Israeli atrocities , the demolition of homes and the killing of civilians .
Men would leave the meeting raging to fight .
Between Israel and America , Osama saw America as an easier target .
" He thinks America is weaker than Israel .
America is easier to get attacked , with its huge cities , " Omar said .
" He sees America is the main power , but in fact is weak in certain ways . "
Omar believes most Al Qaeda fighters can be turned , and that efforts like terrorist rehabilitation programs in Saudi Arabia do work .
The problem , as he sees it , is that their home countries are reluctant to take them back .
" The jihadis , as I know them , want to return to their country and they 're afraid because they know they are going to be killed or poisoned or imprisoned , so they stay with my father , " he said .
When Omar broke with his father and left Afghanistan before the Sept. 11 attacks , he sought to reclaim a life he never had .
His family is trying to get access their inherited Bin Laden wealth , but Omar says the money is " stuck , " held by governments in Sudan and Saudi Arabia .
Omar says his dream in life is to reunite his family and succeed as a businessman .
Being the son of Osama has made both a challenge , and left him expressing a deep discomfort .
" I am a peaceful man , but I do n't have peace , " he said .
Two additional cases of a boy being subject to schools rules that do n’t apply to girls prompts a re-post .
I ’ve added the new instances to the end .
Tara C. sent us a link to a story about a 4 - year - old boy who has been given in - school suspension ( and was threatened with expulsion ) for having hair that breaks the dress code for the Dallas , TX , school system :
Dmitriy T.M. sent in another story , this one featuring a 6 - year - old named Gareth who was being placed into in - school suspension ( i.e. , spending all day each day in the principal ’s office ) because of his long hair and earring .
So , this still you see of him below … that ’s what counts as long hair .
And , can you spot the earring in his left ear ?
It ’s there .
In another case , 16 - year - old Kasey Landrum was suspended for wearing eye - liner on school grounds ( after classes were out ) :
Of course , these are n’t just about enforcing a dress code .
It ’s a gendered code ; girls are n’t required to have short hair cuts , because on girls , longer hair is n’t “ distracting , ” it ’s “ normal . ”
As is make - up and earrings .
Implicit in the idea of what counts as an appropriate appearance , then , is the gender of the person wearing it .
These cases reveal , further , that girls are allowed more choices than boys because we are more accepting of girls acting boyish than boys acting girlish ( in what sociologists call “ androcentrism “ ) .
The final case also reveals the importance of intersectionality , or the way that different identities come together in complicated ways .
Landrum claims that an ostensibly heterosexual boy was allowed to wear punk - style make - up to school on the same day .
So breaking gender rules is apparently okay if you affirm that you ’re heterosexual , and maybe being gay is okay if you do n’t break any gender rules , but doing both is going too far .
Even with the next legislative session a year away , state Rep.
Dan Branch , chair of the Higher Education Committee , has been visiting college presidents , delivering a frank warning :
Texas families can’t take any more big tuition hikes , and neither can the cash - strapped state bail out bulging college budgets .
Since 2003 , when the Legislature deregulated tuition by allowing individual boards of regents to set prices for each school , tuition and fees at four - year state schools has skyrocketed by an average of 63 percent , from $ 1,934 per semester to $ 3,150 according to the last state figures , from 2008 .
At some schools , such as Stephen F. Austin , Prairie View A&M , and Texas A&M Galveston , the cost of an education nearly doubled in that five - year span .
“ Somebody ’s got to give the higher education community a signal , ” said Branch , R - Dallas .
“ Realistically , when we ’re looking at sales tax revenues being off 12 , 15 or even 20 percent … it ’s going to be rough .
I ’ve seen some university presidents ’ eyes get big when I say it , but I ’m telling them they better start storing up nuts for the winter . ”
Branch and other policy makers describe converging factors that could combine to either deplete state coffers or drive down quality , imperiling the state ’s long - term vision to boost both enrollment and graduation rates .
Two factors loom large in the troubling landscape .
First , the sagging economy is pushing more people who ca n’t get jobs back into school , driving up the costs to the state .
And second , the better universities perform at both attracting and graduating students , the more they will cost taxpayers , students , or both .
“ In higher education , there ’s an escape valve : Tuition .
We [ the state ] ca n’t give you enough money , but you [ the university ] can still take it out on the backs of poor families , ” said state Rep. Scott Hochberg , D - Houston .
Watching California
Politicians and educators have warily watched the budgetary bloodletting of universities in California this year , hoping it does n’t portend fiscal trouble in Texas .
California tuition recently spiked by a third , even amid aggressive cost- cutting in both academia and administration .
Meanwhile , at the University of Texas at Austin , tuition and fees now account for nearly two - thirds of total revenue — compared to only about 40 percent in 2002 .
At Texas Tech , which has held post - deregulation increases to relatively low rates , administrators tried freezing tuition in 2008 , only to come back with a whopping 10 percent hike this year .
As the next session approaches , the main question facing educators and policy makers is who will pay , how much , and how much universities can slash from their budgets without cutting too deeply into quality .
In the last session , several attempts to curtail the cost of higher education and tuition failed ; even so , several universities , including the flagship in Austin , have abided by legislative guidance in a non-binding resolution that called for limiting next year ’s hike to less than 4 percent .
Such relative frugality will be a stopgap at best in addressing more systemic cost issues , said Texas Commissioner of Higher Education Raymund Paredes .
Another inflation driver :
The state ’s new plan to transform seven additional universities to top - tier research institutions .
“ If you look at the increases in the cost of higher education , and the economic characteristics of the Texas population , you quickly determine we ’re at the edge , ” Paredes said .
Some argue the state remains at national averages in tuition costs , even with the rapid increases .
But family and student incomes are below the national average , making higher education less accessible here , Paredes said .
Another troubling statistic : Rising student debt .
Today , the average student graduates with about $ 20,000 in student loans , a figure he said has roughly doubled in the last decade .
“ That does n’t include students who do n’t graduate , and there are lot who struggle , flunk out , and end up with no degree and a lot of debt , ” Paredes said .
Screen - to - screen solutions ?
The state ’s budget crisis might or might not pass quickly , but some policy makers nonetheless see the higher education business model on the cusp of collapse .
With the bulk of any college ’s cost wrapped up in salaries , which recently have spiked , cutting the budget means cutting people .
Professors will have to teach more and research less , they say , and take advantage of the ever - growing array of available technologies .
Borrowing a page from their strategy to reduce the long - term costs of dead - tree textbooks in K - 12 schools , both Branch and Hochberg suggested technology could provide huge efficiencies , and maybe even a better education .
“ If you ’ve got interactive video of the best lecture on X subject , and it 's provided online constantly , you do n’t need to go hire the best lecturer , and you certainly do n’t need to go get a mediocre lecturer , ” Branch said .
“ You can have a graduate student proctor the class and share the cost with another university . ”
Such offerings could also cut through bureaucratic tangles that ensnare many college students , Hochberg said .
“ If I hear one more anecdote of a student trying to graduate in four years , but ca n’t because the university does n’t offer the class he needs that semester …
Those things are maddening — and expensive , ” he said .
“ And it ’s tied to poor planning and attitudes .
We need to decide if we ’re going to have customer - centered institutions or those that exist for faculty and administrators . ”
At the University of Texas at Austin , the administration has taken an opposite path in recent years , adding rather than cutting faculty , and paying ever - higher salaries to compete with major universities nationally , said Chief Financial Officer Kevin Hegarty .
In the last ten years , he said , the university has added 30 faculty members a year , in addition to replacing those who leave .
Hegarty does n’t buy that canned , screen - to - screen classes can replace more intimate connections between students and professors .
“ If you view education as a commodity to be videotaped and delivered to 100,000 students — which we do n’t — sure , you can cut costs , ” he said .
“ But education at this level is a human interaction , face - to - face . ”
Hegarty spent 25 years in corporate America , much of it at Dell , where he dealt strictly in commodities .
“ The name of the game there was to squeeze cost out of the box , out of the product you made , ” he said .
“ So you looked at manufacturing offshore and automation .
At any university , you can automate some administrative processes , but it still takes a lot of people . ”
Pinpointing blame , sharing pain
State Rep. Patrick Rose , D - Dripping Springs , wants to put budgetary responsibility squarely at the door of the Legislature .
His proposal , among several that failed to garner support last session , would have allowed universities to increase tuition if — and only if — the state failed to appropriate sufficient financing to maintain educational quality .
He puts the necessary increase somewhere between 4 and 6 percent per year .
Since deregulation in 2003 , the share of college costs shouldered by students has shot up while the state ’s portion has inched up , he said .
At UT - Austin , for instance , the students collectively paid $ 259 million in 2003 — compared to $ 491 million this year .
Meanwhile , the state paid $ 286 million in 2003 and $ 323 million this year .
Rose , who plans to push his legislation again next session , wants to cut a path between two extremes of “ bad policy ” :
Inflexible state mandates to cut tuition , and legislative failure to properly finance colleges .
“ This would put the blame on the Legislature if tuition goes up , and makes sure universities can continue their march toward excellence , ” Rose said .
Paredes , the higher education chief , said it may not matter whether the state was right or wrong to reign in its financing of universities — come next session , the money may simply not exist , particularly as legislators weigh hundreds of other dire needs .
“ If you ’re talking about shifting a larger share from students to the state , that ’s not likely to happen if any of the ( revenue ) projections I hear are accurate , ” he said .
“ The more typical consequence is what ’s happening in California : raising tuition and fees dramatically . ”
At UT - Austin , Hegarty said the market , at least so far , has shown it can bear the load .
“ I did n’t like it when my property tax bill went up this year , but it did , ” he said .
“ For most parents , it comes down to value :
What ’s the quality of the degree compared to what I pay ?
And most students think of the value proposition , too , which is why we had 34,000 applications for 7,000 seats . ”
Research Box Title
More than 12 billion years of cosmic history are shown in this unprecedented , panoramic , full - color view of thousands of galaxies in various stages of assembly .
This image , taken by NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope , was made from mosaics taken in September and October 2009 with the newly installed Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) and in 2004 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) .
The view covers a portion of the southern field of a large galaxy census called the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey ( GOODS ) , a deep - sky study by several observatories to trace the formation and evolution of galaxies .
The final image combines a broad range of colors , from the ultraviolet , through visible light , and into the near - infrared .
Such a detailed multi-color view of the universe has never before been assembled in such a combination of color , clarity , accuracy , and depth .
Hubble 's sharp resolution and new color versatility , produced by combining data from the two cameras , are allowing astronomers to sort out the various stages of galaxy formation .
The image reveals galaxy shapes that appear increasingly chaotic at each earlier epoch , as galaxies grew through accretion , collisions , and mergers .
The galaxies range from the mature spirals and ellipticals in the foreground , to smaller , fainter , irregularly shaped galaxies , most of which are farther away , and therefore existed farther back in time .
These smaller galaxies are considered the building blocks of the larger galaxies we see today .
Astronomers are using this multi-color panorama to trace many details of galaxy assembly over cosmic time , including the star - formation rate in galaxies , the rate of mergers among galaxies , and the abundance of weak active galactic nuclei .
The image shows a rich tapestry of 7,500 galaxies stretching back through most of the universe 's history .
The closest galaxies seen in the foreground emitted their observed light about a billion years ago .
The farthest galaxies , a few of the very faint red specks , are seen as they appeared more than 13 billion years ago , or roughly 650 million years after the Big Bang .
This mosaic spans a slice of space that is equal to about a third of the diameter of the full Moon ( 10 arcminutes ) .
The new Hubble view highlights a wide variety of stages in the galaxy assembly process .
Ultraviolet light taken by WFC3 shows the blue glow of hot , young stars in galaxies teeming with star birth .
The orange light reveals the final buildup of massive galaxies about 8 billion to 10 billion years ago .
The near - infrared light displays the red glow of very distant galaxies – in a few cases as far as 12 billion to 13 billion light - years away – whose light has been stretched , like a toy Slinky , from ultraviolet light to longer - wavelength infrared light due to the expansion of the universe .
In this ambitious use of Hubble 's observing time , astronomers used 96 Hubble orbits to make the ACS optical observations of this slice of the GOODS field and 104 orbits to make the WFC3 ultraviolet and near - infrared exposures .
WFC3 peered deeper into the universe in this study than comparable near - infrared observations from ground - based telescopes .
This set of unique new Hubble observations reveals galaxies to about 27th magnitude in brightness over a factor of 10 in wavelength .
That 's over 250 million times fainter than the unaided eye can see in visual light from a dark ground - based site .
Keeping the quantum and the classic separate ( Image : tdub303/flickr/fiz-iks.com )
WHY ca n’t we be in two places at the same time ?
The simple answer is that it ’s because large objects appear not to be subject to the same wacky laws of quantum mechanics that rule subatomic particles .
But why not – and how big does something have to be for quantum physics no longer to apply ?
Ripples in space - time could hold the answer .
The location of the boundary between the classical and quantum worlds is a long - standing mystery .
One idea is that everything starts off as a quantum system , existing in …

It weighs almost a tonne , has cost more than $ 2bn and , in 2013 , it will be lowered on to the surface of Mars with a landing system that has never been tried before .
The Mars Science Laboratory will " revolutionise investigations in science on other planets " , says Doug McCuistion , director of Nasa 's Mars exploration programme .
It will , he says , lay the foundations for future missions that will eventually bring pieces of the Red Planet back home to Earth .
" The ability to put a metric tonne on the surface ... gives us the capability to undertake sample collection , " says Dr McCuistion .
" To collect and launch samples back into orbit will require that size of a vehicle . "
But it has been a rather bumpy road to revolution .
It behoves us to plan our steps on Mars carefully
Adrian Brown , Seti Institute
The project has been struggling with technical challenges for several years , but Jim Green , the director of Nasa 's planetary science division , recently announced to the planetary science subcommittee that the project had finally turned the corner .
Adrian Brown , a planetary scientist from the Seti Institute in California , has been watching the project 's progress closely .
He says that MSL managers have been riding a " bucking bronco " since it was first proposed .
The first official cost estimate for MSL 's budget was set out in 2003 .
It was to be a " lander to carry out sophisticated surface observations and to validate sample return technologies " .
It would be a " medium cost " project .
So stated a document published by the National Research Council ( NRC ) , which said that projects in this medium price bracket would come in at under $ 650 m ( £ 412 m ) .
MSL is described as " Mini Cooper- sized "
But , at this point , the extent of the technology aboard MSL had been sketched out in only the most general terms .
NRC 's estimate was very modest .
In 2006 , the US Congress approved a figure of $ 1.63 bn for the mission .
This was the estimate from Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) , whose engineers would build the mobile laboratory , as well as an audacious " sky crane " system to land it safely on Mars .
The most recent estimate for the total cost is just under $ 2.4bn ( £ 1.5 bn ) .
This discrepancy led some scientists to criticise JPL for poor management .
And many feel that the project is bigger than it needs to be .
Dr Brown points out that we could have learned more about Mars by " going to a variety of landing sites with smaller robots but more accurate landing systems , so we could get on to challenging terrains " .
" MSL is a fantastically capable vehicle , and should provide some great science , " he says .
" But it behoves us to plan our steps on Mars carefully and deliver on the public expectations of a cool and exciting , but well planned , robotic exploration of the planet . "
Dr McCuistion argues that the budget " has not slipped dramatically " and stresses that MSL will indeed be worth it .
" This is completely the next step , " he says .
" We 're essentially taking a small chemistry lab and compressing it into a rover . "
Launch delay
The technical problems that plagued MSL - also known as " Curiosity " rover - eventually led Nasa , in 2008 , to postpone the launch date by two years to 2011 - a delay estimated to have cost $ 200 m .
Dr Brown says that the decision to make the rover so large turned it into something that JPL 's engineers could not accomplish before the 2009 initial launch date .
Nasa plans to launch MSL to the Red Planet in 2011
The problems were mainly in two areas , says Dr McCuistion .
" The first was the avionics , " he explains .
" They were brand new and much more challenging to build than expected .
" The other thing was the actuators .
These are motors , each with a transmission built into one integral unit . "
The sheer size and weight of MSL made these motors extremely complicated .
In the largest of the rover 's 50 actuators , there are up to 600 parts .
" They 're designed to operate at very low voltage but create very high torque levels - to be able to move this 900kg rover , and they have to operate over an extreme range of temperatures , " says Dr McCuistion .
The motors will drive the " Mini Cooper - sized rover " as well as move robotic arms that will reach out and grab samples from the surface of Mars for analysis by its on - board scientific instruments .
Putting these huge technical challenges aside , there was one nasty shock for Nasa that contributed to the delay .
The agency unwittingly used a " bad batch " of titanium to build more than 1,000 parts on MSL .
Nasa purchased what it believed was military grade titanium from California - based Western Titanium .
" Someone [ at that company ] made a mistake , " says Dr Green .
" They certified that the titanium they were selling us , and that we were using , had a certain capability .
It did n't . "
This has meant painstaking verification of all of the titanium parts - to check they have the structural strength to withstand the launch .
" We 're not quite done with that , " says Dr Green .
" But it does n't look like it will be a show - stopper . "
Back on track
With the budget settling down and the technical problems being gradually ticked off the list , Nasa now has to decide where to land its precious roving laboratory .
The planetary sciences advisory panel has looked at more than 50 possible landing sites and whittled those down to four finalists .
The ultimate aim is to set MSL down safely ( and softly ) , close to an area that looks scientifically interesting .
We 're looking at habitat potential - indicators of life rather than life itself
Doug McCuistion , Nasa
" All four of the finalists are very high science merit and it's unclear which one will emerge as the winner , " says John Grant , a scientist from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC , and a member of the advisory panel .
" The single objective of MSL is habitability , " he says .
" That entails looking at geologic environments that may not only have been habitable but where signals associated with that habitability have been preserved . "
Dr Grant avoids using what he calls the " four letter word " .
MSL , he says , is not a life detection mission .
Doug McCuistion says : " We 're looking at habitat potential - indicators of life rather than life itself . "
Three orbiters currently keeping a close eye on Mars from space , have pointed Nasa to the most scientifically enticing sites .
Where will MSL land ?
Enlarge Image
" We have seen clays on the surface from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) , which is extremely exciting , " says Dr McCuistion .
" That shows us long periods of water . "
MRO 's camera can also identify potential dangers - showing the scientists boulders as small as 1 m across that might damage the valuable rover .
Nasa scientists want to find an area where the geology could have preserved signals of life .
They hope to set down on a flat landscape within reach of rocky minerals , such as sulphates and phyllosilicates , which , at least on Earth , are associated with the preservation of fossils .
The team will make its final landing site recommendation to Nasa early in 2011 .
Gently does it And how do you go about guiding and landing a tonne of scientific equipment on to the surface of a planet more than 55 million kilometres away ?
For this , JPL 's engineers have come up with a new system - the sky crane .
" You can think of it as a rocket - powered helicopter that will hover and then lower MSL to the surface on a harness called a bridle , " says Doug McCuistion .
" It lands on its wheels and as soon as it puts its mast up , it 's ready to go . "
Once this system has safely delivered MSL to Mars ' surface , it will be used for other large rovers and platforms for sample return missions that Nasa plans to embark upon after 2020 .
MSL 's parachute was tested in the world 's largest wind tunnel
But this mission remains the sky crane 's first and only test .
" The only place you can test it end - to - end is on Mars , so it carries a certain risk , " says Dr McCuistion .
" Setting down MSL is definitely the most nerve - wracking part .
It 's hard to hold your breath for six minutes . "
If all goes well , Nasa says the stage will be set for the next big step forward - bringing samples back from Mars .
This is something that Nasa and the European Space Agency ( Esa ) were planning to work on collaboratively .
This mission 's creeping budget , however , brought the two agencies together early to work on an orbiter set for launch in 2016 .
It 's only one rover and it's only going to be looking at one spot on Mars
Adrian Brown , Seti Institute
This has meant a reprieve for the orbiter .
" We had [ made the decision to go ] from a lander , because of MSL 's budget needs , to a small orbiter mission , " explains Dr McCuistion .
" That did dramatically limit the science we could do in 2016 .
But partnership with Esa allowed us to go back to a full - sized orbiter , with full science complement and telecommunications capability .
" It came at a very advantageous time . "
But Dr Brown says this Nasa - Esa mission has only come about because of " the unexpected growth of MSL " and that , without the motivation of another lander project , JPL might struggle to keep its engineers interested .
" It will be an exciting mission to look for methane in the atmosphere , " he says .
" Missing the opportunity to put a rover on the surface in 2016 and 2018 will seriously strain Nasa 's ability to keep rover engineers at JPL on staff and ready for the Mars sample return mission around 2020 . "
Shrinking back Dr Brown warns that Nasa could be putting all of its eggs in one very expensive basket .
" MSL is only one rover , " he says , " and it 's only going to be looking at one spot on Mars .
It has meant that the Mars programme will be shrunk in the latter half of this decade . "
Alan Stern , formerly associate administrator for Nasa 's science mission directorate , has gone much further .
In a 2008 article in the New York Times , he likened Nasa missions ' inflated costs to a " cancer overtaking our space agency " .
He also said that he was admonished by Nasa executives when he attempted to curtail the cost increases associated with science missions , including MSL .
These confrontations eventually led to his resignation in early 2008 .
A scale model of MSL dwarfs the previous two generations of Nasa Mars rover
" The costs of badly run Nasa projects are paid for with cutbacks or delays in Nasa projects that did n't go over budget , " he wrote .
" Hence the guilty are rewarded and the innocent are punished . "
But Dr McCuistion remains bullish about the budget and very positive about the science and engineering value of MSL .
He tells BBC News : " It has not taken money away from anything else .
When we had to move the launch date , I had to pay for that with my 2016 budget .
" MSL is the most capable system ever put on the surface of another planet , " he continues .
" It eclipses the Viking landers in its ability to do chemical analysis on the surface of Mars .
" It 's also guided entry , so we will be able to access areas of the planet we never have before . "
Dr Brown stresses that , should MSL succeed , it will indeed be a " great outcome " .
" It will give us the capability to land all the components of a Mars sample return mission , hopefully around 2020 , " he says .
" But , to keep us on that path , JPL must openly review its overhead , planning and costs procedures , so that Mars sample return can become a reality . "
The Mast Camera ( Mastcam ) will take images and video footage of the terrain Mars Hand Lens Imager ( MAHLI ) will allow MSL to examine samples Mars Descent Imager ( MARDI ) will take colour video during the rover 's descent Alpha Particle X - Ray Spectrometer ( APXS ) will measure chemical elements in rocks and soils by exposing material to alpha particles and X - rays Chemistry & Camera ( ChemCam ) will fire a laser and analyze the composition of the materials it vaporises Chemistry & Mineralogy X - Ray Diffraction / X- Ray Fluorescence Instrument ( CheMin ) will measure the abundances of various minerals Sample Analysis at Mars ( SAM ) instrument suite will search for organic compounds that are associated with life Radiation Assessment Detector ( RAD ) will prepare for future human exploration , measuring high - energy radiation on the planet 's surface Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons ( DAN ) will look for neutrons escaping from the planet 's surface .
If liquid or frozen water happens to be present , hydrogen atoms slow the neutrons down Rover Environmental Monitoring Station ( REMS ) will monitor the weather on Mars

Post - traumatic stress disorder — PTSD — can linger years after someone has experienced or witnessed something extremely upsetting .
It may be accompanied by panic attacks , flashbacks , and nightmares , and it can be fiendishly difficult to treat .
But experimental types of treatment could soon lend a hand .
In a pilot study , South Carolina psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer is targeting PTSD with a controversial drug : methylenedioxymethamphetamine , or MDMA , commonly known as Ecstasy .
He gave MDMA , along with psychotherapy , to 21 participants who had developed treatment - resistant PTSD as a result of experiences with crime or war .
Only 15 percent of the MDMA - treated subjects continued to experience PTSD afterward , as opposed to 85 percent of the subjects who received psychotherapy with a placebo .
Mithoefer considers the findings especially notable given that 20 of the 21 participants had previously failed to obtain relief from FDA - approved treatments .
“ The next step is to find out if this can be replicated elsewhere , ” he says .
The study , sponsored by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies , was the first FDA - approved trial evaluating MDMA ’s therapeutic applications .
Additional clinical tests examining MDMA - based treatments for PTSD are under way in Switzerland and Israel .
Other potential PTSD drugs also show promise .
Researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City report that one or two treatments with a compound called RU38486 can disrupt traumatic memories in rats without affecting normal memories .
And investigators at Tel Aviv University and Ben-Gurion University in Israel find that an injection of the steroid cortisol immediately following a trauma reduces PTSD - like effects in mice .
Both of these therapies are slated for human clinical trials .
Some 12 percent of minors held in government custody are sexually abused , and in some facilities the rate reaches a stunning one in three children , says a report released Thursday by the Bureau of Justice Statistics .
The first - ever National Survey of Youth in Custody found that no less than 10 percent of the 26,550 juveniles being held in detention facilities in the US are abused by staff at the facility , while another 2.6 percent report abuse at the hands of other inmates .
ADVERTISEMENT
Among the facilities studied were six identified to have rates of sexual abuse as high as three in 10 .
According to the Associated Press , those six facilities are Pendleton Juvenile Correctional Facility in Indiana ; Corsicana Residential Treatment Center in Texas ; Backbone Mountain Youth Center in Swanton , Maryland ; Samarkand Youth Development Center in Eagle Springs , North Carolina . ; Cresson Secure Treatment Unit in Pennsylvania ; and the Culpeper Juvenile Correctional Center , Long Term , in Mitchells , Virginia .
“ The widespread sexual abuse of children in juvenile facilities shows that public officials either are n’t paying attention or ca n’t be bothered to do the right thing , ” said Jamie Fellner , senior counsel for Human Rights Watch .
“ The high rates of victimization are powerful testimony to the failure of governments to safeguard the boys and girls in their care . ”
The study was mandated by a 2003 law , the National Prison Rape Elimination Act , which also created the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission .
Human Rights
Watch notes that six months ago the commission set out “ comprehensive , effective standards for the prevention , detection , and punishment of prison rape , ” but the Justice Department has yet to act on those recommendations .
“ Every day Attorney General Eric Holder fails to promulgate national prison rape elimination standards is another day in which kids and adults are being abused behind bars , ” Fellner said .
“ The attorney general already has on his desk proposed standards that reflect the best thinking and effective practices to end this widespread scourge .
There is no need to reinvent the wheel or to delay moving forward . ”
The survey found that gay youth were at higher risk than heterosexual youth , with one in five reporting abuse at the hands of a staffer or fellow inmate .
Males were more likely to report being abused than females ( 10.8 percent to 4.7 percent ) .
And 95 percent of those abused by staff reported that the abuser was female .
But that number may be influenced by the fact that 91 percent of youth in custody are male .
ADVERTISEMENT
The AP reports :
Although advocates said the level of abuse was n’t surprising , the prevalence of sexual abuse by staff , particularly female workers , was shocking , said Linda McFarlane , deputy executive director of Just Detention International , which fights to end sexual abuse of those who are detained .
“ Many of these are already the most vulnerable and traumatized youth from all of our communities and they ’re placed for custody because they ’re considered to be a danger , ” she said .
“ If sexually abused in those very institutions that are supposed to help them prepare for life in the community , then it ’s just an incredible travesty . ”
The Associated Press also notes that sex abuse by staffers was higher in state - run facilities than in privately - run or municipal detention centers , and smaller facilities appear to have lower abuse rates than larger ones .

IMPERIAL BEACH , Calif . 
You go , Abbie girl .
She is as happy in this frothing ocean as a Thoroughbred at the racetrack .
She adheres to the surfboard as if her feet are made of Velcro .
How does an Australian Kelpie , bred to be a hardworking ranch hand , do an about - face and become an aimless surfer dude ?
Easily , says her owner , Michael Uy .
She has many talents , only one of which is herding sheep .
The girl also enjoys mountain biking and rock climbing .
" But surfing is her No. 1 love , " says Uy , 39 , a software program manager in San Diego .
" We surf together almost every day after I get off work . "
Abbie girl is front and center in a dog- surfing craze spreading along California 's beaches .
These coastal canines fuel the real - life action scenes in the film Marmaduke , due in theaters June 4 from 20th Century Fox .
One of the story lines about the popular comic - strip character centers on the Great Dane being pressured to enter a surfing contest after his family moves to Southern California .
Lee Pace , William H. Macy and Judy Greer are human stars in this live - action comedy in which the dogs speak .
Owen Wilson is the voice of Marmaduke , an awkward teen Dane who is a very reluctant surfer up against champions such as Abbie .
Abbie got the nod to be a film extra ( and earn $ 400 ) when the professional animal trainers who work with the Great Dane that plays Marmaduke saw Abbie surf in a contest , Uy says .
Several of the other surfing dogs cavorting in the rough water with Abbie and Uy this particular day also will be extras in the film , which Uy says will show dogs surfing some spectacular waves .
Dog surfing is mostly recreational , but Uy and the dedicated followers bouncing up and down in these San Diego - area waves are taking it to new heights .
Five competitions , up from two the year before , were held in California last year , drawing hundreds of dogs and thousands of spectators .
The number of surf classes for dogs also is growing .
Abbie did n't need classes , Uy says .
" There 's nothing I 've trained her to do .
She is just a natural .
I pick bigger swells and she beaches them . "
She started out surfing on a boogie board in a pool learning how to balance , but that did n't last long .
These days
Uy holds her board until the perfect wave arrives and then releases her .
" She can steer , " he says .
" She knows if it 's a bad wave .
She will back it down and wait for a good one . "
Abbie 's biggest wave so far has been 6 to 8 feet high .
Her longest ride ?
100 yards .
Many of the dogs hop off the board in shallow water , but Abbie has style .
One of her signature moves is called an Aussie tailspin , in which she slightly dips a back hip and spins herself around on the board a couple of times .
The girl is a pro .
She also has sponsors : Oakley sunglasses and INT Softboards , a surfboard company that makes a smaller board for dogs .
She keeps in shape , too .
Uy trains Abbie on a treadmill .
He starts her off on a slow trot and then cranks it up .
He has a primer for dog surfing on her website .
" We 're hooked , " he says .
Abbie and Uy are devoted to each other .
He rescued her in 2007 from the Silicon Valley Humane Society .
" Abbie had a dramatic past as a shelter dog , " says Uy .
" Someone had brought her in after finding her on a roadside near death in Modesto . "
He says Abbie was afraid of everything — people , doors , dark rooms , other dogs , cats , cars — and he spent months rehabbing her , " taking her everywhere and introducing her to the world . "
California dreamin'
Peter and Gabi Noll have a 5 - year - old Bernese Mountain dog , Nani , who is one of Abbie 's surfing buddies and also worked on the set during Marmaduke filming .
Bernese are a big , heavy - coated breed usually happiest when the temperatures drop below freezing .
Not Nani .
" When I put my board shorts on in the morning , she runs to the garage door to get into the car , " Gabi says .
" Once we go , she talks all the way to the beach .
She 's always smiling . "
So is Doug Hukstad and Gigi Bagaporo 's bulldog , Dozer .
When asked if they have to coax their dog into the ocean , they laugh .
" He loves it , " Bagaporo says .
" Because bulldogs are so stubborn , there 's no way I could make him do it if he did n't want to .
He 's got sheer determination to surf .
He protects his board .
No one else can get near it . "
Bagaporo is standing on the beach cheering Dozer on , when suddenly he takes a spill and has to be hauled out of the water by Peter Noll .
The dogs wear harnesses and flotation devices that make them easy to grab .
Dozer shakes off and heads back to the ocean .
" You can't keep him from surfing , " Bagaporo says .
She resumes her stance on the beach and starts cheering .
" We 're like soccer moms , " she says .
" At one of the competitions , some people asked us to calm down because we were cheering so hard .
We laughed at them and kept cheering . "
This group of friends formed the San Diego Dog Surfing Association to help raise money for charities .
Proceeds from the Surf Dogs 2010 Calendar went to charities such as Best Friends and Ronald McDonald House .
The calendar also encourages people to adopt shelter dogs .
The surf competitions include mixed breeds .
Booda , a male Lab mix , won second place in the team category last year at the fourth annual Loews Coronado 2009 Surf Dog Competition .
Today , these friends head off to share a meal at the indoor cafe at Loews Coronado Bay Resort .
The resort is dog- friendly , offering classes for people who want to bring their dogs and learn to surf .
Costs start at $ 349 for deluxe overnight accommodations , including a beef tenderloin and salmon dinner for you - know - who .
Dogs never had it so good .
They can sail here , too .
Abbie girl is stretched out beside
Uy as they sit in a big open area with comfortable chairs and order dinner .
It 's burgers and beers all around .
The dogs ?
Crashed out beside them , even when the burgers arrive .
These are tired dogs .
Catching the wave
Dog surfing is making waves in the canine agility sports world , too .
Agility classes were among the first ways people could get involved in activities with their dogs outside of hunting events .
The sport was born in England , where it provided entertainment between horse jumping events , and it 's recognized by the American Kennel Club .
For the past 12 years , the Purina Incredible Dog Challenge has hooked onto America 's love for agility events by holding national contests and showing the events on ESPN .
It showcases dogs performing in flying - disc events , agility competitions , diving events and head - to - head pole - weaving contests .
This year 's Western regional included dog surfing for the first time .
Surfing 's time is here , Uy says , and make no mistake :
It 's for athletes , just like all the agility events .
But , really , why do these kinds of activities with dogs ?
" If you 're going to bring a dog into your life , he should be part of your life , " says Dina Demeo , who , along with John Grover , has produced the Surf Dogs Calendar for four years .
" Why leave your dog at home ?
He 's part of the family pack .
And dogs love these activities .
Leave them at home and they 're sad .
A happy dog makes for a happy owner . "
She 's dogless now , but she used to take her dog kayaking and windsurfing before he died .
Uy says he hopes that as more people get into the sport with their dogs — taking classes with them , holding their boards , fetching them out of the water — they 'll " realize that trust is the foundation that lets you and your dog take on any challenge and make it fun . "
There is no lack of trust between Uy and Abbie .
She jumps up and stands on his shoulder all the while he 's talking in the shallow water .
At his command , she jumps down , then leaps onto her surfboard , ready to go hunt the next wave .
You go , Abbie girl .

Want to Use New York City ’s Coolest App? Get a Google Phone .
Apple has some 140,000 apps for its iPhone users .
People who use phones with Google ’s ( GOOG ) Android operating system have much less choice .
But here ’s a consolation prize : Android users do get to use the coolest app in New York City .
At least , according to the NYC Big App competition , which awarded its Grand Prize last night to Wayfinder NYC , an Android - only app .
Wayfinder , created by Victor Sima and Steven Lao , uses jaw - dropping space - age “ augmented reality ” technology –which layers map info , tied to GPS data , over the camera view of a user ’s phone–to help people find the nearest subway station .
I ’ve seen a couple variants of these , at least in demo form , and they ’re some of the coolest things I ’ve seen that are n’t in “ Minority Report ” or some other movie .
This one looks pretty cool , too .
There ’s no sound in this demo , so do n’t be alarmed :
I do n’t know what ’s nuttier about the technology that makes an app like this plausible – the fact that we can integrate this stuff into a consumer device or the fact that we do n’t run around shouting about how amazing this stuff is because we already take it for granted .
Anyway , here ’s hoping that New York ’s Metropolitan Transit Authority does n’t put the hammer down on this one .
The MTA has been frustratingly slow to adapt to new technology but alarmingly quick to charge innovators with half - baked claims of copyright violation .
And it would be nice if the WayFinder team ports this thing to Apple ’s ( AAPL ) platform so that New York City ’s hordes of iPhone users can get their hands on it .
Tower cranes arrive at the construction site on 10 to 12 tractor - trailer rigs .
The crew uses a mobile crane to assemble the jib and the machinery section , and places these horizontal members on a 40 - foot ( 12 - m ) mast that consists of two mast sections .
The mobile crane then adds the counterweights .
The mast rises from this firm foundation .
The mast is a large , triangulated lattice structure , typically 10 feet ( 3.2 meters ) square .
The triangulated structure gives the mast the strength to remain upright .

" "
" "
To rise to its maximum height , the crane grows itself one mast section at a time !
The crew uses a top climber or climbing frame that fits between the slewing unit and the top of the mast .
Here 's the process :
The crew hangs a weight on the jib to balance the counterweight .
The crew detaches the slewing unit from the top of the mast .
Large hydraulic rams in the top climber push the slewing unit up 20 feet ( 6 m ) .
The crane operator uses the crane to lift another 20 - foot mast section into the gap opened by the climbing frame .
Once bolted in place , the crane is 20 feet taller !
" "

Once the building is finished and it is time for the crane to come down , the process is reversed -- the crane disassembles its own mast and then smaller cranes disassemble the rest .
Una oportunidad
Las buenas intenciones no siempre son bien vistas .
Al menos eso podría pasar con un acuerdo que acaban de llevar a cabo una petrolera y la Universidad en la que estudió el primer mandatario del país .
Se trata del convenio entre Pemex , de José Antonio González Anaya , y la Universidad Panamericana , que dirige José Antonio Lozano .
Ambas instituciones firmaron un convenio de colaboración para que los estudiantes de esa institución realicen prácticas jurídicas profesionales en distintas áreas de la empresa .
La que alguna vez fue la empresa más importante de México dio a conocer que la reforma energética abre una gran oportunidad para los estudiantes de Derecho interesados en la materia , por lo que con este convenio , Pemex abre sus puertas para forjar a temprana edad a los futuros abogados mediante la realización de prácticas profesionales .
La Universidad Panamericana se fundó en 1967 , cuenta con tres campus y una sede que atienden a cerca de 12,000 alumnos en 33 carreras .
Todo bien , pero , ¿y los estudiantes de Derecho de otras universidades tendrán cabida para ser forjados al interior de la alicaída petrolera mexicana ?

Según la Asociación Mexicana en Dirección de Recursos Humanos , que comanda Ismael Sánchez Moreno , y OCCMundial , que comanda Ricardo Rodarte Uribe , los sectores de tecnologías de la información , aeronáutica , aeroespacial y automotriz son los que más están creciendo en el país y los que demandan mano de obra altamente calificada .
Durante la firma del convenio de colaboración entre ambas instituciones , se afirmó que la generación de empleo en el país se ha mantenido dinámica y en el primer semestre del año registra un crecimiento de dos dígitos y se espera que esta tendencia se mantenga durante el segundo semestre del presente año .
Los especialistas señalaron que la mayor parte de las empresas están dispuestas a seguir creciendo y con ello generar más empleo en el país y no congelar plazas , por lo que se siguen viviendo los efectos de la llamada guerra por el talento en la que las empresas buscan a los mejores jugadores disponibles .
¡ Todo sea por más y mejores empleos !
Suspensión ... hasta nuevo aviso
Con la novedad de que la Bolsa Mexicana de Valores , de José Oriol Bosch , decidió suspender los títulos de una empresa del Sistema Internacional de Cotizaciones .
Resulta que la BMV decidió suspender los títulos representativos del capital de la emisora extranjera Baker Hughes Incorporated luego de que se tuvo conocimiento de que en el mercado de valores norteamericano The New York Stock Exchange se deslistaron dichos títulos derivado de la fusión con General Electric Companys Oil and Gas Business .
En virtud de lo anterior , la BMV aseguró que en ejercicio de sus faculta determinó suspender la cotización en la Sección SIC Capitales del Sistema Internacional de Cotizaciones .
La Bolsa informó que decidió suspender dichos títulos con la finalidad de evitar que se produzcan condiciones desordenadas .

The payload from New Zealand 's first home - grown space rocket is floating somewhere off the Coromandel coast following this afternoon 's successful launch .
Rocket Lab's 6 - metre-long , 60kg rocket Atea - 1 was launched about 2.30 pm from Great Mercury Island , watched by about 50 people .
It burned for 20 seconds or so , reaching its target speed of up to Mach 5 , or 5000 kmh , reaching at least 100 km altitude and spending between 10 and 20 minutes in the sky before splashing down .
It is the first time a privately - owned rocket has been launched in the southern hemisphere .
Atea is the Maori word for space as the team wanted an indigenous name for the rocket .
Today 's rocket was named Manu Karere by the local Thames iwi , which means Bird Messenger .
The target area for the launch was about 50 km northeast of the island .
The team hope to pick the rocket 's payload up within the next two days and physically recover its data .
Rocket Lab was now waiting for the payload 's GPS signal to be picked up , company director Mark Rocket told NZPA .
That could depend on the waves or how buoyant the payload finally was when it splashed down , he said .
The team would not know how high the rocket reached , but with a new nose cone Mr Rocket speculated it could have reached as high as 150km .
That height was suborbital , but it was still considered to be space as there was no atmosphere .
The International Space Station was about 300 km above Earth , Mr Rocket said .
Mr Rocket , who changed his name from Mark Stevens about seven years ago , said the crew was " very , very pleased " with the launch , which was originally scheduled for about 7 am today .
However , an aerocoupler , which connects the fuel line to the rocket , froze , effectively sticking the rocket to its launch pad .
A helicopter was dispatched from the launch site to Whitianga to pick up another hydraulic coupling - worth about $ 6 - from an engineering supplier .
" We nearly scrubbed the launch three times , " Mr Rocket said .
The fuel had to be dumped and the rocket refilled .
" Peter Beck ( Rocket Lab 's chief executive and technical director ) is a brilliant scientist and he managed to think quickly on his feet . "
Mr Rocket said the feeling after the launch was " profound " and one of " pure elation , incredible " .
" A lot of people were crying .
It was really dramatic .
The power of the rocket is just incredible . "
Mr Rocket said the cost of the project so far was commercially sensitive .
Rocket Labs , which was set up three years ago , did not have any government investment .
While it did not have the budget of NASA " needless to say it 's a considerable investment " , he said .
" The last six months have been a terrific amount of work .
The tech team has put in a massive effort .
" It 's not trivial sending something into space .
This is a huge technological leap for New Zealand . "
The next step after recovering the payload would be planning for the next launch , he said .
Rocket Lab was a space launch business and there was massive interest in the company 's products from around the world , he said .
While the Atea - 1 is New Zealand 's first home - grown and privately - funded space rocket it is not the first to be launched from these shores .
In 1963 an imported rocket was launched to a height of about 75 km to conduct upper atmospheric research in a joint venture between Canterbury University 's physics department and the Royal New Zealand Air Force .
It was launched from Birdlings Flat , 44 km southeast of Christchurch , spent about 2 1/2 minutes airborne and landed in the sea .
PETER DRURY / Waikato Times FIZZER : Fuel is dumped from the rocket after the first launch attempt from Great Mercury Island was aborted .
Labour will today launch a hard - hitting campaign against David Cameron 's proposal to repeal the ban on hunting with dogs .
The move will be seen as an extension of its " class war " against the Conservatives .
Ministers will point to Mr Cameron 's record of supporting fox - hunting and condemn his proposal to give MPs the chance to overturn the Hunting Act if he becomes Prime Minister .
Writing in The Independent today , the Environment Secretary Hilary Benn says : " Quite why this is something that would be a priority for a Tory government , instead of the economy or tackling other concerns , is hard to explain to the public and [ the Conservatives ] have failed to do so . "
Last night , Mr Benn explained : " David Cameron used to hunt foxes .
He talked about fox - hunting in his first speech to Parliament , and he has said that if he becomes Prime Minister he will get rid of the fox - hunting ban .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" But like the vast majority of people , I think the barbaric act of letting dogs tear foxes to pieces should not return to our countryside .
If you think the Tories have changed , their views on fox - hunting with dogs make it absolutely clear that their priorities have n't . "
Supporters of hunting will be out in force today – traditionally a big day in the hunting calendar – to press for the repeal of the Act .
But Labour 's decision to launch the " back the ban " campaign makes clear that the party will make hunting an issue at next year 's general election .
Although Mr Benn insists hunting is not a " class issue " , the move follows Gordon Brown 's attack on Mr Cameron 's plans to cut inheritance tax , which he said were " dreamed up on the playing fields of Eton " .
One senior Labour source said : " We are not saying hunting will be the centrepiece of our election campaign .
But it is an issue that concerns many people and it says something about the Conservatives .
They say 'we are all in it together ' but their policies , whether on inheritance tax or hunting , show that under a Cameron government there would be one rule for their friends and another for the rest of us . "
When Labour 's focus groups remind voters of the Tories ' stance on hunting , many people are said to reply : " I guess they have n't changed . "
People are surprised that Mr Cameron wants to overturn the ban , and Labour believes the policy undermines his claim to have modernised the Conservative Party .
However , some Blairites are wary of Labour 's " class war " attacks , which they fear will undermine the party 's support among the aspirational middle classes and give the impression that Labour is appealing to its " core vote " in the hope of denying Mr Cameron an overall majority .
A " Tory toffs " campaign in last year 's Crewe and Nantwich by - election backfired on Labour , but Brown allies insist that the new drive is legitimate because it is linked to Tory policies , not personalities .
The " back the ban " campaign will be endorsed today by the television presenter Tony Robinson and actors Patrick Stewart and Jenny Seagrove .
Its survey of parliamentary candidates found that 84 per cent of Tories who responded did not support prohibition of hunting with dogs , but 98 per cent of Labour candidates did .

The emotive campaign will challenge Tory parliamentary candidates to make public their positions on hunting .
Labour activists and hunting opponents will be told : " Find out what your MP and candidates think about allowing foxes to be ripped apart by the teeth of hounds . "
Amid signs that the Tories are playing down the issue , their candidates are said to have been advised not to state their view on hunting but to promise to consult their constituents before deciding how to vote .
The Tory manifesto will promise a free vote on a government rather than a private member 's Bill , a move which guarantees parliamentary time and would make it harder for opponents to block .
If the Tories win an overall majority , the Commons is expected to overturn the ban .
The 2004 Act made the hunting of all wild mammals using dogs an offence and banned hare coursing , but did not stop people from riding with their dogs if they remain within the law .
The Tories insist the Act is ineffective and unworkable .
They say there have been few successful prosecutions and that such a bad law should be repealed .
In February Mr Cameron said : " My personal view has always been the ban does n't work , it does n't make sense .
It 's an area of life that I do n't think the law ought to go into .
It does n't seem to have worked in any way . "
* The Charity Commission has banned a " keep cruelty history " newspaper advertisement planned by the League Against Cruel Sports , which opposes the repeal of the Act .
According to Whitehall sources , the commission ruled that the advertisement – which highlighted the words " cruel Tory " in blue type – would have breached charity rules that ban party political campaigns .
Hunting ban
What impact has it had ?
* Despite the ban , more than 300 hunts are expected to meet today , on the biggest day in the hunters ' calendar .
* The law permits them to chase their quarry across country , provided the hunt does not end with a fox being torn to pieces by hounds .
Any form of hunting with dogs , including hare - coursing and deer stalking , was banned under the 2004 Hunting Act .
The Conservatives have promised that if they will next year 's general election , they will give MPs a free vote on whether to repeal the Act .
* The RSPCA has released figures which , it says , show that the Hunting Act has proved to be an effective piece of legislation .
There have been more prosecutions under the Act than under similar legislation on animal welfare , and more than three - quarters of the prosecutions have been successful .
Last week , the European Court of Human Rights rejected a claim that the Act was a breach of human rights .
* But research carried out by the Countryside Alliance shows that 57 per cent of the public believe that the Act is a failure , and nearly half think that a new government should either repeal it or give Parliament a free vote on whether to keep it .

It is high time that we ceased indulging in theatrics and spoke the truth .
We all desperately yearn for peace , and the vast majority of us do not wish to rule over Arabs .
If we could convince ourselves that our neighbors would commit to peaceful coexistence , we would make major sacrifices .
But alas , the prospects for a comprehensive settlement in the near future are virtually zero .
Since the Oslo Accords , we have remained in a state of denial , refusing to reconcile with the reality that the duplicitous vleaders , then Yasser Arafat and today Mahmoud Abbas , rather than seeking to create an independent state , were utilizing terror and diplomacy to dismember the Jewish state in stages .
We ignored the relevance of Arafat 's repeated call to his people to heed the passage in the Koran relating to the prophet Muhammad consummating the Al Hudaibiya Treaty with the Koreishi Jews and subsequently reneging and killing them .
The message clearly signaled that agreements with Jews and non-Muslims may be violated .
Our passion to achieve peace blinded successive governments into accepting the false premise that Palestinian leaders were peace partners , and repeatedly chant the idiotic mantra that the peace process was irreversible and that " peace in our time " was achievable .
This cost the lives of thousands in terror attacks and generated successive wars .
In conveying this charade to the world at large , we encouraged the false belief that our conflict with the Arabs was a struggle between two peoples to divide land .
We maintained this nonsense even after Arafat and Abbas rebuffed Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert , who had offered them virtually all the territory previously occupied by Jordan and Egypt .
The Palestinians polarized this further by insisting that the so - called Arab refugee right of return ( a formula for the demise of the Jewish state ) was a nonnegotiable component of any peace settlement .
The Saudi peace plan , praised by the Americans and some foolish Israelis , incorporated this component .
President Barack Obama was informed by the Saudis that until the Israelis accepted the plan in its entirety , he should not bother raising the issue with them .
TODAY , WE face the most intense international pressures we have ever experienced .
Many European countries have forsaken us ; the Obama administration has distanced itself and absorbed the false Palestinian narrative that the Holocaust was responsible for the creation of the State of Israel .
Obama has now been in office for 12 months and his negative approach and attempts to appease our enemies have backfired .
There is a complete stalemate in relation to Iran .
Israelis do not trust him .
The intransigency of the Palestinians and their unwillingness to make any concessions has led to a breakdown in negotiations for which we are being blamed .
Despite the sweeping concessions offered by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his predecessors and the refusal of the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table , Obama alleged that Israel " still found it hard to make bold gestures " and offensively bracketed Hamas and Likud right - wingers as the principal obstacles to peace .
In fact , the Americans seem to have adopted the Palestinian approach hook , line and sinker .
Having abandoned the principal of defensible borders and called on Israel to return to ' 67 lines and divide Jerusalem , they are urging that the delineation of future boundaries be dealt with first as a stand - alone issue .
But they have yet to reject the Arab right of return .
Under the circumstances , we should be grateful to Abbas for refusing to negotiate .
If the Palestinians demand further concessions without reciprocity , it would simply lead to additional confrontations and intensified global pressures .
The most frustrating aspect is that there is little doubt that such negotiations are perceived by all Palestinians - the PA no less than Hamas - merely as phases in their ultimate objective of eliminating Jewish sovereignty in the region .
Any differences between them are primarily tactical .
At least Hamas openly proclaims its objectives .
Its charter is viciously anti-Semitic and urges its followers to kill as many Jews as possible and wipe Israel off the map .
It is time to speak plainly and expose the fact that our " peace partner , " the " moderate " PA , maintains a criminal culture of death and sanctifies the mass murderers within its midst .
Despite repeated exhortations to end anti-Semitic incitement , little has changed .
The PA controlled TV , the media and the mosques continue pouring out hatred against the Jews .
And from kindergarten onwards the PA educational system idolizes the shahid ( the glorious martyr ) or suicide bomber as role models .
While uttering endearing words about peaceful coexistence to the foreign media , Abbas proudly provides state pensions to families of suicide bombers .
In recent weeks , a major public square in Ramallah was named to commemorate the 50th birthday of Dalal Mugrabi , the female terrorist who murdered 37 civilians , including 10 children , on a bus in 1978 .
The allegedly " moderate " Prime Minister Salam Fayyad participated in the ceremony referring to Mugrabi as a " martyr .
"
The same " moderate " Fayyad personally paid a condolence call to the family of those who murdered Rabbi Meir Avshalom Chai , father of seven , last month .
In public addresses , Abbas referred to these murderers , members of his own Fatah , as " martyrs executed cold - bloodedly by Israeli forces . "
Yet the White House continues praising the moderation and leadership qualities of both Abbas and Fayyad .
The PA has yet to curb terrorist affiliates like the Aksa Martyrs Brigades and other armed Fatah militias which continue to engage in acts of terror .
Yet we remain indifferent to the US - trained Palestinian security forces that are supplied with Israeli weapons which , as in the past , will probably ultimately be employed against us .
SO WHERE do we go from here ?
We must stop behaving like performers in an Alice in Wonderland pantomime .
Netanyahu should cease pleading for negotiations with an Abbas who is unwilling ( or powerless ) to make any reciprocal concessions .
He is aware that the PA in all likelihood will ultimately either merge with or be taken over by Hamas .
We must now proclaim explicitly that meaningful progress cannot beachieved in the absence of a genuine peace partner , and that we can nolonger continue making unilateral concessions which only strengthen Palestinian intransigence .
We should continue raising the livingstandards of the Palestinians and encourage the creation of a middleclass in the hope that this will one day encourage them to pressuretheir leaders into choosing peace over war .
It is also importantthat our government tell people the truth .
That will strengthen ourposition in the war of ideas and garner stronger support in the US .
Itmay also encourage the Obama administration to desist from pressuringus to continue making unilateral concessions and ease our growingconcern that , like Czechoslovakia in the 1930s , we are being offered asa sacrifice on the altar of appeasement .
Inexplicably promoted yesterday by waning tech site Slashdot , " Whatever happened to Second Life ? " is a fairly wrong - headed PC Pro article by Barry Collins , but at least it 's misguided in interesting ways .
Collins ' main complaint is that the world seems empty now :
On my first visit back in 2006 , I could n’t walk through the training level without clumsily bumping into the throng of fellow newbies .
Now , there ’s enough room to swing the contents of Noah ’s ark , let alone a cat .
I walk and then fly around the landscape for ten minutes or so , but ca n’t find a single soul to shoot the breeze with .
The inference of course is factually wrong -- Second Life has nearly four times as many active users as it did in 2006 ( then 200 K , now 750K ) -- and what 's worse , Collins mistakes the hype wave 's crush of hapless noobs for meaningful users .
What 's worse still , not once in Collins ' article does he mention two key words that would degrade his thesis : " Map " ( as in Second Life 's dynamic map ) , or " concurrency " ( as in the number of users simultaneously logged in at any given period . )
Had Collins bothered to check the map on his viewer , he'd see a constellation of in - world users -- evidence of massive concurrency , currently about 75,000 at peak , and in the 55,000 range at median .
( I believe this is still the largest concurrency of any single - sharded virtual world or MMO . )
But as I mentioned , Collins is wrong in an interesting way , for truth be told , as he says , Second Life often feels experientially empty .
Call it the Crowded Empty paradox :
Due to its very nature as an open - ended , user - created virtual world , Second Life will always tend to seem empty -- no mater how populated it actually is .
Why ?
Several reasons :
Scientists at the University of Oxford have developed a revolutionary way of capturing a high - resolution still image alongside very high - speed video -- a new technology that is attractive for science , industry and consumer sectors alike .
By combining off - the - shelf technologies found in standard cameras and digital movie projectors they have successfully created a tool that will transform many forms of detailed scientific imaging and could provide access to high - speed video with high - resolution still images from the same camera at a price suitable for the consumer market .
This could have everyday applications for everything from CCTV to sports photography and is already attracting interest from the scientific imaging sector where the ability to capture very high quality still images that correspond exactly to very high speed video is extremely desirable and currently very expensive to achieve .
The technology has been patented by Isis Innovation , the University of Oxford 's technology transfer office , which provided seed funding for this development and welcomes contact from industry partners to take the technology to market .
The research is published February 14 , 2010 in Nature Methods .
Dr Peter Kohl and his team study the human heart using sophisticated imaging and computer technologies .
They have previously created an animated model of the heart , which allows one to view the heart from all angles and look at all layers of the organ , from the largest structures right down to the cellular level .
They do this by combining many different types of information about heart structure and function using powerful computers and advanced optical imaging tools .
This requires a combination of speed and detail , which has been difficult to achieve using current photographic techniques .
Dr Kohl said : " Anyone who has ever tried to take photographs or video of a high - speed scene , like football or motor racing , even with a fairly decent digital SLR , will know that it 's very difficult to get a sharp image because the movement causes blurring .
We have the same problem in science , where we may miss really vital information like very rapid changes in intensity of light from fluorescent molecules that tell us about what is happening inside a cell .
Having a massive 10 or 12 megapixel sensor , as many cameras now do , does absolutely nothing to improve this situation .
" Dr Gil Bub from my team then came up with a really great idea to bring together high - resolution still images and high - speed video footage , at the same time and on the same camera chip -- ' the real motion picture ' !
The sort of cameras researchers would normally need to get similar high - speed footage can set you back tens of thousands of pounds , but Dr Bub 's invention does so at a fraction of this cost .
This will be a great tool for us and the rest of the research community and could also be used in a number of other ways that are useful to industry and consumers . "
" What 's new about this is that the picture and video are captured at the same time on the same sensor " said Dr Bub .
" This is done by allowing the camera 's pixels to act as if they were part of tens , or even hundreds of individual cameras taking pictures in rapid succession during a single normal exposure .
The trick is that the pattern of pixel exposures keeps the high resolution content of the overall image , which can then be used as - is , to form a regular high - res picture , or be decoded into a high - speed movie . "
The technique works by dividing all the camera 's pixels into groups that are then allowed to take their part of the bigger picture in well - controlled succession , very quickly , and during the time required to take a single ' normal ' snapshot .
So for example , if you use 16 pixel patterns and sequentially expose each of them for one sixteenth of the time the main camera shutter remains open , there would be 16 time points at which evenly distributed parts of the image will be captured by the different pixel groups .
You then have two choices : either you view all 16 groups together as your usual high - resolution still image , or you play the sixteen sub-images one after the other , to generate a high - speed movie .
This concept has attracted the attention of Cairn Research , a UK based scientific instrument manufacturer .
" High speed imaging of biologically important processes is critical for many of our customers at Cairn Research , " said Dr Martyn Reynolds , " Frequently there is a requirement to record events in living cells that are over in a fraction of a second , and this pushes us to the limits of existing technology .
For several years we have been developing a product line for fast imaging of optical slices though cells , and we are very interested in using the processes and technology developed by the group in Oxford to extend the capabilities of our devices and the scientific benefits this could bring . "
The research may soon move from the optical bench to a consumer - friendly package .
Dr. Mark Pitter from the University of Nottingham is planning to compress the technology into an all - in - one sensor that could be put inside normal cameras .
Dr Pitter said : " The use of a custom - built solid state sensor will allow us to design compact and simple cameras , microscopes and other optical devices that further reduce the cost and effort needed for this exciting technique .
This will make it useful for a far wider range of applications , such as consumer cameras , security systems , or manufacturing control . "
This research was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the British Heart Foundation .

Even Janet Napolitano , Secretary of the Deception of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , occasionally dispenses some truth .
“ I am grateful to the passengers and crew aboard Northwest Flight 253 , " she confessed Saturday , after a Nigerian tried to emasculate himself as the plane approached Detroit — a rather extreme reaction , granted , but then Detroit seems to bring out the kooks .
This is the place whose residents celebrate Halloween by torching their neighborhoods , after all .
And you can bet the Napster 's grateful .
Those folks saved this silly charlatan 's neck , even if not their own .
Though Leviathan hyperventilates about " a Christmas Day massacre with almost 300 people murdered , " as Rep. Peter King ( R - NY ) babbled , it 's doubtful anyone other than the Nigerian was in danger : blowing off parts of one 's body is n't likely to bring down a plane .
Whether the wannabee terrorist attacks his manhood , as did Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , or his feet la Richard Reid , the carnage these idiots inflict wo n't extend much beyond themselves .
Given the appendage at risk , Abdulmutallab looks to be even less of a trendsetter than Reid — and only the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) considers Reid trendy .
Thanks to his lame - brained stunt in December 2001 , the TSA has de-shoed travellers at its airport checkpoints since — all 2 million daily passengers , 730 million annually , for seven years now .
Ergo , this absurd agency has searched a grand total of 5,110,000,000 pairs of footgear without ever obtaining a single warrant .
Those billions might lead us to conclude that shoe - bombs are not only devastatingly lethal but a terrorist 's favorite tactic .
Yet Reid was just the third shoe - bomber in aviation 's history , and the least successful , too .
Why is it that you 've never heard of the other two ?
Because their bombs killed only one man between them .
Air Safety
Week reports that in the mid-1980's , a terrorist flying from Karachi , Pakistan to Amman , Jordan checked a suitcase containing a shoe with explosives in the heel .
They detonated during a stopover in Dubai , Saudi Arabia , but did little damage .
And in 1995 , Ramzi Yousef of First - World - Trade - Center - Bombing notoriety hid a bomb 's components in his shoe .
He assembled the device aboard his flight on Philippine Airlines , then stuffed it under a seat .
Tragically , it slaughtered the Japanese business man who sat there on the next flight , but the crew safely landed the plane .
So if you want to wreak widespread death and destruction , sign up with the US government rather than Al Qaeda 's shoe - bombing division .
Groin - grenades are apparently even less lethal , judging from Abdulmutallab , not to mention their built - in deterrent for faithful fanatics : what fun can a guy have with all those virgins in Paradise if he 's burnt a certain area to a crisp ?
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
Groin - grenades may be ineffective WMD's , but they 're as good as shoe - bombs at growing government 's power .
If a lone wacko with a bit of explosive in his sneaker excuses the TSA 's foot - fetish , imagine the hay Leviathan can make from one with a bomb in his crotch : " I think we have to head in that direction [ of virtual strip - searches with millimeter - wave scanning ] , ” the histrionic Pete King intoned .
“ Yes , there is some brief violation of privacy with a full body scan .
But on the other hand , if we can save thousands of lives , to me , we have to make that decision . ”
And all because the TSA once again failed .
Remember that this agency hit headlines a mere fortnight ago for leaking its top - secret security manual on the internet ; now , a possible reader slipped past checkpoints with PETN on him .
You might think the TSA would slink away in defeat and shame ; instead , it came out swinging — at passengers .
They paid the price with onerous new restrictions for its bungling , as they always do when an incident like Flight 253 proves the TSA 's utter irrelevance .
Perhaps it hopes that harassing and humiliating us more than usual will distract us from its culpability .
The rules are so ridiculous the Mad Hatter must have dreamed them up .
" Passengers [ on international flights arriving in the US ] must remain in seats beginning 1 hour prior to arrival at destination … Passengers may not have any blankets , pillows , or personal belongings on the lap beginning 1 hour prior to arrival at destination . "
Victims also suffer a " thorough " groping at the " boarding gate prior to boarding , concentrating on upper legs and torso " — unless they are " Heads of State or Heads of Government . "
Yep , murderous criminals who start wars and steal our money are " exempt from the measures . "
The TSA has n't yet prohibited passengers from becoming sick at 30,000 feet , but if you do , kindly conduct your business in the plane 's loo quickly : " an air marshal , his badge visible " arrested one man on Sunday 's Flight 253 who objected to emerging " while still unwell . "
Meanwhile , the Napster was on a truth - telling jag .
She also astoundingly admitted that " … the system worked .
… The passengers and crew of the flight took appropriate action . "
Janet is n't the first of Our Rulers to divulge this damaging info .
In 2007 , the Government Accountability Office reported that the TSA " considers … able - bodied passengers to be an important layer of aviation security " because they will " engage in self - defense actions should an incident occur onboard commercial aircraft . "
That 's right : taxpayers deprived of all weapons and defenses but fingernails , whom the TSA suspects for terrorists and abuses accordingly , not only comprise one of its often - hyped " layers of security " but an " important " one !
Is this complete , jaw - dropping insanity or what ?
And why are we paying $ 7 billion a year for these thugs to molest and insult us when , in the end , they count on us to defeat terrorists ?
Finally , exactly how does the TSA expect us to " engage in self - defense actions " after stealing our knitting needles and pocket - knives ?
Heck , once a screener finishes robbing us , we can't even squirt Listerine at a terrorist 's eyes .
Should n't these wingdings hand out Saturday Night Specials at the gate instead ?
Alas , Janet 's truthfulness did n't include the No - Fly List .
Abdulmutallab was n't on it despite the Feds ' catching wind of him after his father , a retired chairman of Nigeria 's First Bank , helpfully reported " his son 's u2018 extreme religious views '… to the US embassy and Nigerian security agencies six months ago . "
That was enough for Leviathan to have " created a record on … Abdulmutallab last month in the intelligence community ’s central repository of information for known and suspected international terrorists , but … not enough … to place him on a no - fly list , a US official said . "
What the US official did n't say was that the Feds often and purposely exclude terrorists from such lists .
Joe Trento is an investigative journalist and the author of Unsafe at Any Altitude : Failed Terrorism Investigations , Scapegoating 9/11 , and the Shocking Truth about Aviation Security Today .
He reports , " At the Central Intelligence Agency and Defense Intelligence Agency certain names and aliases are kept from the airlines and off the no-fly list to protect intelligence assets who are suspected or known terrorists . "
Why ?
Because , as Mr. Trento explains in his book , " … American intelligence and counterterrorism officials … deliberately [ allow ] suspected terrorist to fly among innocent passengers in the hope that a terrorist would lead them to collaborators or even a terrorist cell . "
The government that nicks your Neutrogena lest you blow up your flight merely winks at Terry Q. Terrorist 's boarding .
At least Attorney General Eric Holder 's on our side .
" We will continue to investigate this matter vigorously , " he thundered , " and we will use all measures available to our government to ensure that anyone responsible for this attempted attack is brought to justice . ”
Yee - haw !
Looks like he 's abolishing the TSA !

In this top - down illustration of a black hole and its surrounding disk , gas spiraling toward the black hole piles up just outside it , creating a traffic jam .
The traffic jam is closer in for smaller black holes , so X - rays are emitted on a shorter timescale .
Think black holes are strange ?
Understandable considering these powerhouses of the universe ( many times heavier than our sun ) are collapsed stars with gravity so strong that even light cannot escape their grasp .
But maybe they 're not " strange " enough , suggest some astrophysicists .
" Stellar " black holes , ones only a few times heavier than the sun , may actually be something even weirder called a quark star , or " strange " star .
A physics team led by Zoltan Kovacs of the University of Hong Kong sizes up the issue in the current Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
Quark stars , or strange stars , are only theoretical right now , but " the observational identification of quarks stars would represent a major scientific achievement , " Kovacs says .
If quark stars exist , it could prove a theory that normal matter — the stuff of people , planets and stars — is n't stable and could help explain the existence of dark matter filling much of the universe .
First suggested in 1970 , a strange star is a collapsed star that does n't quite crumple enough to turn into a full - fledged black hole and yet is too heavy to become a so - called neutron star ( at least 1.4 times heavier than the sun . )
Neutron stars really exist as astronomer Jocelyn Bell showed with the discovery of a pulsar , a spinning neutron star that streams particles from its poles .
In a quark star , gravity would be so strong that it squeezes the sub-atomic particles called quarks right out of the protons and neutron building blocks of the original star 's atoms .
That would leave behind a solid mass of quark stuff called strange matter , hence the name , strange star .
Earlier in the decade , astronomers suggested a neutron star called RX J1856 , about 400 light years away ( one light year is about 5.9 trillion miles ) was about 1/ 3 too small , and might be a quark star .
But a 2004 Nuclear Physics B journal report showed the star 's intense magnetic field explained its size , so it really was a neutron star .
So , if size alone wo n't reveal a quark star , what will ?
In the new study , Kovacs and his colleagues , Cheng Kwong - sang and Tiberiu Harko , analyze the disks of dust and gas circling supposed - black holes .
Whipped to high speeds by the intense gravity of a black hole , these disks are thought to heat to high temperatures and emit powerful radiation .
For a quark star , the radiation would be about 10 % less than predicted around a black hole , they find .
And a quark star would give off a dim light ( called " bremsstrahlung emission " ) , unlike a black hole , emitted by a thin layer of electrons on its surface .
Do n't expect to see bremsstrahlung emissions any time soon , Kovacs says , as observations will take years to make , because the best targets are so distant .
" If we just found one object that was made of strange matter and was stable , that would be an amazing result , " says astrophysicist Mark Alford of Washington University in St. Louis .
The find would confirm a " strange matter hypothesis " suggesting that normal matter will decay into strange matter if it comes into contact with some of the stuff .
" It would be a great surprise to most physicists , and most people I think , to discover that matter as we know it is not stable , and it all really ' wants ' to turn in to strange matter , " Alford adds .
So , in theory , like " Ice - 9 " in Kurt Vonnegut 's novel , Cat 's Cradle , strange matter could eat up the universe .
However , Manjari Bagchi of India 's Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Pune , thinks studying pulsar pairs will reveal whether quark stars exist sooner , based purely on their orbits , not on the brightness or dimness of the stars .
Or finding a neutron star that weighs less than the sun would mean that it has to be a quark star , she says , because neutron stars would n't have enough gravity to hold their neutrons together at that size .
If " strange matter " exists , though , Alford suggests it might be the culprit for the " dark matter " observed only by its gravitational effects .
Although dark matter can't be seen ( it 's literally dark to telescopes ) , it outweighs normal matter by about six times , judged by its gravitational effects throughout the universe .
Some dark matter might just be " strangelets " roaming the cosmos , blasted free from quark stars .

Police have arrested the gunman they believe is responsible for a mass shooting at an Orlando high - rise on Friday morning .
Jason Rodriguez , 40 , is in custody and currently being transported to an Orlando jail after gun shots rang out at the building , killing at least one person and injuring at least five others .
Police said the man 's mother may have turned him in .
He was arrested at her house .
" This is a tragedy no doubt about it , especially on the heels of the tragedy in Fort Hood that is on our minds , " Orlando Police Chief Val Demings said .
" I 'm just glad we do n't have any more fatalities or any more injuries than we currently have . "
Police said they do n't know a motive yet , but Rodriguez told reporters as he was led away in handcuffs that he was trying to get back at the company .
" Why did you do it ? " one television reporter asked .
" Because they left me to rot , " Rodriguez said .
Orlando Fire Department dispatchers reported a shooting with multiple victims on the eighth floor of the Gateway Center at 1000 Legion Place around 11 a.m.
Rodriguez opened fire with a single handgun , sending people running and screaming and barricading themselves in a safe location .
The Orlando Sentinel is reporting at least one person is confirmed dead and five others were transported to the hospital as authorities still sifted through the carnage .
Rodriguez is a former employee at Reynolds , Smith & Hill , a transportation engineering consulting firm .
Officials for the company confirmed that the shooting started in their offices , but said they did not know who the person was .
He had n't worked with the company for over a year , reports WESH .
Police said all the shooting victims were contained to the one company .
Police went floor - by - floor of the 16 - story building searching for the suspect and other shooting victims .
" The building is not secure now , " Deputy Chief Mike Droege of the Orlando Fire Department said .
" It 's still unfolding . "
Dozens of police cars and fire engines at at least six ambulances responded to the building shortly before noon amid reports of shots being fired .
Still , Rodriguez slipped through the police web before being caught a few hours later .
Mark Vella , who works in a different office on the 12th floor , said he and five co-workers also pulled a filing cabinet in front of their door .
They prayed and talked about what to do if the gunman showed up .
" It was a little scary , a little unnerving , " Vella said .
" We were afraid the guy was still in the building and making the rounds . "

Kamui Kobayashi says he will maintain his aggressive style in his first full season of Formula 1 with the Sauber team .
The Japanese driver impressed with his racing ability when he made his debut with Toyota in place of the injured Timo Glock at the end of 2009 .
He was involved in tough wheel to wheel dices with world champion in both Brazil and Abu Dhabi , successfully overtaking the Brawn driver in the latter event .
At the time he had only a limited opportunity to impress as his 2010 plans were not secure , but Kobayashi pledged to remain a hard charger now that he was established as a full - time F1 driver .
" I do n't think it is something special for me , it 's just my style , " he said at the launch of the Sauber C29 today .
" I will keep like this , of course without crashing .
It is my style and I wo n't change . "
He is confident he will be in better shape in 2010 as he has been able to prepare for F1 from the start of winter testing rather than being called up at the last minute .
" We come in to this season having enough time to prepare for it , " Kobayashi said .
" The last two races [ last year ] I had no testing , so it was really difficult , but now I have so many tests and we can work with the car from the beginning of the season . "
He also revealed that he had been discussing a deal with Renault before signing for Sauber .
" I do n't know everything because I am not the manager , but at the last moment we were thinking it was between Renault and here , " he said .
" And this was the last opportunity , and finally we decided here .
But I do n't whether the other one was serious or not , there was some contact of course with more teams . "
Kobayashi was unwilling to make predictions for his 2010 season with testing yet to begin , but said his ambition was to become Japan 's first grand prix winner .
" I will try to be the first Japanese driver to win , this is my ultimate goal , " he said .
" But at the moment it is too far away to think about that and I am just focused on my tests now . "
Corey Hill , who first came to our attention on The Ultimate Fighter Season 5 , has unfortunately become better known for suffering one of the worst injuries ever seen in the octagon when he broke his leg in a fight with Dale Hartt .
The injury occurred back in December of 2008 at the UFC : Fight For The Troops event , and he has n’t fought since .
The good news however is that Hill , now 31 and fully recovered from his leg break ( though he still has a rod in his leg ) , will make his competitive return this Saturday night in Niagra Falls , NY , at the ‘ Raging Wolf VI ’ event .
The lightweight fighter , who holds a record of 2 - 2 ( 1 - 2 in the UFC ) , faces off against local prospect Jason Trzewieczynski ( 3 - 2 ) , who is moving down from 170 lbs for this bout .
The fight is seen as the first step towards a return to the UFC where Hill remains under contract .
It ’s not clear at this stage how many fights
Hill will face in regional promotions like this before being given the green - light to return to the promotion .
Considering he is still relatively inexperienced though , the opportunity for the fighter to get some more fights under his belt before making his way back to the big stage could be invaluable for him .
Whether he wins or loses on Saturday night , in many ways just being able to compete again after such a serious injury will be a victory in itself since doctors initially believed that he would never fight again .
Hill wo n’t be the only familiar face at the Raging Wolf event , as it also features two other former UFC fighters , Luigi Fioravanti and TUF 8 competitor Shane Primm who will fight in the main event of the evening .
UPDATE : 24th January 2010
Corey
Hill made it through his comeback fight unscathed last night , and emerged with a unanimous decision victory over Jason Trzewieczynski .

Global Warming : Trick or Truth ?
Tune in to " Campbell Brown " tonight for a look into the science , skepticism , and secrets surrounding global climate change .
CNN , tonight 8 ET .
Washington ( CNN ) --
Greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare , EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday .
" The overwhelming amount of scientific studies show that the threat is real , " she said .
The announcement stems from a Supreme Court ruling which ordered the agency to determine the impact of carbon emissions not only on the environment , but on public health .
i Report : Share your thoughts on climate change
" These long - overdue findings cement 2009 's place in history as the year when the United States government began addressing the challenge of greenhouse - gas pollution and seizing the opportunity of clean energy reform , " Jackson said .
Immediately after the announcement , Jackson was leaving for Copenhagen , Denmark , to participate in the Copenhagen Climate Conference ahead of President Obama 's appearance at the end of the week .
Her statement could provide evidence to the conference that the agency and the Obama administration are taking global warming seriously .
However , Jackson said that Monday 's announcement does not require any immediate regulatory action .
The Obama administration is pushing for comprehensive energy legislation from Congress that puts a price on carbon emissions , a so - called " cap and trade " policy that uses market forces as an incentive for businesses to reduce carbon emissions .
Jackson said carbon dioxide emissions go beyond damaging the environment -- they also endanger public health .
The agency made the announcement because it is required to issue an " endangerment finding " -- evidence that carbon emissions are dangerous to the public health -- before it can regulate carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases under the federal Clean Air Act .
The EPA said in April that it would likely make such a ruling regarding carbon emissions and public health .
The agency completed a public - comment process before making the announcement .

Thousands protest in Tokyo against U.S. military presence in Japan
Thousands of protesters from across Japan marched today in Tokyo to protest against U.S. military presence on Okinawa , while a Cabinet minister said she would fight to get rid of a marine base Washington considers crucial .
Some 47,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan , with more than half on the southern island of Okinawa .
Residents have complained for years about noise , pollution and crime around the bases .
Japan and the U.S. signed a pact in 2006 that called for the realignment of American troops in the country and for a Marine base on the island to be moved to a less populated area .
Protest : Some 6,000 people gathered at a rally in Tokyo calling for the withdrawal of U.S. Marine base stationed on the Japanese island of Okinawa
But the new Tokyo government is re-examining the deal , caught between public opposition to American troops and its crucial military alliance with Washington .
On Saturday , labor unionists , pacifists , environmentalists and students marched through central Tokyo , yelling slogans and calling for an end to the U.S. troop presence .
They gathered for a rally at a park - under a banner that read ' Change ! Japan - U.S. Relations ' - for speeches by civil leaders and politicians .
Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has repeatedly postponed his decision on the pact , with members of his own government divided on how to proceed .
Last week he pledged to resolve the conundrum by May , just before national elections .
' The Cabinet is saying that it will announce its conclusion in May .
For this reason , over the next few months we must put all of our energy into achieving victory , ' Cabinet minister Mizuho Fukushima said at the rally , to shouts of approval from the crowd .
Angry :
The slogans written in Japanese read ' We do n't need Futenma base ' , in red , and ' We refuse new Henoko base ' , in blue
Fukushima - who has a minor post in the Cabinet and heads a small political party - wants the base moved out of Japan entirely .
Hatoyama 's government must appease such political allies to maintain its majority coalition in parliament , and the public are increasingly vociferous on the U.S. military issue , even outside of Okinawa .
' I 'm against having troops here .
I 'm not sure we can get them all out , but at least some of them should leave , ' said Seiichiro Terada , 31 , a government tax collector who attended the rally .
Terada said he traveled from his home in the central prefecture of Shizuoka , which hosts a Marine base at the foot of Mt. Fuji .
The deal with Washington calls for the Marine base in a crowded part of Okinawa to be moved to a smaller city called Nago .
But last week residents of Nago elected a new mayor who opposes the move , ousting the incumbent that supported a U.S. military presence .
On the other side of the debate , a steady stream of U.S. officials have petitioned Tokyo to follow the agreement and maintain American troop levels in Japan , with U.S .
Documents unveiled during today 's federal same - sex marriage trial revealed close links between the Proposition 8 campaign and leaders of the Catholic and Mormon churches .
Over the objections of defenders of Proposition 8 , challengers presented an e-mail that said the Catholic Church played a substantial role in providing volunteers and money to get the measure qualified for the ballot .
That e-mail , sent by the executive director of the Conference of Catholic Bishops to bishops and a cardinal , also said that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints provided " financial , organizational and management contributions " to the campaign .
[ Corrected at 4:08 p.m. :
An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the e-mail was sent by a member of the executive committee of Protectmarriage.com . ]
According to a Mormon Church document entered into evidence , the church was telling its members not to take the lead in promoting Proposition 8 but to support the measure through Protectmarriage.com .
The church document said a teleconference had been held in Salt Lake City with 159 of 161 Mormon leaders in California .
The leaders were told to teach the church 's beliefs about marriage and encourage members to contribute $ 30 each for Proposition 8 , toward a projected goal of $ 5 million , in addition to general fundraising .
The challengers also presented a document that said Mormons were walking neighborhoods one day with 20,000 volunteers for Proposition 8 , and that evangelicals organized teleconferences with as many as 3,000 pastors around the state in an effort to pass the marriage ban .

Jeremy Kyle 's show began in the UK in 2005
British daytime TV hit The Jeremy Kyle Show is heading for the US this summer .
Kyle is hoping his show will prove successful in the US , where his style of " confrontation TV " was spawned by the likes of Jerry Springer .
Following a test run , the plan is to launch the US version of ITV1's talk show nationwide in 2011 .
" I am particularly looking forward to meeting ordinary American people and hearing about their extraordinary lives , " Kyle said .
" This show is n't about me ; it is about their issues and problems and how we can face them together - with complete honesty and openness - in front of US audiences . "
ITV Studios is teaming up with US company Debmar - Mercury to create a test run later this year .
" ITV Studios ' creative vision convinced us that Jeremy Kyle can conquer another continent , " said Debmar - Mercury co-president Mort Marcus .
" We believe American viewers , stations and advertisers will wholeheartedly embrace Jeremy Kyle , who is such a great talent and brings his unique sensibility to a proven format . "
Assault case
The Jeremy Kyle Show has been a solid performer in the daytime ratings for ITV since it launched in 2005 , but it has courted much controversy .
Last year , the show found itself in trouble with media regulator Ofcom after broadcasting one of the " most offensive " swear words .
The watchdog said its use on an edition of the show aired on 2 July on ITV2 was " highly offensive and unacceptable " .
In 2008 , Labour MP Kerry McCarthy described it as a " modern day freak show " which must stop revealing the identity of babies ' parents on air .
On that occasion , ITV said the show adhered to the Ofcom broadcasting code , and its rules and guidance on protecting under - 18s .
The previous year , a judge branded The Jeremy Kyle Show " a form of human bear - baiting " at a court case in Manchester .
The judge made the comments while sentencing one of the show 's guests - who head - butted his love rival during filming - for assault .
Stimulus to bring body scanners to airports
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The U.S. government is using $ 25 million in stimulus money to buy and install full body scanners in airports this year , in an effort to ramp up security and create jobs .
The Transportation Security Administration is using funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to purchase 150 of the full body scanners , according to TSA spokeswoman Sarah Horowitz .

Rapiscan uses low - dose X - rays to scan airline passengers for weapons and explosives .
These " backscatter " scanners , which use X - rays to provide detailed images of hidden objects in or under a person 's clothing , are manufactured by Rapiscan , a subsidiary of Hawthorn , Calif . - based OSI ( OSIS ) .
The scanners cost from $ 150,000 to $ 180,000 apiece , according to the company .
Peter Kant , vice president of global government affairs for Rapiscan , said his company received a $ 25 million contract from the TSA to produce the 150 backscatter scanners .
The contract has helped create 25 jobs , mostly manufacturing positions in the company 's Ocean Springs , Miss .
facility , as well as some engineering jobs , he said .
Kant said the U.S. government has given the TSA the green light to spend $ 173 million on scanners , which includes the initial $ 25 million contract .
" Should we get additional orders , we will have to hire additional manufacturing positions , " he said in an e-mail to CNNMoney.com .
Horowitz would not specify how much money had been earmarked for TSA spending on scanners , but she said the agency has enough funds that would come from the stimulus program and other federal sources to buy an additional 300 scanners .
The backscatter scanners will be used in airports around the country , but the TSA would not say where .
One - third of the backscatter scanners have already been delivered , said Kant .
These scanners are used to detect " anything hidden on the body that is not the body " including metal , plastic , glass and liquids , said Kant , while using X - ray doses that are too low to harm the person being scanned .
" You would get more radiation from the first few minutes of your flight , just from the sun , " he said .
Kant said this technology could be effective in detecting explosives , such as those that were allegedly hidden in the underwear of a terrorism suspect on a Christmas Eve flight from Amsterdam to Detroit .
If Rapiscan 's scanners had been in place , according to Kant , the incident could have been averted .
" We do believe , from what we know from published reports , that we would have detected it , " he said .
The TSA has already implemented 40 scanners using a different type of technology called " millimeter wave advanced imaging " in 19 airports servicing Los Angeles , Washington , D.C. , Atlanta , Miami , Detroit , Dallas and other cities .
These scanners were manufactured by Woburn , Mass . - based L - 3 Communications Corp. ( LLL , Fortune 500 )
Sessions and browser 's tabs
May you have noticed when you open your website in two or more tabs in Firefox , Opera , IE 7.0 or use ' Control + N ' in IE 6.0 to open a new window , it is using the same cookie or is passing the same session id , so the another tab is just a copy of the previous tab .
What you do in one will affect the another and vice - versa .
Even if you open Firefox again , it will use the same cookie of the previous session .
But that is not what you need mostly of time , specially when you want to copy information from one place to another in your web application .
This occurs because the default session name is " PHPSESSID " and all tabs will use it .
There is a workaround and it rely only on changing the session 's name .
Put these lines in the top of your main script ( the script that call the subscripts ) or on top of each script you have :
<? php
if ( version_compare ( phpversion ( ) , ' 4.3.0 ' ) >= 0 ) {
if (! ereg ( ' ^ SESS [ 0 - 9 ] +$ ' , $ _REQUEST [ ' SESSION_NAME ' ] ) ) {
$ _REQUEST [ ' SESSION_NAME ' ]= ' SESS ' . uniqid ( '' ) ;
}
output_add_rewrite_var ( ' SESSION_NAME ' , $ _REQUEST [ ' SESSION_NAME ' ] ) ;
session_name ( $ _REQUEST [ ' SESSION_NAME ' ] ) ;
}
?>
How it works :
First we compare if the PHP version is at least 4.3.0 ( the function output_add_rewrite_var ( ) is not available before this release ) .
After we check if the SESSION_NAME element in $ _REQUEST array is a valid string in the format " SESSIONxxxxx " , where xxxxx is an unique id , generated by the script .
If SESSION_NAME is not valid ( ie. not set yet ) , we set a value to it .
uniqid ('' ) will generate an unique id for a new session name .
It do n't need to be too strong like uniqid ( rand ( ) , TRUE ) , because all security rely in the session id , not in the session name .
We only need here a different id for each session we open .
Even getmypid( ) is enough to be used for this , but I do n't know if this may post a treat to the web server .
I do n't think so .
output_add_rewrite_var( ) will add automatically a pair of ' SESSION_NAME=SESSxxxxx ' to each link and web form in your website .
But to work properly , you will need to add it manually to any header ( ' location ' ) and Javascript code you have , like this :
<? php
header ( ' location : script.php ? ' . session_name ( ) . ' =' . session_id ()
. '& SESSION_NAME= ' . session_name ( ) ) ;
?>
< input type = " image " src=" button.gif " on Click= " javascript:open_popup('script.php ? <?
php
echo session_name ( ) ; ?> = <? php echo session_id ( ) ; ?> &SESSION_NAME= <? php echo session_name ( ) ; ?> ' ) " />
The last function , session_name ( ) will define the name of the actual session that the script will use .
So , every link , form , header ( ) and Javascript code will forward the SESSION_NAME value to the next script and it will know which is the session it must use .
If none is given , it will generate a new one ( and so , create a new session to a new tab ) .
May you are asking why not use a cookie to pass the SESSION_NAME along with the session id instead .
Well , the problem with cookie is that all tabs will share the same cookie to do it , and the sessions will mix anyway .
Cookies will work partially if you set them in different paths and each cookie will be available in their own directories .
But this will not make sessions in each tab completly separated from each other .
Passing the session name through URL via GET and POST is the best way , I think .
Historically the best leading indicator for the economy ( and employment ) has been housing .
I 've been writing about this for years .
For a great summary paper , see Professor Leamer 's presentation from the 2007 Jackson Hole Symposium : Housing and the Business Cycle
For housing as a leading indicator , I use Residential Investment ( quarterly from the BEA's GDP report ) , and monthly data on Housing Starts and New Home sales from the Census Bureau , and builder confidence from the NAHB .
Two key points :
Existing home sales is not a leading indicator ( sales of existing homes does not add to the housing stock ) .
CHIETI , Italy , Jan. 12 ( UPI ) --
An anti-oxidant plant extract Pycnogenol may be beneficial in patients with hemorrhoids , both for acute and chronic treatment , researchers in Italy said .
Pycnogenol , also known as pink bark , is from the bark of the French maritime pine tree and has important anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties .

The randomized , controlled study conducted by G. D'Annunzio University in Italy investigated 84 patients suffering from an acute episode of external hemorrhoids , lasting 24 - 48 hours prior to inclusion in the study .
Patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups , Group 1 consisted of initial 300 mg of Pycnogenol tablets daily for four days , followed by 150 mg per day for the following three days ; Group 2 received the same treatment as Group 1 , plus 0.5 percent Pycnogenol topical cream ; and Group 3 was a placebo treatment group .
The study , published in Phytotherapy Research , found hemorrhoid bleeding was completely absent in the Pycnogenol groups after seven days and thereafter , while it was still observed in the placebo group during two weeks of follow up .
" Topical medications , lifestyle changes and careful hygiene are all that is needed for most patients to control symptoms of hemorrhoids , " study co-author Peter Rohdewald said in a statement .
" In this study , both topical and oral Pycnogenol treatment reduced the intensity and duration of hemorrhoidal pain and bleeding . "
One of the aspects of science communications that can frustrate even its most sophisticated practitioners is the ability of scientists to reach confident conclusions about the big picture even when a field retains significant uncertainties .
You can look no further than dark matter for an example : researchers are pretty confident that it's out there , even though we still have n't identified what it might consist of .
But climatology remains the field where uncertainties , both real and imagined , are most likely to become front page news .
The journal Nature has devoted a series of articles to discussing why that 's likely to be the case .
The editorial staff assigned one of their senior reporters to identifying the areas of most significant uncertainty when it comes to climatology and , as that reporter noted , the primary challenge is whittling things down : the most recent IPCC report identified 54 items that it termed " key uncertainties . "
Contrary to some accusations , this suggests that the areas where climate science needs some work have n't exactly been swept under the rug by the scientific community .
But , at the same time , scientists have clearly looked at these uncertainties and decided that they 're not so significant that the basics of climate change are questionable .
One of these areas is actually a relatively well known controversy : millennial - scale reconstructions — the famed hockey stick , which shows that temperatures have risen dramatically in the past century .
Anybody who has paid careful attention to the " hide the decline " e-mails knows that tree ring indicators of past temperatures have tracked the instrument record until the 1960's , after which subarctic trees diverge .
In this case , there 's even uncertainty about the significance of the uncertainty .
As the article notes , some argue that we should n't put much weight on any tree ring data until we can understand the cause of the divergence .
Others suggest that the presence of a hockey stick in non-arboreal data and the continued high temperatures ( NASA data places 2009 as the second warmest year on record ) mean that the general conclusions are solid .
Two of the other areas identified by Nature are critical to our ability to adapt to the changing climate : fine - grained regional forecasts of just how the climate will be altered , and information on changes in precipitation trends .
We 've covered the issues with regional forecasts before ; suffice it to say that we still can't get great information on what to expect in many key regions of the globe .
When it comes to precipitation , all the models show areas of increased and decreased precipitation , but they disagree on which areas gain and lose .
More worrisome still , the trends in precipitation we 're already seeing are larger than those predicted .
Like regional changes , this is the sort of information policy makers need for long - term planning , and we 're simply not at the point where scientists are able to provide it .
It may surprise some people that there 's only one uncertainty that may actually influence the trajectory of future climates : the impact of particulates .
These include things like black soot , which absorbs sunlight to warm the air while there and increases the albedo when it comes back to earth .
Sulfate particles also efficiently scatter light and form clouds .
The problem here is that we simply do n't have a good grip on what 's up in the atmosphere now , which means we can't extrapolate any trends .
Meanwhile , some scientists have argued that various aerosol particles have slowed down the impact of greenhouse gas emissions through " global dimming " ; others suggest that they 're a negative feedback that will significantly reduce the climate sensitivity .
Managing uncertainty
But the journal does more than identify the uncertainties ; it offers a prescription for identifying and communicating them .
The route to management , in the view of one author , is the use of a technique called the Cooke method , named after its developer , Roger Cooke .
The basic idea is that , for a risk analysis of an area of significant certainty , you poll a panel of experts , and ask them for their predictions and degree of uncertainty about the topic at hand .
But you also ask them questions about related topics with known answers , and use the accuracy of their response to these questions to provide a weight factor that 's used to adjust their answer to the unknown .
In the author 's opinion , this helps limit the impact of an unfortunate reality : the tendency of those with the least expertise to speak with the greatest confidence .
He noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is actually considering using this method for considering low - probability , high - risk events like the collapse of the Greenland ice sheet .
The other problem addressed is the issue of how to deal with the fact that the public as a whole has little sense of the scientific community 's confidence in the general outlines of climate change .
This , according to someone who studies the topic , is a product of what 's called " cultural cognition . "
The gist of this concept is that the public does n't always evaluate scientific ideas based on the data or reasoning ; instead , they often chose a position based on what they believe would be acceptable to the cultural groups that they belong to .
It 's probably safest to let the author 's own words describe the phenomenon : " People with individualistic values , who prize personal initiative , and those with hierarchical values , who respect authority , tend to dismiss evidence of environmental risks , because the widespread acceptance of such evidence would lead to restrictions on commerce and industry , activities they admire .
By contrast , people who subscribe to more egalitarian and communitarian values are suspicious of commerce and industry , which they see as sources of unjust disparity . "
Either of these tendencies can potentially swamp the individual 's ability to both evaluate evidence and its implications .
So , for example , someone on the liberal end of the spectrum might accept the evidence for climate change , but then turn around and oppose the construction of nuclear plants or powerlines and solar facilities in protected deserts .
The flipside is the conservative / libertarian response to the science of climate change itself .
What 's to be done ?
The simplest solution , it 's argued , is to have a diversity of science communicators ; simply hoping the evidence will eventually overwhelm unjustified skepticism has n't panned out for science .
Instead , what 's needed are communicators who can establish a shared cultural understanding with the audiences they 're reaching .
This wo n't guarantee that the audience will then reach the same conclusions as the scientists , but the author argues that it can get them to at least evaluate the data .

Many people are lamenting the apparent death of the health care bill in the aftermath of Scott Brown ’s election .
They should n’t be .
Congress and the President should use the opportunity to reconstruct a more sensible piece of legislation .
The Reconciliation Route
Senate Democrats , in particular , should not obsess about the number 60 .
The absence of a so - called super majority of Senators does not preclude the possibility of passing significant health care reform , even the approach is ultimately more piecemeal and incremental .
There is still ample opportunity to implement legislation in the Senate via reconciliation ( a parliamentary maneuver which allows legislation to pass with a simple majority vote ) .
It ’s more democratic : 2 or 3 Senators should not be able to hold an entire piece of legislation hostage to their own narrow political interests , as Senators Lieberman and Nelson , amongst others , were able to do under the previous legislation .
In response to the “ incrementalists ” Paul Krugman argues the difficulty of going the reconciliation route , noting that the procedure is basically limited to matters of taxing and spending , and so wo n’t address important aspects of reform like the ban on pre-existing conditions .
What Krugman fails to recognize is that the current incarnation of the bill would have done nothing to stop the abusive practice of denial based on pre-existing conditions , as Yves Smith and I have previously highlighted .
Krugman also embraces the principle flaw inherent in the whole reform effort .
Both the House AND Senate versions of the bill entrench the centrality of private health insurance companies .
But health care , as L. Randall Wray and others have pointed out , is not a service that should be provided by private health insurance companies in the first place .
‘ Game Changers ’ and ‘ Curve Benders ’
Contrary to what the President suggested last week , bad salesmanship was not the main problem with this bill .
There were lots of unattractive substantive elements , such as reductions in spending on Medicare to “ pay ” for the bill ’s “ reforms ” ; misconceived taxes on “ Cadillac plans ” to “ reduce ” health care costs and “ fund ” reform ; a focus on costly end - of - life care ( requiring “ guidance ” from an “ independent group ” outside of “ normal political channels ” ) , and a giant loophole on pre-existing conditions ( which is why the 150,000 - strong nurses union opposed the bill ) .
All of this occurred against the backdrop of vague , incomprehensible talk by the President and his budget director , Peter Orszag , about “ game changers ” and curve - benders ” , along with arguments that “ we ’re going to have to change how doctors think about health care and how patients think about health care ” .
Fine for a symposium debate , but this kind of talk will hardly ease the fears of the average voter , whose main concerns are : “ Will I get coverage ? ” and “ How much will it cost me personally ? ”
Remember the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) which was introduced almost as a footnote to Reagan ’s tax reform bill of 1986 ?
At the time , it seemed like a relatively small item , as the threshold for the AMT was set at a reasonably high level and it did n’t catch a lot of people initially .
But of course , as time went on and incomes rose , more and more of the middle class got trapped by it .
The same thing would have almost certainly occurred in regard to the so - called “ Cadillac tax ” proposal to tax on high - cost health care premiums .
Given that neither the House , nor the Senate , versions of the bill contained any serious proposals for cost containment , health insurance premiums likely would have continued to skyrocket , which would have likely guaranteed that more customers would be hit by the tax as time went on .
It is hard to see how pricing disclosure via national exchanges would significantly change that element , especially given that the health insurance industry is an oligopoly dominated by a limited number of private companies , with no competition from a now - killed public option alternative .
True , in the absence of any kind of reform , rising health insurance costs are still likely to remain a reality , but minus the punitive taxation provisions contained in the current bill , which would simply add to the problems of a highly stressed , debt - laden American consumer .
Insurance - dominated Health Care Does n’t Work
Rapidly rising private health insurance costs have depressed American living standards over the past quarter - century .
And an insurance - dominated health care program is a horrible way to construct an effective health care system : the benefits of extending health insurance coverage are almost certainly overstated and are not likely to make a major dent in our two comparative gaps : we spend far more than any other nation but do not obtain better outcomes and in important areas actually get worse results .
Private health insurance , in fact , represents yet another facet of the ongoing financialization of our economy — credit default swaps , instruments to facilitate speculation in vital commodities such as energy and food , exotic home mortgage products — all of which enable Wall Street gamblers to speculate - and - profit on outcomes with no social benefit to the rest of us .
In addition to the huge rents extracted from the economy , private health insurance creates other problems .
As L. Randall Wray has noted , your friendly health insurance company sells you a policy , and then denies your claim due to the existence of pre-existing conditions ( of which you might have been totally unaware ) , or simply because denial is more profitable and you , as the aggrieved victim , are likely to lack the funds for a court battle .
Bankruptcy is often the end result ( according to Steffie Woolhandler , two - thirds of US bankruptcies are due to healthcare bills ) .
My proposal : use Senate reconciliation and expand Medicare via the Senate ’s buy - in provisions .
The CBO has already signed off on this as a means of saving money ( ” budget savings ” is nonsensical concept , I know , but let ’s go with it , as it provides the necessary political cover for what is essentially a budgetary procedure ) .
More importantly , if more Americans can do a buy - in with Medicare , it creates more cost control ( because there ’s a genuine “ public option ” competitor ) .
It also helps to solve the problems of pre-existing conditions , because Medicare does not deny coverage on this basis .
Allowing a Medicare buy - in to Americans under 65 would give people a genuine alternative to private insurance and thereby render the pre-existing question moot .
It would also lower Medicare costs by expanding the risk pool of patients ( the great bulk of medical expenses are accounted for by a small number of people , mostly the elderly , requiring very expensive treatment ) .
And it would substantially enhance the global competitiveness of American corporations .
After all , in what other country in the world is health care a marginal cost of production for business ?
Towards Single Payer
A Medicare buy - in gets us closer to single payer , which control health care costs by cutting down on administrative complexity and making bargain with suppliers , especially drug companies , possible .
This proposal would give American health care consumers far more bang for their buck than the current legislation , which looks set to go down in flames .
Yes , what I ’m proposing is politically difficult .
The financial reform bill efforts have already illustrated the potently of lobbying .
But , as the festering populist reaction in Massachusetts demonstrates , the foes of reform can overreach and trigger a significant backlash .
Hopefully , President Obama and his party will recognize this and mobilize current voter discontent .
Scott Brown ’s surprising election win has bloodied the Democrats , but one hopes that the President and his party recognize that , like Shakespeare ’s Macbeth , they are
“ in blood
Stepp ’d in so far that , should I wade no more ,
Returning were as tedious as go o’er . ”
Time to cross the Rubicon , Mr. President !
Roosevelt Institute Braintruster Marshall Auerback is a market analyst and commentator .
The Government expressed its " sincere regret and deep sympathy " today to the victims of the Thalidomide scandal .
Health Minister Mike O'Brien made the formal apology in an oral statement to MPs .
Mr O'Brien also confirmed a £ 20 million support package , announced last month , which will be administered through the Thalidomide Trust to help meet the needs of survivors .
Mr O'Brien said : " I know that a lot of thalidomiders have waited a long time for this .
" The Government wishes to express its sincere regret and deep sympathy for the injury and suffering endured by all those affected when expectant mothers took the drug Thalidomide between 1958 and 1961 .
" We acknowledge both the physical hardship and the emotional difficulties that have faced both the children affected and their families as a result of this drug , and the challenges that many continue to endure , often on a daily basis . "
Pregnant women were prescribed the drug in the 1950s and 1960s as a treatment for morning sickness or insomnia .
It was withdrawn from sale in 1961 after babies were born with limb deformities and other damage .
The drug 's UK manufacturer , Distillers Biochemicals , paid around £ 28 million compensation in the 1970s following a legal battle by the families of those affected .
The Government 's financial package was announced after a campaign to secure support for surviving " Thalidomiders " , many of whom are unable to work and require adapted homes and cars .
Mr O'Brien said 466 " thalidomiders " are currently beneficiaries of the Thalidomide Trust which distributes aid to sufferers .
The three - year pilot scheme would allow the " complex and highly specialised needs " of thalidomide survivors to be met .
It would also help to reduce further degeneration in their health and reduce long - term demands on the NHS , he said .
Thalidomide campaigner Guy Tweedy , 47 , from Harrogate , described the apology as " absolutely wonderful " .
" I 'm highly delighted and so glad that it actually came , 50 years too late but never mind .
" It 's an apology not just to thalidomide victims but to the parents who lost their children in the early days .
" Some will not be around to hear the apology from the Government . "
Mr Tweedy said the apology " means as much in some ways as the money " .
" It 's a big day , " he added .
If there ’s one thing I ’ve been surprised by while trying to start startups , it ’s the extent to which the business landscape is shaped by law .
Skin Cancer
One of my first serious startup business efforts involved skin cancer : melanoma , specifically , by far the most malignant and dangerous type .
It turns out that one can really do a pretty good job in terms of detecting melanoma in the early stages , when it ’s still relatively easy to treat .
This is in part because it is a cancer on the surface of the skin , and typically the cancerous , rapidly multiplying melanocytes produce an excess of melanin in patterns of characteristic irregularity .
In other words , one can spot melanoma in ugly moles .
If ( a ) one knows what to look for and ( b ) actually does look , in the vast majority of cases you can catch the disease before it spreads , and thus , save a life .
The World Health Organization pegs melanoma deaths at 48,000 per year .
1
The chain breaks in both places .
There are papers2 that estimate the sensitivity of physicians to melanomas at 86 % , which is not bad , if they happen to look , but not great either .
The big problem is that it ’s by no means certain that the doctor will look : most melanomas are still found first by the patient .
That is , if they ’re found at all before it ’s too late .
A friend of mine refused to see a dermatologist , despite her friends urgings .
Once she finally did , the cancer had grown out of control .
She did survive , but she had to suffer through an extremely painful excision followed by reconstructive surgery followed by a recovery period nearly a year long .
Prevention and early detection are the key weapons against disease .
This could have been prevented .
There ’s a heck of a lot you can learn from a photograph , even one taken from a cellphone .
From that photograph , a trained individual can determine whether the mole is a cause for concern — whether you ’re really just fine or whether one should be examined more closely by a specialist .
There are even papers showing how an algorithm can be made to be as accurate as physicians in diagnosing the cancer .
3
It seemed like a great hack .
Within a week or so , I rallied some friends of mine , threw together an application to Y Combinator , and tried to put a business together .
Whatever the technical challenges were , I was unprepared for the legal and social challenges I was to face .
The partners at Y Combinator did like the idea on some level , but declined to fund us .
In Paul Graham ’s words
“ The trouble with the melanoma detection idea is that you ’d spend most of your time dealing with legal and regulatory crap .
That sort of work does n’t really take advantage of your skills . ”
There were other problems too ( we were rather cavalier about the quality of images we ’d get in practice from widely varying cameras , lenses and lighting conditions ) , but in the end it was the specter of law and regulation that cowed us .
I still maintain that we could build this , and while perhaps it might not have been the absolute best focus for my efforts or launching point for my career , I still think we could have done a lot of good .
4
What concerns me most is n’t that we could n’t get the melanoma detection idea to take off .
It ’s that anyone trying to work in the field of medicine is going to have to slog through legal and regulatory crap .
There ’s a lot that can be done with simple little pieces of software and hardware to help people look after their health .
Detection is the first line of defense .
But as long as we persist in the current regulatory environment , where detection aids must disclaim whatever they imply or slog through the same lengthy and expensive FDA approval process regardless of their capacity for harm , entrepreneurs , engineers , doctors and scientists are going to be limited in the good that they can do , as well as the bad .
Lesson one .
[ JessNordell notes that both SpotCheck and SkinScan have taken up the charge ! ]
The Electrical Grid
It does n’t take too long before the familiar seems sane , and what we grow up with seems to have always been , bequeathed to us by ancestors blessed with the virtues of invention , vigor and foresight .
I remember , as a kindergardener , when my mother took me to the local power plant , chimneys three hundred feet tall , how awed I was by the sights and sounds — the enormous burners and boilers , steam blasting through turbines powering vast generators , electrons pumping through transformers in gray substations of metal ringed insulators , transformers , cylinders , a geometrical landscape adorned with fins , cathedrals of wire , lines buzzing .
Deep sounds metal clangs reverberated through the boiler room , amid hot steel , as my tiny feet traced halting paths along innumerable iron grates .
Six years old , seeing this , I imagined the builders of these machines surely must have known what they were doing .
Promethean gods walked the earth : behold !
This was their handiwork .
5
It shocked me to find out how the electrical grid really worked .
The grid , as it exists today , has almost no capacity to store energy .
This means that at every instant in time , the amount of energy going on to the grid must almost exactly equal the amount of energy coming off .
Otherwise , the grid rapidly fails in its operation , rising too high or too low in voltage , or shifting frequency , or succumbing to noise , spelling disaster to everything dependent upon a smooth , steady stream of power for its operation .
That is to say , nearly every device of the modern world .
And while we have some provisions to redirect power on the grid ( primarily , giant , motor driven switches of a kind not unlike those which control your household lightbulbs ) , our ability to throttle the amount of power we put onto the grid is slow and expensive .
Gas turbines are the power plants that can be controlled most readily , however their power must be throttled over a period of nearly 15 minutes .
When they do this , however , they operate away from their most efficient operating point , meaning that lots of fuel is burned , power is expensive , and more CO2 goes out the stack into the air .
Hydropower stations can be throttled nearly as readily as gas turbines , but they can operate in a wider range before they lose most of their efficiency .
Coal , petroleum , and nuclear plants , on the other hand require periods on the order of days to speed up and slow down — it takes about that long for them to relax to a thermal equilibrium , keeping thermal stresses within safe bounds .
However , the electrical demand is quite unpredictable , and it can vary significantly in a period much shorter than the 15 minutes it takes for our fastest power plants to significantly alter their power output .
So to respond in faster timescales , power plants must run as ‘ spinning reserves . ’
This is where fuel is burning and the turbine is spinning , constantly , in expectation of a fluctuation .
There are now massive power plants , burning fuel this very second , for no purpose other than to smooth out the rapid fluctuations on the grid .
I hope I do n’t need to point out how crazy this is .
What ’s more , electrical supply from renewables is very unpredictable , especially whatever ’s coming from distributed power .
Wind power is the least expensive ( in fact , according to Prof.
Marc Jacobson of Stanford University , considerably less expensive than coal power !) 6 , but in terms of supplying controllable , usable power , wind is terrible !
Wind power varies rapidly and widely , is extremely difficult to predict , is quite correlated over large regions , and , what ’s probably the worst , wind power comes mostly in the dead of night , when nobody needs it .
The entire world has wired itself up with an electrical grid that is fundamentally insane , and as we plug in renewables to solve the other problem with the electrical grid , controlling it is only getting harder .
We need a way to store energy .
The current state - of - the - art8 is pumping water up a hill to store energy ( essentially using a hydropower plant backwards ) , and letting it run down to retrieve it .
This works well and is relatively inexpensive if you have the ideal geography , but those plant sites are mostly taken up : from now on pumped hydro energy storage is either going to be a lot more expensive or a lot more exotic ( current plans call for giant undersea bladders , or the use of enormous underground aquifers ) .
There are a number of other energy storage technologies , including electrochemical batteries , flywheels , and compressed air .
There are good people working on every one of these approaches , and from our perspective , technically , there ’s a good chance that at least one of us will find a solution allowing for energy storage so efficient and inexpensive that renewables , especially wind power , are economically competitive on the world scale , and on an unsubsidized basis .
However , among the many obstacles we find along the way appears the government .
Despite their problems , technologies now exist that can both regulate the grid on short time scales ( that is , dampening the second to second and minute to minute fluctuations ) and , over a longer period , buy unneeded power in bulk at low prices and sell it when needed at high prices .
If , on a single device , you can only provide the short or long term service , the economics do n’t make sense .
Luckily , it is technically feasible to do both simultaneously , on the same device , and thus the economics for the current technology can work out , in at some cases .
The electrical grid can be buffered by energy storage , and utilities could make money doing it , to boot !
How sensible .
Unfortunately , it ’s illegal !7
Let me explain .
Transmission assets , like roads , railways , telephone networks and the electrical grid , have been shown to naturally tend towards a monopoly .
In the case of the electrical grid , after a number of political fights the following deal was struck : the government would grant the electrical grid transmission monopoly to a single entity ( in some cases more specifically the last few legs leading from the power plants to your home ) in exchange for certain powers .
In particular , the utility could , using its monopoly pricing power , impose practically any price on the unwitting public , which would pay just the same — they have almost no choice and electricity demand is notoriously inelastic .
However , it would be restrained to charge a price only up to a certain regulated return on their capital , and no more .
The regulatory commission has other powers , such as being able to define which sorts of investments and projects can proceed , and it places on the utility certain contractual demands to supply power .
Therein lies the first problem .
In effect , were one selling power equipment for the grid , one ’s real customer is not the utility , but the regulatory commission .
It ’s in the utility ’s interest to buy the most capital intensive equipment that the regulatory commission will allow , and to incur the greatest expenses .
After that , it may jack up prices such that it achieves its regulated rate of return , but now , due to its greater expense , it is now earning a greater profit as a greater entity for more investor dollars .
I never imagined such a perverse set of incentives .
There are only three reasons for which utilities regulated in this way will look beyond the most expensive corner of the status quo .
Firstly , in order to reduce risk on their capital investments , secondly , to explore the use of alternative technologies and broaden their strategic options , and finally , out of the goodness of their hearts .
They ’ve actually done a lot on that last count ; that renewable energy is deployed at all seems to me shining evidence of a desire to do good .
But utilities are conservative organizations , they ’ve already figured out how to run their capital investments with very low risks ( lower than most new technologies could possibly manage ) and dollars for technology exploration are in short supply .
So , there ’s the first shocker .
Utilities with a regulated rate of return ( I think this is most of them , though I ’d love a better quantification for this ) have essentially no incentive to save money , and hence no incentive to try out new money saving technology .
If we ’re to sell to anyone we have to sell to the regulatory boards , who are even more conservative .
Oy .
Secondly , as the government is fond of doing , parts of the electrical utility business have been broken up , and they are not even allowed to talk with one another and share information , much less operate with the same hardware .
The transmission department at PG&E is kept sealed off from the generation department at PG&E .
Unfortunately , despite the fact that it is ludicrous , that it is patently insane to operate an electrical grid without energy storage ( just as it ’s insane to operate a network with no buffer , a computer with no cache or memory ) , there is no energy storage department at PG&E , or at least it does n’t fit into the existing regulatory structure .
There are no requirements for a certain amount of energy storage , and even the things that you could do to save money for the utility are unattractive for the reasons described above , and even those are unlikely with current technology to be good investments because they are both risky and it is illegal to operate the same device for both the generation department ( people are saying now that storing cheap energy at night and selling it at a higher price during the day is called ‘ generation ’ for some reason ) and the transmission department ( regulating short term fluctuations in the grid and storing energy to ease congestion is called ‘ transmission ’ for some reason ) .
So , a sensible and practically necessary thing ( energy storage ) is not allowed to be run in a manner which with existing technology which could save the public and the utility money and could enable the economic competitiveness of renewables .
But that does n’t matter because utilities are n’t trying to save money anyway .
Wow .
A couple of these problems can be avoided in the new , deregulated , ‘ ancillary services ’ markets .
These deregulated markets , humorously enough , are markets for regulation — utilities and electric co-operatives pay a premium for MW scale power slices , so as long as you ’re in the right spot and can deliver power on extremely short notice ( people are pushing this as short as 4 seconds ) you can stand to make a fair bit of money on a deregulated market selling to utilities .
There are a few companies ( Beacon Power is a prominent one ) that try to make systems to do this now : in addition to the technology they ’ve developed they ’ve put in an incredible amount of political effort to get utilities to open up and deregulate their ( * snicker * ) regulation markets .
Unfortunately , the economics are still somewhat marginal .
Current energy storage technologies are really expensive compared with the wasteful throttling of fossil fuel power plants .
Better technologies ( we ’re working on one ) might be able to make a really substantial profit .
And if you can do energy arbitrage ( buying power low , selling it high ) , or do something else that ’s useful with your energy storage device , you can make even more money .
Unfortunately , as above , it ’s illegal to sell regulation services and do energy arbitrage on the grid — you have to do something else .
( If any investors are reading this , do n’t worry , we ’ve got a few tricks up our sleeves ! )
Someday , by our actions and with the help of others , enough of these problems will be solved so that the electrical grid can be buffered and made sane , that the public will save money by using energy storage , and renewable energy will be free to take over the world .
Someday .
Until then , we ’ve got a lot of work to do .
Here I thought we were working on a complete , technical solution to solve a massive problem in the world .
A straight shot .
And what do we find ?
Legal and regulatory crap , my nemesis , as defined by Paul Graham .
Lesson two .
So it goes .
A Patent Puzzle
Inventing things is what I do .
It ’s an inseparable part of who I am .
I ca n’t get three chapters into a book before I have an idea for a new technology , product , startup , or hack .
Parties are brainstorming sessions .
I pester romantic partners as we fall asleep .
Some of my ideas are good .
Some , not so good .
Those that pass all my filters probably each have a decent shot at solving a major problem in a way fundamentally better than what ’s come before with an approach that ’s within my eventual capability to execute .
Maybe it ’s a little better than 1 in 3 .
I ca n’t really know until I try .
But because I have so many ideas , and possibly because of practice , they number in the hundreds .
If they were they only idea I had , I could really see myself giving them a go .
And succeeding .
I am not at all unique in this .
One thing that helps tremendously is to be able to talk about one ’s ideas .
Maybe even bring another person in to help work on bringing them to life .
Oftentimes one ’s ideas are too much for one to handle at some time , or maybe one is missing some crucial missing piece that needs just the right person or the right piece of knowledge .
If good ideas are too plentiful to fully utilize by oneself , if the difficult part of profiting from a good idea is bringing them to life , and if being open about them aids in this process , then ideas should be free .
Or , at least , it should not make one unduly vulnerable to reveal one ’s ideas .
One should at least be free to let one ’s ideas free .
My friend , let me tell you about the patent system .
If I hold a patent on something ( a widget ) , it does not allow me to build , license or sell the patented widget .
It merely allows me to prevent others from building , licensing , or selling that widget ( or anything else that falls under the widget classes and widget constituents for patented widget uses under the widget claims ) .
If my widget involves some device ( a sprocket ) that someone else ( Eve ) has patented , Eve can prevent me from building , licensing , or selling my widget unless I purchase a license for Eve ’s sprocket .
If my something absolutely requires some crummy little item ( a doohickey ) that I forgot to mention or did n’t quite yet invent in my papers , my blog posts , my patent applications or my brochures , the sum total of my disclosure to the public domain and the patent office , and Eve notices this , she can patent said doohickey and the rational use of her doohickey and extort an outrageous price from me before I can sell any widgets at all .
Herein lies the problem .
Race to the Sea !
If you mention almost anything specific about what you ’re doing and how you ’re doing it , then you ’re making yourself vulnerable .
Eve can now take a look at what you ’ve done , run through possible improvements , and possible requirements that you either have not claimed or disclosed or have not invented yet , and patent the ones that will hurt the most .
Once you ’ve given away your position , she can surround you , choking you off from the possibility of profiting from your work .
The important patent on the sewing machine was the sewing pin .
With a tiny little hoop through the head .
It is easy to forget the little things .
In the current legal climate , there are three options .
1. Stay hidden indefinitely .
Protect everything that you ’ve got by trade secret .
If you personally ( with or without corporate backing ) expect to be able to bring your ideas to their full potential , this might be best for both you and the world .
2. Race to the sea .
Patent your work — stake your ground , and reveal your position .
Once your first patents are filed , you have to , urgently and carefully , check to make sure you ’ve thought everything through .
Are the relevant uses and markets patented ?
Are all of the incorporated or required devices available as commodities , or public domain , or inexpensively licensable , or do you own those patents yourself ?
Are you absolutely sure that you have n’t left anything critical out — that there ’s nothing that you still need to invent that someone else might patent first ?
Are substantial improvements and variants of your design included in the first patent ?
There is a relatively short delay ( on the order of a year ) between when you file a patent and it appears for publication .
If any of the vulnerabilities describe above exist , you ’ve got until the publication date to protect yourself before Eve can make her attack .
The clock is ticking .
3 . Use your judgment , talk and write as freely as you desire , and cross your fingers .
Hope that no one patents around you , and no one litigates .
I personally would love to be able to open source many of my patentable ideas .
Engines .
Desalination plants .
Solar collectors .
Refrigerators .
Waste water mining .
Wind turbines .
Boats .
Planes .
A crowd beacon .
Medical devices .
Heat lamps .
Translucent coatings .
Metallurgical processes .
Bioreactors .
You name it .
But the legal climate does not make it very safe for me to do so .
If I write about them too freely , Eve might patent around me — now neither I nor anyone else can pursue my idea without encumbrance .
If I protect myself by racing to the sea , I need to engage in an extraordinary investment of time , energy , and money on an idea that I probably crystallized in three seconds .
It ’s clear that even in the best of circumstances I ’d be rate limited , but for almost all practical purposes this would become an untenable demand on my time ( unless I have the resources of Nathan Myhrvold at my disposal . )
Finally , I can protect myself by keeping my ideas trade secrets .
Unless they are one of the few which I actually find the time and resources to seriously work on , this accomplishes exactly nothing .
There is no pile of precious ideas I keep to stroke at night .
I do not hoard them .
Some members of the free software community have been brainstorming ideas which have some relevance to tackling this problem .
They include the Patent Commons and retaliation provisions in the GPL v3.9 Unfortunately they really do not provide full protection .
Patents can only prevent people from building or selling things .
They are weapons .
Patent trolls , on the other hand , do n’t build or sell anything .
There is nothing to retaliate with , nothing to counter - sue , there is no center , no target .
Patent trolls occupy an ecological niche in the legal landscape equivalent to cell based terrorist organizations in today ’s political world .
A sufficiently determined and evil person could extract billions of dollars from the world and destroy billions of dollars in wealth via long and painful lawsuits , simply by surrounding the patents and inventions that the world now relies upon .
Perhaps at this time our only real protection is how grueling and soul destroying that path to fortune is versus the creation of wealth .
The patent system is supposed to encourage innovation .
But I think what it ’s done is cause everyone to overvalue ideas , and that has shifted the balance of power away from those who want to turn their ideas into something concrete and towards , marginally , those who have the ideas in the first place , but much more worrisomely , those who wish to wage war with them .
I ’d love a discussion on how to fix this system .
Specifically , not what to fix , but how : what specific actions can we take to make a difference ?
Quite apart from this , what should I do ?
Suppose I want nothing more than to do good for the world , to let my ideas , if they so deserve , blossom fully into life .
Just talk about them and hope there ’s no lawsuit ?
I do not want to be thinking about this !
Lesson three .
More legal and regulatory crap .
Maybe I should n’t be so surprised : without law , there ’s no formal property , no real capitalism , pretty much just anarchy , really .
Of course it undergirds business .
But what ’s strange is that it ’s constraining my thought .
I just want to talk to people about my ideas , help the world , and be good .
This should n’t be so hard !
So it goes .
Post Script : Trevor Blackwell of AnyBots and Y Combinator gives a thoughtful reply on Hacker News as to how the regulations that come into being are so malformed .
Big companies are smarter than gov’t regulators , they understand their business better , and they have a longer time horizon .
So when the government comes around to regulate them , they think “ OK , how can we turn this into a huge barrier to entry for new competitors ? ”
They have large lobbyist and strategy budgets .
They generally win .
The most misregulated industries in the US are energy , medical , and transportation .
So there are lots of glaring inefficiencies , but they are there for a reason .
Technologists assume the reason is stupidity and that clever inventions can fix things .

( Reuters ) - Shares of Dell Inc DELL.O tumbled 10 percent on Friday , a day after the company posted a 54 percent drop in quarterly profit , prompting at least two brokerages to cut their price target on the stock .
Credit Suisse cut its price target on shares of the No. 3 maker of personal computers to $ 14 from $ 16 , while RBC Capital Markets cut its price target on the stock to $ 16 from $ 17 .
“ Dell ’s results will continue to be disappointing in coming quarters as its market share and profits should remain constrained , ” Credit Suisse analyst B . Shope wrote in a note .
A large portion of the decline stems from increased tax and interest burden , said the analyst , who expects the tax rate to be higher going forward .
Despite the weak third quarter , Dell executives on Thursday spoke positively about demand trends and expectations for a wave of new spending next year as companies update aging equipment .
“ We believe Dell ’s team is doing the right things to position the company ahead of a recovery , but we are cautious on the stock given multiple moving pieces , ” RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note , referring to the company ’s restructuring and the integration with Perot Systems Corp .
Though Dell expects to see seasonal improvement , the January quarter is typically a consumer - centric quarter and gross margins are likely to be pressured due to an increased lower - margin consumer mix , Daryanani said .
On Thursday , Dell said gross margins fell to 17.3 percent from 18.8 percent in the year - ago period .
The company posted lower - than - expected sales as it lost market share to competitors .
Shares of the company were trading down 9 percent at $ 14.41 Friday morning on Nasdaq .

Industrial agriculture is currently the dominant food production system in the United States .
It 's characterized by large - scale monoculture , heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides , and meat production in CAFOs ( confined animal feeding operations ) .
The industrial approach to farming is also defined by its heavy emphasis on a few crops that overwhelmingly end up as animal feed , biofuels , and processed junk food ingredients .
From its mid-20th century beginnings , industrial agriculture has been sold to the public as a technological miracle .
Its efficiency , we were told , would allow food production to keep pace with a rapidly growing global population , while its economies of scale would ensure that farming remained a profitable business .
But too often , something crucial was left out of this story : the price tag .
In fact , our industrialized food and agriculture system comes with steep costs , many of which are picked up by taxpayers , rural communities , farmers themselves , other business sectors , and future generations .
When we include these “ externalities ” in our reckoning , we can see that this system is not a cost - effective , healthful , or sustainable way to produce the food we need .
And the good news is that it ’s not the only way .
Scientists and farmers are developing smart , modern agricultural systems that could reduce or eliminate many of the costs of industrial agriculture — and still allow farmers to run a profitable business .
It ’s time for farm policy to move into the 21st century and prioritize these innovative methods .
Costs to human health and safety
Industrial farming is bad for the health of workers , eaters , and downstream neighbors .
Here are some of its costly health impacts :
Pesticide toxicity .
Herbicides and insecticides commonly used in agriculture have been associated with both acute poisoning and long - term chronic illness .

Water pollution from fertilizer runoff contaminates downstream drinking water supplies , requiring costly cleanup measures with an annual price tag of nearly $ 2 billion .

Junk food .
Industrial agriculture , especially in the central United States , mostly produces commodity crops like corn and soybeans .
These crops are used to make the processed foods that dominate the US diet , with serious — and enormously costly — health impacts .

Antibiotic resistance .
The overuse of antibiotics in CAFOs has accelerated the development of antibiotic - resistant bacteria , which has taken a toll both in lives and health care dollars .
Damage to farmland and the rural environment
The soils of the American Corn Belt were once celebrated for their fertility .
But industrial farming treats that fertility as a resource to be tapped , not maintained .
This leads to several kinds of costs , including :
Depletion .
Monoculture exhausts soil fertility , requiring costly applications of chemical fertilizers .

Lost biodiversity .
Industrial farms do n't support the rich range of life that more diverse farms do .
As a result , the land suffers from a shortage of the ecosystem services , such as pollination , that a more diverse landscape offers .
Social and economic impacts
The pressure to " get big or get out " is fundamental to industrial agriculture — and takes a toll on communities .
The coming year : 2010 , will see a growing clash of conflicting mega-trends in the Afghanistan - Pakistan theater ; trends which will ultimately have long - term impact not only on the region , but on all of Eurasia and global energy and political arenas .
These main mega - trends are :
1. Obama ’s Needs :
The desperate efforts of the US White House of Pres. Barack Obama to appease and negotiate with any element of the “ Taliban ” — and the label “ Taliban ” is used with great looseness by most observers of the Afghanistan and Pakistan scene — willing to in order to expedite a US withdrawal and legitimize a “ modern ” Afghan state .
The Obama White House is determined to start an irreversible disengagement by mid-2011 and to complete the bulk of the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan a year later , just before Obama runs for re-election .
Since a US military victory is inconceivable , the White House argues , a negotiated settlement with the “ Taliban ” would provide the sole key to bringing the war to a “ closure ” .
Toward this end , the US is empowering , and handsomely paying , a rapidly expanding cottage industry of mediators and go - betweens of dubious reach and reliability .
This undertaking further disrupts the delicate tapestry of the region tribal populace and the competing indigenous leaderships because these mediators throw around huge sums of money and empower the crooks and criminals .
2. Pakistan ’s Needs :
The need for Pakistan to regain its influence over the “ Taliban ” in order to ensure Pakistani dominance over its own territory and much of Afghanistan has to be a priority for Pakistan ’s Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) organization .
Islamabad has little option but to strive to regain such control in order to reverse the growing Indian influence in Afghanistan and to improve Pakistani ability to withstand a forthcoming crisis , even war , with India .
There is evidence that many in Islamabad are convinced that such a war is imminent .
The strategic ascent of the PRC and the ensuing effective encirclement of India by the People ’s Republic of China ( PRC ) and its allies ( east to west : Myanmar - Bangladesh - PRC - Nepal - Pakistan ) will ultimately compel India to attempt a strategic breakout .
In an effort to contain India , the PRC is increasing pressure by supporting Maoist and secessionist movements in northeastern India , as well as empowering Pakistan to intensify the ISI ’s support for the jihadist insurgency in Kashmir .
For its part , India is intensifying support for Pushtun and Baluchi insurgencies inside Pakistan from facilities in Afghanistan .
A vicious cycle of wars - by - proxy is rapidly escalating .
The PRC is thus instigating crises which might possibly lead to a wider war in which Pakistan will inevitably be involved .
Under such conditions , it is vital for the ISI to ensure Islamabad ’s control over the strategically crucial terrain and pertinent population .
3 . The PRC ’s Energy Transit Priorities :
The PRC ’s drive to control the pipeline routes across Afghanistan with Pakistan — the PRC ’s closest ally — as the implementer mean that the Chinese - sponsored undertakings in Pakistan and quest for control over Afghanistan are an integral part of the PRC ’s drive to consolidate long - term strategic posture in Central Asia .
Beijing must secure privileged access to the region ’s energy resources because these reserves are crucial for the sustenance of the PRC ’s economic growth and modernization .
Beijing is committed to a rejuvenated Silk Road built around a web of hydrocarbon pipelines and railroads .
Running pipelines from Central Asia to Arabian Sea seaports via Afghanistan and Pakistan is a critical component of the PRC ’s grand design .
Ultimately , the Chinese intend to encircle India , challenge Russia ’s hegemony in Central Asia , and , to a lesser extent , undermine the EU ’s economic presence .
Beijing is cognizant that this grand - strategic ascent will not go unnoticed or without resistance .
However , the PRC considers this surge the sole undertaking capable of facilitating and sustaining the historic ascent of China as a global “ hegemon ” ( a recently revived Imperial - era term ) , and the PRC is willing to take the risks and pay the price .
4. The Reinvigoration of Pushtun and Baluch Tribalism :
The transformation of the Pushtun and Baluchi tribal population , and the ensuing impact on the jihadist movement in their midst , is assuming significant proportions .
There are about 42 - to 45 - million Pushtuns ( in an estimated 60 major tribes and more than 400 sub- clans ) and about 20 - million Baluchis ( in two distinct sub-nations and a convoluted system of tribes and sub- tribes ) , and all are determined to return to Pushtunwali - based tribalism as the quintessence of society and beliefs .
This grassroots determination is the outcome of more than a half - century of ceaseless conflicts with modernity and governance which cost both Pushtuns and Baluchis a lot of blood .
There is now a discernable grassroots conviction that an historic watershed has been crossed ; a conviction which manifests itself in a profound rejection of both the centralized state - government and its localized governance authorities ( be it “ Pakistan ” or “ Afghanistan ” ) to the point of launching armed uprising .
But this revival of Pushtunwali - based tribalism is also the cause of profound rejection of the neo- salafites ’ monolithic Arabization of Islam in the name of jihad , and consequently , the harbinger of schism with the jihadist movement ( commonly called al - Qaida ) .
This pattern of Pushtunwali - based tribal revivalism goes back some 2,500 years .
This is a recurring phenomenon throughout history ; always an indigenous reaction to outside pressure and coercion with which the grassroots population has refused to compromise .
However , since the Pushtunwali - driven tribal society is the grassroots level — with which everybody must deal and contend — the dynamic within the multifaceted tribal society will continue to have a singular impact on the bigger mega - trends .
Simply put , in their pursuit of their world - changing grand - strategic future interests , the dominant powers will have to come to terms with the 2,500 year old Pushtunwali - driven tribal society .
All efforts to coerce or cajole the Pushtunwali - driven tribal society into modernity — especially Westernization — will come to naught .
Hence , although the PRC and Pakistan are committed in principle to a centralized state and governance by institutions ( albeit mainly security / intelligence dominated rather than civil - democratic ) , consolidating and sustaining control over the strategically crucial territories without resistance and disruption from the indigenous population is of far greater importance .
The ISI — the principal on - the - ground implementer of this grand design — knows this better than anybody else .
Hence , the ISI will reach compromises on coexistence and cohabitation with the human tapestry which makes up the Pushtunwali - based tribal society .
Pakistan has a long record of doing this quite effectively , until Islamabad was coerced by the Obama Administration into launching offensives into the Pushtun areas against all advice from Pakistan ’s own experts and senior officials .
It wo n’t be long before Islamabad and Beijing can move away from the Washington demands , and revive this proven pattern of compromise and cooperation if only because these arrangements will also result in the grassroots suppression and rejection of jihadist networks as they increase their anti-Pakistan surge .
The sole explosive and disruptive ingredient is the Obama policy in Afghanistan .
The US seeks to break indigenous population patterns and alliances through its support for a viable Kabul .
This approach disturbs all other key players particularly because this US policy is being implemented through the COIN ( Counter - Insurgency ) strategy .
These efforts to build Kabul ’s power on the coat - tails of the US and NATO COIN operations needlessly alienate wide segments of indigenous population and drive the grassroots to not only take - up arms against the US / NATO forces , but also shield and shelter jihadists in the name of solidarity and hospitality code .
The locals know that the US is leaving soon and are therefore ready for interim compromises in order to ascertain and expedite the US withdrawal .
What is still uncertain is just how much will they — the locals — be willing to suffer and risk before the withdrawal happens .
Islamabad wants to see the US leaving as quickly as possible , and is therefore willing to endure interim setbacks as the US attempts to consolidate a government in Kabul and to coerce Pakistan to continue its offensives in the Pushtun lands .
But the US reaching out to the “ Taliban ” for negotiations is too destabilizing , and thus threatening for the ISI ’s necessary and proven tapestry of protégés .
And this tapestry is so crucial to the success of the grand designs of the PRC and Pakistan that Islamabad cannot compromise or sacrifice it .
Therefore , the ISI is increasingly manipulating and truncating existing “ negotiations ” via US - empowered emissaries .
Meanwhile , the ISI is also encouraging and assisting the so - called “ good Taliban ” of Pakistan to deploy their forces to help the so - called “ bad Taliban ” of Afghanistan in escalating the war against the US / NATO and so - called Afghan forces , thus failing ongoing “ negotiations ” which are not under the ISI control and reversing whatever progress made in the empowerment of Kabul .
Thus , the recent US initiatives , while essentially futile , have nevertheless increased the fear in Beijing and Islamabad of US conspiracies , as well as engendered their apprehension of a possible US challenge to their long - term vital interests .
Both Beijing and Islamabad will not take a chance and wait for the US to fail and disengage on its own .
Instead , it is probable that they will opt for a war - by - proxy ; that is , sponsoring a marked escalation of anti-US / NATO insurgency and even cooperation with foreign neo-salafite jihadists despite repeated calls by radical Islamist leaders such as Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri for the jihadists to take on Islamabad .
Even with the forthcoming “ surge ” in mind , US and NATO forces are woefully insufficient and under - equipped to meet the current level of fighting , let alone the anticipated escalation .
The restrictive ROE ( rules of engagement ) in the name of pro-people COIN further diminish the effectiveness , and undermine the deterrence , of the US / NATO military forces without any tangible contribution to building bridges to the frustrated and increasingly hostile population .
But the West cannot just drop everything and walk away from Afghanistan and Pakistan as the Obama White House yearns to do .
The West has vital interests in the energy resources and strategic stability in Central Asia .
Simply put , Europe ’s ability to rely on “ the Persian Gulf of the 21st Century ” — Central Asia — for its long - term secure energy supplies depends on containing the PRC ’s strategic ascent and quest for the same energy resources and the southwards transportation routes ( there is a limit to the quantities of hydrocarbons which can be piped westwards through Russia ) .
These interests can be secured through the Russian political - security hegemony in Central Asia , which , in turn , is facilitating the Western economic outreach .
The European Union - Russian Federation ( EU - RF ) “ Eurasian Home ” grand strategy codifies such cooperation .
The PRC ’s containment can also be achieved in part by ensuring a strategic balance between India and the PRC , a policy supported by Russia .
As well , Western interests would be furthered by the stifling of the continued spread of jihadism , a key objective of Russia as well .
Moscow is most apprehensive about the jihadist attrition of socio-political stability in Central and South Asia and the ensuing spread into Russia ’s sizeable Muslim population .
Ultimately , however , there is no substitute for the West ’s long - term direct presence and military involvement at the Heart of Asia .
A US withdrawal would abandon the Heart of Asia to a Russian - Chinese condominium with the EU — being dependent on the region ’s energy resources — playing a pliant supportive rôle .
Apprehensive as it is of China ’s strategic ascent , Russia does not have the means to singlehandedly block the PRC .
To remain in Central Asia , Russia will have to compromise with China against its own better judgment .
Russia would rather have the West in the area to jointly contain China .
It is therefore crucial for Russia and the West to demonstrate US - led Western commitment through long - term military presence and continued fighting against the primary foes .
Afghanistan and Pakistan are the crux of such presence for they are outside Russia ’s strategic domain in Central Asia , and they constitute both the vital corridor for independent Western access to Central Asia and the primary route of pipelines transporting the region ’s hydrocarbons to the West ( or China ) .
Moreover , Western military presence in Afghanistan and Pakistan would calm down India ’s warranted anxieties of strategic encirclement and the imperative of an audacious breakout , thus significantly reducing the threat of Indo - Pakistani crisis and war .
The Obama White House , however , is going to undermine these vital interests of the entire West and abandon everything .
The Obama White House is focusing on instant - gratification steps — an inexplicable mix of near - term “ defeat ” of , and negotiated “ compromise ” with , the “ Taliban ” — in order to provide domestic political fig - leaf for the withdrawal .
Although several major NATO and EU governments are cognizant of the strategic significance of Afghanistan , Pakistan and the road to Central Asia , Europe is too weak and lacking military resources to do anything without US leadership and dominance .
Nevertheless , the PRC - led contenders remain apprehensive that the US might realize the real stakes at hand , and , at the last minute , decide to stay .
Therefore , it is in the vital interest of Beijing and Islamabad to expedite the US / NATO withdrawal by facilitating a combination of pressure — “ Taliban ” escalation — and political enticement — “ Taliban ” negotiations — under their tight control .
Adamant on bringing the war to a swift “ closure ” at all cost , the Obama White House is walking straight into this “ Taliban ” trap .

‘ snow house ’
as part of an architectural competition for xella cellular concrete blocks , nicolas dorval - bory architect and emilio marin have developed ‘ snow house ’ , a winter chalet that uses sustainable means to provide home heating .
the project uses xella aerated concrete blocks which are energy - efficient building panels .
using this material combined with its compact square plan helps to reduce the loss of heat .
the house is also built close to the ground with no overhang while the central courtyard is kept open to allow for a significant supply of light and fresh air in the summer .
additional heating is achieved through two systems called the geothermal heat pump and trombe wall .
both work in tandem to first pump fresh cold air from the exterior to later pass through the trombe wall for heating .
during the day , the trombe wall warms the air using a greenhouse effect trapping it between two walls .
at night , the heat stored between the high thermal walls is distributed through the house .
the system is controlled by motorized valves to prevent a reverse flow of air overnight .
the supporting structure of the house is made out of 15 cm xella blocks , lined with a vapor barrier and 10 cm xella panels , with a black waterproof roughcast coating to maximize solar gain and limit the accumulation of snow on the roof .
cold air pumped from the exterior is used to warm the interior using a geothermal pump and trombe wall
sectional
the interior rooms are provided different levels of thermal insulation depending on the activities they are used for .
bedrooms and bathrooms on the south end of the building have a higher indoor temperature than the living room and kitchen facing the north .
this is possible due to the natural slope on which the house sits on .

NOVEMBER 11-- Just in time for Veteran 's Day , a California bank employee is facing federal charges for allegedly masquerading as a decorated Marine and wearing a host of bogus medals , including the Purple Heart , Bronze Star , and Navy Cross .
Steven Burton , 39 , is scheduled to surrender tomorrow in U.S. District Court in Riverside , California ( Burton , who has never served in the armed forces , was named last week in a misdemeanor criminal information charging him with the unauthorized wearing of military medals ) .
According to a search warrant affidavit , Burton 's charade was discovered after an actual Navy commander , Colleen Salonga , ran into him at their high school reunion .
Online records indicate that Salonga and Burton graduated in 1988 from Alhambra High School in Martinez , California ( and that their class 's 20th reunion was last October ) .
Suspicious that Burton was playing dress up , Salonga asked to take a photo with him .
That image , seen at left , was later provided to FBI agents .
A subsequent investigation turned up another photo of Burton in uniform as well as blog postings in which he recounted his " combat experience " and tours in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In the real world , Burton is employed at Rabobank in Palm Springs , California .

Dear Cecil : Dear Cecil :
Why are manhole covers round ?
-- Barry L. , Glendale , Arizona PS : This is no joke .
Cecil replies :
Why are manhole covers round ?
– Barry L. , Glendale , Arizona
PS : This is no joke .
Cecil replies :
Hey , man , the Straight Dope is always serious–it ’s REALITY that ’s a joke .
The commonly told story , which may even be true , is that manhole covers are round so some moron from Streets and Sanitation , or whatever it is they have out there in Glendale , wo n’t be able to drop them accidentally into the manhole .
This may require some thought .
You take your squares , for instance .
A square cover you can tip up on edge and drop through the hole on the diagonal , if you follow me .
Similarly with ovals .
A circular hole , however , will defy the most determined efforts in this regard .
( Bear in mind that there ’s a lip around the inside of the manhole that the cover rests on ; this effectively makes the diameter of the manhole an inch or so less than that of the cover . )
This means manholes are one of the few things in the universe that are absolutely goofproof .
Kinda reassuring , except for one thing .
A circular manhole cover is n’t the only shape that wo n’t fall into the hole .
A cover shaped like an equilateral triangle wo n’t fall in either .
[ Not quite .
See below . ]
The main objections to be raised against a triangular cover are that ( 1 ) it would be pretty tough to roll ; ( 2 ) the corners might tend to pop up when cars drove over them ( I get the latter from my friend David Feldman ’s book , When Do Fish Sleep ? ) ; and ( 3 ) it would look stupid .
Regarding point # 3 , someone has written me claiming the English have triangular manhole covers .
‘ Nuff said .
Almost forgot .
Point # 4 . Circular covers , in addition to the won’t - fall - in angle , have the advantage that you do n’t have to get the corners lined up when dropping them into place , saving God knows how many thousands of seconds of valuable time .
Originally I wrote this as “ man-seconds , ” to which I added the hilarious remark , “ OK , worker - seconds , but how many female sewer workers have YOU seen ? ”
Caught no end of flak from numerous defenders of insulted female sewer workers .
Guess I wo n’t try THAT again .
Anyway , it seems to me that round has got to be the shape of choice .
That said , we do n’t have any definitive statements on this subject from the Manhole Cover Research Institute .
We cannot entirely discount the possibility that the covers are round because someone at the dawn of modern civil engineering discovered he could draw them by tracing around the outside of a penny .
But good enough for now .
NOT SO FAST
The Teeming Millions have pointed out at exasperating length that it ’s not an equilateral triangle that wo n’t fall into the manhole but a Rouleaux triangle – the kind in which each side consists of an arc centered on the opposite vertex ( or at least that ’s one way to do it ) .
A puffy triangle , if you will .
An equilateral triangle can be dropped into the manhole by positioning it so that one of the altitudes is parallel and close to one side of the hole ( you geometry lovers know what I mean ) .
A Rouleaux triangle , however , is a constant - diameter shape , and ca n’t be .
As usual , blame Little Ed. I ’m not saying it ’s his fault , just that you should blame him .

I am not the only one who worried that the introduction of the Human Rights
Act might backfire on those of us who worry about little things like rape , murder , child abuse and prostitution .
Certainly some of the fears many feminists had about fancy lawyers defending all sorts of scum in the name of " rights " proved well founded .
HRA cases have included the right of a man accused of rape to hear details of a complainant 's sexual history for the benefit of his defence and - turned down only after serious deliberation - serial killer Dennis Nielsen to be allowed gay pornography in prison , based on the argument that heterosexual serial killers are allowed theirs .
In countries in which real human rights violations blight the lives of millions , there is confusion about why we westerners are using the act to argue , for example , that a man has the right to sunbathe naked in his own garden .
Is that really the best we can do ?
It 's not all bad news , however .
The British Columbia supreme court in Vancouver recently overturned an earlier decision of the human rights tribunal that Vancouver Rape Relief had breached the human rights code when it refused to allow Kimberley Nixon , a male to female transsexual , to train as a counsellor of female rape victims .
In 2002 , Nixon had won $ 7,500 , the highest amount ever awarded by the tribunal , for injury to " her dignity " .
The arrogance is staggering : having not experienced life as a " woman " until middle age , Nixon assumed " she " would be suitable to counsel women who have chosen to access a service that offers support from women who have suffered similar experiences , not from a man in a dress !
The Rape Relief sisters , who do not believe a surgically constructed vagina and hormonally grown breasts make you a woman , successfully challenged the ruling and , for now at least , the law says that to suffer discrimination as a woman you have to be , er , a woman .
The Equal Opportunities Commission , your best friend if you are a man wanting to get into nightclubs free on Ladies ' Nights , has a lot to learn from this .
Last summer , it supported the case of five male to female transsexuals , only one of whom had disposed of his meat and two veg , on the grounds of sex discrimination after a pub landlord objected to one of them using the women 's toilets .
The claim was rejected , with the judge stating that although he accepted the claimants ' wish to regard themselves as women , a person 's wish " does n't determine what he is " .
Quite .
Call me old - fashioned , but I thought the one battle we feminists won fair and square was to convince at least those left of centre that gender roles are made up .
They are not real .
We play at them .
We develop traditional masculine or feminine traits by being indoctrinated , not because we are biologically programmed to behave in those ways .
Feminism is supposed to be based on the premise that prescriptive gender roles are a cause of women 's oppression .
When I were a lass , new to feminism and lesbianism , I was among the brigade who would sit in the women 's disco wearing vegetarian shoes and staring in disbelief at the butch / femme couples , mainly because they were having a better time than me .
" Oh , but they 're emulating heterosexuality ! " we would gasp in horror as the butch ran her Zippo up the femme 's fishnets .
" What 's the point of being a lesbian if you 're going to behave like that ? "
I look back on them with affection and , yes , nostalgia .
At least those women were women , and had n't gone to gender reassignment clinics to have their breasts sliced off and a penis made out of their beer bellies .
Their attitude was , we 're comfortable in our own skin , let 's be women but subvert what that means .
Could we really have imagined back then that unpicking constructions of gender would result in Kwik - Fit sex changes on offer to all and sundry ?
Twenty years ago , when I worked on an advice line for lesbians , I would take call after call from self - hating , suicidal women who had experienced horrific homophobia .
Thanks to feminism and gay liberation , that situation has altered radically .
What a disgrace , therefore , that our legacy amounts to this : if you are unhappy with the constraints of your gender , do n't challenge them .
If you are tired of being stared at for snogging your same - sex partner in the street , have a sex change .
Where are those who go berserk about the ethics of genetic engineering yet seem not to worry about major , irreversible surgery on healthy bodies ?
Also , those who " transition " seem to become stereotypical in their appearance - fuck - me shoes and birds '- nest hair for the boys ; beards , muscles and tattoos for the girls .
Think about a world inhabited just by transsexuals .
It would look like the set of Grease .
When feminists suggested that the true " gender outlaws " were those who did n't give a toss about conforming to masculine or feminine norms , it sounded so persuasive that even some straight people took it up .
When it got to the stage where my mum was wearing jeans and trainers rather than her usual skirts and heels , I started to feel a bit like the wonderful Daffyd from Little Britain .
Too many straight women looked like they might be lesbians , and I wanted to be the only gay in the village !
To go back to my five men and a toilet , I do n't have a problem with men disposing of their genitals , but it does not make them women , in the same way that shoving a bit of vacuum hose down your 501s does not make you a man .
In the hours following Haiti 's devastating earthquake , CNN , the New York Times and other major news sources adopted a common interpretation for the severe destruction : the 7.0 earthquake was so devastating because it struck an urban area that was extremely over - populated and extremely poor .
Houses " built on top of each other " and constructed by the poor people themselves made for a fragile city .
And the country 's many years of underdevelopment and political turmoil made the Haitian government ill - prepared to respond to such a disaster .
True enough .
But that 's not the whole story .
What 's missing is any explanation of why there are so many Haitians living in and around Port - au - Prince and why so many of them are forced to survive on so little .
Indeed , even when an explanation is ventured , it is often outrageously false such as a former U.S. diplomat 's testimony on CNN that Port - au - Prince 's overpopulation was due to the fact that Haitians , like most Third World people , know nothing of birth control .
It may startle news - hungry Americans to learn that these conditions the American media correctly attributes to magnifying the impact of this tremendous disaster were largely the product of American policies and an American - led development model .
From 1957 - 1971
Haitians lived under the dark shadow of " Papa Doc " Duvalier , a brutal dictator who enjoyed U.S. backing because he was seen by Americans as a reliable anti-Communist .
After his death , Duvalier 's son , Jean - Claude " Baby Doc " became President - for - life at the age of 19 and he ruled Haiti until he was finally overthrown in 1986 .
It was in the 1970s and 1980s that Baby Doc and the United States government and business community worked together to put Haiti and Haiti 's capitol city on track to become what it was on January 12 , 2010 .
After the coronation of Baby Doc , American planners inside and outside the U.S. government initiated their plan to transform Haiti into the " Taiwan of the Caribbean . "
This small , poor country situated conveniently close to the United States was instructed to abandon its agricultural past and develop a robust , export - oriented manufacturing sector .
This , Duvalier and his allies were told , was the way toward modernization and economic development .
From the standpoint of the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) Haiti was the perfect candidate for this neoliberal facelift .
The entrenched poverty of the Haitian masses could be used to force them into low - paying jobs sewing baseballs and assembling other products .
But USAID had plans for the countryside too .
Not only were Haiti 's cities to become exporting bases but so was the countryside , with Haitian agriculture also reshaped along the lines of export - oriented , market - based production .
To accomplish this USAID , along with urban industrialists and large landholders , worked to create agro-processing facilities , even while they increased their practice of dumping surplus agricultural products from the U.S. on the Haitian people .
This " aid " from the Americans , along with the structural changes in the countryside predictably forced Haitian peasants who could no longer survive to migrate to the cities , especially Port - au - Prince where the new manufacturing jobs were supposed to be .
However , when they got there they found there were n't nearly enough manufacturing jobs go around .
The city became more and more crowded .
Slum areas expanded .
And to meet the housing needs of the displaced peasants , quickly and cheaply constructed housing was put up , sometimes placing houses right " on top of each other . "
Before too long , however , American planners and Haitian elites decided that perhaps their development model did n't work so well in Haiti and they abandoned it .
The consequences of these American - led changes remain , however .
When on the afternoon and evening of January 12 , 2010 Haiti experienced that horrible earthquake and round after round of aftershock the destruction was , no doubt , greatly worsened by the very real over - crowding and poverty of Port - au - Prince and the surrounding areas .
But shocked Americans can do more than shake their heads and , with pity , make a donation .
They can confront their own country 's responsibility for the conditions in Port - au - Prince that magnified the earthquake 's impact , and they can acknowledge America 's role in keeping Haiti from achieving meaningful development .
To accept the incomplete story of Haiti offered by CNN and the New York Times is to blame Haitians for being the victims of a scheme that was not of their own making .
As John Milton wrote , " they who have put out the people 's eyes , reproach them of their blindness . "
In her historical piece in the Jan. 10 Camera , Silvia Pettem recounted news stories about how the population of Boulder nearly doubled in the 1950s .
( Growth rate = 6.34 percent per year ; Doubling time = 10.9 years . )
To see what this means , we must look more closely .
First :
In short periods of time modest annual growth rates give startlingly large increases .
The 60 - year average ( 1950 - 2010 ) population growth rate of Boulder of 2.74 percent per year gives doubling in just 25.3 years !
Second :
If the modest 1950s growth rate of 6.34 percent per year continued for another 60 years , Boulder`s population would increase by about 45 times to about 4.7 million people .
Compare this to Los Angeles ( 3.8 Million ) or New York City ( 8.4 Million ) .
Third : Population growth is destroying democracy in Boulder .
In 1950 the population of Boulder was 19,999 people and there were 9 members on the City Council .
Today Boulder`s population is over 100,000 and there are still 9 members on the Council .
So there are now five times as many citizens per Council member as there were sixty years ago ..
Fourth :
The rate of loss of democracy in Boulder is equal to the rate of Boulder`s population growth .
In the 1950s both were about 6.34 percent per year .
Fifth : Population growth is destroying democracy nationally .
The 2000 Census showed that the U.S. population grew 13.2 percent during the decade of the 1990s , but the number of members of the House of Representatives stayed fixed at 435 .
So after the 2000 Census all of the Congressional Districts had to be redrawn in order to increase the number of constituents in every House district by 13.2 percent .
Our national democracy was founded over 200 years ago on the basis of about 57,000 people per representative .
In 1990 the number of constituents per member of the House was about 600,000 .
Sixth :
Taxes have to rise to pay the public costs of population growth .
Some years ago , using data from the 1970 Census , I plotted the per capita annual municipal taxes as a function of the size of the city .
The graph showed that when you went from a city of one population in the U.S. to a city of twice the population , the per capita annual municipal taxes increased by between 20 percent and 25 percent .
So the national data suggest that in the decade of the 1950s municipal annual taxes in Boulder had to rise by about 20 percent plus the rise due to ten years of inflation .
Seventh :
The obvious conclusion is that the population growth does not pay its own way .
The book , “ Better , Not Bigger ” by Eben Fodor ( 1999 ) shows examples of this from all over the U.S.
He shows , for instance , that every new house in Oregon costs the Oregon taxpayers an average of over $ 25,000 .
The Boston Tea Party of 1773 was a rebuke to the British Parliament by colonists who objected to being taxed without representation .
Population growth is raising our taxes and diminishing our representation .
Why don`t today`s “ Tea Parties ” address this issue ?
Eighth :
We wonder why the budget situation in Colorado is so dire .
Politicians will recite a list of all of the contributing factors but they never give the principal reason .
During the go - go growth of the 1990s the rapid population growth caused the tax money to roll in and be spent , but the need for tax - supported public infrastructure rolled in even faster .
Education funding will be just one of the many casualties of Colorado`s population growth of the 1990s .
There`s a time to grow .
If an infant does not grow , it`s a tragedy .
But for adults , continued growth is either obesity or cancer .

Here 's a blast from the past :
In the early 1980s , an industrial design firm helped create some early prototypes of tablets for a young Steve Jobs .
The tablet was called " Bashful , " in reference to the dwarf in the fairy tale Snow White .
Bashful was created alongside the Apple IIe as an extension of the Snow White industrial - design language that Apple used from 1984 to 1990 .
Now Frog Design , the firm that created those mock - ups , has unearthed some photos from its archives that show what the tablet might have looked like more than 25 years ago .
With Apple expected to unveil its long - awaited tablet device on Wednesday , it seems like a good time to bring these photos out of the archives , Frog Design 's people thought .
There are none of the sleek contours that characterize Apple 's products today .
But you can still see the emphasis on ease - of - use and a slim profile ( relatively speaking , anyway ) .
And it shows how long Jobs has been mulling the idea of bringing a tablet to market .
Variations of the Bashful tablet included one with an attached keyboard and one with a floppy - disk drive and a handle for portability .
Some of the tablet prototypes included a stylus .
And one concept even had an attached phone .
Frog Design also helped create the Apple IIc , the fourth in the wildly popular Apple II line of personal computers .
The Bashfuls never made it to market , and the prototypes are probably still in the hidden , underground storage vaults of Apple or Frog Design .
Take a look at more photos of the prototype tablets below .

Houston firefighters at Station 54 were called downtown Tuesday to be interviewed by a private law firm about why they do n't want a female firefighter to return to the firehouse after a racist and sexist graffiti incident that occurred last summer .
City attorney Arturo Michel said the city is paying Haynes and Boone $ 20,000 to conduct a “ fact - finding ” effort to hear why some of the firefighters who confronted Jane Draycott last month told her they did n't trust her or want her back .
“ What they 're doing is really trying to find out what people believe and why in Station 54 , ” Michel said .
“ The reason is to try to improve the environment . ”
Michel said the interviews are not disciplinary .
Last summer , Draycott and firefighter Paula Keyes left Station 54 after finding racist and sexist graffiti scrawled on the walls of their dorm after the two complained for months of harassment .
Keyes is back at work at another station .
When Draycott tried to return on Jan. 13 , a captain began reading a list of grievances about why he and others did not want her to return to the station .
Draycott said the members of the station also confronted her with “ insulting ” rumors about why they , too , did not want her to return and even questioned her sanity in front of several commanding officers , including then - Fire Chief Phil Boriskie .
Mayor Annise Parker called the confrontation a display of “ poor judgment ” on the part of Boriskie and members of the command staff who were present .
A week later , Boriskie resigned as chief .
The law firm is only interviewing Station 54 firefighters who publicly aired an opinion last month about why they did not want Draycott to return , Michel said .
“ The goal is to basically have a work environment at 54 where the firefighters can work together and trust one another and have Ms. Draycott return there if that is what she chooses sometime in the future , ” Michel said .

John Terry 's lawyers had secured the injunction last week An injunction stopping the media from reporting allegations about England football captain John Terry 's private life has been lifted by the High Court .
Mr Justice Tugendhat removed the order , which banned reports about married Terry 's alleged affair with an England team - mate 's ex-girlfriend .
The Chelsea star is alleged to have had an affair with French model Vanessa Perroncel , ex-partner of Wayne Bridge .
An interim order had been granted at a private hearing in London last Friday .
It had banned publication of details of the alleged relationship and barred the use of photographs relating to it .
However , the judge said the information was in " wide circulation amongst those involved in the sport in question , including agents and others , and not just amongst those directly engaged in the sport " .
Justice Tugendhat said he thought Terry 's real concern was the effect on his sponsorship contracts , in which case , payment of damages would be an adequate remedy if he succeeded at trial .
The judge said : " Freedom to live as one chooses is one of the most valuable freedoms , but so is the freedom to criticise " .
John Terry and Wayne Bridge played together at Chelsea until Wayne Bridge moved to Manchester City in 2008 .
It has not been revealed when the affair is alleged to have taken place .
There has been more prior restraint on freedom of speech in Britain than in any other democratic country in the world
Tom Crone , News of the World
FA silent on Terry Lawyers for Terry had obtained the injunction a week ago , after learning that the News of the World planned to write about him .
BBC media correspondent Torin Douglas said the existence of these so - called super - injunctions had become more widely known recently .
He said : " Lawyers for the oil trading firm Trafigura stopped a parliamentary question being reported by the Guardian , until its identity became widely known via the Twitter social network .
" This ruling recognises the right of media to report . "
News of the World legal manager Tom Crone welcomed the decision as " a long overdue breath of fresh air and common sense " .
" Over recent years , there has been more prior restraint on freedom of speech in Britain than in any other democratic country in the world , " he said .
" Gagging orders like the one sought by John Terry have been granted to numerous other Premier League footballers and assorted celebrities . "
He said he hoped the ruling would lead to " a fundamental reassessment of our draconian privacy laws " .
A Chelsea spokesman said : " This is a personal matter for John Terry .
The club will give John and his family all the support they need in dealing with it . "
Terry , 29 , married childhood sweetheart Toni Poole in 2007 and is the father of twins .
He has captained the England team since August 2006 , when he took over from David Beckham .
The FA has declined to comment .

The following excerpts are from letters written by border patrol guard Jonathon Yankee , from the game Homeland Defense : National Security Patrol .
The game is available for $ 20 from Best Buy .
Do not buy it .
Day 1 :
Well Mom , I made it .
I have successfully completed all the training necessary to be a Border Patrol Guard for the National Security Patrol !
As a member of the NSP , we ’ve got all sorts of duties , but basically we ’re the first line of defense against all of the illegal immigrants trying to steal our free air by breathing it .
Not much to say for today .
We ’re basically just waiting to find out what our orders are going to be .
Until we know where we ’re stationed , we ’ve been practicing standing still and not noticing things happening directly in front of us .
It ’s tough .
Any way , it ’s been a long day .
I better say good night .
Day 2 :
We got our orders !
I ’ve heard the fraternity of smugglers is a pretty bad bunch , so I ’m going to make sure I check each car from Mexico super carefully , and that I pretend to check every car from the U.S.A. as well as I can , given the fact that , well , you know .
I mean , it ’s wrong to say it , but …you know .
Love you , Mom !
Tell Dad not to touch my guns while I ’m away !
As soon as I get a gun rack set up in my new apartment , I ’ll have you mail those down , unless the fascists in the U.S. Mail Department wo n’t let you mail guns nowadays .
Anyway , time to Accept My Mission and keep the borders safe !
Day 3 :
First day on the job .
Here ’s a photo :
I ’ve got to level with you , Mom .
The first day did n’t go so well .
First off , my co-workers are a little weird .
Take Stan , for instance .
He works at the patrol booth opposite me .
So he checks all the cars coming from Mexico to the U.S.
That ’s what we in the Border Patrol biz call “ the awesome job , ” because it ’s awesome .
So we ’re standing at our booths , waiting .
A car shows up at Stan ’s checkpoint .
He just waits .
“ Hey Stan , you going to let that guy through , or not ? ”
He looked at me blankly for a while , and then started running away from his booth , around the road to my side , and then just stops .
This Mexican guy is still waiting in his car to go through the checkpoint , but now Stan is over on my side of the road .
I tell him to get back to his post , which he does , but real slow .
And I mean REAL slow , and walking funny , like he had dropped a dump in his pants or something .
But here ’s the thing : by this point , there was a car waiting in my lane to get checked through ( just a routine procedure , Americans are n’t terrorists , of course , only terrorists are terrorists ) .
So Stan , rather than walk around the car , walks right through the hood of the car !
Now there ’s a bunch of cars waiting in my lane , so I realize I ’ve got to put them through .
I walk up to the patrol booth and try to open the gate , but I can ’t .
I mean , there ’s just no button or anything to click to open the gate .
So I walk around for a little while , as the cars pile up .
We start getting these messages that cars are waiting too long at the border , and we ’re getting fined for it , so Stan and I are both really struggling hard to get our gates open .
I try everything I can think of : walking up to it , walking next to it , touching it , but nothing helps .
I decide to ignore the cars and check out this guy who was standing near the booth .
As soon as I do , however , this lady walks right through him !
I think she might have been a ghost .
After I let that guy go , this weird ghost lady was still standing there .
Her papers were in order , but seeing as she was a ghost , and a pretty attractive one at that , I decided to pat her down .
The cars were still backed up , but since neither of us knew how to open the gates , Stan and I just called it a day .
Day 4 :
It ’s great to hear that little Lou Dobbs had puppies !
If you have n’t named them yet , then we should name them : “ Freedom , ” “ Democracy , ” “ Eagle , ” “ Ashcroft , ” and “ Threat Level Indicator Orange . ”
Name the runt “ Civil Liberties , ” although I ’m guessing that Lou Dobbs will eat her , so tell Peggy Sue not to get too attached to that one .
Hey , I have n’t shown you guys where we live yet !
Here ’s a picture of our facilities .
For some reason , our facilities are really far away from the actual border , so when we arrest people it takes a long time to walk them to the holding pen , especially since we walk pretty slowly , and sometimes in random directions .
Today was better .
I read in the manual that you can set the gates to automatically open , so that ’s what we did .
We ended up letting everyone go through , but at least we did n’t get any fines for letting cars sit for too long .
We got some messages that the police had arrested some smugglers that had crossed the border at our checkpoint .
I think they were trying to make us feel bad about it , but if the police arrested them , then that ’s good , right ?
No harm , no foul ?
Day 5 :
Time to hire some new recruits .
The boss is letting me look over the résumés of two of the candidates .
First up we ’ve got Neil Blake .
Here ’s what I like about him : he ’s got good dexterity , which will come in handy when he has to type up reports or do sleight - of - hand tricks .
He also left “ a booming career in novelty garden ornament sales , ” so he ’s used to dealing with weirdos .
He ’s from Arizona , so he ’s comfortable with the locale .
What I do n’t like :
He ’s only got an awareness of 20 , which is pretty low .
Stan has an awareness of 72 , and he did n’t even notice that carload full of bandolier - covered illegals who rolled by the other day .
( I asked them if they had any paperwork , and they replied “ Badges ?
We do n’t need no stinkin ’ badges ! ”
I pointed out that I had n’t mentioned badges , only paperwork , but they were already speeding off towards Washington D.C. , pistols firing into the air .
When I asked Stan about it , he said “ huh ? ” and walked directly through a tree . )
I also do n’t like that Neil only answered the call of patriotism AFTER his wife left him .
Why not before , Neil ?
The life of a NSP agent is fraught with danger , but if Patriotism calls , you better answer the phone as lickety - damn - split as you can .
Also , during the interview he cried a lot .
Here ’s the other candidate , Jacob Clark :
What I like : he recognized that being an ER medic is a waste - of - time , dead - end job that will never help anybody , and that the border patrol is where all the real action and glory are .
He ’s also smart and honest , which will come in handy in some way or another that is n’t entirely clear to me .
( Maybe he can figure out how to open the gate manually . )
What I do n’t like : Low stamina .
Most of this job is about walking slowly for no particular reason , and then breaking out into a brisk jog when it ’s unnecessary .
If he ca n’t do that , or if he ca n’t make the inexplicably long walk from the border to our barracks without stopping to take a rest … well , that could be trouble .
In the end , I hired both of them .
They ’re both standing outside HQ , because I do n’t know how to have them get guns from the armory .
They tried all the usual things ( walking up to it , walking near it , and touching it ) , but none of them worked .
Day 6 :
I finally feel like a real Border Patrol Guard , Mom .
I am one of the people that make NSP amazing .
Today , in fact , I responded quickly to our worst emergency yet :
Luckily , we all knew exactly what to do .
So that ’s it for today , Mom .
Maybe tomorrow we ’ll figure out how to use the guns and tazers .
Until then , love you !

Enlarge By Derick E. Hingle , US Presswire Derek Dooley will become the head coach at Tennessee after going 17 - 20 in three seasons as head coach at Louisiana Tech .
KNOXVILLE , Tenn .
( AP )  Derek Dooley has the Southern accent , the coaching pedigree and is doing his best to reassure Tennessee fans their new coach appreciates where he 's now working .
" How can you ask for anything more than the University of Tennessee ? " Dooley said Friday .
The son of Georgia legend Vince Dooley was introduced as the Vols ' second new head coach in 14 months , replacing Lane Kiffin days after he bolted for Southern California .
Among his first challenges will be reassuring fans and players that he wants to be at Tennessee .
CAMPUS RIVALRY : Cutcliffe stays at Duke " The times of worrying about what happened is over , " Dooley said .
Dooley talked about how he learned early that Tennessee represented the essence of college football , and remembers watching the weekly television shows of former coaches Johnny Majors and Phillip Fulmer .
He also promised he will not try to sell Tennessee in a sound bite , perhaps taking a shot at Kiffin , who was reprimanded by the Southeastern Conference for brash comments .
" Everything we 're going to do is going to be done with a foundation of integrity with every aspect of the program , " Dooley said .
" We 're going to represent this institution with class on and off the field . "
Dooley was offered the job late Friday afternoon , resigned as coach and athletic director of Louisiana Tech , and flew into Knoxville for the late news conference .
He brings along a son with a name popular in Tennessee — Peyton — just like Kiffin , who named his young son Knox after taking the Vols ' job in December 2008 .
" I am finally happy to be in a state where Peyton will be well received , " Dooley said of his 8 - year - old son , whose name conjures memories of Vols ' star four - time NFL MVP Peyton Manning .
Like his predecessor , Dooley comes with a short head coaching resume .
He went 17 - 20 in three seasons at Louisiana Tech and was the only coach in major college football to also serve as the athletic director .
He holds a law degree and previously worked for several years under Nick Saban at LSU and with the Miami Dolphins .
Tennessee athletic director Mike Hamilton ( FSY ) said Dooley agreed that coaching the Vols is a destination job .
He praised him for a five - year tutelage under Saban and for helping the current Alabama coach land two No. 1 recruiting classes at LSU .
" I 've talked to a number of folks over the past 24 hours , " Hamilton said .
" He 's been described as very intelligent , intense , disciplined , hard - nosed , a tenacious recruiter , a family guy and extremely well - organized . "
The Volunteers introduced him three nights after Kiffin abruptly quit , bolting to USC only 14 months into his tenure with the Vols .
Dooley was hired from a list of candidates believed to include Texas defensive coordinator Will Muschamp , Air Force coach Troy Calhoun , Duke coach David Cutcliffe and Utah coach Kyle Whittingham .
Dooley 's limited head coaching experience — like Kiffin , whose only head coaching stint had been a brief , bad one with the Oakland Raiders — makes him a risky pick .
But the new coach 's uncle , former North Carolina and Virginia Tech coach Bill Dooley , voiced his support .
" He 'll do well anywhere he goes , and at Tennessee , he would do very well , " Bill Dooley said in a phone interview from his home in Wilmington , N.C.
" When you get a law degree , it gives you a little notch up .
He 's got his feet on the ground .
He 's levelheaded .
Dooley 's father coached at rival Georgia from 1964 - 88 and won the 1980 national title .
He did not return a call to his cellphone seeking comment , but his son said his father is excited .
Derek Dooley worked as LSU 's recruiting coordinator and tight ends coach from 2000 through 2003 's signing day , landing classes rated No. 1 in 2001 and '03 .
He coached LSU 's running backs and special teams in 2003 - 04 .
He followed Saban to the Dolphins as tight ends coach in 2005 before leaving for Louisiana Tech in December 2006 .
Dooley was a receiver in college at Virginia .
After earning his law degree from Georgia , he worked as an attorney for two years before starting his coaching career at Georgia in 1996 as a graduate assistant .
He also worked as assistant recruiting coordinator at SMU from 1997 - 99 until being hired by Saban .
He went to Louisiana Tech in December 2006 as one of the youngest coaches in the Football Bowl Subdivision and added the athletic director title in March 2008 .
Dooley led the Bulldogs to their first bowl victory in more than three decades , beating Northern Illinois in the 2008 Independence Bowl .
" We are grateful for the contributions that Derek made to Louisiana Tech Athletics and we wish him luck in his new position , " Louisiana Tech President Dan Reneau said .

We were fortunate enough to receive a scalding take down of Dick Ebersol from a former NBC Sports employee who took " great offense " when his ex-boss called Conan O'Brien an " astounding failure . "
Here 's his ( anonymous ) counter - argument .
Advertisement
By now , everyone 's heard about Dick Ebersol 's blistering critique of embattled late - night talk show host Conan O'Brien .
From high atop his 30 Rock tower perch , Ebersol said it was " chicken - hearted and gutless " of O'Brien to blame " a guy he could n't beat in the ratings , " and characterized the situation as " an astounding failure by Conan . "
It seems the dictator of NBC Sports is immune to any return fire , but the irony of Ebersol 's comments is the definition of ego run amok .
Advertisement
" Astounding failure " would be a fair term for his own recent blunder .
Just days before Ebersol lobbed grenades at a man already negotiating terms of surrender ( talk about chicken - hearted and gutless ! ) , it was announced that his sports unit would lose millions on the Olympics — up to and possibly over $ 200 million , according to parent company GE .
Perhaps most tellingly , the financial disaster is not due to advertising sales in the soft economy .
In fact , Ebersol himself admitted it was due to overpaying for broadcast rights , a decision for which he is ultimately responsible .
NBC under Ebersol 's direction paid $ 820 million for the 2010 Winter Olympics .
Keep in mind that Major League Baseball receives about $ 670 million a year in TV rights fees for the entire season and the NBA receives about $ 930 million a year .

While the decision to pay such a staggering sum for a two - week event can be debated — and by the way , that monstrous price tag does n't even include a worldwide Olympic sponsorship fee approaching nine figures that also gets added to the bill — a look at Ebersol 's other NBC initiatives during the last decade show an executive clearly out of touch with the changing tastes of the sports world and the world at large .
Let 's take a look at some of Ebersol 's recent stretch of questionable decisions :
XFL
In 2001 , Ebersol started off the decade with a mind - blowing decision .
Incredibly , he decided to partner with contoversial pro wrestling magnate Vince McMahon on a legitimate sports league .
Unsurprisingly , within weeks , the football league had set a record for the lowest primetime ratings ever on a major network .
NBC 's loss for the 10 - week season was around $ 35 million .

Online
If there 's any question about his lack of long - term vision and cluelessness regarding contemporary culture , perhaps most indicative is the fact that NBC Sports did n't get around to launching its own sports site until the tail end of 2006 .
Think about that for a second .
By then , Youtube and Facebook were already major online destinations and over half the homes in the country had access to high - speed internet connections , yet NBC Sports did n't have its own site !
Meanwhile , sports sites they would soon be competing with , including ESPN.com , Yahoo.com and FoxSports.com , were already drawing over 10 million monthly loyal unique visitors each .
Not surprisingly , NBC Sports has never caught up .

AFL
It seems to be forgotten to history , but from 2003 - 2006 , the major network aired a decidedly minor sport , hoping it would grow into a valuable sports property .
Not surprisingly , the ratings were miniscule with the average rating around 1.00 for the four - year run before the project was abandoned .
The only bright side ?
NBC did n't pay any rights fees .
( But neither did it generate much profit . )

Universal Sports
Because there 's such a clamoring for Olympic sports in non-Olympic years , NBC Sports launched a cable network devoted exclusively to those events .
Ever clamor for Alpine skiing in July ?
They 've got you covered .
Wait , what ?
You did n't know this channel even existed ?
Exactly .

Notre Dame
In 2008 , NBC renewed its TV contract with Notre Dame football .
Though the deal is relatively cheap at roughly $ 9 million a year , Notre Dame 's increasing irrelevance as a college football power has been illustrated in the ratings .
The Irish have only finished a season ranked 10th or higher just 3 times in the 19 years they 've been on NBC .
Regardless of Notre Dame 's storied history , NBC is essentially granting a perpetual national showcase to a mid-tier program in hopes that it will rise again .
Admittedly , this is the least offensive decision on this list .
Advertisement
Olympics
While the Olympics have been a financial success for NBC up until this year 's Winter Games , the critical reception is a whole other story .
The network has been repeatedly lambasted for its coverage , showing scores of important and popular events on tape delay , including some of Michael Phelps ' historic medal chase in 2008 .
With all of NBC 's cable partners including USA , MSNBC and more participating in the Olympics broadcasting , how does this happen ?

Since the start of 2000 , NBC Sports under Ebersol 's watch :
* Lost MLB rights
* Lost NBA rights
* Lost NASCAR rights
* Became shut out of broadcasting college Bowl games
* Has n't broadcast a single college basketball game in a very long time

In fact , the only Ebersol decision that can be considered an overwhelming success in the last decade is returning the NFL to the network .
Even with that , however , there are plenty of complaints about their stale game presentation and an overload of personalities , featuring an incredible 10 hosts and analysts on their Football Night in America pre-game program alone .
Incredibly , despite all this , Comcast is still reportedly set to install Ebersol as the head of its sports division when the NBC / Comcast merger is completed .
Much like the guy he is backing in the Late Night Wars , Ebersol is lucky enough to be failing upward .
Of course he 's going to be on Team Leno ; they 're essentially the same character in alternate NBC worlds .
He 's got his opinion , but when you talk about " astounding failures , " and NBC , Ebersol could have well been describing himself .

The burka and other face - covering veils worn by Muslim women should be banned , the UK Independence Party says .
Ex -UKIP leader Nigel Farage , who leads UKIP 's 13 MEPs in Brussels , told the BBC's Politics
Show they were a symbol of an " increasingly divided Britain " .
He also said they " oppressed " women and were a potential security threat .
But Schools Secretary Ed Balls said it was " not British " to tell people what to wear in the street , and accused UKIP of indulging in " unpleasant politics " .
Some European countries , including France , are debating banning the burka , but the issue has sparked controversy when it has been raised in the UK .
UKIP is the first British party to call for a total ban , after the BNP called for it to be banned in Britain 's schools .
' Different culture ' But Mr Farage said : " I ca n't go into a bank with a motorcycle helmet on .
I can't wear a balaclava going round the District and Circle line .
As long as they are not imposing it on anybody else they should have the right to wear it
Salma Yaqoob , Respect leader " What we are saying is , this is a symbol .
It 's a symbol of something that is used to oppress women .
It is a symbol of an increasingly divided Britain .
" And the real worry - and it is n't just about what people wear - the real worry is that we are heading towards a situation where many of our cities are ghettoised and there is even talk about Sharia law becoming part of British culture . "
A " different " culture was " being forced on parts of Britain and nobody wants that " , added Mr Farage , but he denied the policy was an attempt to grab votes from the BNP , insisting it had " nothing to do with the BNP " .
" There is nothing extreme or radical or ridiculous about this , but we can't go on living in a divided society , " he told The Politics Show .
He said his party was seeking to ban " covering of the face in public places and public buildings " but said it had not yet worked out such a ban would be enforced .
Mr Balls said he was not surprised by Mr Farage 's latest policy announcement , but he said no " sensible " or " mainstream " party in Britain would back a ban on face veils .
' Freedom of speech '
He told The Politics Show : " I would n't want to be part of a religion myself where we said to women and girls you have to wear a veil , but I also would not want to be in the kind of society where people were told how to dress when they walked down the streets .
" So the idea that we would tell people that you cannot wear a veil in public , I think that 's not British , it 's unfair , it 's not consistent with our traditions of liberty and freedom . "
Salma Yaqoob , leader of the anti-war Respect party , also criticised UKIP 's proposed ban on the burka .
" I certainly would n't want to wear it myself , but then to take it to a step where they are going to ban it because I feel uncomfortable with it is something I would say is very un -British because the British way of life is ' live and let live ' , freedom of speech , freedom of worship , " she said .
" As long as they are not imposing it on anybody else they should have the right to wear it . "
UKIP came second in last year 's European elections , ahead of the Labour Party , but Mr Farage quit as leader to concentrate on trying to become the party 's first MP at Westminster .
His successor , Lord Pearson , has said he wants to step up the party 's campaign against radical Islam .
He told the Times the party was taking legal advice on how the burka , or any veil covering a woman 's face , could be banned in public places and in private buildings such as airports .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said the full burka is " not welcome " in France , but did not explicitly call for a ban , saying " no one should feel stigmatised " by any eventual law .
A French parliamentary report on the issue is due out at the end of January .

The topic of Goldman frontrunning clients using its prop desk , which has long bothered Zero Hedge , and which in the past received Goldman 's vehement refutation , seems to have resurfaced , and to have proven our initial speculations correct .
Jane Lattin , assistant to Thomas Mazarakis , head of fundamental strategies , sent out an email to clients earlier , notifying them that the firm in the past has traded ahead of them in its Fundamental Strategies Group , aka its Prop Trading desk , which is , by definition , frontrunning : " The Fundamental Strategies Group is a group of cross-capital structure desk analysts employed by our Securities Divisions to assist our traders .
They develop Trading Ideas in conjunction with traders .
We may trade , and may have existing positions , based on Trading Ideas before we have discussed those Trading Ideas with you .
We may continue to act on Trading Ideas , and may trade out of any position , based on Trading Ideas , at any time after we have discussed them with you .
We will also discuss Trading Ideas with other clients , both before and after we have discussed them with you . "
This answers our repeated queries from July as to whether Goldman is legally front - running its clients for its own prop positions .
Full Goldman letter :

We may from time to time discuss with you Trading Ideas generated by our Fundamental Strategies Group .
As part of our commitment to managing conflicts of interest appropriately , this message is to explain how the Fundamental Strategies Group interacts with other parts of our organisation and how that impacts on the Trading Ideas .

For those who may not recall , Zero Hedge queried the following on July 1 , 2009 :
Everyone who is anyone on Wall Street has at some point used the Goldman 360 portal whether for research , news , keeping a track of prime brokerage portfolio or , disturbingly , for trading , via the REDI Plus 9.0 platform ( now loaded with enhanced algo trading features to make life for you , dear soon to be frontran Goldman client , so much easier ) .
A second widely accepted Wall Street concept is that a disclaimer is the last thing that anyone reads , if ever .
Yet after taking a close look at the Goldman disclaimer for the 360 portal , which is an umbrella waiver or all downstream websites , including REDI , one discovers the following gem :
Monitoring by GS : Your use of the products and services on this Web site may be monitored by GS , and that the resultant information may be used by GS for its internal business purposes or in accordance with the rules of any applicable
regulatory or self - regulatory organization .
One second : by using Goldman 360 a client voluntarily allows Goldman to provide keystroke by keystroke data of everything the client does , even if that includes launching trades via REDI , to Goldman for the internal business purposes .
The third thing everyone on Wall Street agrees on is that " internal business purposes " usually ( and in Goldman 's case , almost exclusively ) means proprietary trading .
Are Goldman 360 clients ( in ) voluntarily signing off a release to be front ran by Goldman on any portal - based trade ?
Could Goldman please clarify just what " internal business purposes " means in the context of this overarching disclaimer , and also whether Goldman has ever actually used 360 submitted information in the decision making process of its prop trading desk ?
Lucas Van Pragg : the floor is yours .
Update : several readers have presented some other Goldman Sachs and Spear , Leeds and Kellogg form documents that contain an even more crypitc warning in section 4 ( f ) in Use Of Services :
You acknowledge that we may monitor your use of the Services for our own purposes ( and not for your benefit ) .
We may use the resulting information for internal business purposes or in accordance with the rules of any applicable regulatory or self - regulatory body and in compliance with applicable law and regulation .
NOT FOR YOUR BENEFIT ?
I mean , come on , how more clearer does it need to get .
The post promptly solicited the following response from Goldman Sachs :
Dear Mr Durbin [ sic ] :
This is in response to your recent blog about our web site disclaimer .
It is quite usual for websites to have disclaimers that refer to the monitoring of site usage .
Most web sites , including yours we noticed , track usage by their visitors .
This is primarily used for marketing and to help inform decision about enhancing content .
Your suggestion that we monitor our web site to facilitate front - running is untrue and offensive .
Sincerely
Ed Canaday
Vice President
Goldman , Sachs & Co .

This was followed by Marla 's counterresponse :
Dear Mr. Canady :
Thanks for your quick reply .
For your future reference , the correct spelling for " Tyler " is " Tyler Durden . "
( A re-viewing of " Fight Club " might be in order , but I know Goldman VPs probably rarely have time for such luxuries ) .
Obviously , we want to make sure we have our facts correct so I am pleased to see your email .
Perhaps you can lay to rest some questions we have for the record :
1. Indeed , data use disclaimers are a common feature on most websites .
Still , I think you will agree that where usage patterns are so directly linked with potential investment activity and customer intentions it is a bit unusual not to have a more explicit description of the kind of use Goldman intends here .
This is particularly so where customer attitudes are concerned , and appearances are important .
" Internal business purposes " is a bit vague in this respect , do n't you find ?
This seems unlike Goldman , usually a firm known for very careful attention to detail .
Why is a more specific description of such purposes not included ?
I would think that easier than explaining the matter repeatedly to random bloggers ( and customers ) .
2 . I notice that you have not taken the opportunity to address similar disclaimer language in the form contracts used by Goldman and Spear , Leeds and Kellogg .
Was this omission intentional or an oversight ?
( For your reference you can find the language we are curious about here : http://www.zerohedge.com/node/12083).
" You acknowledge that we may monitor your use of the Services for our own purposes ( and not for your benefit ) .
We may use the resulting information for internal business purposes or in accordance with the rules of any applicable regulatory or self - regulatory body and in compliance with applicable law and regulation . "
Not to be a stickler , but the drafting here seems quite careless .
Note the differing terms between the website disclaimer " ... the resultant information may be used by GS for its internal business purposes OR in accordance with the rules of any applicable regulatory or self - regulatory organization .... " ( emphasis added ) and the form disclaimer " ... we may use the resulting information for internal business purposes or in accordance with the rules of any applicable regulatory or self - regulatory body AND in compliance with applicable law and regulation .... " ( emphasis added ) .
As a reformed legal professional myself , this seems a bit sloppy to me .
Can you comment on the language and in particular why a more explicit definition of " internal business purposes " is not included ?
3 . I also notice that you do not specifically address our question :
" ... has Goldman has ever actually used 360 submitted information in the decision making process of its prop trading desk ? "
Could you give us a response there ?
Perhaps you might augment that to include the decision making process of any Goldman investment decisions rather than just the prop desk and all information Goldman collects about 360 users .
And lastly , while we have your attention , we were hoping you could make a statement for Zero Hedge and its readers on the long discussed topic on our pages regarding Goldman Sachs ' effective monopolization of Principal Program Trading in the New York Stock Exchange .
In other venues you have attributed this domination solely to Goldman 's selection as the one and only SLP currently used by the NYSE .
Would you care to elaborate how that fits in with the NYSE 's upcoming changes to their DPTR ( http://www.zerohedge.com/node/11769)
specifically as pertaining to J and K account type indicators .
Was Goldman in any way consulted in the making of this decision by the NYSE ?
Did Goldman have any direct communication with the SEC on this issue ?
Thanks for your help with these matters .
As an aside , if there is a contact at Goldman we can routinely direct these questions to that might be helpful for both of us going forward .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Best Regards ,

After all the talk of Flash Player 10.1 and what it does to gadgets ' battery lives , the folks at FlashMobileBlog decided to take the old - fashioned approach to finding out how the Google Nexus is affected : Playing a lot of videos .

They found that " video can be played for well over 3 hours over Wi -Fi from YouTube in H.264 ( Baseline 1.2 ) . "
One 's gotta wonder whether this is acceptable battery consumption or not , but the big idea is that we can extend that time by playing with configurations ( backlight , Wi - Fi vs 3G , etc ) and encouraging the availability of optimized content .
You can read more about what content providers can do to optimize content and about the various configurations tested by FlashMobileBlog at their site .

So I feel like a really out - of - touch Asian right now because I have no idea when the Lunar New Year is suppose to be .
I mean , I already got my New Year ’s money , so I did n’t really need to keep track .
Hehhehhh …
But year of the rabbit man .
That ’s cool .
I ca n’t wait for year of the dragon because we be dominating yo .
Hope you ’re kind enough to excuse my weird ramblings right now .
I ’m a bit confused spending my time between high school and college .
Imagine the transition I have to make daily !
It ’s frightening .
My students scream “ Ms. Gee ! Ms. Gee ! ” and I wo n’t hear them until I stop and think ‘ Oh yeah …
That ’s me . “
I ’m still not used to being called Ms. Gee yet .
Oh then today a student said " Cuz he ’s a dick ” in reference to one of the characters from Their Eyes Were Watching God and my cooperating teacher took him out of the class for a little chat .
I thought it was freaking hilarious .
Damn , I got lots to learn it seems .
So anyway , the real reason for this post is to introduce the cool things I ’m looking forward to :)
These are events and projects that I am actually involved in and attending !
1. Hibakusha : Animated Short Film by Steve Nguyen & Choz Belen
Everyone involved in this project –the survivor , the directors , the supporters –is super passionate , which makes it so inspirational .
I ’m really looking forward to it .
Like them on facebook here !
Or you can look to your right and I have an app for that .
Wrd .
2. ECAASU : East Cost Asian American Student Union
For once , ECAASU is coming to me !
Although I always did enjoy driving down with my friends to where ever and staying at a hotel for the night .
Wait–it ’s really not as exciting as that sounds … although the conference is indeed very exciting in all of its college madness Asian invasion kind of way .
3. BANANA 2
Anyone watch the new Fringe episode ?
Banana … get it ?
Anyway , it ’s interesting that I ’m attending two conferences in the span of a week .
I ’m looking forward to learning a lot :D
New legislation outlaws employment discrimination on many grounds Churches have warned new equality laws could force them to go against their faith when hiring staff .
They say the Equality Bill may force them to employ sexually active gay people and transsexuals when hiring staff other than priests or ministers .
Churches currently have special status allowing them to turn down certain candidates for ministers or priests .
The government says it is not trying to narrow the churches ' ability to employ lay people who share their values .
The Equality Bill - which is due to be debated in the House of Lords on Monday - would allow churches to avoid appointing homosexuals to clerical roles .
However , some bishops claim that they could lose the right to ensure other important staff - such as key representative and teaching roles - had lifestyles compatible with church beliefs .
Three Anglican bishops have written to members of the House of Lords , appealing to them to vote against what they see as a weakening of the churches ' special status under the Equality Bill .
Unless the present drafting of the bill is changed , churches and other faiths will find themselves more vulnerable to legal challenge than under the current law
Bishops ' statement A statement was issued on behalf of the Bishop of Winchester , the Right Reverend Michael Scott - Joynt , the Bishop of Exeter , the Right Reverend Michael Langrish , who is Chair of the Churches Legislation Advisory Service , and the Bishop of Chester , the Right Reverend Peter Forster .
They said the issue involved striking " the right balance between the rights and responsibilities of different groups to be protected from harassment and unfair discrimination and the rights of churches and religious organisations to appoint and employ people consistently with their guiding doctrine and ethos " .
The statement went on : " The Christian churches , alongside many other faiths , support the Equality Bill 's wider aims in promoting fairness in society and improving redress for those who have suffered unjust treatment .
" However , unless the present drafting of the Bill is changed , churches and other faiths will find themselves more vulnerable to legal challenge than under the current law .
"
Churches are allowed to turn down candidates for jobs as ministers or priests if they are actively homosexual or have changed their gender , or if they are women .
' Unreasonable ' position Bishops claim that the exemption currently extends to key staff such as youth workers or the heads of Catholic schools .
They say that changes proposed by the government would remove it .
Keith Porteous Wood from the National Secular Society believes the bishops ' position is " entirely unreasonable " .
He told BBC News : " For every discrimination there 's a victim , and it seems entirely unreasonable that the churches should be permitted to discriminate , on grounds of sexual orientation , against administrative staff , janitors , other ancillary staff - given that an EU directive does not permit them to be discriminated against . "
Meanwhile , a Church of England spokesman looked forward to the bill being discussed .
He said : " The Lords Spiritual play a valuable role in politics in the UK and the debate will be further enriched by the opinions of others in the House of Lords . "

This week we 've heard it from everyone from a Ugandan Pastor to another California Beauty Queen , Miss Beverly Hills 2010 Lauren Ashley .
And despite them both saying they ' do n't hate gay people ' , there 's not much love in saying I should have ' blood upon me . '
That 's not really a debatable point .
This may come as a shock to the " hate the sin , love the sinner " set , but by quoting that verse , it 's not God saying that gays should be put to death - it 's YOU .
It 's not simply a personal religious view or a debatable " political difference " or a great talking point .
YOU are saying that I should be put to death .
If man lies with a man as he would lie with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination .
They shall surely be put to death and their blood shall be upon them .
Alright .
Let 's get one thing straight , fundie homophobes - you do n't get a pass when you " quote " the Leviticus Bible verse saying :
Of course we 've all heard that Leviticus quote in every debate about homosexuality and LGBT rights that comes up .
Everyone from Focus on the Family to politicians to Westboro Baptist Church throws that verse up as a bump - sticker quote that explains why they hate us - and why it 's beyond their control that they do .
They just can't help it - God says so .
Uganda 's Porn Peddling Pastor Martin Ssempa uses the quote to explain why his country should pass the " Kill the Gays " Bill , even while at the same time he says he does n't hate gays .
It 's just about the act , not the person .
It 's out of his hands - that verse means we should die .
It 's not up to him .
Even the new Miss Beverly Hills 2010 Lauren Ashley uses the verse to explain why it 's okay if she hates the gays :
The Bible says that marriage is between a man and a woman .
In Leviticus it says , ' If man lies with mankind as he would lie with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination .
They shall surely be put to death and their blood shall be upon them . '
The Bible is pretty black and white .
I feel like God himself created mankind and he loves everyone , and he has the best for everyone .
If he says that having sex with someone of your same gender is going to bring death upon you , that 's a pretty stern warning , and he knows more than we do about life .
Yet in the same breath , she says she personally does n't hate gays , we just have a friendly difference of opinion :
That is n't really the issue .
I have a lot of friends that are gay , and ... I have a lot of friends who have different views , and we share our views together .
See ?
It 's not Miss Beverly Hills who thinks you should die - just ask her gay friends !
This verse has become a homophobic cover for people to try to wash their hands of the damage they are doing and the violent , extremist views they hold .
It 's become an accepted talking point for bigots and haters , parroted without any real thought about the consequences of saying a swath of people should be killed because their personal idea of ' God says so . '
( Oddly , the same people breeze over other ' abomination ' verses in the same book and put on their mixed fiber clothing and eat their shrimp scampi after church . )
I 've personally heard that ' gays should be killed verse way too much in my life .
It 's what started my life as an activist when a skycap played it over the intercom in Fort Lauderdale Airport as a joke .
Because saying I should die is simply hilarious .
Think it 's a stretch to mention the Ugandan Pastor and a California Beauty Queen in the same post ?
It 's not .
It 's the " trickle down " hate effect .
Leaders crow about how gays should die and then small - minded bigots use it in casual conversation .
It 's all the same hate .
That 's why it 's important that we do n't give passes to people like Miss Beverly Hills .
She invoked ' death for gays ' in a discussion on gay marriage ( and pageants ) and was n't challenged by the interviewer .
That 's how accepted the talking point has become .
That 's what we are facing .
And that 's why we have to always call it out .
Let 's be clear : when you trot out this Bible verse , you are endorsing it , embracing it , and wrapping yourself in it .
No amount of " I have gay friends " , " it 's just the act " , or excuse - making will soften it .
YOU are saying I should be killed .
You can't wipe your hands of it , you can't act shocked when violence happens to LGBT people , and you can't distance yourself from it .
YOU own it .
YOU are part of it .
And no amount of fancy pageant walking will change that .
Three weeks ago , a federal appeals court ordered Microsoft to stop selling Word with Custom XML as of today due to patent infringement , and now we see that the company has struggled to meet the deadline for its many SKUs and versions .
Microsoft previously said that it would be able to meet the kill date for Office 2007 .
On the Microsoft Store , there are 32 results when you choose to display All Office Products , but the majority of them are not available for purchase today .
Generally speaking , all individual Office applications excluding Word are still being sold .
In terms of Office suites , all of which include Word , availability depends on how quickly Microsoft has rolled out the versions without custom XML .
For example , at the time of this writing , Office Standard 2007 , Office Small Business 2007 , Office Standard 2007 Upgrade , Office 2008 for Mac Business Edition , and Office 2008 for Mac Home and Student Edition are not available , while Office Ultimate 2007 Office Professional 2007 and Office Professional 2007 are available .
On the online store , Microsoft does not give an explanation as to why the products are not available : " This product is currently unavailable while we update versions on our site .
We expect it to be available soon . "
The " Not available " messages will soon show the correct price tags again , but the software giant refused to disclose what deadline it has given itself .
Meanwhile , the company managed to re-release Office 2007 ( Professional , Professional Plus , Ultimate , and Enterprise ) for its MSDN and TechNet subscribers on Friday , just in time for Monday 's deadline .
An Office 2003 edition with Custom XML was not so lucky and unsurprisingly Microsoft did n't give the older version the same priority as Office 2007 , though a Custom XML removing patch for Word 2003 was posted on the Microsoft Download Center over the weekend .
Microsoft also managed to get a patch out for Word 2007 last week , but notes to users that neither are mandatory unless the company communicates otherwise in a separate message .
" We 've taken steps to comply with the court 's ruling and are introducing the revised software into the US market , " a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed with Ars .
" Only Office 2003 Professional edition was temporarily removed from MSDN / TechNet as part of this process and will be back up soon .
Office 2003 Standard is still available to MSDN / TechNet subscribers . "
Microsoft only needs to modify versions of Word and Office that include custom XML and were sold before January 11 , 2010 before it reintroduces them into the marketplace as newly compliant products .
Office 2010 , which is set to arrive in June 2010 , does not include Custom XML .
The current debate does not involve handguns , whose registration has been required since 1934 .
Nor does it involve a variety of military - style weapons like assault rifles and sawed - off shotguns , which are banned outright .
And the law ’s repeal would not alter the requirement that gun buyers take safety courses and obtain a license .
But what it would do is hotly contested .
The current law requires the registration of the weapons themselves , rifle and shotguns , which account for 6.7 million of Canada ’s 7.4 million registered guns , according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
Many police forces say that registry data , which they consulted 3.4 million times last year , prevents killings by allowing them to seize guns from homes where serious domestic disputes have been reported .
And many police officials warn that without mandatory registration , their officers will lose the ability to seize illegal guns found in the possession of criminal suspects .
William Blair , the Toronto police chief and president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police , said that information from the registry allowed his force to seize 58 illegal guns in October alone .
Killings involving guns have declined significantly since the gun registry began but it is unclear how much of that the registry is responsible for .
Homicide rates have been dropping in Canada since the 1970s .
And the registry itself , delayed for years by bureaucratic and software problems , has been operational for only a few years , limiting the data available for analysis .
Many recreational hunters , farmers and Native Canadians who hunt for food consider the law a useless and intrusive burden .
“ From the beginning and still today , the feeling has been that it ’s going to do absolutely nothing about reducing crime , ” said Dale R. Garnham , the president of the Manitoba Wildlife Federation , a hunting and fishing group , who added that his members have felt “ unduly harassed ” by the registration process , which is similar to applying for a passport .
Greg Farrant , a lobbyist for the Ontario Federation of Hunters and Anglers , said that gun license records are sufficient for the police to determine if guns are likely to be in , say , a home that is about to be raided .
And , like many critics , he cites the cost of the registry , nearly $ 1 billion to set up , as a reason to dismantle it .
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE : December 2009
SchultzeWORKS designstudio ( www.schultzeworks.com) of Pasadena , CA is proud to announce its top three placement in a recent design competition with their “ radical reinvention of the personal computer , ” titled ‘ Philco PC . ’
The competition was sponsored by ASGVIS , makers of V - Ray for Rhino , the 3D rendering technology for the Rhino modeling software used to create the project .
The design of the “ Philco PC ” was inspired by the 1950 ’s design classic Philco Predicta , as well as an eclectic mixture of modern minimalism , the steampunk movement , and antiques .
As lead designer Dave Schultze explains , “ The result is a design aesthetic that blends multiple elements of the familiar , but with some surprisingly fresh styling that just so happens to house a state - of - the - art Windows 7 PC . ”
The SchultzeWORKS designstudio has created a wide variety of consumer electronics and housewares for clients such as Microsoft , LG , and Target , but the Philco PC design received more attention than usual .
“ The design was a total labor of love , ” says Mr. Schultze , “ but I felt so strongly that , with few exceptions , most computers are engineered eyesores .
So it was very cool to receive so much positive feedback . ”
This interest encouraged additional development and resulted in a one - minute 3D animation .
This video is now being used for presentation to PC makers for manufacturing consideration , and can be seen online at www.vimeo.com/7951005
BIO | BACKGROUND :
SchultzeWORKS designstudio was founded by Dave Schultze in 1997 .
Since then , the firm has designed goods in the categories of consumer electronics , housewares , high - tech toys , furniture , and lighting .

Information .
Thank you to everyone who has called or written to inquire where they could buy the Philco PC .
However , these images are 3D renderings of a design concept which does not yet exist in the real world .
We are currently meeting with PC manufacturers and hope that will change in the near future .
In the meantime , thanks for the interest , and it ’s very cool that you thought the images were real .
Deepening the mystery over the theft of a valuable painting by the 19th - century French artist Edgar Degas , the police in Marseille on Friday released a night watchman who had been detained for questioning the day before .
He was on duty when the work , valued at about $ 1.15 million , vanished from the Cantini Museum there .
The piece , “ The Chorus , ” a small pastel that shows singers performing on a theater stage , was missing when the museum opened on Thursday , and there was no sign of a break - in .
It was one of about 20 Degas works on loan from the Musée d’Orsay in Paris for an exhibition of paintings with theatrical themes .
It was to close on Sunday and travel this year to Italy and Canada .

As one slice of the observed brain image from a human participant ( left ) and the theory ( right ) shows , the theory makes precise predictions , particularly about the two shelter - related coding areas in this slice ( circled ) , where brighter red indicates more activation .

Two hundred years ago , archaeologists used the Rosetta Stone to understand the ancient Egyptian scrolls .
Now , a team of Carnegie Mellon University scientists has discovered the beginnings of a neural Rosetta Stone .
By combining brain imaging and machine learning techniques , neuroscientists Marcel Just and Vladimir Cherkassky and computer scientists Tom Mitchell and Sandesh Aryal determined how the brain arranges noun representations .
Understanding how the brain codes nouns is important for treating psychiatric and neurological illnesses .
" In effect , we discovered how the brain 's dictionary is organized , " said Just , the D.O. Hebb Professor of Psychology and director of the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging .
" It is n't alphabetical or ordered by the sizes of objects or their colors .
It 's through the three basic features that the brain uses to define common nouns like apartment , hammer and carrot . "
As the researchers report today in the journal PLoS One , the three codes or factors concern basic human fundamentals : ( 1 ) how you physically interact with the object ( how you hold it , kick it , twist it , etc. ) ; ( 2 ) how it is related to eating ( biting , sipping , tasting , swallowing ) ; and ( 3 ) how it is related to shelter or enclosure .
The three factors , each coded in three to five different locations in the brain , were found by a computer algorithm that searched for commonalities among brain areas in how participants responded to 60 different nouns describing physical objects .
For example , the word apartment evoked high activation in the five areas that code shelter - related words .
In the case of hammer , the motor cortex was the brain area activated to code the physical interaction .
" To the brain , a key part of the meaning of hammer is how you hold it , and it is the sensory - motor cortex that represents ' hammer holding , ' " said Cherkassky , who has a background in both computer science and neuroscience .
The research also showed that the noun meanings were coded similarly in all of the participants ' brains .
" This result demonstrates that when two people think about the word ' hammer ' or ' house , ' their brain activation patterns are very similar .
But beyond that , our results show that these three discovered brain codes capture key building blocks also shared across people , " said Mitchell , head of the Machine Learning Department in the School of Computer Science .
This study marked the first time that the thoughts stimulated by words alone were accurately identified using brain imaging , in contrast to earlier studies that used picture stimuli or pictures together with words .
The programs were able to identify the thought without benefit of a picture representation in the visual area of the brain , focusing instead on the semantic or conceptual representation of the objects .
Additionally , the team was able to predict where the activation would be for a previously unseen noun .
A computer program assigned a score to each word for each of the three dimensions , and that score predicted how much brain activation there would be in each of 12 specified brain locations .
The theory generated a prediction of the activation for apartment based only on the patterns derived from the other 59 words .
As one slice of the observed brain image from a human participant ( left ) and the theory ( right ) shows , the theory makes precise predictions , particularly about the two shelter - related coding areas in this slice ( circled ) , where brighter red indicates more activation .
To test the theory , the team used the word scores to identify which word a participant was thinking about , just by analyzing the person 's brain activation patterns for that word .
The program was able to tell which of the 60 words a participant was thinking about , with a rank accuracy as high as 84 percent for two of the participants , and an average rank accuracy of 72 percent across all 10 participants ( where pure guessing would be accurate 50 percent of the time ) .
One absent code in the study that is essential for the human species concerns sex or love or reproduction .
" Our vocabulary of 60 test nouns lacked any words related to the missing dimension , such as ' spouse ' or ' boyfriend ' or even ' person , ' " Just said .
" We certainly expect some human dimension to be part of the brain 's coding of nouns , in addition to the three dimensions we found . "
" With psychiatric and neurological illnesses , the meanings of certain concepts are sometimes distorted , " Just said .
" These new techniques make it possible to measure those distortions and point toward a way to ' undistort ' them .
For example , a person with agoraphobia , the fear of open spaces , might have an exaggerated coding of the shelter dimension .
A person with autism might have a weaker coding of social contact . "
Another implication is in developing and testing domain expertise at the neural level .
" We teach to the mind but we are shaping the brain , and now we can give the brain a test of how well it has learned a concept , " says Just .
" If an instructor knows how an advanced concept is represented in the brains of experts in that area , she will be able to teach to the brain test .
We can do it for hammers and carrots right now .
In the near future isotope and telomere may soon be on some brain researcher 's agenda . "

According to an Associated Press report , a state legislator from Maine has introduced a bill that would attach a warning label to cell phones .
The proposed warnings would feature bold red text warning of the danger of brain cancer , and feature an image of a small brain .
There 's one small problem with all of this : there 's little evidence that cell phones increase the risk of brain cancer .
The AP story provides a convenient way to look at a whole series of relevant issues : nonscientific policy initiatives , scientific consensus , and press reporting on contentious scientific issues .
We 'll start with the science .
Cell phones emit radiation in an area of the spectrum that is n't capable of rearranging the chemical bonds of biological systems unless intensely focused ( which they 're not ) .
The energy is able to heat water , and that heat may influence biological systems .
But there 's no obvious connection between mild heating and any obvious health issues , meaning there 's no clear mechanism linking cell phones with health problems .
In the absence of a mechanism , epidemiological studies might be used to identify a risk .
Here , the literature is a bit more confused , as a few small studies have suggested associations between cell phone use and specific cancers ( or , in one case , the location of the cancer and the side of the head that an individual typically holds the phone ) .
So , it 's possible for someone to read the literature and conclude there 's some risk ; that reading , however , would have to be very selective , as large population studies argue against it .
In the most recent example , published just this month , the records of national health services in Nordic countries were combed for instances of brain cancer .
Although rates of some cancers have risen over the last 30 years , there was no change in the rate of increase since the boom in cell phone use of the 1990s .
Studies like this one have led the majority of the scientific community to reach a consensus : any influence of cell phones on brain cancer rates has to take decades to be apparent , and cell phones simply have n't been in general use long enough for us to evaluate that risk .
As with any scientific consensus , there are dissenters , and the AP article features them prominently .
These include the retired director of a cancer research institute , who bases his claims on unpublished data , and a report from an organization called the BioInitiative Working Group , which includes scientists who research this topic .
The AP reporter , however , did n't appear to have bothered to evaluate the Bioinitiative document ; doing so would have revealed a selective and , in some cases , misleading view of the current biomedical literature .
In short , the report does n't appear to be a reliable guide to the scientific literature , making its conclusions suspect .
Although the National Cancer Institute is given the final say ( no apparent risks at this time ) , the article highlights one of the weaknesses of traditional reporting .
In attempting to provide a sense of balance , it uncritically provides space to those who dissent from the prevailing consensus , which is likely to confuse those who have n't dug into the scientific literature .
( Presumably in an attempt to humanize the report , it also presents the opinion of a Maine cell phone user , even though there 's no indication that the individual is in any way especially informed about the topic . )
As for the legislation in question , the person who introduced it ( Democrat Andrea Boland , for the curious ) apparently claims that numerous studies have established a link between cell phones and cancer , and wants the warning to target children and pregnant women .
It 's clear that the legislation is spectacularly ill - informed , but that has n't stopped it from being introduced and promoted .
Unless the bill is made an issue in an upcoming campaign , however , Boland is unlikely to face any difficulty for introducing something that runs counter to the best available evidence .
Boland 's bill gets lumped in with another potential law , one being pushed by San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom .
In contrast to the Maine legislation , Newsom is promoting a law that would require cell phones sold in the city to carry an indication of the amount of radiation that their users are exposed to .
Although that would almost certainly stoke unwarranted fears , it 's actually a reasonable approach given the current state of the science .
We can't currently know whether there are risks following decades of exposure ; the bill would provide those who want to exercise caution with an opportunity to limit their exposure .
Unfortunately , the AP terms that a " similar effort , " despite the fact that its focus — informing cell phone buyers — is almost exactly the opposite of the Maine bill , which would misinform them .
At this point , neither of the efforts have passed .
The Maine legislation is being introduced during the January session .
Hopefully , other legislators will use the opportunity to educate its backers on understanding scientific evidence .

Iraq has formed a committee to negotiate with France to recover 651 million euros ( 895 million U. S. dollars ) paid by Saddam Hussein 's regime for buying Mirage F1 jet fighters which were never delivered , the government said on Thursday .
The committee is headed by an advisor to Prime Minister Nuri al- Maliki and includes senior officials from the presidency office , defense , foreign affairs and justice Ministries , government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said in a statement .
The committee is designated to negotiate with France over recovering the advance money , said the statement posted on the website .
" Formation of this committee and other committees to recover Iraqi funds outside Iraq came as part of the government policy to safeguard Iraq 's money and retain the rights of the Iraqi people outside the country , " al - Dabbagh said .
During the war with Iran in the 1980s , Iraq used to purchase advanced weapons from world powers , including France , but some contracts were not fulfilled as the UN imposed 13 years of sanctions following the invasion of Saddam 's army of Kuwait in 1990 .

Do you use your kettle on a daily basis ?
Every few months you should clean it so that you can better its performance and remove all of the build - up minerals and limescale that are on the inside .
Not only will this cause bad performance but the lifespan can shorten .
Who would want this to happen to their favorite kettle ?
The First Method
For the first method , all you will need is water and vinegar .
Fill the kettle up to ¾ with equal parts of vinegar and water .
Turn the kettle and let the mixture boil then let it stay in for around 30 minutes .
Then remove the mixture , rinse the kettle and boil it again so that you remove all of the vinegar properly .
The Second Method
For this method , you will need coke – the drink that has a phosphoric acidity at a pH of 2.8 which makes it efficient at cleaning .
Fill in the kettle with coke and boil it .
Let the liquid in for 45 minutes and then pour it out .
Rinse the inside and then boil it again with just some water so that you can remove the taste of coke .
The Third Method
Which item is just as effective as vinegar and coke ?
Lemon juice .
Make a mixture – 30 ml lemon juice and 500 ml water and let it sit in the kettle for an hour .
Then boil the liquids and remove them .
The Fourth Method

That 's not to say the interface has much polish , or that you do n't have to install non-free multimedia codecs in your Linux system beforehand .
Then again , unless you 're a FLAC / OGG music purist , you probably already installed your MP3 and other file supports .
I had a video project to assemble over the weekend — combining a recorded audio file and still pictures into a video file that could be imported into iMovie , or watched on a standard PC laptop .
I dropped an audio file into the left - hand sidebar , and it automatically dropped into one of the two default tracks .
I dragged in a batch of pictures , and I could then drop them onto the timeline .
From there , you can use the really simple tools — resize , razor , marker , and moving tool — to adjust and arrange the clips .
For my purposes , that was perfect .
It was a return to earlier versions of iMovie , a basic non-linear video editor for the rest of us .

Jamie Oliver reduced to tears as America 's fattest city resists his latest healthy eating crusade
Television chef Jamie Oliver was reduced to tears during his latest efforts to convert an Amercian community to healthy eating .
The usually upbeat good food crusader broke down after he met serious resistance while shooting scenes for his new series , Jamie Oliver 's Food Revolution .
More than half the residents of the country 's fattest city , Huntington , West Virginia , are obese but most were blatantly uninterested in the chef 's advice .
Tears of frustration : Jamie Oliver broke down while filming his new series , Jamie Oliver 's Food Revolution
He sobbed as he said : ' They do n't understand me .
They do n't know why I 'm here .
A production source told the Sun : ' His tears was the lowest we 've ever seen Jamie .
' He is normally so upbeat but the scale of this challenge got to him .
Everywhere he turned , he was face with obstacles .
' People were outwardly hostile to some of the ideas he put forward .
Resistant : Residents of Huntington , West Virginia , did n't react well
to Jamie 's advice
' He felt so alone and thought at times of packing the whole thing in . '
Some members of the local press warned him to steer clear of their community .
One radio presenter blasted : ' We do n't want to sit around and eat lettuce all day .
' I do n't think Jamie has anything that can change this town .
He can try all he wants . '
Jamie was also left flabbergasted after he asks a group of school children to identify vegetables , mistaking tomatoes for potatoes .
The programme , which will air on America 's ABC network , is based on his British series Jamie 's School Dinners .
Confused :
When shown tomatoes on a vine , some of the pupils thought they
were potatoes
By definition , risk management involves the methodical identification and analysis of events that may or may not happen .
The responsibility of present and future business leaders – as well as industry and government leaders of course – is to ensure the sustainability of the endeavors they oversee .
So , should n't peak oil be considered a risk management scenario ?
Strategies to manage risk include transferring the risk to another party , avoiding the risk , reducing the negative effect of the risk , and accepting some or all of the consequences of a particular risk .
Risk is defined in ISO31000 as the effect of uncertainty on objectives ( whether positive or negative ) .
Risk Management can therefore be considered the identification , assessment , and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize , monitor , and control the probability and / or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities .
Risks can come from uncertainty in financial markets , project failures , legal liabilities , credit risk , accidents , natural causes and disasters as well as deliberate attacks from an adversary .
. .
Risk Management like sustainability has become one of the buzz phrases and hot topics in business and management in general .
According to Wikipedia :
This is a guest post by Joseph Sullivan .
Joseph is a management and strategy consultant in Madrid , Spain .
This is a link to his blog .
The Need to Consider the Possible Impact of Peak Oil
During a recent discussion on the topic of peak oil , the dean of one of America ’s most prestigious business schools [ who asked to remain anonymous ] , said
“ … leaders should bring somebody in to their organizations right away to talk to them about this …if only to say they ’ve had a thorough look at the subject and dismiss it .
This is something that must appear on the radar screen and be addressed . ”
Then , after study and analysis they can either write it off as an acceptable risk or act accordingly to minimize its effects …or even act to monopolize on the opportunities that may arise as a result of it .
Governmental Response
There is evidence that at least some federal governments have identified ( and have begun addressing ) peak oil as a significant risk management scenario .
They may be choosing to keep a low profile about their recognition and handling of the subject for the sake of order and national security , however .
The actions of China represent an exception and indicate that China is adopting an openly aggressive strategy by gobbling up resources at every turn .
China has been building its crude oil reserves , completing 102 million storage facilities while at the same time , nailing down 11th hour deals in late December with both Iraq and Venezuela .
Another indication of China ’s sense of purpose ( and urgency ) include an oil pipeline linking Russia ’s far east to China ’s northeast , set to start operation by the end of 2010 .
The pipeline would transport 15 million tons of crude oil annually .
In short , China is unabashedly leading the way in terms of resource acquisition as a means to mitigate the effects of peak oil and the subsequent decline in supply .
Local and community governments - –with more manageable sized constituencies - –remain largely unaware of the peak oil scenario .
Following the lead of Portland , Oregon , several cities have done some homework in evaluating the risk of peak oil and pulling together a plan , including major cities like San Francisco – but they are miserably few considering the number of towns and cities worldwide that ought to be leveraging each other ’s risk evaluation and planning methods at least on a small scale or in clusters .
This is an unnecessary risk exposure since they could play a key role in creating a responsible level of awareness and developing mitigation measures – IF they deem such actions necessary after a proper risk management analysis .
Business School Response , or Lack Thereof
Business schools , the very institutions where present and future leaders are formed , have also been slow to include peak oil in their many leadership programs about challenging times and sustainability .
At a minimum and for the sake of credibility , the topic should appear as a " what if " leadership challenge in case - studies .
There is a particularly high representation of executives / business leaders from certain industries such as healthcare & medicine [ pharmaceuticals ] in the leading business schools around Europe and the US .
Are these leaders and their teachers informing themselves and each other about the peak oil " blip " currently blinking on the radar screen ?
Judging from the on - line syllabi of current Executive Management & Leadership programs , the answer is No .
There is no evidence of programs or even case studies that address hypothetical scenarios such as :
1 . A much more serious natural gas supply disruption than recently took place in Great Britain takes place .
( Natural gas is produced with oil , and in some parts of the world , may face disruptions as well . )
How might a business plan for such a disruption ?
As supplies get tighter , the chance of disruptions rises , for both oil and natural gas .
2 . An acute oil price spike occurs , similar to or greater than the one of July 2008 .
What are the potential risks and mitigating measures for the aviation and general transport industries ?
3 . The planned technologies to replace oil fail to scale up quickly enough .
This seems like at least a possibility , given the high cost of wind , solar , biofuels , and electric cars .
What alternative approaches would business leaders suggest to minimize the effects of declining supply ?
These approaches might be different for different industries , such as healthcare , automotive , and food & agriculture .
These [ and other similar ] business case scenarios should clearly be among the " war games " at the B - Schools , the institutions of higher learning whose collective mission is to shape present and future leaders .
The title of the executive leadership program at one of Europe ’s most prestigious business schools is – “ Creating global leaders capable of taking on the world ’s greatest challenges ”
And I ask …
Is the mother of all risk management scenarios included amongst the challenges ?

Two things have really changed the face of independent backpacker travel in the last decade : digital cameras and — even more so — the internet .
While some people can afford the luxury of traveling with a laptop or even a netbook , a real backpacker does n't want to have to carry the extra weight nor the responsibility of carrying expensive equipment that would be difficult to lug around , relatively easy to steal , and expensive to replace .

Internet cafes proliferate all throughout Asia and other remote countries , which makes getting online very easy and cheap .
That said , as much as I love " the cloud , " keeping data online comes with security concerns , especially in places where internet restrictions and heavy government monitoring are commonplace .
Here are a list of items from my arsenal — many from Lifehacker — which made my own backpacker travels much easier when in remote places :
Gmail / Google Apps
Lifehacker has already sung the praises of Gmail , and it 's impossible to understate it .
With Google 's recent announcement that accounts will connect using the more secure https by default , Gmail reigns supreme as the best possible email app for travelers logging in on dicey computers in strange places .
On top of that , Google Docs , Google Calendar , and now Google Wave are a wonderful and secure set of cloud based apps to really allow you to do what you need to do from practically anywhere .

Two USB Sticks
Online options are getting better every day , but we can't quite always access everything we need on a computer straight from the cloud .
Choosing the right USB stick to accompany you on your travels is in itself a chore .
The secure Ironykey thumb drive is certainly very impressive , but it is also quite costly .
It 's definitely out of range for most backpackers , myself included .
Corsair makes a padlock drive which is far from completely secure , but it has a more reasonable price and assures you that if you lose it , someone can't simply just plug it in and start using it immediately .

I keep one USB stick around my neck , the other in a zipped pouch under my pants next to my passport , emergency cash , etc .
Both sticks have exactly the same files on them , and core files can easily be synced using DropboxPortable .

PortableApps
On your USB drives , you want to carry software that you need , and for that the PortableApps Suite really is outstanding .
It 's almost like carrying your own computer with you , without the hassle of actually doing so .
Login to any strange machine , and you are armed and ready with all of your favorite software available to you .

Keepass
If I had to choose one single PortableApp that was most important to me , it would be KeePass .
Lifehacker has already gone over the tremendous security advantages to using KeePass , and protecting your passwords in general .
This is even more true and relevant when traveling in remote places .
Advertisement
I keep two KeePass databases with me at all times : my primary database with all of my passwords which I use constantly , and another that only contains scanned PDFs of all of my most important travel documents , including :
Passport
Birth Certificate
Travel Visas ( if I have them ) ,
Health / Travel Insurance info
A list of vaccinations I 've had and when I had them
Medical Records
My U.S. Driver 's License
In that they are in a KeePass database , they are all stored encrypted while on the USB .
Truth be told , no digital copies of those documents will stand up legally in place of hard copies , but sometimes the information on them is all you need and enough to cover you while a hard copy replacement is sent overnight from home .

Skype
With the possible exception of Google Wave ( which I 'm excited for but not quite ready to switch to ) , Skype is still the best way to chat and talk securely ( but of course do n't let the app permanently store your login and password or history ) .

Travelers in China should beware of " Tom - Skype " , a legitimate Chinese version of Skype which was developed in conjunction with one of China 's phone companies .
That version is not secure , but other versions , such as the one you can get from PortableApps , are .
If you have a Google Voice Account , you can even mashup Skype ( or Gizmo5 ) with Google Voice to place and receive free calls back home and or receive incoming phone calls on a local cell phone wherever you are .

uTorrent
Hardcore backpacking is a wonderful adventure , but it is n't always restful .
Sometimes you want to kick back and relax and catch up with the latest TV shows and movies .
uTorrent now also exists as a PortableApp , so depending on the friendliness of the staff of the internet cafe where you are logging in , you could — in theory — download things for your listening or viewing pleasure to watch the next day on your Portable version of VLC .
Advertisement
TrueCrypt
As Lifehacker has covered , when it comes to encrypting your files , there is nothing better than TrueCrypt .
It is possible to bring along with you a Portable version of TrueCrypt , but you can't mount TrueCrypt encrypted drives without admin privileges on the computer you are using .
Ideally , I would love to use TrueCrypt to encrypt my USB drives in their entirety , but since having admin privileges is always hit or miss when traveling , it 's a risk I can't afford to take .
Any documents on my drive that I feel need to be encrypted , I can just store in a KeePass database .
But I still carry TrueCrypt with me and it has come in very handy on occasion .

PortableTOR
Lifehacker has done an excellent job of explaining the anonymous internet tool , TOR , including what it is and how it works .
Some people use TOR in the U.S. , for example , to do things like access Facebook from work — which really should be strongly discouraged .
As events of recent days have proven , some governments around the world censor websites from their citizens .
You may be curious to see your friend 's latest updates at work , but there are people in places whose lives — without exaggeration — might truly depend on TOR .
TOR , and especially the Portable version , provides a way for travelers to those locations ( and citizens who face privacy invasions every day ) to be able to access whatever web sites they need to .

MozyHome Backup
Lifehacker has covered a variety of great cloud based backup services .
Mozy is the one which has served this traveler well .
While my backpack and I are running around the world , my hard drive is still safely at home , turned off and under lock and key .
Fortunately , I backed up my entire system ( well over a 1TB these days ) , and if in a pinch I need a file that I do n't have with me on my USB , in my Google Apps , nor even in my Dropbox , I can " restore " that file from my MozyHome account to whatever machine I 'm on at the time .
Mozy stores my data encrypted and downloads it encrypted as well .

Xubuntu Live CD
But what if you 've covered all of the above and the only computers you have access to are all malware , spyware , and virus infected , but you need to get online as quickly , safely , and securely as possible ?
Advertisement
Then there 's the Xubuntu Live CD .
I always carry a few Linux live CDs with me .
In a durable plastic case , they fit well in the pockets of cargo pants .
Ubuntu itself is great , but Xubuntu is even more streamlined , and runs smoothly and well even on computers with a minimum of memory and hardware .
Go into the internet cafe , put your CD in the drive , and restart it .
More often than not , the computer will then boot from the CD and automatically connect to the internet .
You 're running your own , safe Linux system on a compromised Windows PC .
Of course on the USB stick I also have Linux versions of my favorite Apps : KeePassX , Skype , and TrueCrypt .
I do n't carry a Linux version of TOR with me , but it downloads and installs just fine on Xubuntu .
Flash does n't come installed on Xubuntu either , but I carry Flash with me and wrote a little script to install it with one click off of the USB drive .
Advertisement
Truth be told , someone could probably compile a great " Traveler 's Xubuntu " CD that would come with all of the necessary open source apps already installed , but I 'll leave that to another forward thinking Lifehacker reader .
Traveler 's should always be aware : no security system is ever going to be foolproof and 100 % secure .
Hardware and software keyloggers are great threats which are very difficult to avoid .
Still , by taking proper precautions and arming yourself with the right tools , you can turn the odds in your favor and still accomplish whatever you set out to online , no matter where you are .
The “ tax the rich ” idea is gaining in popularity .
A Washington Post - ABC
News poll released last Thursday found that 73 percent of Americans would support “ a special tax on bonuses over $ 1 million . ”
That includes 85 percent of Democrats , but also an impressive 62 percent of Republicans and 69 percent of independents .
Voters in Oregon are deciding today whether to increase taxes on the rich in their state , which is being hit by cuts in education and other social programs .
They are voting on two ballot measures : Measure 66 which would raise the state income tax on households earning more than $ 250,000 , and Measure 67 which would increase corporate income taxes .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey also released last Thursday found 61 percent of the public favor the House health reform provision , which pays for reform by a tax surcharge on people with high incomes .
Only 29 percent favor the Senate provision , which would tax some employee health insurance plans instead .
“ A tax on the wealthy is obviously most popular with lower - income Americans , but it is also the preference of people making $ 100,000 a year or more , ” noted CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
Meanwhile , in a CBS poll released Jan. 18 , 7 in 10 Americans said they are “ bothered ” by the bonuses being handed out by banks that benefited from federal bailout money .
By a 72 to 19 percent margin , they feel that the bailout has benefited “ mostly just a few big investors and people who work on Wall Street . ”
The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation , in a report released earlier this month , calculates that in 2010 , a little over 1 million U.S. taxpayers will report incomes over $ 500,000 .
“ These 1 million top - earners will collect an astounding $ 241 billion more in income this year than the just under 80 million taxpayers who will take home less than $ 40,000 , ” writes Sam Pizzigati at the Campaign for America ’s Future web site .
Pizzigati notes that Goldman Sachs is piously congratulating itself for paying its employees a smaller percent of its whopping revenues than it did last year .
“ Goldman ’s chief financial officer , David Viniar , wants all of us to consider this smaller payout share a thoughtful , conscientious bank response to widespread public concern over excessive banker compensation , ” comments Pizzigati .
“ Restraint ?
Even with the smaller share of bank revenue going to pay , the ‘ average ’ Goldman employee will pocket $ 498,153 for the year , ” he says .
Since , of course , the secretaries and such wo n’t be getting anywhere close to that , that “ average ” means that the firm ’s top bankers and traders will be pocketing vastly more .
One important Goldman Sachs shareholder , the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority , which operates public transit in the Philadelphia area , last week filed suit against Goldman executives , accusing them of greed .
“ Goldman ’s employees are unreasonably overpaid for the management functions that they undertake , and shareholders are vastly underpaid for the risks taken with their equity , ” SEPTA ’s lawsuit charges .
SEPTA ’s pension fund has about $ 1 million in Goldman stock , according to SEPTA general counsel Nicholas J. Staffieri .
“ The value of that stock dropped because of excessive fees that management took out , ” Staffieri said .
In the lawsuit , filed Jan. 20 , SEPTA says that the bank was not acting in shareholders ’ best interests when it approved executive pay and bonuses amounting to almost half the bank ’s net revenue , the Philadelphia Inquirer reported .

Today ’s Martin Luther King Jr. Adventures in Feministory focuses on Bayard Rustin , one of the most important individuals in the Civil Rights Movement but whose contributions are often overlooked , then and now , because he was gay .
Rustin had always been a social justice activist .
He practiced Gandhian nonviolence during the 1930s and 40s to protest World War II , and he was n’t just a conscientious objector–as a radical pacifist , he refused to serve in the civlian corps ( which was part of the war effort ) and spent three years in jail for it .
Rustin brought his background of nonviolence to the Civil Rights movement and trained and directed groups of activists to nonviolent sit-ins for integration around the South .
He met Martin Luther King Jr. in 1956 and became one of his closest advisors , and was the reason why King would come to embrace nonviolence as the best method of achieving equality .
It was also Rustin who laid out the blueprints of what would become the Southern Christian Leadership Conference .
Being openly gay in a deeply homophobic era did not go without its problems –Rustin was at odds with the law , which at the time made homosexual acts illegal and it perfectly okay for police to raid gay spaces and arrest whoever they felt like .
Rustin himself was arrested in 1953 for “ consensual sodomy , ” an arrest that would be used against him later .
It also put him at odds within the liberal movements he was involved with , such as the Christian pacifist movement and the Civil Rights Movement .
In 1960 , as King was rising in prominence , a rival black leader , Senator Adam Clayton Powell of New York , threatened to reveal a untrue rumor that Rustin and King were having an affair .
Rustin turned in his resignation to King and distanced himself from the Civil Rights movement for three years .
However , A. Phillip Randolph knew Rustin was too valuable to remain outside the movement and enlisted him to organize a march on Washington .
Organize he did ….
Rustin had less than two months to organize what was expected to be the largest peaceful demonstration in American history .
He took over a rundown office in Harlem and with a small staff set to work .
Within days he had raised over $ 15,000 to bring the poor to Washington , drafted a mission statement for the march , and designed a plan for secuirty .
He contracted with bus companies to transport the marchers , arranged for one thousand beds to be made available to those arriving the night before , and even enlisted hundreds of volunteers to prepare bag lunches for those who had not brought their own food .
But only weeks before the march , Strom Thurmond , virulent racist , segregationist , and would - be recipient of numerous Douchebag Decrees should they have existed back then , also delivered a speech to congress about Rustin ’s history and as communist , pacifist , and yes …sexual pervert .
This time though , the movement stood behind Rustin , and the March on Washington , where King delivered the historic “ I Have a Dream ” speech , was a success , Thurmond be damned .
His Civil Rights movement involvement crossed into labor politics during the ’ 70s , but Rustin was still actively writing ( Check out Time on Two Crosses for his collected works ) .
In his essay “ Feminism and Equality , ” Rustin supported the women ’s rights movement but criticized it for the way that it did not frame its goals in terms of larger social problems in America , and in turn left out disenfranchised members of the population .
He uses the example of abortion access not being framed in terms of socialized medicine for all , and children ’s education in terms of integration , rightly pointing out that these were just some of the reasons that black women were not part of the mainstream feminist movement .
He advocated for gay rights in the 1980s , testifying for the New York State Gay Rights Bill .
“ Indeed , if you want to know whether today people believe in democracy , if you want to know whether they are true democrats , if you want to know whether they are human rights activists , the question to ask is , ‘ What about gay people ? ’
Because that is now the litmus paper by which this democracy is to be judged . ”
A year before his death in 1987 , he delivered a speech called “ The New N — - rs ” are Gays , ” in which he did n’t argue that the struggle of black people were over , but that the value of a soceity is measured by the way it treats its most vulnerable citizens .
“ It is in this sense that gay people are the new barometer for social change . …
The question of social change should be framed with the most vulnerable group in mind : gay people . ”
In 2008 PBS produced a documentary on Rustin called Brother Outsider , which is an example of how Rustin ’s legacy is being recognized .
You can also check out Rustin ’s legacy at the Jordan / Rustin Coaltion , whose mission is to “ empower Black same - gender loving , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender individuals and families in Greater Los Angeles , to promote equal marriage rights and to advocate for fair treatment of everyone without regard to race , sexual orientation and gender identity or expression . ”
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Environment Minister Ed Miliband has accused China , Sudan , Bolivia and other left - wing Latin American nations of having tried to hijack the U.N. climate summit to stop a deal , the Guardian reported on Monday .
Energy Minister Ed Miliband speaks to reporters during a news conference at the UN Climate Change Conference 2009 in Copenhagen in this December 14 , 2009 file photo .

The summit in Copenhagen ended with a bare - minimum agreement on Saturday when delegates “ noted ” an accord struck by the United States , China and other emerging powers that fell far short of original goals .
Miliband wrote in an article in the Guardian that Britain would make clear to those countries holding out against a binding legal treaty that “ we will not allow them to block global progress . ”
“ We cannot again allow negotiations on real points of substance to be hijacked in this way , ” said Miliband .
“ We did not get an agreement on 50 percent reductions in global emissions by 2050 or on 80 percent reductions by developed countries .
“ Both were vetoed by China , despite the support of a coalition of developed and the vast majority of developing countries . ”
The Guardian said that although only China was mentioned specifically in Miliband ’s article , aides made clear that he included Sudan , Venezuela , Bolivia , Nicaragua and Cuba which had also tried to resist a deal being signed .
Miliband said there must be “ major reform ” of the U.N. body overseeing the talks -- the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) -- and on the way negotiations were conducted .
The Copenhagen accord , weaker than a legally binding treaty and weaker even than the “ political ” deal many had foreseen , left much to the imagination .
The accord set a target of limiting global warming to a maximum 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial times -- seen as a threshold for dangerous changes such as more floods , droughts , mudslides , sandstorms and rising seas .
But it failed to say how this would be achieved .
It held out the prospect of $ 100 billion in annual aid from 2020 for developing nations but did not specify precisely where this money would come from .
Decisions on core issues such as emissions cuts were pushed into the future .
Another round of climate talks is scheduled for November 2010 in Mexico .
Negotiators are hoping to nail down then what they failed to achieve in Copenhagen -- a new treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol .
The flurry of announcements is heating up prior to the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show .
Details on the 2010 Lotus Exige Stealth or 2010 Lotus Exige Scura ( depending on what market you are in ) have just been released and my heart is aflutter .
But let me take a step back and explain the excitement .
When the Lotus Exige first emerged on the scene , there was an individual in LA who immediately took his car to a custom shop and got the body repainted in matte - black along with carbon - fiber highlights .
Strangely enough , I came across this Lotus quite often and it was this particular Exige that got me pumped about these fierce urban racers .
I remember searching far and wide to try and find out whether or not Lotus offered this as an option and was disappointed with the answer .
However , that is all about to change .
Scura actually means ‘ dark ’ in Italian .
And as such , this special edition Lotus Exige features matte black paint , contrasting glossy black stripes and carbon - fiber accents .
The 260 - hp supercharged and intercooled 1.8 - liter engine from the Exige Cup 260 is used as the powerplant .
This lightweight dynamo sheds an additional 10kg with massive amounts of carbon - fiber strewn inside and out .
Sprints from 0 to 60 mph take just over 4 seconds with 100 mph surpassed in under 10 seconds .
Top speed is rated at 152 mph .
This nifty Lotus comes with launch control , traction control as well as adjustable Ohlins dampers .
Pricing and availability has been announced but sadly enough it does n’t look like the 2010 Lotus Exige Scura is destined for the states .
Only 35 models will be built in total .
In Britain , pricing has been set at £ 45,000 , while those customers in the EU will have to cough up close to € 61.000 on average ( depending on country ) .

An advertising campaign is being launched to raise awareness of domestic violence in teenage relationships .
The adverts will target boys and girls aged 13 to 18 , urging them not to use violence against their girlfriends .
The £ 2 m TV , radio , internet and poster campaign is part of a government strategy announced last year to reduce violence against women and girls .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said it was essential to change attitudes in order to stop abuse against females .
He said : " We want to see young people in safe and happy relationships and this means tackling attitudes towards abuse at an early age , before patterns of violence can occur .
" We hope this campaign will help teenagers to recognise the signs of abuse and equip them with the knowledge and confidence to seek help , as well as understanding the consequences of being abusive or controlling in a relationship . "
Controlling behaviour
The campaign follows research by the NSPCC .
The study suggested a quarter of girls aged 13 to 17 had experienced physical violence from a boyfriend and a third had been pressured into sexual acts they did not want .
It 's a message I fundamentally believe in , and it's what most of my films have been about - finding another way of leading your life
Shane Meadows
Film director
The children 's charity said it was alarmed by the number of young people who viewed abuse in relationships as normal .
Diana Sutton of the NSPCC said she hoped the campaign would encourage teenagers to come together to tackle the problem .
" Many teenagers perhaps do n't talk to their parents and maybe it's not that comfortable to talk to a teacher , " she said .
" So any initiative like this that reaches out and gets them to talk about it amongst their peer group will be very important , and really say it 's absolutely not appropriate to punch , or hit , or slap , or pressure your partner into early sex . "
One version of the advert shows two teenagers lying on a bed watching television .
When the girl gets a text message from a friend the boy dislikes he loses his temper , throwing her phone to the floor and grabbing her by the hair .
' Powerful lesson '
The TV advert 's award - winning director Shane Meadows said he wanted to highlight the problem of emotional violence , including verbal insults and controlling behaviour such as monitoring text messages .
" It 's a message I fundamentally believe in , and it's what most of my films have been about - finding another way of leading your life .
It 's a very powerful and valuable lesson , " he said .
Christine Barter from Bristol University , who led the study , said long - term intervention in schools was also needed .
" [ They need ] to look at what is happening in peoples ' relationships , to say to them , ' This is a serious issue , we do take your relationship seriously , we take the concerns you have in those relationships seriously '.... to challenge the violence and intimidation and control that is in those teenage relationships as it is in adult relationships . "
Psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos said the extent and pervasiveness of abuse outlined in the report were " quite startling " .
She told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme many girls had an expectation that " boys will be boys " and violence would happen anyway .
" It is very interesting , the way it happens .
It 's much more about mind control .
Through the language used , ' He does n't allow me to do this , he would n't like me doing this ' .
" It 's as if the boy speaking to them like this is a way of them valuing them .
As if they think , ' He cares enough to be jealous ' , and that is what is particularly worrying . "

01/04/11 : Welcome again boingboing fans , a bit more than a year later .
Thanks to Sean Bonner for the link and congrats on his success .
I still have no idea why it works so marvelously for some , marginally or not at all for others ( though I think they are decidedly minority given the many comments and emails ) .
At any rate , I had tweeted Mark Frauenfelder and emailed him about an update post I did just a few days ago , so this is opportune and coincidental .
Here it is : A Most Successful Self - Experiement : Over 18 Months Soap and Shampoo Free .
For those who might be interested in the other aspects of my " Free the Animal " life way …such as fat loss , strength gain , awesome sleep , getting off meds & more , stay tuned for a beginners primer at the top of the blog by Friday , 1/7 .

Well it ’s over six months , now , and I really do n’t want to do this post .
Why ?
Cause it ’s too weird , I fear .
We do n’t live in caves without modern convenience , I ’d not want to , and I loath the possibility of paleo becoming a Luddite - esque religion .
I blogged about that ( The Paleo Principle is Neither Authoritative nor Dogmatic ) , and it got picked up by Sisson in a Weekend Link Love issue .
So , I guess , take this with a grain of salt .
I ’m merely reporting on my own experience .
I have n’t used soap or shampoo anyplace on my body for six months , save hand washing in advance of food prep .
That ’s it .
let me just report my observations and leave you to judge .
Took about two weeks to normalize .
That is , I felt my hair was greasy and skin oily up to then .
Now it ’s intermittent .
It ’s perhaps a function of water hardness , but sometimes skin and hair feel squeaky clean , and other times indeterminate .
Even when I feel greasy / oily in the shower with just water , once everything dies out , it ’s always all the same — fine ; soft & dry .
My skin & hair have never been softer .
Never .
If anything , my hair is less " greasy " than ever , yet shampoo has n’t touched it in over six months .
Private parts .
Have to address this , of course .
This is the biggest benefit of all .
Surprised ?
You ’ll just have to try it , because I ’m not going to elaborate .
That ’s why they call them " private parts . "
OK , a clue : maybe it ’s the constant cleansing that ’s the cause of the sweaty - stinky problem in the first place ?
If for nothing else , I ’m soap free for life on this point alone .
I feel as though I ’ve been scammed — and liberated .
I ca n’t explain further .
You ’ll just have to try .
You ’ll save a lot of money , especially you chicks .
Grils : you can Google about no shampoo .
Lotsa links .
I could go on , but ultimately you ’re gonna self - experiment or not .
But if you do , give it at least a month .
Weirdness cleared up for me in two weeks or less , but we ’re not all the same .
I suspect that women who wash furiously and slather all manner of lotions might take a year or two to normalize .
Alright , I know this is out there and it has NOTHING to do with anyone ’s success in a paleo plan and should not be taken as even necessarily desirable .
I will surely not expect anyone to try it .
And you can have at me if you want .
I ’m just saying that I ’ve tried it , I waited a long time to mention it , and in the end , I ’ll never use soap or shampoo on anything but my hands for the rest of my life .
Later , and maybe TMI :
My wife now mentions more than ever before that " you smell good . "
OK , I had to post that only because some might worry on that score ….
