I work ( as a computer lackey ) in a research psychology lab where we 're studying the way young children learn words .
We have an experiment where we get parents to teach the names of some toys to their toddlers .
After the parents teach for a while , we test which names the child has learned .
We used to tell the parents that their child would be tested .
When they knew this , they " taught to the test " --- they wiggled a toy at their child , saying its name over and over , before moving to the next toy and repeating the process .
Logical , right ?
But it did n't work .
The children hardly learned anything .
When the mention of the test was taken out of the text read to the parents , they paid much greater attention to their children , and interacted with them , dropping the name of the toy the child was already interested in , rather than trying to bend the child 's attention to their will .
These children performed far better on the test .
Even though these tests do n't mean anything for the child 's future , when the parent knows that the test is coming , they try to help their children out .
Who would n't ?
But their attempt at helping in fact hinders their child 's learning process --- playing works much better .
How much more pressure is there on a teacher who is trying to provide for their students ' futures , and save their school district from ruin at the same time ?
When people 's minds get filled with goals and pressures , they lose a lot of their ability to adjust to what is actually happening .
( for example , did you ever have a really good question in class , and completely lose track of what was happening because you were trying to ask the question ? )
Schools that are in trouble under no child left behind sometimes force their teachers to use detailed , " scientifically based " prescripted curricula , in return for getting federal funding ( http://findarticles.com/... ) .
The teacher literally reads from a script , and sometimes even the teacher 's responses to children 's questions are scripted .
When I learned about these results in our lab , I started to connect the dots .
Are you really teaching when you read from a script ?
How much of an agenda can you have , and how much pressure can you be under , and still notice how your students are doing ?
Teaching and learning are social processes .
Who do you trust to manage a social process --- someone who is right there , with all their intuitive awareness of what is happening ?
Or someone thousands of miles away , profiteering on the problems of inner-city schools by selling them scripts for turning their teachers into robots ?
Power to the teachers !
Thanks for reading my first diary !

A novel nuclear technology is making a comeback - but why are the researchers keeping quiet about it ?
There was uproar in the scientific community in 2003 when it emerged that the US military was funding research into miniature warheads based on nuclear isomers .
The science behind the project was attacked and even ridiculed .
Nuclear isomers are atoms with a " metastable " nucleus .
Perhaps the best analogy is to consider the nucleons as snooker balls .
In a normal atom , the balls are all flat on the table .
In a metastable isomer , they are piled in a pyramid , ready to collapse and release energy , given the right sort of prod .
Everyone agrees that nuclear isomers can store vast amounts of energy - less than is released in other nuclear reactions , but thousands of times more than chemical fuels .
The question is whether the isomeric decay is random , or whether it can be triggered by interaction with an x-ray or other high - energy photon .
Triggering could release an intense burst of gamma rays , lethal to both humans and electronic devices .
The planned weapon was dubbed " the death ray bomb " and " the atomic hand grenade " ( US military pioneers death ray bomb , August 2003 ) .
Trigger happy
Triggering of the 178m2 isomer of Hafnium was reported by Carl Collins of the University of Texas in 1999 .
But others , notably the Argonne National Laboratory , were not able to repeat his results .
Academic opposition was intense , and a panel of scientists urged a review of the evidence " before proceeding to study applications that may not make physical sense " .
Unsurprisingly , the US Congress cut the project 's funding .
Many still treat isomer triggering as a classic example of pseudoscience .
But the phenomenon is becoming more accepted , and several military isomer projects are under way .
The focus is now on a slow energy release for batteries - but not everyone has completely given up on bombs .
Youngstown State University , Ohio , recently announced funding from the Pentagon for fundamental research into the physics of nuclear isomers .
This academic effort is led by James ( Jeff ) Carroll .
He regards applications such as exotic batteries as speculative , since much more solid data is needed to prove they are feasible , but believes that any form of weapon is unlikely .
" One should differentiate between an ' isomer programme ' and what might be called the ' Hafnium programme ' , " says Carroll .
" The former has added significantly to the body of science , as documented by many peer - reviewed and published results that have achieved acceptance in the nuclear physics community .
" The Hafnium program was focused , to my knowledge , on proving a specific claimed effect that has even now not been successfully observed by any independent and sceptical group .
It would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bath water by equating these two overlapping , yet distinct programmes with quite different aims and outcomes . "
The US army has been quietly running an isomer project for years .
The researchers have published several papers about using isomers for micro-batteries and portable power generation .
Rather than Hafnium , they are working with isomers of silver , lutetium and holmium .
This team also distances itself from earlier work , noting : " This approach differs dramatically from suggestions for use of isomeric materials in explosives applications " .
However , the army estimates that isomer power plants will be too expensive for anything except small - scale use .
Nuclear isomers have to be charged up with energy , and there is no cheap way of doing this .
In Britain , the Atomic Weapons Establishment is looking at whether an ultra-short pulse laser can trigger uranium isomers by stimulating the electron shell around the nucleus into an energetic state .
The technique is called Nuclear Excitation by Electron Transition , and involves zapping a quantity of material so it becomes a plasma .
" This process requires a resonance between the nuclear and atomic electron transition energies , " says Peter Thomson , a scientist at the Atomic Weapons Establishment .
" In principle these might be adjusted within a high - temperature plasma to bring an appropriate atomic transition into resonance with the nucleus . "
Voodoo science
The AWE 's emphasis is on basic research and the potential for energy storage .
But Thomson does not believe that an isomer bomb can be ruled out , saying that the controversy over Collins ' claims has not been fully resolved .
He adds : " A secondary role of AWE is to provide independent advice to the UK government on potential threats to the security of the UK , so an understanding of the fundamentals of isomer physics is essential . "
The US navy also has an isomer programme .
A recent presentation lists nuclear isomers as a possible replacement for explosives in warheads .
This continued belief may stem from the Triggering Isomer Proof Experiment , which was sponsored by the US Department of Defense to determine conclusively whether high - energy Hafnium isomer triggering was possible .
In spite of failures to reproduce results elsewhere , there are strong hints that the results of the experiment were positive .
Meanwhile , isomer triggering is edging towards the mainstream .
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was previously a stronghold of isomer scepticism .
Last year , researchers announced they were working on triggering energy release from a thorium isomer .
They say this would be a world first , showing continued disbelief in the earlier triggering claims .
The earlier results have been disowned by many , who refer to their work as " quantum nucleonics " rather than the sensitive " isomer triggering " .
Nobody wants to be accused of voodoo science , and military funding is at the whim of politicians who can be swayed by the scientific community .
No wonder researchers are treading very carefully .
The war in Afghanistan spilled over on to Pakistani territory for the first time yesterday when heavily armed commandos , believed to be US Special Forces , landed by helicopter and attacked three houses in a village close to a known Taliban and al - Qaida stronghold .
The surprise attack on Jala Khel was launched in early morning darkness and killed between seven and 20 people , according to a range of reports from the remote Angoor Adda region of South Waziristan .
The village is situated less than one mile from the Afghan border .
Local residents were quoted as saying that most of the dead were civilians and included women and children .
It was not known whether any Taliban or al - Qaida militants or western forces were among the dead .
Furious official Pakistani condemnation of the attack followed swiftly , amid growing concern that the Nato - led war against the Taliban in Afghanistan could spread to Pakistan , sparking a region - wide conflagration .
Owais Ahmed Ghanisaid , the governor of North - West Frontier province , adjoining South Waziristan , said 20 people had died and called for retaliation .
" This is a direct assault on the sovereignty of Pakistan and the people of Pakistan expect that the armed forces ... would rise to defend the sovereignty of the country and give a befitting reply , " he said .
The foreign ministry in Islamabad termed the incursion " a gross violation of Pakistan 's territory " and a " grave provocation " which , it said , had resulted in " immense " loss of civilian life .
" Such actions are counterproductive and certainly do not help our joint efforts to fight terrorism .
On the contrary , they may fuel the fire of hatred and violence we are trying to extinguish . "
" This is a very alarming and very dangerous development , " said a former senior Pakistani official .
" We have absolutely been telling them [ the US ] not to do this but they ignored us . "
US and Nato commanders say Taliban and al - Qaida fighters use the unruly , semi-autonomous tribal areas of Pakistan to stage attacks on coalition forces inside Afghanistan and create " safe havens " where they are immune from attack .
Nato and civilian casualties in Afghanistan have reached record levels in the past 12 months in the face of a spreading Taliban offensive .
US forces have used missile - carrying drones - unmanned aerial vehicles - to attack militant targets inside Pakistan in the past .
But yesterday 's assault , involving up to three helicopters and infantry commandos , marked the first time the fight has been taken directly to the enemy on Pakistani soil .
Major - General Athar Abbas , a spokesman for the Pakistan army , said Nato 's International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) had carried out the raid .
" Two helicopters of Isaf landed very early in the morning and conducted a raid on a compound there .
As per our report , seven civilians were killed in this raid . "
But a Nato spokesman denied involvement .
" There has been no Nato or Isaf involvement crossing the border into Pakistan , " a Nato spokesman , James Appathurai , said .
There were unconfirmed reports that the incursion was carried out by US Special Forces , which are not under Isaf command and can operate independently .
A US military spokesman at the Bagram base near Kabul did not deny an attack had occurred but declined to comment .
Tensions between Pakistan 's new civilian government and the US have been running high following American accusations that rogue elements in Pakistan 's top spy agency , the Inter - Services Intelligence agency , were feeding classified information on coalition troops to Taliban fighters .
Washington has also repeatedly accused Islamabad of failing to do enough to curb militant activity .
The strains have been exacerbated by a political crisis in Pakistan following last month 's forced resignation of President Pervez Musharraf and the collapse of a power - sharing agreement between the ruling Pakistan People 's party ( PPP ) and Nawaz Sharif , a former prime minister .
An election to find a replacement for Musharraf is scheduled for Saturday , with the PPP chairman , Asif Ali Zardari , Benazir Bhutto 's widower , expected to win .
In a further sign of instability , militants opened fire yesterday on prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani 's car , in an apparent assassination attempt , near Islamabad .
The assailants , firing from a roadside embankment , hit the driver 's side window twice .
Gilani was not in the car at the time .
Today he was due to meet David Cameron , the Conservative leader , who is visiting Pakistan .

At work recently we found the need to check some dates in a database were correct .
There ’s a database table that for any given date provides both the date two working days before and two working days after .
The system uses it to figure out when it should send transactions so that they complete on the correct day .
Anyway , I have been trying to learn Lisp for a while so as a side project I decided to write something to generate a CSV of the required dates so that I could check everything lined up and so that we have the next few years worth of dates ready .
Here ’s the code , if you have any feedback I would greatly appreciate it as I am still really new to Common Lisp .

Here is the bank - holidays 1.txt I used , it contains all the UK bank holidays for the next few years .
Feel free to use the bits I wrote for anything you want , any feedback of how I could improve things would be appreciated .
Cheers , Dave .
Edit :
I have taken some of the advice given in that comment , and I have tweaked the code .
I noticed that transactions take three days to complete , inclusive of the send day .
So while allowing two working days is usually enough , we need to allow three if we ’re sending the transaction on a weekend or bank holiday .
I also fixed a bug to get rid of a trailing space on all lines when printing the CSV .
Interestingly I did find some mistakes after comparing my results with a dump of the database ’s table , so it was worth checking after all !
Next up I am going to take up the suggestion of using decode - universal - time and encode - universal - time .
( Hopefully , that will mainly involve changing the with - date macro , we will see… )
Edit2 :
I have sorted out the with - date macro and other parts of the code , so they now use proper universal time - stamps .
Also , I have been forced to learn how packages work to get Hunchentoot and co to work so I have now made this into a package that I can use from my other projects .
In a statement that may defuse the escalating tension in the Persian Gulf since Monday , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ruled out the possibility of a war between his country and the U.S. or Israel .
Ahmedinejad 's statement comes in the wake of reports that Iran on Tuesday started military maneuvers in the Persian Gulf a day after the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln moved into the Gulf of Oman so its warplanes can fly missions over Afghanistan .
Addressing a news conference on the sidelines of a summit of developing Muslim nations in Malaysia , Ahmadinejad predicted that the Israeli regime would collapse without Iranian action .
" I assure you that there wo n't be any war in the future , " Ahmadinejad told reporters in response to a question on whether he has called for the destruction of Israel .
He said he did not believe that people in America would endorse President George W Bush for an attack on Iran because it would be a " political suicide . "
" The economic , political and military situation will not let Mr Bush do that , " Ahmadinejad added .
The Iranian leader is of the opinion that the United States ' intervention in other countries poses a " great threat in the Middle East and the whole world . "
Ali Shirazi , an aide to Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , was quoted as saying Monday that Iran will hit Israel , U.S. ships in the Gulf , and American interests around the world if it is attacked .
" The first bullet fired by America at Iran will be followed by Iran burning down its vital interests around the globe , " Ali Shirazi said , while addressing the Revolutionary Guards .
Although an outbreak of war over the nuclear dispute between Iran and the world powers seems not imminent , the Iranian government frequently says it will remain on high alert and make any aggressor regret its actions .
Any development based on geopolitical factors related to Iran influences the oil price , as the strategically important Strait of Hormuz , between Iran and Oman , is a vital channel for energy supplies .
Upto 40 percent of the world 's crude oil is carried through the Persian Gulf waterway .
A war of words between Iranian and Israeli officials raised concerns of military confrontation and influenced oil prices to record highs in recent weeks .
Ahmadinajad 's latest stand on the war indicates that despite spirited rhetoric from Iranian leaders , Tehran does n't prefer a military conflict with the United States .
On the other side , Washington is also wary of the repercussions of a possible war , which would drive surging crude prices even higher , fueling a global recession .
Last week , Vice Admiral William Gortney , the new commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet said that the American naval presence in the Persian Gulf poses no threat to Iranian interests .
He told reporters in Bahrain that the White House only seeks to send a " very clear message " that its naval presence will help maintain security and provide stability in the region .
The European Union imposed new sanctions on Iran in June after it rejected a package of incentives offered to persuade the Islamist country to suspend uranium enrichment .
Iran , which insists that uranium enrichment is meant for peaceful purposes , has said it is prepared to negotiate with major world powers on condition that the talks had to address its nuclear rights .

Performance - enhancing energy drinks should carry prominent health warnings to protect young people from overdosing on caffeine , doctors said yesterday .
The warning follows research in the US into 28 energy drinks that found some contained up to 14 times as much caffeine as a can of cola , or the equivalent of seven cups of strong coffee .
The market for caffeine - rich energy drinks has exploded in recent years , causing some doctors concern at the lack of regulations to ensure they are consumed safely .
In the UK , drinks containing more than 150 mg caffeine per litre must be labelled as " high caffeine content " , but there is no upper limit on the amount of caffeine , nor do drinks need to carry warnings about the potential risks of caffeine overdose .
The Food Standards Agency advises pregnant women not to exceed 300 mg of caffeine a day .
Roland Griffiths at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland surveyed caffeine levels in energy drinks widely available in the US and found they varied from 50mg for a drink called " Whoop Ass " to 505 mg in a drink called " Wired X505 " .
A can of cola contains around 35mg and a cup of coffee around 75mg .

Some of the drinks are not available in the UK , but one brand , called Cocaine Energy Drink , was launched in Britain last month .
It contains 280 mg caffeine , or eight times as much caffeine as a can of cola .
One of the best - selling energy drinks in the UK , Red Bull , contains 80 mg caffeine .
" What we 've seen since the first energy drinks arrived on the shelves is a sea change in how caffeine is being marketed , " said Prof Griffiths .
" These drinks are being very aggressively marketed , often to kids interested in extreme sports , and some of them are making overt appeals to the illicit drug culture .
You can easily imagine people consuming a couple of these drinks and running smack into caffeine intoxication .
People can end up not only feeling lousy , but in ER thinking they 're having a heart attack . "
People who drink tea and coffee regularly build up a tolerance to caffeine , but Griffiths says younger people are at risk of overdosing if they consume highly caffeinated energy drinks at an early age .
Writing in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence , Griffiths calls for energy drinks to carry the same kinds of warnings as caffeine pills , which can be bought over the counter at chemists to alleviate drowsiness .
Those labels highlight the risks of having too much caffeine , including anxiety attacks , nervousness , rapid heart beat and nausea .
" There 's no reason to have a drink on the market that is so caffeinated that if you consume it , the majority of the population is going to experience caffeine toxicity , " he said .
" For someone who 's sensitive to caffeine , 200 mg is enough for them to have many of the symptoms of caffeine intoxication . "
In the study , Griffiths highlights the cases of nine patients treated by a US poisons unit after having an energy drink called Redline , which contains 250 mg caffeine .
Eight of the nine were boys , with the youngest aged 13 .
Their symptoms ranged from nausea and vomiting to tremors , chest pain and a racing pulse .
Earlier this month , the anti-drugs advisory group Drug Education UK warned that schoolchildren are becoming dependent on energy drinks to boost their performance .
Jamey Kirby of Redux Beverages in Las Vegas , which makes Cocaine Energy Drink , said the drinks are labelled with their caffeine content to help children and adults consume them safely .
" Energy drinks are coming under attack because of the branding and marketing strategies .
If we were hurting people , we'd be having our ass sued off by now .
If you look at the demographic we are going for , it 's great news to have these people coming out and saying ban them . "

The levees that collapsed were the ones the canceled funds were intended to strengthen .
With the help of complex computer models and stark visual evidence , scientists and engineers at Louisiana State University 's Hurricane Center have concluded that Katrina 's surges did not come close to overtopping those barriers .
That would make faulty design , inadequate construction or some combination of the two the likely cause of the breaching of the floodwalls along the 17th Street and London Avenue canals -- and the flooding of most of New Orleans .
[ Washington Post ]
Bush cut the levee strengthening funds to help pay for his war in Iraq , a war started with lies .
This is not wise leadership .
It is reckless " loot the treasury to pay for phony wars " leadership .
Bush has , through incompetence , wrecked a major US city just as thoroughly as any terrorist could ever hope to do .
Botnet operators are keen to hijack PCs and turn them into zombies
The summer saw a surge in the number of hijacked home PCs or " zombies " , say security experts .
The Shadowserver Foundation , which tracks zombie numbers worldwide , said it had seen at least a threefold increase in the last three months .
More than 450,000 computers are now part of zombie networks , or botnets , run by hi-tech criminals , it said .
The rise is believed to be linked to attacks that booby - trap websites to try to infect the machines of visitors .
Attack vector Criminals are keen to recruit new machines to a botnet to create a resource that they can use or which can be hired out to other gangs .
Most spam or junk mail is routed through the hijacked machines forming a botnet .
The collection of PCs are often used to launch attacks on other websites , as anonymous stores for stolen data and to help with phishing scams .
The vast majority of machines in these botnets will be PCs running a version of Microsoft Windows .
In June 2008 Shadowserver Foundation knew about more than 100,000 machines that were part of a botnet .
By the end of August this figure had exceeded 450,000 machines .
The Shadowserver Foundation is a group of security professionals who volunteer their time to track and measure botnets to help law enforcement investigations .
The rise in numbers has been accompanied by a fall in the number of so - called command and control ( C&C ) servers tracked by the Shadowserver group suggesting that hi-tech criminals are concentrating their resources .
As their name implies , the C&C servers co-ordinate the use of all the machines linked to them .
The jump in individual zombie numbers is linked to a series of wide - spread attacks that inject malicious code on to legitimate websites that tries to compromise any visiting machine .
In recent months many hi-tech criminals have turned to web attacks to recruit new victims rather than rely on sending viruses out via e-mail .
Typically , a machine is compromised via a vulnerability in one of the programs it runs .
Inside this initial attack program will be code that directs it to contact a C&C server which then downloads software to put it completely under the control of a botmaster .
The machines in any individual botnet can be spread across many different nations .

Today is September 24 .
On this day in 1864 , Abraham Lincoln presided over a country at war with itself and a party split to its roots over the question of how to plan for the nation ’s reconstruction — to such an extent that on this day , Lincoln reluctantly accepted the resignation of Montgomery Blair , his Postmaster General and a valued advisor , owing to disputes over plans for Reconstruction .
Yet the campaign for the presidency was “ now being prosecuted with the utmost vigor , ” as one could read in the New York Times .
On this day in 1932 , with the nation mired in the Great Depression , you could read Will Rogers in the New York Times saying “ This is a year that will bring out lots of votes , for the voter has nothing to do but vote ; his 1932 employment consists entirely of voting . ”
Managing the economic crisis was assuredly a full time job .
Yet Herbert Hoover prepared to give a large speech in Iowa and Franklin Roosevelt had just given what became a famous address to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco .
On this day in 1944 , the US prepared one of the most ambitious postwar occupations in history for Germany , while American forces in the Pacific prepared an assault on the Philippines on the way to Japan .
Yet President Roosevelt had just officially launched his campaign for a fourth term , while Thomas Dewey took his turn speaking in San Francisco , challenging Roosevelt ’s supremacy .
All these examples suggest the contest for the presidency has been an indispensable part of American democracy , enduring even in the greatest of crises .
But somehow , on this day in 2008 , John McCain announced the suspension of his campaign for the presidency and asked for an extension in preparing for this week ’s presidential debate .
UPDATED to add : Bob Mackey adds 1940 , and also “ man up ” .
UPDATED AGAIN to add : G.D. has an initialism that has to be seen to be appreciated .

When I worked at the Department of Homeland Security , I remembered hearing discussions about creating security by denying access to electronics or control systems .
The idea was that in a crowd of people , like in a protest group or political rally , cell phones could be dampened in a region to prevent hostile persons , such as terrorists , from coordinating attacks by using mobiles .
This principle could also be used to prevent signals from reaching improvised explosive devices .
With airliners , no - fly zones could be set up around specific ground targets , such as stadiums , and airliners that strayed into the zone would automatically be piloted out .
Such technology did n’t exist , but I ’m sure there were contractors trying to peddle their ideas to the Department .
As it turns out , there is a protocol in existence , patented by Microsoft , which can dampen devices that are equipped to listen for such signals .
Microsoft calls it DMP , or “ Digital Manners Policy . ”
The idea is that people walk into a theater and their cell phones are automatically set on vibrate .
Or a college professor can prevent students from texting each other in class or during exams .
Or a museum can prohibit cameras from taking pictures of their displays .
OnStar already has the ability to kill your engine in the event of vehicle theft .
And while those ideas sound like great applications for the Digital Manners Policy , Bruce Schneier , writing in his column Security Matters on Wired .
Com , paints a much darker picture of how this technology can be abused .
He suggests that the police can dampen video cameras to prevent anyone ever again recording a Rodney King beating .
Or perhaps your Media Center computer can no longer record certain television programs .
Or your iPod can no longer share music with systems other than your own .
What if your car is automatically stopped or prevented from entering a highway that is being used for a politician ’s motorcade ?
The limits to free speech and free press could be deeply impacted by this tool .
Schneier rightly concludes ,
“ Digital Manners Policies ” is a marketing term .
Let ’s call this what it really is : Selective Device Jamming .
It ’s not polite , it ’s dangerous .
It wo n’t make anyone more secure — or more polite .
Amusing facts about Sweden , Swedish Culture , and Swedish Governance , compiled by an American .
As of 2004 you can pay your Swedish taxes by sending an SMS message from your cell phone .
The government sends you a completely filled out tax form and if it looks good you just go online and click okay to pay your taxes .
Taxes are generally between 50 and 70 % of your income .
( Of course your employer already pays the full amount of your salary to the government in taxes before you even get anything . )
Companies must lay off employees in first - in - last - out order when they are downsizing .
You can take sick leave during your vacation if you are ill .
Parents get a total of 13 months of paid maternity leave and the father is required to take at least 1 month of it .
( There has been a discussion about changing this to 15 months and requiring the father and mother to each take 5 and then split the last 5 as they feel appropriate . )
Parental leave can be used to take off time for parenting classes before your child is born .
Parents can save up their maternity leave for more than 5 years ( i.e. , use it for doctor 's appointments , school visit days , etc. ) .
Daycare cost is based on your family income with a government imposed maximum .
( Currently about 1/10th as much as in the U.S. ! )
If you have a new child , your other children get a month of free daycare so you can concentrate on the new one .
All employees ( including graduate students ) get 5 weeks of paid vacation a year .
All employers ( as of 2004 ) are required to provide free massage .
Yearly car inspections include comprehensive safety checks as well as pollution controls .
Car insurance is flat - rate depending on the deductibles ( i.e. , no " comprehensive " vs. " collision " vs. " uninsured " vs. " medical " ) , and liability insurance is not required .
The transportation department of the Swedish government works actively to reduce the number of traffic deaths each year to zero .
( Mainly by reducing the speed limits . )
The government installs elk fences along the sides of large roads to prevent elk from wandering into traffic .
There is no right turn on red .
Multi-lane highways often merge in large roundabouts .
( Although not as obnoxiously frequently as in England . )
Any product you purchase is guaranteed for 1 year , and the retailer must exchange it if it fails in that time .
( This includes things like clothes and shoes . )
All non-military property that is not fenced in , or is not a farm or someone 's personal garden is open to anyone for hiking through or camping for one night .
Ice cream comes in blueberry and rhubarb flavors , and is never florescent .
( Although the licorice ice cream can be coal black . )
Roughly 20 % of the country 's police stations close during the summer since everyone is off on vacation .
The sun rises at 3.30 am in the summer .
The sun sets at 3.30 pm in the winter .
Christmas is celebrated on the evening of the 24th .
The father always goes out to buy a newspaper and while he is gone Santa arrives ( in person ) to deliver presents .
Swedish university students are required to pay a membership fee in the student union , but no tuition .
American textbooks are cheaper in Sweden than in the U.S. .
The government has made a political choice to shut down all nuclear power plants in the country for environmental reasons .
This means Sweden is forced to import dirty coal - generated power from Poland to meet its needs .
In Sweden IKEA is a cheap store , not a trendy store .
( And they are only open until 8 pm on special days . )
Recycling is taken so seriously that one company ( FTI ) is trying to put up video cameras to make sure people sort their recyclables correctly .
( June 2006 )
Privacy is taken so seriously that putting up video cameras in laundry rooms to catch vandals is illegal .
Learning to speak Swedish is frustrating becaues everyone in Sweden already speaks better English than you will ever speak Swedish .
On Easter children dress up as witches and go trick - or - treating .
St. Lucia is a nationally celebrated saint ( complete with baked goods and TV shows ) , and despite the fact that she is a saint because she tore out her own eyes to avoid being seduced by a man , little children dress up like her every winter .
The largest ice cream restaurant in the country is located in the quaint little village of Söderköping , and sells creations that use dry ice to create bubbling smoking concoctions .
No one is concerned about being sued if some foolish kid eats the dry ice .
Can you guess which one of these Swedish road signs is real ?

Metabolic changes responsible for the evolution of our unique cognitive abilities indicate that the brain may have been pushed to the limit of its capabilities .
Research published today in BioMed Central 's open access journal Genome Biology adds weight to the theory that schizophrenia is a costly by - product of human brain evolution .
Philipp Khaitovich , from the Max - Planck - Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , led a collaboration of researchers from Cambridge , Leipzig and Shanghai who investigated brains from healthy and schizophrenic humans and compared them with chimpanzee and rhesus macaque brains .
The researchers looked for differences in gene expression and metabolite concentrations and , as Khaitovich explains , " identified molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of human cognitive abilities by combining biological data from two research directions : evolutionary and medical " .
The idea that certain neurological diseases are by - products of increases in metabolic capacity and brain size that occurred during human evolution has been suggested before , but in this new work the authors used new technical approaches to really put the theory to the test .
They identified the molecular changes that took place over the course of human evolution and considered those molecular changes observed in schizophrenia , a psychiatric disorder believed to affect cognitive functions such as the capacities for language and complex social relationships .
They found that expression levels of many genes and metabolites that are altered in schizophrenia , especially those related to energy metabolism , also changed rapidly during evolution .
According to Khaitovich , " Our new research suggests that schizophrenia is a by - product of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution " .
The authors conclude that this work paves the way for a much more detailed investigation .
" Our brains are unique among all species in their enormous metabolic demand .
If we can explain how our brains sustain such a tremendous metabolic flow , we will have a much better chance to understand how the brain works and why it sometimes breaks " , said Khaitovich .

Firm top McCain aide ' quit ' was paid $ 90 K by campaign Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday September 25 , 2008
Print This Email This John McCain 's presidential campaign has become increasingly adamant this week that campaign manager Rick Davis has had nothing to do with the consulting and lobbying firm he founded since signing on for the White House bid two years ago .
So why does it look like McCain 's own campaign paid Davis 's firm in lieu of putting him directly on their payroll ?
The Arizona senator 's presidential campaign paid at least $ 90,000 to Davis Manafort Inc. , the firm Davis founded with Republican lobbyist Paul J. Manafort , during the first six months of last year , while Davis was serving as CEO for the campaign .
Five payments were made for " communications consulting " in increments of $ 10,000 to $ 40,000 , according to a Raw Story review of campaign finance records maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics .
The payments stopped in July 2007 , when Davis and some other top McCain aides reportedly began working for free , as McCain 's campaign struggled to raise money .
Davis himself never received a personal salary from the campaign , although he reportedly earned $ 20,000 per month from the campaign .
Neither McCain 's campaign nor Davis Manafort returned calls seeking an explanation for the payments to Davis 's firm Thursday .
A well - connected Republican operative told Raw Story the payments to Davis Manafort appear to have been in exchange for Davis 's service to the campaign .
Davis previously faced questions over another firm he owns , 3eDC , and its work on behalf of the McCain campaign .
That group billed the campaign $ 175,000 in early 2007 to build the McCain Web site , all while Davis was serving as the campaign 's CEO .
More recently , the McCain campaign manager 's connection to Davis Manafort has come under scrutiny because of the firm 's connection to embattled mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
In a pair of articles this week , the New York Times revealed that the companies had paid Davis nearly $ 2 million to fight off federal regulations , and then Freddie Mac kept his firm on a $ 15,000 per month retainer when it became clear he'd be working for the McCain campaign .
The disclosures infuriated McCain 's campaign , which unleashed a slew of attacks on the Times and any reporters who tried to point out inaccuracies in their denials .
Newsweek 's Michael Isikoff on Thursday further undercut the campaign 's attempts to argue that Davis the campaign manager was fully separated from Davis Manafort the consulting firm .
Rick Davis , John McCain 's campaign manager , has remained the treasurer and a corporate director of his lobbying firm this year , despite repeated statements by campaign officials that he had ended his relationship with the firm in 2006 , according to corporate records .
The article contradicted a lengthy memo released the day before that attempted to make the case that Davis was completely disconnected from his firm .
" As has been previously reported , Mr. Davis has seen no income from Davis Manafort since 2006 .
Zero. Mr. Davis has received no salary or compensation since 2006 , " McCain spokesman Michael Goldfarb wrote in the memo .
" Mr. Davis has received no profit or partner distributions from that firm on any basis -- weekly , bi-weekly , monthly , bi-monthly , quarterly , semi-annual or annual -- since 2006 .
Again , zero .
Neither has Mr. Davis received any equity in the firm based on profits derived since his financial separation from Davis Manafort in 2006 . "
The statement was meant to counteract implications of a conflict of interest on Davis 's part because of his previous work on behalf of the mortgage lenders , which last month had to be bailed out by the federal government .
If the statement is true , though , it seems it would also mean Davis collected no salary from his time as campaign CEO .
Artist 's Statement
What exactly the Large Hadron Collider will do is something I can understand only in the most reductive , metaphorical layman 's terms , in rare , momentary satoris I really have to strain for , and usually only when Brian Greene , or sometimes Lisa Randall , explains it .
The main thing they ’re hoping to accomplish is find evidence of a Higgs Boson , the only elementary particle predicted by the Standard Model not yet observed , and the one that gives other particles mass .
Do I really have any idea what this means ?
I do not .
What I do get is that it is only at extremely high energy levels that certain phenomena which would otherwise remain totally theoretical can be observed .
These gigantic supercolliders are the only way to test some of the more otherworldly implications of particle physics and string theory , such as the nature of dark matter and the existence of higher dimensions .
I find this cool .
The U.S. was to have built such a supercollider in Texas , but congress cancelled funding for it back in 1993 .
Science is one of the stupider things I can think of to get jingoistic about — it's up there with art as one of the great collaborative intergenerational human undertakings -- but it still disappoints me that my own country , which split the atom and landed a man on the moon , decided it did n’t have the money to resolve some of the profoundest questions about the nature of reality but did manage to come up with funds for the destruction of Iraq .
This seems to me kind of like not being able to afford music lessons for your daughter but somehow always having enough cash on hand to buy cocaine every weekend .
It was a symbolic turning of the tide in this country , receding from our high water mark of scientific preeminence .
Now the Europeans are hosting the project instead , while we ’re still debating the monkey trial .
It ’s funny that evangelicals only stage really organized outcries over evolution , rather than , say , geology or particle physics .
How come no picket lines in front of the moon rock repository , where scientists have blasphemously dated basalt back 4.5 billion years , well before the appearance of the moon on Day Four of Creation five thousand years ago ?
Why no demand for equal time for Creationism at conferences on string theory , which does n’t acknowledge the hand of a divine creator in supersymmmetry ?
Perhaps I 'm belaboring the point .
It is because they are too stupid even to have ever heard of these things .
None of their sources of information -- their pastors , Good Morning America , USA Today , Time magazine -- has told them about bosons or or branes or the electroweak force .
Lately I find myself feeling less contemptuous of Creationists than sorry for them .
The creation myths of religion were only primitive efforts to understand the origin of the world and the nature of being in the absence of any information .
Now , for the first time in history , we ’re actually able to get at the answers -- the actual , correct answers -- and most people are too blinded by their emotional attachment to the old bedtime stories to look at the truth now that it ’s staring them in the face .
It ’s especially depressing because the truth , insofar as we ’re able to apprehend it , is so much more elegant , complex and beautiful , a far more aweful revelation , than the crude fables of religion .
Our spiritual lives may be more impoverished , but our picture of this universe is so shockingly immense and rich compared to the dwarfish , arid worldview of five thousand years ago .
I recently went to Baltimore 's the Walters Art Gallery to see an exhibit of ancient maps and an ancillary exhibit of photos from the Hubble telescope .
Compare the crude Medieval maps that show the earth as a disc divided cleanly into the continents of Asia , Europe and Africa ( with the Garden of Eden at the center ) , with the Hubble 's Deep Field image — galaxies like handfuls of jewels , each an unreachable island universe teeming with worlds we ’ll never know .
A glimpse of this vision , like seeing Zeus in all his glory , is enough to make you fall to your knees and cover your eyes .
The human imagination is incommensurate to the mystery we inhabit .
Biblical ( or Talmudic , or Koranic ) literalists remind me of children wrinkling their noses at Belon oysters and asking for more Chef Boy - R - Dee .
They just want the world to be as simple as they are .
( Which is one reason evangelicals , as a group , hired a guy as dumb as they are for the job of running the country ; they hoped that intelligence was n’t that important , that guts or faith or “ moral clarity ” would be enough , which , it turns out , sadly , no . )
And yet I share some of Carl Sagan ’s naive belief that if only science were more widely publicized people would might take more of an interest in it , might learn some skepticism , and might even , per Brian Greene ’s recent op - ed in the Times , quench some of their thirst for wonder that ’s otherwise being lucratively slaked with cheap , dehydrating New - Agey booze .
Instead we get a steady diet of political gaffes and celebrity gossip , sports and infotainment , Doritos for the mind .
( See my artist ’s statement for “ Enough Local News ” for more of my mouthing off on this subject . )
Oh , never mind me , I ’m just some snobby Ivory - Tower elitist who thinks some board of philosopher - kings ought to confiscate all the TVs and shove string theory and Proust down everyone 's throats .
Forget it !
Let ’s go back to talking about Miley or A - Rod or whoever .
In the interest of scientific literacy I should clarify that there is just about no realistic possibility that the LHC will generate a mini black hole , strangelet , or any other phenomena that might destroy the world .
Some doofi did sue the LHC in a Hawaii District Court , demanding that they , like , cease and desist until filing a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement reassuring us that they were not going to accidentally suck us all into Yuggoth .
You can read the LHC 's safety report here , if you 're really worried about it .
Thanks to my friends Ellen , for good advice on the Lovecraft panel , and Cynthia , for help thinking up New York Post - style headlines .
It 's harder than you 'd think .

John Grant 's handsome little hardcover book " Corrupted Science : Fraud , Ideology , and Politics in Science , " is an eye - popping tour through the history of bad ( very , very bad ) science , from eugenics to geocentrism to Lysenkoism .
Grant — whose stern historical tone is liberally relieved with bravura dry sarcasm — approaches his topic from the general to the specific .
The book begins with a fine , brief history of fraudulent scientists , categorizing their frauds into self - deception , hoaxing , " cooking " ( fudging research ) , and forging ( a taxonomy from Charles Babbage 's " Reflections on the Decline of Science in England " ) , and then ranges back and forth through history , revealing the minor and major frauds of respected figures like Newton , Galileo and Marco Polo to outright scoundrels like Ruth B Drown , who sold fake radio - based cancer cures to desperate , dying people for decades .
After this delightful and enervating overview , Grant moves on to different social causes of fraud : ideological scientists who fooled themselves ( for example , the discoverers of " menstrual rays " and other improbable phenomena ) ; then military fraud ( CIA psi experiments , military waste on secret flying military bases that did n't , and , of course , Star Wars , junk Patriot Missiles and the Missile Defense Shield ) ; religious fraud ( bans on teaching evolution , intelligent design , und so weiter ) ; then ideological attacks on science ( the burning of the Library of Alexandria , the American Eugenics movement ; anti-masturbation campaigns , young earth and New Age crackpots ) ; and then finally onto the book 's third act , a chilling exploration of the political curtailment of science .
Here , Grant begins with Nazi science , and not just the gruesome death - camp experiments we 're all familiar with , but also the bizarre attacks on " Jewish " mathematics and physics and the effort to create " German " equivalents that adhered to the ideological tenets laid out by Hitler 's regime .
Of course , there 's plenty here about junk genetics , weird theories about the origins of disease ( " earth rays " ) (! ) , and then , finally , a stomach - turning look at the human subjects experiments undertaken in the death camps .
Next up is Stalinist Russia , and of course , that means Lysenkoism , an ideologically correct biology that led famines that killed millions .
The social factors that brought Lysenko ( and his contemporaries , including Lepeshinskaya , who advocated the idea of " spontaneous generation of life , " despite this notion having gone out with Pasteur .
Grant does a great job bringing these personalities to life , and giving a flavor of the reasons that some scientists were forced to toe the line while others ( physicists — vital to the nuclear arms race ) were able to conduct their affairs with relatively little meddling .
I was also fascinated by his description of the junk psychology that doomed political dissidents to a lifetime in mental institutions and the notion that some psychiatrists may have turned in their diagnoses in order to spare their patients the worse fate that awaited them in the Gulag .
Finally , Grant closes with the systematic attacks on science under the presidency of George W Bush , and makes a compelling case that the failure of countries that tried to constrain science in order to make it comply with ideology is a real possibility for the USA today .
Grant 's relentless account of the Bush administration 's attacks on health science , environmental science , geoscience , evolutionary science , climate science and other critical disciplines is deeply chilling .
The political hacks who censor NASA and EPA reports are clearly of a lineage with the commisars who doomed the Soviet Union by purging the bioscience that undermined their political philosophy .
Exhaustively researched and footnoted , Corrupted Science is excellent reading for anyone who believes that science is worth fighting for .

I watched the GOP convention tonight and was not surprised , but still dismayed , at the attacks by the speakers on America liberties .
Romney and Palin both attacked the rights of “ terrorists ” to constitutional protections .
Romney blabbed :
Is a Supreme Court liberal or conservative that awards Guantanamo terrorists with constitution rights ?
Palin chirped of Obama :
Al Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America … he ’s worried that someone wo n’t read them their rights ?
Both times , I noticed the crowd at Nuremberg — excuse me , Minneapolis — rabidly cheering these attacks on American liberties .
What Palin and Romney did not note is that a “ terrorist ” is anyone the president says is a terrorist .
Although this possibly was slightly reduced by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision , anyone in the world , including American citizens , could be branded a “ terrorist ” and held , possibly indefinitely , in detention .
Even Romney and Palin might be held that way , never to be heard from again .
And as H.L. Mencken pointed out , the test cases of liberty seldom involve the top people , but those at the margins , or even at the bottom .
If everyone deserves the same rights , then everyone ’s rights must be defended .
And “ everyone ” includes even real terrorists .
It ’s not surprising that , under Bush , first “ terrorists , ” real and imagined , had their rights abridged , then everybody else did , too .
As Glenn Greenwald has reported on the scene from Minneapolis — here , and here , and here – even peaceful protesters ’ houses have been raided before the convention even began , and reporters were arrested .
Palin : Nice lady , bad company
Palin gave a great speech .
But her foreign policy and civil rights sections clearly were written by the anti-American Neocons who run McCain ’s campaign , and who hate our liberties with a passion .
She ’s a nice lady who ’s put in with a bad crowd , as Lew Rockwell pointed out .
Palin ’s nickname is “ the Barracuda . ”
But even a barracuda would be devoured by a gang of killer sharks — in this case , Bush , Cheney , McCain , Liberman , and the Neocons .
If America is about anything , it ’s liberty protected by the Bill of Rights .
Bush , Cheney , McCain and the others have spent the past 8 years assaulting the Bill of Rights as it never has been in our history .
Romney ’s ambition
The oleagenous Romney also said :
John McCain hit the nail on the head : radical violent Islam is evil , and he will defeat it !
That ’s rich coming from a Mormon .
Like Islam , it has a history of polygyny ( although Muslims can have only 4 wives ) , bans booze , and has some terrorism in its past .
And a lot of Republicans consider Mormonism a cult ( see comments section here ) .
I do n’t have anything against Mormons myself , I ’m just pointing out that , if Mormons were judged by Romney ’s rhetoric , he might end up at Guantanamo just for that .
Most of his speech was a preparation for a presidential run in 2012 by continually saying conservatism is better than the liberalism of Obama .
But just 2 years ago he was a liberal himself .
What a night
Republicans at the convention must be feeling so giddy tonight they could float up to the moon .
But if you believe in America ’s principles and tradition of liberty , it was a night to despair .

WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
Five former secretaries of state , gathering to give their best advice to the next president , agreed Monday that the United States should talk to Iran , the Associated Press reported .
The wide - ranging , 90 - minute session in a packed auditorium at The George Washington University , produced exceptional unity among Madeleine Albright , Colin Powell , Warren Christopher , Henry A. Kissinger and James A. Baker III .
They did not agree on who should move into the White House next January .
Albright and Christopher are Democrats , the others Republicans .
Albright surprised no one by endorsing Democrat Barack Obama to replace Republican George W. Bush .
" " It would be sending a message of diversity " " to the world , she said , drawing cheers from an audience of dozens of diplomats and hundreds of students .
Baker said he wished to send a " " powerful message " " to America as well as abroad .
After a dramatic pause , he evoked applause and some laughter by saying tersely , " " But I am for John McCain . " " Powell , the first black secretary of state , said he had not decided yet .
" " I am an American first , " " Powell said .
He said he had told Obama , " " I am not going to vote for you just because you are black . " "
The critical issue , he said , " " is who is going to keep us safe . "
" The Bush administration has dragged its feet on even minimal contact with Iran under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a course the five former secretaries of state implicitly criticized .
Nor did they suggest the United States should keep its distance out of concern for Israel .
"
" The military options are very poor , " " Christopher said .
" " And we have to tell the Israelis that . " " Kissinger , for his part , said he favored negotiations with Iran , but the United States should spell out its objectives at the outset .
And that , he said , included a stable Middle East .
Kissinger was secretary of state in the Nixon and Ford administrations from 1973 - 1977 .
Albright said if she were secretary of state , she would begin the talks at the State Department level .
" " You need to engage with countries you have problems with , " " she said .
Secretary of state in the President Bill Clinton 's administration from 1997 - 2001 , she said , " " The more we criticize Ahmadinejad the stronger he gets " " within Iranian society .
As the five former secretaries cruised through world issues , they hewed to a line that the United States had to project its standing but also to work with other countries .
Christopher , who preceded Albright in the Clinton administration , serving from 1993 - 1997 , offered the proposition , though , that the United States should outlaw torture of captured terror suspects .
And Powell , who served President George W. Bush from 2001 - 2005 , sought to allay suspicions that Russia was turning into a second Soviet Union , even though it acted " " brutally " " in its conflict last month with Georgia .
It was " " foolhardy , " " he said , for Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili to " " light a match " " with a military operation in South Ossetia to reassert forcibly his authority over the breakaway region .
And Baker , secretary of state for President George H.W. Bush from 1989 - 1992 , said he did not think " " there is a deal to be struck " " between Israel and the Palestinians .
But he said the United States should get on good terms with Syria when there is a better chance for a deal .
" " It 's ridiculous for us to say we are not going to talk to Syria , " " he said .
Despite the opposition to the deal , some legal experts suggested that the appointment of Mr. Litvack , who has a reputation for independence , might simply be an effort by the Justice Department to deflect any political fallout from its ultimate decision .
He served as the Justice Department ’s top antitrust lawyer in the administration of President Jimmy Carter .
The Justice Department has been criticized by some in Congress for its approach to antitrust enforcement .
“ The Justice Department is looking for political cover one way or the other , ” said Jeff Chester , executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy , a public interest group that has opposed the deal .
“ That ’s clearly what ’s Sandy ’s role is here . ”
Mr. Litvack , the former vice chairman of the Walt Disney Company , recently left Hogan & Hartson , where he was a partner , to join the Justice Department , a spokeswoman for the law firm said on Tuesday .
The Justice Department refused to confirm Mr. Litvack ’s appointment .
Two people with knowledge of the investigation , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it , confirmed the appointment , which was first reported late Monday by The Wall Street Journal .
Google and Yahoo have said their deal does not violate antitrust law .
The companies voluntarily agreed to postpone putting it into practice for three and half months to give regulators time to scrutinize it .
Eric E. Schmidt , Google ’s chief executive , recently said that the companies were planning to go forward with the deal next month , even if it had n’t been cleared by regulators by then .
Google and Yahoo both declined to comment on the antitrust review .
Both companies said it would be premature for regulators to block the deal before it was completed .
If the deal is blocked , the fallout for Google will be strategic , said Benjamin Schachter , an analyst with UBS Securities .
Yahoo has said that the agreement will bring it an additional $ 250 million to $ 450 million in operating cash flow in the first year .
The fallout of a deal being blocked would be financial and immediate , Mr. Schachter said .
Yahoo shares , which are at a five - year low , could drop even further , leaving the company vulnerable to a new bid from Microsoft , or from another party , Mr. Schachter added .
Captcha systems to stop automated postings have been ' completely broken ' by spammers , experts say .
So what 's the alternative ?
Tim Anderson reports .
Captcha is the bane of the internet , " says Matt Mullenweg , who runs the massively popular blogging site Wordpress.com .
" I ca n't figure them out myself half the time ! "
He is referring to those squiggly , distorted images commonly seen when registering for internet services such as free email accounts or blogging sites .
The user has to type the letters in the image before proceeding .
Captcha stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart .
The idea is that humans can read the letters , but computers cannot , thus preventing automated scripts from registering .
Online music sales continue to skyrocket at the expense of CDs .
iTunes continues to be the leader of the pack , too , not only in online sales , but music sales overall .
But a small rebellion is brewing against iTunes as artists become disgruntled with the hit they 're taking on overall album sales thanks to the now - wildly - popular method of cherry - picking favorite tracks for download .
As we reported on Infinite Loop back in June , Kid Rock is one of the artists who have begun to speak out against what they consider to be an unfair distribution system in iTunes .
Rock said at the time that iTunes was representative of the " old system , " where distributors and record labels take money instead of giving it to artists .
iTunes , for instance , pushes the a la carte music track system instead of allowing artists to sell music in album - only format .
But selling millions of singles is n't necessarily as lucrative as selling far fewer full albums , and for some artists ( we do n't necessarily include Kid Rock in this category ) , there 's the artistic vision realized only in the full - album experience .
Rock eventually decided that he was boycotting iTunes and not placing his new album on the popular online service .
" In so many ways it 's turned our business back into a singles business , " Kid Rock 's manager Ken Levitan told the Wall Street Journal today , referring to iTunes as " part of the death knell of the music business . "
Since June , Rock has sold 1.7 million copies of his Rock ' n ' Roll Jesus album , and sales have grown steadily in 19 of the last 22 weeks .
Levitan says that , if the album was sold the iTunes way , most of those sales would have merely shown up as 99 ¢ downloads of the hit single from the album , All Summer Long .
If the rest of the album was actually good enough to attract fans , then perhaps this would n't be so much of a concern ; artists worry that many fans will never even sample enough other material from an album to find out if it 's good or not .
Rock 's success sans iTunes apparently prompted Atlantic Records , owned by Warner Music Group , to pull an album by R&B artist Estelle from iTunes , too ( Estelle 's album remains on Amazon 's MP3 store , but is sold " album - only " ) .
AC / DC has never put its music on iTunes either , the WSJ points out , and still managed to enjoy some success with 2.7 million CD sales last year .
And , of course , Jay - Z made headlines late last year for boycotting iTunes when his new album ( at the time ) American Gangster went on sale .
" As movies are not sold scene by scene , this collection will not be sold as individual singles , " he said at the time .
The one thing we 'll likely never know , though , is how much more successful these artists would be with the help of iTunes , if at all .
Music lovers : please change your buying habits
These artists ' complaints are n't so much iTunes ' fault as they are the " fault " of the evolving music market .
There 's an endless supply of other music stores that also sell music on a track - by - track basis , because customers just plain love being able to cherry - pick their favorite songs .
Digital downloads just make that easier , but the practice itself has been around for decades .
Album sales have been plunging for some time now — they dropped a full 20 percent just last Christmas — and CD sales in general have been tanking for even longer .
Some artists believe that actually cutting out iTunes and its per-track sales is the best way to increase revenue .
It 's a dangerous game , though ; if consumers want only a single track that they could have for a buck but it's not available , will they purchase the whole album or simply grab the single from P2P networks ?
In the next day or so you 'll probably find yourself hearing a lot about how Google started 10 years ago , and , well , is n't it remarkable that a company that started in a garage has survived that long and become a household name ?
I 'm not going to do that .
Hell , that 's what Wikipedia and the official Google history are for .
I 'm more interested in Google 's next 10 years – because that could define what life is like in 2018 and beyond .
I 'm not exaggerating .
And if I 'm wrong , you can come back and beat me over the head with a printout of this piece .
An interesting generic forecast came from John Battelle , who wrote Search , a book about how Google catapulted to the top of the search – and more importantly search advertising pile – over AltaVista , Yahoo , Lycos ( remember Lycos ?
Adverts used a dog sniffing stuff out ) and Ask Jeeves ( Jeeves got whacked ; now it 's just Ask ) .
His prediction ?
" I 'd say , by then they'd have made a couple big ass mistakes and most likely one of the key founders is gone , " he forecast .
" But they still [ will ] rule the world in terms of monetization of traffic of good intent . "
It 's not as though Google has n't already made some mistakes .
There 's been its ( purposeful ) concession to China 's demands to filter its content ; and the ( accidental ) release by AOL of lots of personal data gathered by Google from AOL users .
Until the latter , people had n't realised quite how easy it was to find an individual from their searches .
To get an idea of what Google will look like in 10 years ' time , it helps to imagine the world then .
Important trends are visible already .
Energy , food , and oil and coal byproducts will all be more expensive in real terms .
That means first that power efficiency will be essential in any product we use ; minimising wasted energy and effort will be part of daily life .
Minimising waste , in fact , will be sensible ; we 'll reuse and recycle because it'll often be preferable to buying to buy new .
In computing , there are important trends that are only just starting .
The rise of ultraportables ( or Liliputers ) – really small yet fully functional computers , with solid - state drives – is a key trend .
This will bring Linux to a wider market that would never have used it before .
Mobile phones are becoming even more important ; their penetration is a key indicator of economic growth in developing countries .
They 'll become portable internet devices for the times when we do n't want to use our ultraportables .
A final point before we move into the predictions : companies develop a lot less in their second decade than their first .
Though it helps to be a multibillion pound company if you do want to have a stab at continuing your dramatic growth .
OK , so what should we expect from Google in the next 10 years ?
First , Android , its mobile phone platform , is very important .
Google wants to be in your mobile phone where you 're making searches and calls .
It wants to know what you 're doing there so it can persuade companies to advertise with it .
After all , if you 're a company and all the mobile phone traffic you see comes via an Android phone , you 're going to listen with more interest to Google 's ad sales people than Microsoft's .
Here 's my forecast : in 10 years , Android phones will be outselling phones using Microsoft Windows Mobile or Apple iPhones .
Yes , I do think that .
Secondly , Chrome - its browser - is going to be preloaded , and often the default , in computers that you buy in shops , whether full - sized ones or the ultraportables .
Google has the financial muscle to make that happen , which Firefox ( owned by the Mozilla Foundation ) does n't .
In fact the ultraportables are important to this story .
They are the real incarnation of what Bill Gates thought the Tablet would be .
His 2001 forecast that in five years the Tablet would be the dominant model on sale was wrong .
But I 'll pick up his wonky prediction cap .
I think that it will be true of the ultraportable in five years or so ; in 10 years , surely .
And I think that ultraportable , like the Android phones , will be running Linux , because there 's a lot of effort gone into developing low - power versions of it already .
And they 'll have Google as a default search engine , and run Chrome , which will be used to write documents and do spreadsheets and check email and work collaboratively – with the data stored both in the " cloud " ( on Google 's or other servers ) and also saved locally , on the SQLite database that underlies Google Gears .
( Data in two places .
It 's safe . )
Meanwhile , Google 's other initiative is going to be in energy .
It uses colossal amounts of energy for its server farms .
It 's going to be walloped by rising energy costs , which is a key reason why last November it began its " RE < C " program – with the aim of making renewable energy cheaper than coal .
At the time Larry Page said : " With talented technologists , great partners and significant investments , we hope to rapidly push forward .
Our goal is to produce one gigawatt of renewable energy capacity that is cheaper than coal .
We are optimistic this can be done in years , not decades . "
( One gigawatt can power a city the size of San Francisco .
Or a few Google server farms . )
And , quite possibly , Google will sell some of that energy to the electric grid .
How would you like to have your Google - laden ultraportable powered by green Google electric juice ?
Now there 's a capture of the market for you .
Into this scenario I can see a couple of clouds that will loom .
Larry Page and Sergey Brin have had their differences ; I suspect that Battelle is right that one of them will leave within the next decade , and how Google reacts to that will be key to its future .
The other two things that will be a problem are that China will resist Google , because its authoritarian government cannot contemplate the openness of information the search engine represents .
China , already the largest internet nation , will be stubbornly closed to Google 's best endeavours .
The other is that there is going to be one hell of an antitrust case coming .
Google 's in so many places at so many times , and so dominant particularly in search , that it cannot avoid this : it 'll move into some new market , and someone will raise a huge stink about how it is using its power in search to take over a new market .
( A reminder : having a monopoly is n't illegal .
Using that monopoly to force others out of other markets is . )
As Microsoft discovered , fighting an antitrust case takes the creative wind out of your sails ; it becomes all you can do to row to shore .
The Microsoft of 10 years ago was cocky , confident ; today it 's vast , but uncertain , overwhelmed by its bureaucracy .
That could be Google 's fate – even as in 10 years we use its tools all the time , and a significant number of people use phones and computers based around its products , it will be becoming sclerotic .
And then it will be time for something completely new to burst onto the scene .
Very probably the people who are going to do that have only just started their first day at secondary school ( high school to our American readers ) .
You can't guess what it will be .
But if some kids ask to use your garage for a computer project , my advice would be to let them – and ask if they 'll let you fund them in exchange for a few shares .
Ask for 10 % .
If it pays off , by 2030 you 'll never need to work again .

Ms. Palin used the interview to reinforce the muscular foreign policy of Mr. McCain , saying she would not second - guess any military action Israel deems necessary to protect itself , warning Russia away from aggression against its neighbors and generally supporting President Bush ’s approach to combating terrorism .
But she also put some distance between the administration and the McCain team .
“ There have been blunders along the way , ” she said .

Ms. Palin came into the interview with heavy preparation from Mr. McCain ’s top political and policy advisers , many of whom accompanied her home to Alaska , where Mr. Gibson will be holding a series of question - and - answer sessions with her through Friday afternoon .
The McCain campaign has kept Ms. Palin away from reporters and off the interview circuit traditionally traveled by vice - presidential nominees , but was under pressure to place her before a nationally recognized journalist .
There were conflicting signals from the campaign about whether it would consider Mr. Gibson ’s interview session the first of many or one of the few .
In choosing Mr. Gibson as Ms. Palin ’s interlocutor , the campaign was going with a journalist known for having a mild manner but the gravitas to be taken seriously .
But the interview was hardly gentle , as Mr. Gibson pressed Ms. Palin for direct answers to some of the complicated foreign policy and national security issues facing the next administration .
Ms. Palin said the United States could not allow Iran to have nuclear weapons .
As Americans , she said , “ we do not have to stand for that . ”
She advocated a new round of sanctions .
But Mr. Gibson noted that threats of new sanctions had failed to stem Iran ’s nuclear program so far and asked Ms. Palin whether she would back Israel if it were to seek to eliminate Iran ’s facilities militarily .

The bra and panties stand for women ’s rights .
Davy Crockett shaking hands with Daniel Boone symbolizes how we need to put aside our differences .
The skull and crossbones , in the lower right corner , stands for pirates , and all that they have given us .
The angel holding the sword represents how guns are nice but swords are more of a “ heavenly ” thing .
The plow with the four - leaf clover symbolizes the luck of the farmer .
The quicksand represents the travails of life .
The hand sticking out of it is so you know it ’s quicksand and not just a dirty spot on the flag .
The bat stands for eternal life , through our lord Dracula .
The sheaf of wheat symbolizes the bounty of the land , and the hope that soon more things will come in sheaves .
The parrot represents the need to communicate , even if it ’s only squawks .
The tin of paprika stands for paprika , a spice I hope to learn more about .
The triskelion indicates that I know what a triskelion is .
The sun on the horizon makes you wonder , Is it rising or setting ?
And is it our sun or a weird invader sun ?
The five rays coming out of the sun symbolize the five times that I have had sex .
The big word “ NO ” refers to the boy running with the pair of scissors .
If you look closer , you can see that he also has a pair of scissors sticking in his thigh and another in his belly .
This symbolizes the need for kids not to run with scissors , especially if they ’ve already been stuck by scissors .
The bulldozer pushing over the pine tree stands for progress .
And the bluebird flying out of the tree symbolizes the way bluebirds fly off when you knock down their trees .
The rose stands for blood .
So does the sparkling ruby .
And so does the bucket with “ Blood ” written on the side .
All hail Dracula !
The eagle , you will note , is the centerpiece of my flag .
It symbolizes freedom .
Also the ability to see far away , so you can spot somebody doing something fishy and get him locked up .
In his talon , the eagle is holding a clutch of arrows .
This symbolizes the growing problem of Indian litterbugs .
Wrapped around the eagle ’s other talon is a big ball of fishing line , which represents my love of fishing .
The banner in the eagle ’s beak , if you ca n’t read it , says “ Courage , Valor , Dignity , ANTS !! ”
It ’s easy to tell what some of the symbols on my flag mean .
The tweezers symbolize tweezing .
The dog symbolizes doggies .
Good boy !
Good doggie !
But the meaning of other symbols is not so clear , even to me .
What does the T. rex stepping on the Martian mean ?
Perhaps scholars can figure it out .
My flag started out as nothing more than the word “ NO ” on a blank background and has evolved over the years .
Recently , my friend Don told me that my flag had too many symbols , that it was “ cluttered . ”
I wanted to punch him , but instead I ran out into the howling storm , fell on my knees , and railed against the night .
“ Why me , Lord ? ” I sobbed .
“ Why me ? ”
Then I saw my flag , illuminated by my spotlight and my rotating Christmas color wheel , flying proudly above the tool shed .
As the flag snapped in the wind , some of my symbols , which I guess I had n’t sewn on too well , flew off like leaves .
There were also some real leaves blowing by , but mostly it was symbols .
And I thought , Maybe Don ’s right .
Maybe I do need to “ thin out ” my flag .
So I wound up removing some of the symbols , leaving only the ones you see here today .
If it ’s still “ cluttered , ” then so be it .
I would rather have a cluttered flag than one that has no meaning whatsoever . ♦
Science Debate 2008 has asked Senators Barack Obama and John McCain to answer 14 top science questions facing America today .
The theory is that we are living in a science dominated world and we should know where the candidates stand on science issues – a topic not usually covered by the press .
Obama sent in his answers a couple of weeks ago and McCain ’s appeared today .
A side - by - side comparison of the candidate 's replies can be found here .
However , perhaps a set of prepared responses to a set of prepared questions is not the most telling way to judge a candidate ’s stance on science issues - or any other issue for that matter .
Do n’t get me wrong , I ’m glad the folks at Science Debate 2008 have set up the questionnaire and am pleased that both candidates took it seriously enough to provide answers .
But , perhaps the most telling glimpse into a candidate ’s views on a subject can be obtained when that subject comes up during a live interview .
Here ’s what John McCain had to say today when speaking to the Associated Press and Florida newspapers :
" That 's nearly a million every day , every working day he 's been in Congress , " McCain said .
" And when you look at some of the planetariums and other foolishness that he asked for , he should n't be saying anything about Governor Palin . "
This was a comment about Obama ’s earmark requests in response to queries about the earmarks Governor Palin has requested for Alaska .
Quite frankly , I am left speechless at the phrase : " planetariums and other foolishness . "
Perhaps I ’m biased , but I never thought of planetariums as being foolish .
So , I did some checking on the internet .
This is one of the great things about this election – the actual facts can be checked by anyone on the web .
Here is the text from Obama ’s FY08 funding request :
Adler Planetarium , to support replacement of its projector and related equipment , $ 3,000,000 : One of its most popular attractions and teaching tools at the Adler Planetarium is the Sky Theater .
The projection equipment in this theater is 40 years old , and is no longer supported with parts or service by the manufacturer .
It has begun to fail , leaving the theater dark and groups of school students and other interested museum - goers without this very valuable and exciting learning experience .
Sorry , but replacing 40 year old equipment at one of the leading science education facilities in this country ( the Adler Planetarium is located in downtown Chicago and is the oldest planetarium in the Western Hemisphere in existence today ) is one of the best investments in the future that I can think of .
I ’ve always equated planetariums with science education - an area where the US seems to be lacking .
In fact , the state - funded university where I was an undergraduate had one and its projection equipment was less than 40 years old .
In fact , when I was in the 4th grade , my class took a field trip to the McDonnell Planetarium in Forest Park .
It was one of the coolest things I did in grade school ( well , that and the trip to see the Egyptian mummies ) and I remember it to this day .
I wonder what Senator McCain would say if Senator Obama had supported funding for a hockey arena instead .

Pass It On : Our Own Agenda- 10 Policies For a Better America
You ’ve heard it before : Ralph Nader is too radical to be president .
But is he too radical for the 73 % of Americans who say corporations do n’t pay enough taxes ?
Too radical for the 80 % who want to increase the minimum wage ?
Too radical for the 64 % who favor a national health care program , or the 56 % calling for a renegotiation of NAFTA ?
A recent Yes ! article suggests that Ralph Nader may just be mainstream America ’s dream candidate .
Onward !

New Intel Chip Threatens Video Card Obsolesence with Discrete Graphics Processor
Dubbed " Larrabee " , the chip was unveiled at this year 's SIGGRAPH conference and sports a variety of new technical features , including a fully coherent memory subsystem which allows for more efficient multi-chip implementation .
Should the x86 - based graphical rendering capabilities prove viable to developers , Larrabee could serve as a cost - efficient alternative to expensive PC video cards , such as those produced by AMD and Nvidia .
TechReport explains the chip and its features as follows :
One potential positive of Larrabee 's fully coherent memory subsystem is the possibility of much more efficient multi-chip implementations .
Nvidia and AMD are essentially managing the coherency problem manually via custom game profiles for multi-GPU setups right now .
When I asked about this issue , Intel said it did n't expect to have the same pain as its competitors in this area .
The possible downsides of all - software implementations of things like the render back - end are also rather apparent .
We saw this illustrated nicely when the Radeon HD 4800 series brought a vast improvement over the shader - based MSAA resolve used in the Radeon HD 2900 and 3800 series products .
Somewhat comically , the initial reactions to the Larrabee architecture disclosures from Intel are mixed along clear dividing lines .
When I pinged David Kanter , the CPU guru at Real World Tech , about it , he was very much impressed with the choices Intel had made and generally positive about the prospects .
Meanwhile , Rys over at Beyond3D expressed quite a bit of skepticism about the chip 's likely performance and area efficiency for graphics versus more traditional architectures .
Intel expects engineering samples of the chip by the end of the year , followed by a general market release in late 2009 to early 2010 .
Our earnestness our sincerity … when we learned to sing America .
When studying Greek political thought , I ’m tempted to think Americans especially naive .
For an example , consider Antigone .
Antigone invokes the gods ;
Creon fears disobedience of his edict will destroy the city .
That ’s the surface , but a closer look shows the play refusing to be such a simple conflict .
Creon absolutely is a tyrant , declaring himself in charge and setting down his one law to consolidate rule .
He ’s a terrible , stupid excuse for a human .
His conversation with Haemon demonstrates a complete contempt for women , not just Antigone , and an utter inability to see his own son as anything other than a possession .
Thus , it seems opposing Creon ’s rule is perfectly just .
We witness Creon angrily argue with nearly everyone else in the play as if no one recognizes him as the ruler of his own room , much less Thebes .
But Antigone ’s own motives are complicated .
She has no concern for the life of her living sister and barely mentions the other brother who died in the fighting .
Though she confronts Creon with his hubris , her final justification for her action sounds warped .
She buried Polynices because she can always have another husband or son , but she can never have another brother .
It is safe to conclude that Antigone , like Creon , has no idea who actual people are .
Like him , she has an idea that she ’s part of a family and that family should be honored .
Creon cannot abide a hint of dishonor , and Antigone ’s first conversation with Ismene reveals she cares far more about the slights the family name has received than her sister ’s well - being .
Antigone and Creon are not merely thin - skinned , as they are completely unable to engage other people properly .
If , as a matter of convention , we value obedience to law and honor families dedicated to public service , we hold that distance from other people is a political necessity .
It ’s what makes a true political leader committed to order , we think , than some individual good .
I look at this sort of reflection on the public and the private — how the family is the heart of the city , but is itself an unstable concept which could destroy civic order — and then I consider how my country thinks .
If people do n’t believe the Trumps are a great family , deserving of rule , they believe the Kennedys and Bushes are .
People believe large amounts of wealth indicate large amounts of skill or favor from God Himself .
If something is on television a lot , it must be good , or else why would it be on television ?
I know –it is n’t fair of me to compare Antigone to common opinion .
American contributions to drama , cinema , visual art , sculpture , dance , music , and a host of other artistic endeavors are incredibly thoughtful .
If Americans on the whole are naive , then it is purposeful .
“ Our earnestness our sincerity , ” part of the achievement :
America ( from The Atlantic ) Alicia Ostriker
Do you remember our earnestness our sincerity
In first grade when we learned to sing America The Beautiful along with the Star - Spangled Banner And say the Pledge of Allegiance to America
We put our hands over our first - grade hearts
We felt proud to be part of America I said One Nation Invisible until corrected Maybe I was right about America School days school days dear old Golden Rule days
When we learned how to behave in America
What to wear how to smoke how to despise our parents
Who did n’t understand us or America Only later understanding the Banner and the Beautiful Lived on opposite sides of the street in America
Only later discovering this land is two lands
One triumphant bully one hopeful America Sometimes I still put my hand tenderly on my heart Somehow or other still carried away by America
Earnestness and sincerity as part of a larger project are complicated to explain , but Ostriker ’s musing helps .
When , “ in first grade … we learned to sing America , ” no one meant to brainwash kids .
Nor did they mean to create a civic faith which would deepen with liberal learning .
What you see as an earnest first grader is “ The Beautiful along with the Star - Spangled . ”
You name the place you ’re in .
“ America . ”
You sing it as good .
“ Star - Spangled ” sounds awesome , you stumble over the syllables of “ spangled . ”
You have no idea what it means .
You feel “ proud . ”
It ’s higher but related to the same pride you have pretending to be a ninja while watching Power Rangers or powering up a Pokemon .
These are “ first - grade hearts ” — earnest , sincere , innocent above all .
*
Innocence is fine for 6 year olds .
We ’d like them to know words .
We ’d like them to fill with pride as they learn more .
I said One Nation Invisible until corrected Maybe I was right about America
The teacher wants the word “ indivisible ” learned .
Curious .
The word does n’t really have a use outside of the Pledge .
They want the Pledge said correctly , but a child ’s patriotism or enthusiasm is n’t in question .
What matters is the uniformity : the Pledge as proper ritual , said all together , and no teasing of one for not knowing “ indivisible . ”
No one means to brainwash a child , but we have yet to speak about adulthood .
Ostriker then bursts into sing - song about where and when she was taught to behave : “ School days school days dear old Golden Rule days . ”
More than family , more than song , more than teachers , peers at school taught .
Adults in America get so frustrated with their children ’s friends .
Why is a kid not listening to their elders ?
Why are they going to some other kid to learn “ what to wear ” or “ how to smoke ? ”
Amazing that adults ca n’t stop for one second and realize they ’re not dealing with first - graders any more .
What a kid , teenager , or college student wants to understand is how their interactions with others work .
Their own independence and distinctiveness .
How to exert control , demonstrate value , gain respect .
Amazing so many adults refuse to ask about any of this or appreciate the complexity involved .
Nationalism or blind patriotism alone do n’t make adults hopelessly rule - bound , unable to understand their own growth .
Rather , it ’s the assumption growth is natural and inevitable which drives the narrow - mindedness which in turn feeds the nationalism .
One ugly sentiment captures it perfectly : “ Why are n’t they grateful , ” where “ they , ” for example , have households worth $ 8 in the same city “ we ” have ones worth $ 250,000 .
“ The Golden Rule ” Ostriker intones is deeply problematic in an American context .
It is easy to do unto others as they do unto you when segregated by race and class .
Relative equality denies the moral principle any force , or for that matter , any moral content .
Still , kids and their peers , despite their lack of knowledge , despite their conformity , see through the Golden Rule somehow .
Something regarding their anxiety about being a part of their generation helps them .
When I taught Kant ’s “ Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals ” a few months ago , we puzzled over “ Act in such a way as to treat humanity , whether in your own person or in that of anyone else , always as an end and never merely as a means . ”
Never treating another as a means resonated with my students immediately .
They knew how wrong it is to simply use people .
Treating others as ends ?
That ’s more complicated .
What does it mean for society if we put our individual goals aside to ensure the welfare of others ?
In some ways , we do this already .
But the ways we do n’t would change everything if attended to .
*
The quiet drama of Ostriker ’s “ America ” concerns growth .
Whitman ’s “ I Hear America Singing ” celebrates individuality and industry as musical .
Hughes ’ response in “ I , Too ” sings those neglected , bearing witness to their strength and the strength of their songs and hopes .
Ostriker ’s growth is different .
Older , she now sees “ this land is two lands . ”
That the flag is used in the service of a great denial : “ the Banner and the Beautiful … [ live ] on opposite sides of the street . ”
I take this to be an echo of Nikole Hannah - Jones in the introductory essay of the 1619 project :
The United States is a nation founded on both an ideal and a lie .
Our Declaration of Independence , signed on July 4 , 1776 , proclaims that ‘‘ all men are created equal ’’ and ‘‘ endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights . ’’
But the white men who drafted those words did not believe them to be true for the hundreds of thousands of black people in their midst .
‘‘ Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness ’’ did not apply to fully one - fifth of the country .
Yet despite being violently denied the freedom and justice promised to all , black Americans believed fervently in the American creed .
Through centuries of black resistance and protest , we have helped the country live up to its founding ideals .

Ostriker ’s growth , you could say , resides in grasping the difficulty of the ideal being a lie .
If you see the opposite side of the street , you have only begun to look .
There are no easy , balanced dichotomies even when one has located good and evil : “ one triumphant bully one hopeful America . ”
The complexity of truth comes into sharp relief with the pull nostalgia still has on her :
Sometimes I still put my hand tenderly on my heart Somehow or other still carried away by America
It ’s not a naive pull or a faded pride .
It ’s the product of confrontation with belief itself .
This is growth .
Not unwavering triumph or resolve , nor all things settled , but the acceptance of being swayed in an ambiguous world .
We need to check your system to make sure it meets the minimum requirments .

Senator Barack Obama is a man of few rhetorical stumbles , but this week a few of his words opened a racial door his campaign would prefer not to step through .
When Senator John McCain ’s camp replied by accusing him of playing the race card from the bottom of the deck , the Obama campaign seemed at least momentarily off balance .
The instinctive urge to punch back was tempered by the fact that race is a fire that could singe both candidates .
So on Friday the Obama campaign , a carefully controlled lot on the best of days , reacted most cautiously as it sought to tamp down any sense that it was at war with Mr. McCain over who was the first to inject race into the contest .
Mr. Obama made no mention of the issue , except for a brief reference in an interview with a local newspaper in Florida .
“ I was in Union , Mo. , which is 98 percent white , a rural conservative , and what I said was what I think everyone knows , which is that I do n’t look like I came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates , ” he told The St. Petersburg Times .
“ There was nobody there who thought at all that I was trying to inject race in this . ”
The furor started on Thursday when Rick Davis , Mr. McCain ’s campaign manager , said , “ Barack Obama has played the race card , and he played it from the bottom of the deck . ”
Mr. Davis was alluding to Mr. Obama ’s remarks on Wednesday that Republicans would try to scare voters by pointing out that he “ does n’t look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills . ”

KABUL , Afghanistan , Sept. 28 ( UPI ) --
The Taliban and the Afghanistan government have been involved in secret peace talks to bring an end to the conflict , The Observer reported Sunday .
The British newspaper said it had learned a senior former Taliban leader has been talking to Kabul officials in a loose peace process facilitated by Saudi Arabia and given logistical support by Britain .
The unnamed Taliban negotiator has been shuttling between the militant Islamist group 's bases , Saudi Arabia and European capitals , sources told The Observer .

The revelation contradicts British government statements that negotiations with the Taliban , denounced as a terrorist organization , could only happen when it had given up violence , the newspaper said .
The secret talks , however , have lost momentum in recent weeks , unnamed Afghan officials said .
" They keep changing what they are asking for , " one official told the newspaper .
" One day it is one thing , the next another . "
He said one aim of the talks was to drive a wedge between the Taliban and Osama bin Laden 's al - Qaida terrorist organization .
The Irish stock market has reacted positively to the decision by the Government to guarantee all deposits and borrowings for the six Irish - owned banks for the next two years .
The ISEQ eventually closed up almost 8 % at 3,551 .
The banks covered are : Allied Irish Bank , Bank of Ireland , Anglo Irish Bank , Irish Life & Permanent , which owns permanent tsb , Irish Nationwide Building Society and the EBS ( Educational Building Society ) .
Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan speaks to David Murphy about the Govt 's decision to guarantee deposits .
Watch
How are your savings affected ?
See the protection in place for Irish banks .
Today 's Dáil schedule was rearranged to allow for the introduction of emergency legislation covering the guarantee .
Specific subsidiaries that may be approved by Government following consultation with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator are also covered under the guarantee .
The guarantee also covers all money borrowed by Irish banks from other financial institutions and the statement from the Department of Finance says all deposits , bonds and debt will be covered by the State .
EC to study details
The European Commission has said it would study details of the decision to see whether the move complied with EU competition rules .
A commission spokesperson said that the EC had been in touch with the Irish authorities and if there was any State aid involved it would look at it as a matter of urgency .
The two - year guarantee is being provided on commercial terms to the institutions .
The decision in effect means that the Government has decided that the Irish taxpayer will now provide a guarantee for € 400bn of liabilities .
It does not apply to the liabilities of Ulster Bank , National Irish Bank , ACCBank or Rabobank , which are all supported by large overseas parent banks .
The Government says that the interest of the taxpayers will be protected by charging for the guarantee at commercial rates .
However it is not clear what those rates are .
The guarantee provided will also be subject to terms and conditions , although there is no announcement yet about what those terms and conditions will be .
In a statement , the Government said that all financial institutions in Ireland will be subject to normal ongoing regulatory requirements .
It added that the guarantee is first and foremost in the interest of the stability of the Irish economy and the long - term interest of the taxpayer and that a secure and stable financial sector is essential for the Irish economy and in the best interests of the Irish people .
The safety of deposits in credit institutions authorised by the Financial Regulator , aside from those covered by the Government plan , are guaranteed up to € 100,000 .
National Irish Bank , owned by Denmark 's Danske Bank , has applied to the Department of Finance to be included in the scheme .
It has received indications that it will be accepted .
Rabobank , which operates online , does not come under the € 100,000 scheme as it authorised by the Dutch Central Bank .
It is guaranteed for up to € 38,000 by the Dutch deposit guarantee scheme .
Dexia bailout
Meanwhile , Dexia has become the latest European bank to need a state bailout with Belgium , France and Luxembourg pumping € 6.4bn into the group .
The capital injection was agreed during crunch talks through the night after shares in the Belgian - French banking group plummeted by nearly 30 % yesterday .
Under its terms , various Belgian authorities and some big Belgian shareholders will contribute € 3bn to the rescue by subscribing to a capital increase .
The French government and the French state financial institution Caisse des Depots will add another € 3bn to the pot while Luxembourg will invest € 376 m through a convertible loan .
Dexia was founded in 1996 as a merger of France 's Credit Local and Belgium 's Credit Communal .
While it specialises in local government finance , it also has € 5.5 m individual clients in Belgium , Luxembourg , Slovakia and Turkey .
US action along the Pakistan border has raised tensions Pakistan says its troops fired warning shots at two Nato helicopters as they crossed the border from Afghanistan .
It is the first time the Pakistan army has admitted opening fire near US or Nato forces , as tension grows over cross border military action .
Nato said its aircraft were not in Pakistani airspace when shots were fired over Khost province .
The Pentagon said they were US helicopters and that Pakistan would have to explain what had happened .
Chief Pakistani military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said that the helicopters had " crossed into our territory in Ghulam Khan area " .
" They passed over our checkpost so our troops fired warning shots , " he said .
He added that the matter was being taken up with the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) in Kabul .
' Flares ' fired However , Pakistan 's new president , Asif Ali Zardari , appeared to contradict his military spokesman , insisting that his troops had only fired " flares " to warn the helicopters they were near the Pakistan border .
The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan , in Islamabad , says that the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan is very unclear .
There is an imaginary border called the Durand line which each side marks differently .
Our correspondent says that , in reality , the border is marked by a 3 - 4 km ( 1 - 2 mile ) stretch of no man 's land .
Pakistan says that this is its territory and Afghanistan makes similar claims .
In a statement , Isaf said its helicopters had received small - arms fire from a Pakistan military checkpoint along the border near Tanai district , Khost , on 25 September " while conducting routine operations in Afghanistan " .
" At no time did Isaf helicopters cross into Pakistani airspace , " it added .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said : " The flight path of the helicopters at no point took them over Pakistan . "
He said US and Nato officials were speaking to their Pakistani counterparts to determine what had happened and to ensure there was no recurrence .
" The Pakistanis have to provide us with a better understanding of why this took place , " he said .
Local tribesmen in the area told the BBC that two helicopters were trying to cross into Pakistani territory near Ghulam Khan , in North Waziristan , when Pakistani troops at posts near the border fired at them .
There are currently two Western military operations in Afghanistan - a US - led coalition and the Nato - led Isaf mission .
It appears the helicopters involved in Thursday 's incident were US OH - 58 reconnaissance aircraft operating under the Nato flag .
The BBC's Martin Patience , in Kabul , says it is believed to be the first time Nato helicopters have been fired on in this fashion .
BORDER TENSIONS 3 Sept : First reported ground assault by US troops in Pakistan - Islamabad responds furiously 15 Sept : Pakistani troops reportedly fire in air to stop US troops crossing in S Waziristan 17 Sept : Top US military chief Adm Mike Mullen visits Pakistan to calm tensions 16 Sept : Pakistan says it was not told of fresh US missile strike 22 Sept : Pakistani troops in fresh firing to deter US incursion into N Waziristan , officials say 25 Sept : Pakistani troops fire warning shots at Nato helicopters on border with Khost
The Afghan - Pakistan militant nexus US attacks raise stakes in Pakistan Correspondents say there is growing anger in Pakistan at US forces in Afghanistan allegedly violating Pakistani sovereignty .
The remote Afghan - Pakistani frontier is rife with militant groups .
BBC defence correspondent Rob Watson says the US doubts Pakistan 's capability - and even willingness in some quarters - to tackle Islamic extremists .
There has been growing tension between the two countries since 3 September when the US conducted its first ground assault in Pakistani territory on what it said was a militant target in South Waziristan .
Pakistan reacted angrily to the action , saying 20 innocent villagers had been killed by US troops .
Local officials have said that on two occasions since then Pakistani troops or tribesmen have opened fire to stop US forces crossing the border .
The claims were not officially confirmed .
On Wednesday , a drone believed to be operated by the CIA crashed inside Pakistan .
The US and Nato have called on Pakistan to do more to curb militants operating in the border area .

Introduction
This two - part article is aimed at experienced C# .NET programmers who wish to write their own little computer languages ( see part two here ) .
Historically , this has been reasonably difficult due to requiring in - depth knowledge of compilation theory and / or the use of one or more tools , each of which had its own learning curves .
Recently though , there has been somewhat of a revolution in this area , with tools being developed which greatly simplify the writing of compilers .
The Irony Compiler Construction Toolkit for .NET is used in this tutorial due to the fact that it requires no configuration files etc. ( Just drop the Irony DLL into your project ) and it simplifies many aspects of compiler construction .
The Sample Problem
Imagine you are writing a content - management system for websites where your users can upload their own images .
Now , imagine you have a client who wants to upload a large image , and then display only part of the image , but have the image scrolling around , like so :
And oh , here 's the next thing : they want to be able to set up the way the " camera " scrolls across the image , and change it themselves .
So , it is decided that the users will type instructions into a textbox to control the scrolling of the images .
The language will look something like this :
Set camera size : 400 by 300 pixels .
Set camera position : 100 , 100 .
Move 200 pixels right .
Move 100 pixels up .
Move 250 pixels left .
Move 50 pixels down .
It 's a far cry from C# , but having a language which basically reads like English will ( hopefully ) be appreciated by the users .
This language is so simple that you could easily write your own parser that extracts the data from the string ; however , as soon as the language gets a little more complicated ( for example , if you introduce " if " statements and variables , as in part II of this article ) , then writing a bona - fide compiler will pay dividends .
So , how do we write a compiler for this language ?
Well , the first step is to formally describe the language .
Defining the Grammar
Looking at the language example above , we can say that a program starts with a line to set the camera size , then a line to set the initial position , and then one or more lines to move the camera .
Each line ends with a '. ' character .
Most of the text is just fixed keywords ( such as " Move " and " camera " ) , with the exception of numbers and directions ( " up " , " down " , " left " , " right " ) .
The language can be written in upper - case or lower - case ( or a combination ) .
The paragraph above explains the grammar ; however , it is always a good idea to write this description in a more formal manner .
A very common way to describe a grammar is using Backus–Naur Form , and the following is a slightly non-standard version of BNF describing the program :
< Program > ::= < CameraSize > < CameraPosition > < CommandList > < CameraSize > ::= " set " " camera " " size " " : " < number > " by " < number > " pixels " " . " < CameraPosition > ::= " set " " camera " " position " " : " < number > " , " < number > " . " < CommandList > ::= < Command >+ < Command > ::= " move " < number > " pixels " < Direction > " . " < Direction > ::= " up " | " down " | " left " | " right "
You can read " ::= " as something like " is made up of " , and " | " as " or " .
So , for example , a " Direction " is made up of one of four string s .
If you have written in BNF previously , you may be surprised to see " < Command > + " , which uses the regular - expression convention to mean " one or more commands " .
This is not standard in grammars ( or in BNF ) ; however , Irony lets you do this ( I will not go into the more complicated traditional way to achieve the same thing ) .
A grammar always ends up as a tree with a single root .
For any ( valid ) program that we input into the compiler , a tree will be created with " Program " as the root node .
This will have three children : " CameraSize " , " CameraPosition " , and " CommandList " .
This will continue down into the tree until the leaf nodes , which will be the keywords , numbers , and directions .
The most important job of the compiler then is to convert the source code into a tree which is termed as an " Abstract Syntax Tree " ( AST ) .
So , based on the grammar above , with the following program ...
Set camera size : 400 by 300 pixels .
Set camera position : 100 , 100 .
Move 200 pixels right .
Move 100 pixels up .
... we should get the following Abstract Syntax Tree :
Note that the blue nodes are called " Non-terminals " whereas the orange nodes are called " Terminals " .
The terminals correspond to the actual code the user has entered .
While conventionally terminals such as " set " , " camera " , and " size " would come under the " CameraSize " node , when using Irony , you can ignore these non-useful terminals ( more on this later ) .
Once we have a tree , we can then generate the code to execute the program .
So , how do we do all this with Irony ?
Writing the Grammar in Irony
After you have downloaded Irony , create a new project in Visual Studio , and add a reference to Irony.dll .
Then , add a new class to define the grammar : CameraControlGrammar.cs will do .
After referencing the correct Irony namespace ( using Irony .
Compiler ; ) , make your class inherit from the abstract " Grammar " class :
public class CameraControlGrammar : Grammar
The grammar of the language is defined in the constructor .
The first part is to do some preparation for the actual grammar , and set a few options , for example , making it case - insensitive :
this .
CaseSensitive = false ;
Then , define all the terminals and non-terminals needed :
var program = new NonTerminal ( " program " ) ; var cameraSize = new NonTerminal ( " cameraSize " ) ; var cameraPosition = new NonTerminal ( " cameraPosition " ) ; var commandList = new NonTerminal ( " commandList " ) ; var command = new NonTerminal ( " command " ) ; var direction = new NonTerminal ( " direction " ) ; var number = new NumberLiteral ( " number " ) ;
And finally , specify which non-terminal is the root node in the abstract syntax tree :
this .
Root = program ;
OK , with the ingredients all cut up and prepared , we can start cooking .
Defining the grammar in Irony is surprisingly similar to writing it in BNF form :
program .
Rule = cameraSize + cameraPosition + commandList ; cameraSize.Rule = Symbol ( " set " ) + " camera " + " size " + " :" + number + " by " + number + " pixels " + " . " ; cameraPosition .
Rule = Symbol ( " set " ) + " camera " + " position " + " :" + number + " , " + number + " . " ; commandList.Rule = MakePlusRule( commandList , null , command ) ; command .
Rule = Symbol ( " move " ) + number + " pixels " + direction + " . " ; direction .
Rule = Symbol ( " up " ) | " down " | " left " | " right " ;
Irony has overloaded the " + " and " | " operators so that you can join together the different parts of the grammar in a very natural way .
The only exception is where the first part of the rule is a string : in general , you should wrap the first string in a Symbol ( ) method call so that the C# compiler knows that the string is actually a special Irony construct .
Also note , rather than having " set camera size : " in a single string , we add each word separately , which allows any whitespace ( including new lines ) to go between each word .
Finally - and this is optional , but recommended - you can specify certain string s as " punctuation " .
On each line , there are lots of keywords that we do n't actually care about once we are using the generated AST ( for example , on each " move " line , we only care about the number of pixels and the direction ) .
We can tell Irony that we do n't want the AST cluttered with keywords by registering all the " punctuation " :
this .RegisterPunctuation ( " set " , " camera " , " size " , " : " , " by " , " pixels " , " . " , " position " , " , " , " move " ) ;
This means a " Command " will have only two children ( number and direction ) instead of five children ( " move " , number , " pixels " , direction , and " . " ) .
Compiling the Source code
We are now ready to parse some code .
This is done by passing an instance of your grammar to a LanguageCompiler object and getting a reference to the root node of the AST :
CameraControlGrammar grammar = new CameraControlGrammar( ) ; LanguageCompiler compiler = new LanguageCompiler ( grammar ) ; AstNode program = compiler .
Parse ( " the source code as a string " ) ;
Assuming the source code successfully compiled , you can run this in debug mode and browse through the ChildNodes property of each node in the tree to view it .
( See the attached project to see one way to handle invalid source code . )
Using an Abstract Syntax Tree
An elegant way to generate code from an AST is to write a class for each non-terminal node in the tree , and then each node in the tree simply generates the piece of code that it is responsible for .
This is a very good pattern to use , especially when dealing with more complex languages ; however , to keep things relatively simple , I will simply act directly on the returned AST ( for an example which uses classes to generate code , see JSBasic which converts from BASIC to JavaScript ) .
Examining the tree above , we know that the first child node of the tree is the camera size declaration , which should have two children itself : the width and the height of the camera :
AstNode cameraSizeNode = program .ChildNodes [ 0 ] ; Token widthToken = ( Token ) cameraSizeNode . ChildNodes [ 0 ] ; int width = ( int ) widthToken .
Value ; Token heightToken = ( Token ) cameraSizeNode . ChildNodes [ 1 ] ; int height = ( int ) heightToken .
Value ;
Note that the actual number entered is considered a Token ( in fact , each piece of text in the source code is a Token ) ; however , not all ChildNode s are Token s ( e.g. , " CommandList " is a ChildNode of Program ; however , it is a non-terminal , so not a token ) .
This is why we must convert the children to Token objects before accessing their values .
A similar deal is used to get the initial position .
These camera sizes and positional values are used in the demo project to create some JavaScript which initialises the photo .
( The actual JavaScript is not explained here as it is outside the scope of this article . )
Next , we know that the third child of the program is a list of Command nodes , which we can then loop through :
foreach ( AstNode commandNode in program .
ChildNodes [ 2 ]. ChildNodes ) { Token pixelsToken = ( Token ) commandNode.ChildNodes [ 0 ] ; int pixelsToMove = ( int ) pixelsToken .
Value ; Token directionToken = ( Token ) commandNode. ChildNodes [ 1 ] ; string directionText = directionToken .
Text. ToLower ( ) ; }
Using the pixelsToMove and directionText values , JavaScript is generated for each command in the program .
Again , this is left out as it is n't important in terms of how to write your language .
And We 're Done
And that 's all there is to it , really .
Of course , once you introduce variables , branch and conditional statements etcetera , you would probably want to look into creating your own AST node classes and look at the AstNode .
Evaluate method ; however , that is for another tutorial , along with many other Irony features which have been left out in this tutorial .
Hopefully though , this should give you enough information to allow you to write your own simple little languages .
And do n't forget to try the online demo .

GREELEY — Allen Andrade told his girlfriend that he “ snapped ” when he learned the woman he had oral sex with the night before was biologically a man .
Indeed , until he confronted 18 - year - old Angie Zapata in her Greeley apartment in July , Andrade had no reason to believe she was born Justin Zapata , Andrade ’s attorney argued Thursday at his preliminary hearing in Weld County District Court .
Zapata ’s closet was full of women ’s clothes and her apartment was decorated with a female ’s touch , testified Greeley police Detective Greg Tharp .
Only when Andrade grabbed at Zapata ’s crotch did he discover the truth .
But when she smiled at him and said , “ I ’m all woman , ” it drove an enraged Andrade to commit murder , attorney Annette Kundelius said .
“ At best , this is a case about passion , ” Kundelius said .
“ When ( Zapata ) smiled at him , this was a highly provoking act , and it would cause someone to have an aggressive reaction . ”
She argued Thursday that the first - degree murder charge filed against Andrade for Zapata ’s murder be dropped to second - degree murder .
But Weld County District Judge Marcelo Kopcow ruled otherwise Thursday , citing evidence the 31 - year - old Andrade killed Zapata with deliberation .
Andrade hit Zapata several times with a fire extinguisher after he confronted her about her transgender status , Kopcow said .
He said he also considered several statements Andrade allegedly made while in custody that showed his anger toward Zapata and gays in general , including Andrade referring to Zapata as “ it . ”
When his girlfriend told him her cellphone was dying during a conversation with him , he said that was gay and “ all gay things need to die , ” Tharp said .
Andrade also said that he was trying to put the murder behind him and there was “ no use crying over spilled milk , ” Tharp said .
Kopcow declined to drop a felony bias - motivated crime charge , which could lengthen Andrade ’s sentence if convicted .
The judge refused to set bail for Andrade , citing the capital nature of the crime .
Another hearing in the case is set for Nov. 6 .

Palin and pro-gay books : A new chapter unfolds
by Jeremy Hooper
Last week , we presented some of the claims and allegations regarding Sarah Palin and her supposed " inquiries " about banning certain library books while mayor of Wasilla , AK .
And in doing so , we caught some crap from folks who thought that by simply putting the information -- which , it should be noted , had merited a full exploration from ABC News -- out there , we were working too much from a place of rumor and conjecture rather than fact .
This despite the fact that we explicitly acknowledged that the claims were unverified -- there were some who simply thought we were unfairly fueling speculation .
Well , critics and skeptics , get ready .
Because when claims like the following merit the attention of a scrappy little outfit like The New York Times , we , as fans of both gays and literary freedom , have no choice but to present them to our peeps :
NY Times , 9/14/08
The new mayor also tended carefully to her evangelical base .
She appointed a pastor to the town planning board .
And she began to eye the library .
For years , social conservatives had pressed the library director to remove books they considered immoral .
“ People would bring books back censored , ” recalled former Mayor John Stein , Ms. Palin ’s predecessor .
“ Pages would get marked up or torn out . ”
Witnesses and contemporary news accounts say Ms. Palin asked the librarian about removing books from the shelves .
The McCain - Palin presidential campaign says Ms. Palin never advocated censorship .
But in 1995 , Ms. Palin , then a city councilwoman , told colleagues that she had noticed the book “ Daddy ’s Roommate ” on the shelves and that it did not belong there , according to [ Laura Chase , the campaign manager during Ms. Palin ’s first run for mayor in 1996 ] and Mr. Stein .
Ms. Chase read the book , which helps children understand homosexuality , and said it was inoffensive ; she suggested that Ms. Palin read it .
“ Sarah said she did n’t need to read that stuff , ” Ms. Chase said .
“ It was disturbing that someone would be willing to remove a book from the library and she did n’t even read it . ”
“ I ’m still proud of Sarah , ” she added , “ but she scares the bejeebers out of me . ”
***
So there ya have it -- yet another claim involving yet another gay - themed book .
You do n't have to believe the chatter if you do n't want .
But please direct your focus towards shooting down the allegations rather than shooting down the messenger .

( - promoted by Julien Sharp ) I just spent the evening having dinner with Alaska 's most influential bloggers : What Do I Know ? , Progressive Alaska , Alaska Real , Mudflats and Immoral Minority , a former Anchorage radio talk show host , friends and a video team from the U.K .
Most importantly , I met a man I 've revered for 14 years , retired Valley Baptist Pastor Howard Bess .
Howard is the man who wrote the book , " Pastor , I Am Gay " ... the book Sarah Palin specifically targeted to be removed from the Wasilla library .
( I respected him long before that .
He supported those of us in 1993 fighting for an Anchorage Ordinance to add " sexual orientation " to the protected classes in Municipal employment .
It 's what made him and his book a target in the first place . )
I happened to meet the U.K. film crew at the women 's rally and they took an interest in me as a blogger .
When I was invited to this dinner , I askedk our host if they could come as well .
He said yes .
I watched and participated tonight while this U.K. film crew got Howard 's story on video .
Since the journalist from Salon.com could n't come and the reporter from " The Nation " had to leave ( the folks who were the reason for the gathering ) it would have been a missed opportunity to really get this story out had it not been my " chance " encounter with this quirky film crew .
There are no coincidences .
There was something really powerful about watching Howard speak in simple terms about the threats , intimidation and his eventual forced retirement and his church 's excommunication from the American Baptists over his stances on LGBT issues and that book .
It 's easy to forget how frightening truth in the form of the written word can be to the enemies of truth .
It 's also easy to forget that while our countrymen and women fought and died for over 200 years to protect our access to that truth , our friends in the U.K. did the same centuries before us .
Listening to the film crew , they are quite literally terrified by the thought of someone like Sarah Palin being in the White House only a heartbeat away from being the " Leader of the Free World . "
Sadly , the U.K. seems more terrified than most in the U.S. I was glad that David Talbot of Salon.com ( the other reporter who was supposed to come to the dinner ) got his interview with Howard Bess and he did a great job .
However , I think that the story will be much more powerful on film .
This ordinary - looking plain - speaking man and his wonderful wife are heroes because they believe that God loves everyone equally and worshipping Him in ANY church is a right as children of God .
They show every Christian and any other religious person the true meaning of the words " Love Won Out . "

( A) Rumors and gossip often start somewhere .
If this situation had been made up from whole cloth , there would be an issue .
But getting to the bottom of an issue , to find the true details , to verify whatever happened , or to discover that it 's entirely fabricated is important .
For how much people roasted Obama as an " unknown " they seem to be quite eager to be blissfully ignorant of Palin .
She was governor and mayor , but the context of those positions matter .
( B ) Friend of mine has a great blog about censorship , with a letter from an actual librarian in response to a " concerned " mother .
http://misslettinggogetting.wordpress.com/2008/08/03/librarians-censorship-superheroes-battling-one-closed-minded-person-at-a-time/
Two good quotes from the letter :
" I think a lot of adults imagine that what defines a children ’s book is the subject .
But that ’s not the case .
Children ’s books deal with anything and everything .
There are children ’s books about death ( even suicide ) , adult alcoholism , family violence , and more .
Even the most common fairy tales have their grim side : the father and stepmother of Hansel and Gretel , facing hunger and poverty , take the children into the woods , and abandon them to die !
Little Red Riding Hood ( in the original version , anyhow ) was eaten by the wolf along with granny .
" " So what defines a children ’s book is the treatment , not the topic . "
Some people have it in their heads that homosexuality is an inappropriate topic at any age below 21 , but that 's not the case with any other topic I can think of .
But these are the same people that think if you do n't tell someone about homosexuality , they wo n't grow up to be gay , and if you do n't tell kids about condoms they wo n't have sex .

I 'm sorry if you took offense at my comment but this was the line I found troubling .
Again it is your blog and you can post what you like but somehow I think this bar is set a little to low regarding information received from outside sources .
" We do n't think it should be said , at this point , with 100 % certainly that she DID try to have books banned .
But on that same token -- it absolutely should n't be said with certainty that she DID NOT ! " Now if I exchanged words I could easily say , " We do n't think it should be said , at this point , with 100 % certainly that you DID try to have sex with children .
But on that same token -- it absolutely should n't be said with certainty that you DID NOT HAVE SEX WITH CHILDREN !
When a defendant is asked to disprove a rumor the rumor should not be presumed true until the teller of the rumor has presented it .
It 's the foundation of our criminal justice system .
That 's why I found your statement saddening .
I respect what you do , and I love reading your site and honestly I could never bear to dig through all the trash that many write about gays .
So thank you for your service and I 'm sorry if you were offended .

Tim :
Your comparison is beyond insulting , as well as an unfair argument .
Insulting , because the earlier post involved ACTUAL CLAIMS FROM PEOPLE FROM WASILLA , not outlandish character attacks about something like pedophilia !
And the point I was making is that just as it would be unfair to say that the claims presented were 100 % true , it would be unfair to deny these people of their recollections .
So I find it insulting to the very heart of reason to say you find that " troubling . "
And I say it 's unfair , because if the exact same situation were playing out involving a potential veep who HAD been accused by various locals of having " inquired " about sex with children , then YES , those claims might also need to be looked into !
There 's a difference between fueling outlandish and unfair gossip without a shred of verifiable truth , and investigating potentially troubling bits of a potential leader 's history !!

Again it 's your blog and I only commented because I thought there was a flaw in your logic .
Like I said I really like your blog , however I think the burden of proof should be the same be it charges of pedophilism or censorship .
Unless you can prove that everyone that read one version of the rumor reads the refutation than you have n't ( in my mind ) balanced the damage from what is essentially gossip .
As for the charge of banning on " Daddy 's Roommate "
The wikipedia article actually paints a different picture than previous rumors however the stories are still incongruous .
The Librarian has stated that no books were banned , yet the NYT article says that books were marked up .
Now would a mayor go in and mark up books or would that be someone that had checked out the book and than defaced it ?
They are implying that the Mayor ( Palin ) made the alterations but logically and from the statements made by the librarian that does n't follow the facts of the story .
Again these are rumors , I 've seen rumors destroy peoples lives and jobs , and I do n't think they are necessary in this political campaign .
There is no reason to demonize political opponents , there is no need to do anything besides judge their positions and their previous ability to accomplish goals .
Sadly only Biden and McCain even have a history and both of their histories are fairly gay poor .
Biden demonized HIV infected gays and gay families trying to get citizenship .
McCain turned on gay marriage advocates , it 's all messy .
But to me the bigger issues are gov't spending , and the looming issues of Medicare and social security .
My gay concerns pale in the thought that if congress does n't find a way to limit expenditures everything is going to come to a grinding stop .
Than social issues get pushed to the side as people struggle just to get by .

BOOKS are far from the important lesson in this episode .
The important point to me was that whatever she wanted the librarian to do , which the librarian was not ethically correct , PALIN then FIRED her for saying ' no .'...
The librarian was only reinstated after a large town protest and then could only stand working under PALIN's ... STALIN like governance for two years and was forced to leave a job she loved .
That is the PALIN to fear the STALIN - PALIN ...
I have not heard any American that espoused ideas closer to his in my entire life .

I 'll not criticize you for running this one .
It does n't hint at more than was there .
Unlike the previous rumor ( which it now seems may have been inaccurate ) , this does appear to at least be specific .
It is likely that Palin did have at least one gay - related book in mind when she asked her " hypothetical " question about removing books from the collection .
It would seem that had the librarian been supportive of the idea , at least one gay - supportive book would likely have been among those removed .

" It does n't hint at more than was there . "
And neither did the previous post , Timothy .

Oh Jeremy , do n't you know that it 's sexist to criticize Sarah Palin !
She 's a woman !
Posted by : Jason D | Sep 15 , 2008 10:42:16 PM
I really do not understand the anger and annoyance that has been generated from this seemingly routine post by Jeremy on Governor Palin .
It seems to me that if there is a New York Times article on this issue , as opposed to a less credible source such as the National Enquirer , it should be investigated .
Governor Palin is the potential Vice President of the US and it would be greatly concerning to myself if she did indeed engage in some form of censorship in the past .
Also , the fact that the NYT article apparently mentions a book with an LGBT theme does in my mind directly pertain to the concern and theme of this website .
It is my conclusion that this information is indeed relevant and the owner of this site was correct in posting it .
Furthermore , I find Tim 's post on pedophilia to be offensive myself .
The difference between the Palin issue and Tim's " sex with children " rumour is that the former is based on an article written by a credible news source while the later is a wild and base accusation .
Also , court hearings are not initiated under evidence of mere hearsay or rumours - actual evidence or credible witnesses need to be present for a trial to even be considered .
The first issue has witnesses in the people of Wasilla , while the other is an unfounded accusation ( and really quite ridiculous ) .
Therefore the two cannot be compared to each other because they are fundamentally incompatable .
I look forward to any further information about the Palin / censorship issue from this site .
Please keep up the good work ! :)

Given that no one else seems willing to , I will say that I absolutely agree , LOrion .
Whatever the other details of this story , the fact remains that Palin fired the librarian unfairly , seemingly because of her disapproval of censorship .
Whether or not Palin HAD the books banned , TRIED to have the books banned or merely INQUIRED about having the books banned comes secondary to the fact that she , from all appearances , is in favour of censorship and actually drove out a librarian ( TWICE ! ) because she did n't agree .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Having higher vitamin B12 levels may protect against brain shrinkage in elderly people , according to a study published on Monday .
The researchers called their findings striking , but said more information is needed before recommending that people take vitamin B12 supplements to guard against the loss of brain volume and possibly prevent declines in thinking and memory .
In the study led by David Smith and Anna Vogiatzoglou of the University of Oxford in Britain , people in the upper third of vitamin B12 levels were six times less likely to experience brain shrinkage than those in the lowest third .
The study involved 107 healthy people ages 61 to 87 who underwent scans to measure brain volume and gave blood samples to assess vitamin B12 levels once a year for up to five years .
All of those in the study had vitamin B12 levels classified in what is considered the normal range , the researchers said .
“ Our study suggests , but does not prove , that by modifying our vitamin B12 status we might be able to protect our brain and so possibly prevent cognitive decline , ” said Smith , who heads the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing .
The study , published in the journal Neurology , did not look at whether taking vitamin B12 supplements would slow the rate of brain shrinkage , Smith said .
Another study in which he is involved focuses on that question , with the results expected in 2009 , Smith added .
“ So , we think it is too early to advise people to take B12 supplements to prevent their brains from shrinking , ” he said .
“ What we can say is that our results suggest that rather than maintaining one ’s B12 at a level that is just above the cut - off for deficiency , it might be prudent to aim to keep it higher up the normal range , ” Smith said by e-mail .
Smith said that could be achieved by eating plenty of foods that are a good source of vitamin B12 such as milk and other dairy products , fish , meat and fortified breakfast cereals .
Vitamin B12 helps in the formation of red blood cells and is important for the maintenance of the central nervous system .
Deficiency can lead to anemia and neurological damage .
Smith said another study from Oxford that came out last year showed that lower vitamin B12 levels -- but still within the normal range -- were linked to cognitive impairment and a higher risk of later cognitive decline .
“ More research is needed into the relationship between nutrition and the brain , in particular dementia , ” Smith said .
Vitamin B12 deficiency is uncommon in developed countries but is an issue among the elderly due to problems in vitamin absorption and among vegetarians whose dietary intake may be low , the researchers said .
But it is a serious problem in less developed parts of the world , Smith said , noting that in India around 70 percent of the people are vitamin B12 deficient .
A separate study led by Harvard University scientists in the journal Nature Genetics showed that common variations of a gene called FUT2 influence B12 vitamin levels in the blood .
AROUND 4 m people moved to OECD countries in 2006 , 5 % more than the year before , according to the OECD 's annual migration report .
Joining family members and seeking employment were the main reasons , accounting for 44 % and 14 % of all arrivals respectively .
America is by far the most popular destination , taking 1.3 m migrants .
China provides the biggest share of legal immigrants to OECD countries ( though Britain and Ireland do not monitor nationality ) .
Chinese migrants made up the biggest group in South Korea , Japan and Canada , and the second largest in America after Mexicans .

Still , Mr. Payton said , “ everybody is nervous that in a political campaign we get reduced to slogans , and the narrowest of slogans , so that you do n’t get good discussions . ”
In some respects , Mr. Obama ’s remarks simply reflect a growing consensus that class should play a significant role in affirmative action programs .
It already does in states like California and Michigan , where voters have decided that race can no longer be a factor in government hiring or public university admissions .
A Supreme Court decision last year , which barred public school districts from assigning students to schools based on their race , has also forced administrators to focus on socioeconomic status in their efforts to integrate segregated public schools .
But the Supreme Court has also said that universities could consider race as they worked to diversify their campuses .
Proponents of such programs point out that blacks continue to face discrimination regardless of class or income .
Some fear that Mr. Obama ’s focus on the socioeconomic status of his daughters  as opposed to the diversity of experience and perspective they might bring to predominantly white campuses  may help conservatives in their battle to eliminate race from university admissions and government hiring .
Ward Connerly , a crusader against affirmative action , said he believed that Mr. Obama ’s remarks would buoy support for his ballot initiatives in Arizona , Colorado and Nebraska in November that would ban preferential treatment on the basis of race , ethnicity and sex in government hiring and public education .
Last week , Mr. Obama ’s Republican rival , Senator John McCain , announced his support for those measures .
He also accused Mr. Obama of injecting race into the campaign , citing his remarks that Republicans would try to scare voters by pointing out that “ he does n’t look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills . ”
Mr. Obama ’s campaign officials said the remark had been misconstrued .
Mr. Obama opposes the ballot initiatives , saying they would derail efforts to break down barriers for women and members of minorities .
But Mr. Connerly said Mr. Obama had already helped the cause .
“ He ’s advanced the debate , ” Mr. Connerly said .
“ He ’s brought it to a new level . ”
Charles J. Ogletree Jr. , a professor at Harvard Law School and an adviser on black issues to Mr. Obama , said some of Mr. Obama ’s supporters were “ obviously concerned about whether this is a retreat from a commitment to affirmative action in its classical sense . ”
NEW YORK / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. lawmakers rejected a $ 700 billion bailout plan for the financial industry in a shock vote that sent global markets sliding as the world credit crisis claimed more banks .
By a vote of 228 - to - 205 the House of Representatives rejected a compromise plan that would have allowed the Treasury Department to buy up toxic debt from struggling banks .
The plan ’s defeat sent U.S. stocks down sharply , with the Dow Jones industrial average briefly falling more than 700 points , its biggest intraday drop ever .
Shares had already been under pressure following sharp declines in Asian and European shares on fears the crisis was spreading .
Global money markets remained frozen , even as central banks poured in cash in an attempt to boost liquidity .
Capping three hours of debate on Capitol Hill , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland had warned lawmakers that the cost of inaction would be an economic calamity beyond Wall Street .
“ A meltdown would begin , it is true , on a few square miles of Manhattan , but before it was over , all of us know , no city or town in America would be untouched , ” Hoyer said .
When the contentious bailout plan was announced by the Bush administration last week , some House Republicans balked at spending so much taxpayer money just before U.S. elections .
Republican
House members voted against the bailout by a more than 2 - to - 1 margin .
A majority of Democrats voted in favor .
President George W. Bush had urged lawmakers to pass the bailout package quickly , saying it was needed to keep the financial crisis from spreading .
The showdown on the bailout proposal came too late for Wachovia Corp , which agreed to sell most of its assets to Citigroup Inc in a deal brokered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 4 percent and the broader S&P 500 index was down nearly 6 percent .
Oil fell $ 8 a barrel .
Earlier , European shares dropped to a three - and - a - half year closing low with bank shares weighing heavily .
“ Investors are fearful , frenetic , especially when it comes to banking shares .
They want to get out now and see the after effects from afar , ” said Frank Geilfuss , head analyst at Bankhaus Loebbecke .

Around the world , investors were dumping assets they regarded as risky .
World stocks were down sharply , while gold and U.S. Treasuries surged in the rush to safety .
The world ’s central banks , led by the U.S. Federal Reserve , announced a $ 330 billion expansion of currency swap arrangements , which allows them to increase the amount of money they can provide in their home markets , effectively throwing more money at the crisis .
Earlier , the governments of Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg moved to partly nationalize Belgian - Dutch group Fortis NV with an injection of more than $ 16 billion , and German lender Hypo Real Estate Holding AG secured a credit line from the German government and banks of up to 35 billion euros .
“ The contagion is spreading to mainland Europe and everyone ’s asking , ‘ Who ’s next ? ’ ” said Mark Sartori , head of European sales trading at Fox - Pitt , Kelton in London .
The Wachovia deal is the latest in a series of events that has transformed the American financial landscape and wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars of shareholder wealth .
The changes include the government takeover of mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc , the failure of giant savings and loan Washington Mutual , and Bank of America Corp ’s purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co Inc .

WASHINGTON , Sept. 8 , 2008  --
With 57 days left until Election Day , the campaigns of both Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain are sprinting through key battleground states this week , vying for women voters who widely supported Sen.
Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primaries .
Clinton -- who won 54 percent of women voters in the primaries -- campaigned for Obama today in Florida , a key battleground state .
The Obama campaign plans to send Democratic women governors and senators , such as Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill , to other battleground states .
Obama held a campaign rally on the economy in Flint , Mich. , while Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden toured Wisconsin and Iowa .
McCain and his vice presidential nominee , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , campaigned today in suburban Kansas City , Mo. , where 5,000 people showed up at a campaign rally to see the running mates -- 3,000 more than could fit inside the hall where the event was held .
McCain is keeping Palin with him on the campaign trail for the first part of this week , clearly enjoying the larger - than - usual crowds energized by Palin 's conservative credentials and fiery speech at the Republican convention last week .
With Palin 's pick , the McCain campaign is hoping to peel away independents and women voters who identify with her " hockey mom " appeal .
Both the Obama and McCain campaigns argue they have been targeting women voters since the beginning .
However , the McCain campaign says Palin 's pick has given a " shot in the arm " to their effort to recruit women volunteers -- doubling their " Women for McCain " grassroots volunteer lists since her acceptance speech .
" She 's a daring and exciting pick that has really rejuvenated support and respect for Sen. McCain , " McCain spokeswoman Crystal Benton said .
" When she said she 'd ' stand up to the ol ' boys network in Washington , ' that really inspired a lot of women . "
Now , the McCain campaign will begin holding " Mondays for McCain , " when women surrogates and women volunteers in battleground states call women voters , urging them to support McCain .
Who Will Women Vote For ?
" As NFL season picks up and their husbands are watching " Monday Night Football , " we thought it would be a good time to reach out to women , " Benton said .
The Obama campaign argued they have n't stepped up their women 's outreach efforts in light of Palin 's appearance on the GOP ticket .
" Women have been a big focus since the beginning of the campaign .
We 're very fortunate that leaders like Hillary Clinton are out on the trail for Sen.
Obama on a daily basis .
They 're going to continue to lay out the basic choice in this race , and remind voters that , on the issues women care about , John McCain is n't standing with them ... he 's standing with George Bush , " Obama spokeswoman Moira Mack said .
Obama 's wife Michelle has held numerous roundtable discussions with military wives , and hosts a roundtable discussion with working women in Indiana Wednesday focusing on the economy .
" Mrs. Obama will meet with women in Fishers , Indiana to hear about their stories juggling their work and family responsibilities amidst a struggling economy .
At this event , she will share with them the Obama - Biden plans to strengthen working women and their families , and prosper in a challenging economy , " reads a press release sent to reporters Monday by the Obama campaign .
Obama 's campaign argues efforts by McCain 's campaign to target women will fall flat , given that McCain and Palin both oppose abortion rights , McCain supported President Bush 's veto of SCHIP legislation that would have expanded health insurance for low - income children , and he opposed legislation that would have made it easier for women to sue in cases of wage discrimination .
Palin opposes abortion , even in cases of rape or incest .
" Women voters do n't trust McCain because of his extreme positions on the key issues they care about , " Dana Singiser , a Clinton adviser , who is now Obama 's senior advisor for the women 's vote , wrote in August in an Obama campaign memo obtained by ABC News that argues " McCain can not close the gender gap . "
" Women want change from the last eight years of neglect for America 's middle class families and women 's economic security ... Sen. Barack Obama offers clear support for the challenges facing women and families .
As president , he will expand opportunities for working women raising families and help make life affordable for stay - at - home moms .
He will stand up for a woman 's right to choose and for affordable birth control .
He will prioritize economic security for all women by ensuring that women receive equal pay for equal work and protecting Social Security , " Singiser wrote .
Do Women Identify Better with Palin or Clinton ?
Before Palin joined the ticket , Obama enjoyed a lead over McCain among women , 55 percent to 37 percent , according to a recent ABC News / Washington Post poll .
However a new ABC News / Washington
Post poll out today finds white women have moved from 50 - 42 percent in Obama 's favor before the conventions to 53 - 41 percent for McCain now , a 20 - point shift in the margin that 's one of the single biggest post - convention changes in voter preferences .
Sixty - seven percent view her favorably and 58 percent say her selection makes them more confident in McCain 's decision - making .
Among those with children , Palin does better yet .
And enthusiasm for McCain among his female supporters has soared .
The day Palin delivered her speech at the Republican convention last week , Obama was in Toledo , Ohio , where he hosted an economic town hall meeting with women , arguing he is the candidate who will stand up for women 's rights .
" She 's opposed , like John McCain is , to equal pay for equal work .
That does n't make much sense to me , " Obama said of Palin .
The campaign also released a radio ad highlighting McCain 's opposition to abortion and suggesting that he will try to overturn Roe vs. Wade .
" John McCain 's out of touch with women today , " the Obama ad narrator says .
" McCain wants to take away our right to choose .
That 's what women need to understand .
That 's how high the stakes are . "
Some Obama supporters are reportedly grumbling they would like to see Clinton use her leverage with women supporters to do more campaigning against Palin .
However Clinton remained respectful toward Palin in her comments today in Kissimmee , Fla .
" It is a great accomplishment , " Clinton said of Palin 's selection as the GOP 's first female running mate to a crowd of 500 people .
However she said the issues , not the candidates , will decide the election .
" Women as well as men make their decisions after they weigh the evidence , " Clinton said .
" As Americans go into that voting booth , what they have to ask themselves is not so much who am I for , as who is for me ?
And I do n't think it 's an even close question that we have the ticket that is going to do the best job in restoring the American promise . "
Women Swing Vote
Former Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson , who remains an informal adviser to the senator , writes in his debut blog in The New Republic there will be " no ' cat fights ' " between the senator and the Alaska governor .
" I have been asked repeatedly over the last several days to respond to the idea that Hillary Clinton will soon be dispatched by the Obama campaign to ' take Palin on , ' " Wolfson writes .
" The questions are fair , but what undergirds them is an obsession in our popular culture with the ' cat fight , ' an offensive term that describes the spectacle of two well - known women fighting with one another .
" Do n't hold your breath .
It 's not going to happen , " Wolfson writes .
" Clinton - Palin might drive ratings and sell magazines , but it would n't be good for the Democratic party , or the cause of women 's rights .
Some might enjoy the spectacle , but do n't expect Hillary Clinton to play along .
Hillary Clinton has spent a lifetime resisting quick and easy stereotypes , and she 's not about to stop now . "

Texas Congressman Ron Paul has urged voters to reject Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain and vote for a third - party US candidate instead .
Dr Paul said a former senior McCain adviser had asked him this week to endorse Mr McCain – but he had refused .
He is backing independent Ralph Nader , Libertarian Bob Barr and Green Party and Constitution Party candidates .
Dr Paul , who dropped his own bid for the Republican nomination earlier this year , has a strong internet following .
He told a news conference in Washington he had been contacted by ex-McCain adviser Phil Gramm , who was dropped from the campaign after he said the US was a “ nation of whiners ” over the economy .
Dr Paul said Mr Gramm told him : “ You need to endorse McCain . ” He refused .
“ The idea was that he would do less harm than the other candidate , ” Dr Paul added , quoted by the Associated Press news agency .
‘ Realignment ’
Dr Paul said the majority of Americans were unhappy with the choice on offer from the mainstream parties and urged the third - party candidates to bring their supporters together to vote against the “ establishment candidates ” .
Mr Nader , Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney , a former Democratic congresswoman for Georgia , and Constitution Party hopeful Chuck Baldwin were among those to attend the news conference .
However , Mr Barr turned down the invitation , saying at his own news conference later that he had done so because Dr Paul failed to endorse one specific candidate .
Ahead of Dr Paul ’s event , Mr Nader was quoted by AP as saying it would “ raise the eyebrows ” of commentators sceptical about their chances in November ’s presidential election .
“ This is the beginning of the realignment of American politics , ” he said .
Mr Nader won 0.3 % of the vote in 2004 , when he ran as an independent .
In 2000 , when he stood as a Green Party candidate , he was blamed by Democrats for taking votes from Al Gore that might have prevented George W Bush ’s narrow election win .
Thousands of people attended a protest rally held by the libertarian - leaning Dr Paul – who opposes the Iraq war – near the Republican National Convention in Minnesota , last week .

Lets see London has had numerous plagues the last of which was punctuated by the Great Fire of London .
It 's been partially flooded many times over the years .
There was the Great stink ( not a disaster I know but bloody unpleasant nonetheless ) until Basiljet came along and sorted out the sewerage .
The Luftwaffe had a good go a flattening London from above during the Second World War and the IRA had a go as well from the late 70s through to the early 90s .
Last , but no least though , some good old home grown radicalised Islamic terrorists had a crack at it twice ( only one of which was successful thankfully )
That covers most of it I think
( I have chosen to not mention the numerous invasions London has faced since its inception as there are far too many to mention but you get the point )
Daniel James has a presence which extends somewhat beyond the borders of his person , so that when you meet him it seems like you are having a Very Real Experience .
As a game designer and a CEO ( in that order ) , his company Three Rings is known for putting out incredibly quirky shit .

The business model of putting bits in a box and charging to experience said tasty bits is forever broken .
Furthermore , to prevent the copying of bits is futile and ultimately destructive to the goal of any modern digital business , which is to conscript enthusiastic ‘ users ’ , and from them , customers .
Our mission at Three Rings is to create an emotional connection with players .
We want to become one of the ten places you go on the interwebs .
We want to be on your Chrome start page .
We want you to dream of puzzley pieces and Pirates ( or Zombies ) .
If some folks would like to give us some money , that ’d be great too .
Money ca n’t buy you love , but love can bring you money .
In software the only sustainable way to earn money is by first creating love , and then hoping that some folks want to demonstrate that love with their dollars .
The cheddary ‘ Free to Play ’ is not just a cheesy marketing slogan , but a shift in assumptions ; it costs approaching nothing to give away some bits , or let people play Puzzle Pirates for free .
Every player , free or paid , adds value to the community and excitement for other players .
Free players are the content , context and society that encourages a small fraction of the audience to willingly pay more than enough to subsidize the rest .
It ’s perhaps easy to stand in the server - side tower , printing coin of the realm and lording it over a bit-mountain .
One of online games ’ many business model advantages is sidestepping DRM questions by maintaining the canonical database that is highly valued by members of the community .
‘ Not fair ’ , the vendor of music or packaged software cries .
Well , tough shit .
Nobody added your business to the list of protected species , despite what your lobbyists and lawyers say .
Find a business model that ’s actually appropriate to the 21st century , and perhaps scale back your expectations of vast profits accordingly ( oh , and fire some lawyers and lobbyists , too , please ) .
For example , as some musicians have done by returning to live performance as their main source of revenue .
We all know folks who collect music , movies or software , thrilled by all the notional value acquired , but rarely look at any of it .
To me , it seems worthless .
I assume that any bits are commonplace and easy to come by , and the value is in their use .
Everything should be shareware to be tried and tested until its value is proven and the love - meter swings open the wallet .
If I were to pass on some music or a piece of code I become a vector of word of mouth viral marketing , the best kind , the kind that money ca n’t buy .
To fight this inexorable trend seems as counter - productive as the cellular operators practice of not distributing game demos in order to fleece people with marketing and crappy games .
Way to kill a platform , guys .
DRM takes a big poo on your best customers — the ones who ’ve given you money — whilst doing nothing practical to prevent others from ‘ stealing ’ your precious content juices .
Worse , it makes these renegades feel nice and righteous about sticking it to ‘ the man ’ .
Stop trying to persuade people to love you more by hitting them a rusty pipe .
Put down the pipe , and give up on DRM .
Republicans are going to die when they see who is supporting their cause .

Mark James Dennis , of Tregear , in Sydney 's west , pleaded guilty in March to 13 charges , including having sexual intercourse without consent , armed robbery and maliciously applying an explosive substance .
During sentencing submissions in the NSW District Court today , the court heard how Dennis robbed , then raped the woman in front of her toddler as they walked home after Carols by Candlelight in Liverpool five years ago .
Dennis robbed the woman at knife point and threatened to hurt her son , telling her , " Maybe I should take you for a drive but I guarantee that if I take you for a drive that it will be an all night thing because I have some friends in a car and they are n't as nice as me .
Would you like a big gang bang ? "
He then raped her as her son watched , tied her hands and feet with rope , poured gunpowder into her eyes and lit it with a cigarette lighter .
" You know you should n't cry ' cos it turns me on , '' he told the four - year - old as he masturbated in front of him .
" It 's alright , I am the police and I am here to save you and mummy from the bad people that are going to drive by and start shooting .
" I am going to lie on top of mummy and protect her . ''
After raping the woman , Dennis poured a powder which he claimed was glucose into her eyes " so you ca n't see me walk away ' ' .
He ignited the substance , which was gunpowder , burning away her eyelashes and scorching the skin around her eyes .
Judge Penelope
Hock today described the use of gunpowder as a " completely gratuitous act which you might describe as torture ' ' .
" I must say over 20 years of criminal law I have never encountered such an offence , '' she said .
" It 's not to have her subdued , she 's already been subdued , he 's already had sexual intercourse without her consent ... and then this act is performed .
" It 's a completely gratuitous act of violence . ''
Another of his victims , a 16 year - old girl , was walking home from school with her 10 - year - old brother when Dennis lured them at knife point into a nearby park .
He put his hands down the girl 's pants and then forced her to masturbate him before tying her and her brother with their school ties and fleeing .
In both cases , semen found on the victims ' clothing or at the scene matched DNA from Dennis 's discarded cigarette butts .
Wearing glasses and a dark suit , the former ice addict has gained weight since his arrest .
In a statement tendered to the court , one of his victims said she felt as though she had been unable to protect her son during the rape and had trouble dealing with knowing what he had witnessed .
The other victim said her school work had suffered as a result of the attack .
" It has affected me and will continue to do so for the rest of my life , " the statement said .
" I just hope that one day I can forget about it altogether . "
Judge Hock ordered Dennis to undergo a psychiatric report before a sentence is handed down in November .

A memo to the media : did you look at McCain 's record and his actions pertaining to the Georgia / Russian conflict ...
Did n't he act like he was the President ?
Wow , The Washington Post noticed that too :
Standing behind a lectern in Michigan this week , with two trusted senators ready to do his bidding , John McCain seemed to forget for a moment that he was only running for president .
Asked about his tough rhetoric on the ongoing conflict in Georgia , McCain began : " If I may be so bold , there was another president . . . "
He caught himself and started again : " At one time , there was a president named Ronald Reagan who spoke very strongly about America 's advocacy for democracy and freedom . "
With his Democratic opponent on vacation in Hawaii , the senator from Arizona has been doing all he can in recent days to look like President McCain , particularly when it comes to the ongoing international crisis in Georgia .
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili says he talks to McCain , a personal friend , several times a day .
McCain 's top foreign policy adviser , Randy Scheunemann , was until recently a paid lobbyist for Georgia 's government .
McCain also announced this week that two of his closest allies , Sens. Lindsey O. Graham ( R - S.C. ) and Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , would travel to Georgia 's capital of Tbilisi on his behalf , after a similar journey by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
The extent of McCain 's involvement in the military conflict in Georgia appears remarkable among presidential candidates , who traditionally have kept some distance from unfolding crises out of deference to whoever is occupying the White House .
The episode also follows months of sustained GOP criticism of Democratic Sen. Barack Obama , who was accused of acting too presidential for , among other things , briefly adopting a campaign seal and taking a trip abroad that included a huge rally in Berlin .
Even as Barack Obama proposes fiscally responsible tax reform to strengthen our economy and restore the balance that has been lost in recent years , we hear the familiar protests and distortions from the guardians of the broken status quo .
Many of these very same critics made many of these same overheated predictions in previous elections .
They said President Clinton 's 1993 deficit - reduction plan would wreck the economy .
Eight years and 23 million new jobs later , the economy proved them wrong .
Now they are making the same claims about Sen .
Obama 's tax plan , which has even lower taxes than prevailed in the 1990s -- including lower taxes on middle - class families , lower taxes for capital gains , and lower taxes for dividends .
Overall , Sen .
Obama 's middle - class tax cuts are larger than his partial rollbacks for families earning over $ 250,000 , making the proposal as a whole a net tax cut and reducing revenues to less than 18.2 % of GDP -- the level of taxes that prevailed under President Reagan .
Both candidates for president have proposed tax plans .
But they are starkly different in their approaches and their economic impact .
Sen .
Obama is focused on cutting taxes for middle - class families and small businesses , and investing in key areas like health , innovation and education .
He would do this while cutting unnecessary spending , paying for his proposals and bringing down the budget deficit .
In contrast , John McCain offers what would essentially be a third Bush term , with his economic speeches outlining $ 3.4 trillion of tax cuts over 10 years beyond what President Bush has already proposed and geared even more to high - income earners .
The McCain plan would lead to deficits the likes of which we have never seen in this country .
It would take money from the middle class and from future generations so that the wealthy can live better today .
Target has settled a class action lawsuit with the National Federation of the Blind over accessibility complaints with Target.com .
Despite the law being unclear as to whether the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) applies to websites , the company will pay a substantial fee and update its web site to make it accessible to the blind .
In February 2006 , Bruce Sexton Jr. , a student at the University of California - Berkeley and president of the California Association of Blind Students , sued Target because its web site was inaccessible to the blind .
Filed in conjunction with the National Federation of the Blind , the suit was used as to spotlight many corporate sites that do n't play well — if at all — with screen reading technology .
Web technologies and techniques have been advancing , but Sexton and the NFB are worried that the blind are being left behind .
" What I hope is that Target and other online merchants will realize how important it is to reach 1.3 million people in this nation and the growing Baby Boomer population who will also be losing vision , " said Sexton .
In September 2006 , a judge ruled that the lawsuit could go forward , further elevating the discussion about website accessibility .
Specifically at issue in Target 's case is a lack of " alt " tags throughout its site , tags which are used by screen reading technology to help disabled users navigate web sites .
Target tried to argue that its web site is not covered by the ADA , a civil rights law passed in 1990 , saying that only its physical stores were .
A similar lawsuit the NFB brought against AOL in 1999 over similar accessibility issues , also citing the ADA , never went to trial because AOL decided to comply and make its site fully compatible with screen reading technology .
Ultimately , Target changed its stance and settled with the NFB .
The terms , detailed at NFBTargetLawsuit.com , require Target to pay $ 6 million to a " Damages Fund " to be allocated to members of the class action suit .
Target must also make its website more accessible and pay up to $ 15,000 of the NFB 's costs per training session for Target employees to learn the requirements and techniques for accessibility design .
While it may be true that the ADA does not account for cyberspace yet , Target 's settlement with the NFB sets a precedent for corporations to assess the accessibility of their websites .
With the settlement , the NFB can take its battle to other corporations and possibly the rest of the Internet .
Senator John McCain had intended to ride back into Washington on Thursday as a leader who had put aside presidential politics to help broker a solution to the financial crisis .
Instead he found himself in the midst of a remarkable partisan showdown , lacking a clear public message for how to bring it to an end .
At the bipartisan White House meeting that Mr. McCain had called for a day earlier , he sat silently for more than 40 minutes , more observer than leader , and then offered only a vague sense of where he stood , said people in the meeting .
In subsequent television interviews , Mr. McCain suggested that he saw the bipartisan plan that came apart at the White House meeting as the proper basis for an eventual agreement , but he did not tip his hand as to whether he would give any support to the alternative put on the table by angry House Republicans , with whom he had met before going to the White House .
He said he was hopeful that a deal could be struck quickly and that he could then show up for his scheduled debate on Friday night against his Democratic rival in the presidential race , Senator Barack Obama .
But there was no evidence that he was playing a major role in the frantic efforts on Capitol Hill to put a deal back together again .
Nov. 17 , 2004  --
Not everyone may feel this way , but new research argues that humans evolved to become natural runners .
From our spring - loaded ligaments to our muscular behinds to our ability to sweat , the human body took the ideal shape of a long - distance runner starting some 2 million years ago , the researchers say .
The long , lean build helped us scavenge widely scattered kills and could also have been an advantage when hunting down prey over long distances .
" We 're lousy sprinters , but we 're really great long - distance runners , " said Daniel Lieberman , an anthropologist at Harvard University .
" Anyone who jogs regularly can tell you that it feels good . "
How can two legs be better than four when it comes to striding for long distances ?
Consider the fact that some 334,000 people ran marathons in the United States last year , and then try getting an antelope to run 26 miles , or a chimp , for that matter .
" You 'd never beat a chimp in a 100 - meter dash , but you could never get them to run a marathon , " he said .
" And they would n't like trying . "
Evolutionary biologists have generally credited humans ' ability to run as an offshoot of our ability to walk on two feet .
" How can anyone even conceive of an animal evolving a walking strategy that was entirely decoupled from a running strategy ? " asks C. Owen Lovejoy of Kent State University in Kent , Ohio .
But in a study appearing in this week 's issue of " Nature , " Harvard 's Lieberman and Dennis Bramble of the University of Utah argue that endurance running may have been so critical in early humans ' survival that it played a role in shaping many aspects of our bodies .
Runners From Head to Toe
The pair studied both modern human anatomy and the fossil record of early human ancestors to look for characteristics that would have specifically enhanced people 's ability to run for long distances .
They say most , if not all of these key features seem to have emerged 2 million years ago with the first appearances of the genus Homo -- the same group as modern living humans .
The peroneus brevis tendon , for example , made famous by Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling 's injury during the 2004 World Series , is one of several elongated tendons in the human body that the authors argue provides critical spring as a person runs .
In apes and chimpanzees , the same tendons are much shorter , says Lieberman , and do n't offer the same kind of spring - loading action .
Then there is the gluteus maximus -- the unusually large muscle humans carry at their rear .
Why such bulk in back ?
Lieberman says it 's for running and , again , this feature is less pronounced in our evolutionary ancestors .
" When we walk , we barely use the gluteus maximus , " he said .
" As soon as you start running , it plays a vital role to keep you from falling -- it stabilizes your trunk . "
Other features the authors list that help us run include the arches in our feet , which offer spring in our step , and broad surface areas of our joints , which help distribute the shock of impact from running -- at least enough for ancient man , who did n't run on pavement and who never lived much longer than 40 years .
The upper body , meanwhile , carries its own made - for - running designs , including wide shoulders -- good for swinging arms from for balance as we stride -- and lighter forearms that are easy to move back and forth .
Even our heads are equipped for running , they say , as a large ligament stretching from our spines to the back of our heads acts to dampen the oscillation of our heads as we plod along .
Finally , our ability to sweat is unmatched with our estimated 3 million sweat glands .
Couple that with the fact that we are n't very furry and you have a cool , running machine .
Jogging for Supper
Bernd Heinrich , a world record holder in the ultra marathon and biologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington , says the authors ' points make sense .
" Most of us do n't do much running so it may not feel natural , but it feels natural to me , " he said .
" Not much is new here , but I think they bring together a lot of evidence so it all fits into a pattern . "
While few anthropologists argue with the fact that humans evolved to become good runners , Lovejoy remains skeptical we were specifically designed for endurance running .
" There is little doubt that many of the bony features that are mentioned … are adaptations to running and walking , but there is no evidence that they are specifically adapted to endurance running , " he said .
Lovejoy points out that our arms and legs could also be considered well designed for swimming , but that does n't necessarily mean we evolved specifically to be elite swimmers .
But Lieberman and others counter that endurance running , unlike swimming , could have been a key part of early man 's survival .
It may have helped them during long hunts and in scouting out abandoned carcasses first , for example .
" Being fast would have been a huge premium , " said Heinrich .
" Vultures can come in and devour a dead cow in an hour or two .
So ideally , the humans would get there first . "
Patricia Kramer of the University of Washington , points out there may be a small glitch in that theory .
According to most research , early female humans likely did not participate in long hunts , but stayed behind to care for the young .
If this is the case , Kramer asks , why would women also have evolved to be good long - distance runners ?
" If endurance running was a male activity , then why do women have small waists and hypotrophied gluteus maximae ? " she asks .
" I think that understanding how we moved through our environment is critical to understanding who we are as evolved primates … but as with all good research this causes us to ask a new set of questions . "

WASHINGTON  Senior White House officials played a central role in deliberations in the spring of 2002 about whether the Central Intelligence Agency could legally use harsh interrogation techniques while questioning an operative of Al Qaeda , Abu Zubaydah , according to newly released documents .
In meetings during that period , the officials debated specific interrogation methods that the C.I.A. had proposed to use on Qaeda operatives held at secret C.I.A. prisons overseas , the documents show .
The meetings were led by Condoleezza Rice , then the national security adviser , and attended by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld , Attorney General John Ashcroft and other top administration officials .
The documents provide new details about the still - murky early months of the C.I.A. ’s detention program , when the agency began using a set of harsh interrogation techniques weeks before the Justice Department issued a written legal opinion in August 2002 authorizing their use .
Congressional investigators have long tried to determine exactly who authorized these techniques before the legal opinion was completed .

The documents are a list of answers provided by Ms. Rice and John B. Bellinger III , the former top lawyer at the National Security Council , to detailed questions by the Senate Armed Services Committee , which is investigating the abuse of detainees in American custody .
The documents were provided to The New York Times by Senator Carl Levin , chairman of the committee .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The buyer of a $ 53.5 million penthouse apartment in New York ’s famed Plaza Hotel who sued , saying the apartment turned out to be “ attic - like , ” is now being counter - sued for lying to get out of his contract .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Russian financier Andrei Vavilov sued the hotel , developers El - Ad Properties and brokers Stribling & Associates this month for breach of contract , fraud , deceptive trade practices and negligence .
He demanded the return of his $ 10.7 million deposit and $ 30 million in damages .
Vavilov , who said he made the purchase based on a video , claimed that the apartment -- actually two separate penthouses built on top of the Plaza -- has small windows , low ceilings , obstructed views and ugly drainage grates .
But in a counter lawsuit filed on Wednesday in New York State Supreme Court , El - Ad Properties accused Vavilov of libel and filing a “ sham ” lawsuit .
It is seeking $ 36 million in damages .
“ These false and defamatory statements were made ... solely in an attempt to escape the unconditional obligation to purchase such condominium apartments , ” the El - Ad lawsuit said .
Vavilov and his wife , the Russian actress Maryana Tsaregradskaya , were concerned the penthouses were not large enough , it said .
Their “ feigned dissatisfaction ” about the condition of the apartment in fact reflected frustration that they were unable to buy additional Plaza penthouses and had been unable to combine the two penthouses , the lawsuit said .
In a statement , Vavilov ’s lawyer took issue with El - Ad ’s decision to refer to Vavilov by name , since he had not previously been publicly identified .
“ It is ironic that , according to published reports , El - Ad released Mr. Vavilov ’s name to the press and it now sues him for libel , ” the statement said .
“ The libel lawsuit is truly the ‘ sham lawsuit ’ in that it is factually incorrect , legally insufficient and is seemingly being used as a weapon to quell discontent , keep other unhappy buyers quiet and a publicity stunt , ” the statement said .
The Plaza overlooks Central Park and has inspired writers such as Kay Thompson , author of the “ Eloise ” stories about a 6 - year - old girl who lived at the hotel , and Neil Simon , who wrote the Broadway play and hit film “ Plaza Suite . ”
It has been owned by moguls such as Conrad Hilton and Donald Trump .
After $ 400 million worth of renovations , the Plaza reopened
in March as a mixture of hotel rooms and condominiums .
The penthouses for sale were advertised as magnificent “ one of a kind ” properties .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A fire retardant chemical used in electronics , toys and furniture has been detected in children ’s blood at triple the levels found in their mothers , the Environmental Working Group reported on Thursday .

REUTERS / Arnd Wiegmann
In a small pilot study of 20 families , the non-profit environmental group tested blood samples from mothers and their young children -- ages 18 months to four years -- for the presence of PBDEs , a hormone - disrupting chemical .
In 19 of the 20 families , concentrations of PBDEs were typically three times as high in children as in their mothers , said Sonya Lunder , the study ’s author .
One child had six times the level of the chemical that was detected in her mother .
“ To us , this raises concerns that kids live very differently in the same environment than their parents do and those kid- like behaviors put them at risk for contaminant exposure , ” Lunder said in a telephone interview .
Lunder said young children are exposed to more of these substances because they play by putting their hands and other household items in their mouths after touching furniture or appliances that contain PBDEs .
They also eat more and drink more , proportionally , than their mothers do , and food and drink can contain these chemicals , she said .
PBDEs , or polybrominated diphenyl ethers , are hormone - disrupting pollutants that build up in the blood and tissues .
Two forms of PBDEs are no longer made in the United States but are still present in items in U.S. homes , the study said .
The largest volume of PBDEs are in electronics in a form called Deca , which is banned in European electronics and in some U.S. states , according to the study .
The study cited peer - reviewed tests that showed a single dose of PBDEs given to mice on a single day when their brains were growing rapidly can cause permanent behavior changes , including hyperactivity .
Lunder said there have been numerous studies of the toxic effects of fire retardants on adults , but few on how these substances affect children .
A spokesman for the Bromine Science and Environment Forum , a trade group , took issue with the environment group ’s study , saying that even the highest levels of PBDEs detected were relatively low , and that Deca was barely found in the children .
“ Flame retardants save actual human lives , and no illness , ailment or harm to any human anywhere has ever been reported as a result of exposure to Deca , even among those who work producing the material , ” the spokesman , John Kyte , said in an e-mail .
Kyte said the flame retardant manufacturers group supported monitoring and analysis of “ potential concerns ” raised by the environmental group ’s study .
I ’ve heard reports from Harvard that yesterday and today Heisuke Hironaka has been giving talks in the math department there , claiming to have a proof that singularities of algebraic varieties can be resolved for any dimension in characteristic p .
This would be a major advance in the field of algebraic geometry .
I do n’t know any details of the proof , but Hironaka is , at 77 , an extremely well - respected mathematician , not known for making claims unless they are very solid .
Hironaka won the Fields Medal in 1970 , largely based on his 1964 proof of the resolution of singularities , in the characteristic zero case .
For an introduction to that proof , see this article from the Bulletin of the AMS .
Update : From comments here it seems that the source of my information about Hironaka ’s talk was most likely overly optimistic about exactly what Hironaka was claiming .
The current situation seems to be that several groups are working on this , with promising ideas of how to get to a proof , but with no definitive proof yet done .
There will be a workshop at RIMS in December , with the goal of sorting out the current situation :
California drivers chafing at the ban on holding cellphones can soon forget about texting , too : Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has banned motorists from sending , writing or reading messages on electronic devices starting Jan.
1 .
Schwarzenegger signed legislation Wednesday that imposes a $ 20 fine for a first offense of texting while driving and a $ 50 fine for any subsequent violation .
As he works against a Tuesday deadline to act on more than 800 bills passed by the Legislature , Schwarzenegger also signed a measure barring companies that do business with the Sudanese government from bidding on state contracts .
Schwarzenegger said in a statement that he was “ happy to sign ” the prohibition against text - messaging , which surveys show is widespread among drivers .

“ Banning electronic text messaging while driving will keep drivers ’ hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road , making our roadways a safer place for all Californians , ” said Schwarzenegger .
The California Public Utilities Commission recently banned certain railroad workers from using text - messaging devices or cellphones on moving trains in the wake of the Sept. 12 collision between a Metrolink passenger train and a freight train .
Investigators are probing whether texting by an engineer was a factor in the crash in Chatsworth , which killed 25 people and injured 135 .
Insurers , bicyclists and cellphone companies backed the measure that Schwarzenegger signed Wednesday , as they did the ban on holding a cellphone while driving , which took effect July 1 .
The earlier law allows drivers to use cellphones only with hands - free devices such as headsets ; another law prohibits drivers younger than 18 from using any kind of phone or texting device while behind the wheel .
“ When somebody ’s distracted , ” said state Sen. Joe Simitian ( D - Palo Alto ) , who wrote the new law , SB 28 , and the earlier laws , “ it puts not just the driver at risk but everybody else in the car and everybody else on the highway . ”

Tom Marshall , a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol , said state officers have issued 19,753 citations to motorists for talking on cellphones without a hands - free device since July 1 .
The number does not include citations by local police departments .
Marshall said the number of drivers cited for that infraction is far less than those stopped for speeding , but still significant .
“ Why everybody is n’t hands - free now , I have no idea , ” he said .
Consistent with state actions in favor of human rights that began in the 1980s , Schwarzenegger also signed a bill banning state contract bids from companies that do business with the government of the African nation of Sudan .
That nation has been widely condemned for conducting a genocidal campaign against people living in its Darfur region .
The conflict has killed an estimated 400,000 people and displaced more than 2.5 million , the governor said .

In signing AB 498 by Assemblyman Ed Hernandez ( D - West Covina ) , Schwarzenegger said , “ We are continuing to send a message that California will not condone nor enable economic gain at the expense of innocent people . ”
It is not clear how many companies might be affected by the law .
Schwarzenegger also signed a bill sought by the Los Angeles Unified School District to allow it to continue tapping state construction funds even as it withdraws from a program to fund multitrack , year - round schools .
The $ 90 million remaining in the multitrack program will be shifted over five years to charter schools serving low - income children under SB 658 by Sen. Gloria Romero ( D - Los Angeles ) .

Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar bill last year because it did not shift the money to charter schools , which are public schools freed from some restrictions imposed by state education laws and local school districts .
L.A. Unified director of governmental affairs Santiago Jackson said the district is working to put all of its schools on a two - semester schedule , rather than a multitrack , year - round schedule in which four separate groups of students use the same school with staggered start dates .

Whether you ’re a seasoned WordPress blogger or you ’re starting up a new blog from scratch ( as I am here ) , then these plugins will make installing new plugins , themes , and WordPress updates a snap :
Effortless Plugin Installation
Installing new WordPress plugins and themes can be somewhat of a hassle .
You have to download the file , upload it to your web host , and extract the contents .
The Single Click Plugin Updater will alleviate much of the pain by allowing you to install plugins and themes all from within WordPress .
You just provide the URL of the new plugin or theme , and the single click plugin does the rest .
You do n’t even have to download it to your computer first !
WordPress Automatic Upgrade
Much like installing plugins and themes , upgrading to a new version of WordPress can be a tedious and time - consuming process .
The WordPress Automatic Upgrade plugin makes it much easier , although I would call it more of a semi-automatic upgrade .
It ’s not a single - click process , as you have to manually click through each step of the process .
It does still make it a lot easier to just perform each of the steps at the click of a button rather than performing each one manually .
Sarah Palin just keeps going back for more car - wreck interviews with Katie Couric .
After forecasting a possible Great Depression and saying something indecipherable about her state 's relations with Russia , the Republican vice presidential nominee reportedly went silent when called on to name Supreme Court cases other than Roe V. Wade .
Also , in the attached clip , Palin and John McCain both implausibly try to blame " gotcha journalism " for reporting on Palin 's support for cross - border raids into Pakistan , a position shared by Barack Obama and attacked by McCain during the presidential debate .
( Click the video icon to watch . )
Now , Politico reports , the Republican ticket is pulling Palin back to the safer waters of right - wing talk radio .
Putting McCain 's popular - but - inexperienced running mate in front of more TV cameras was a calculated gamble by the campaign to broaden her appeal .
It 's now safe to say that it failed .
Everyone has an opinion on Bristol pregnancy Party faithful rally to support decisions by Palin family
When she ran for governor of Alaska in 2006 , Sarah Palin was asked if she would support abstinence - before - marriage programs over sex education , school clinics and contraceptive distribution .
She was firm in her answer : " Explicit sex ed programs will not find my support . "
But that response came back to haunt her - and the presidential campaign of GOP candidate John McCain - Monday with the news that Palin 's unmarried , 17 - year - old daughter Bristol is five months pregnant .
Palin and her husband , Todd , released a statement saying they welcomed the news that their daughter would keep the baby , marry and make them grandparents - unexpectedly , but happily , they said .
Palin 's news is by no means unfamiliar to American families of any background .
But even in an era when little seems to shock us , the eye - opening situation of the woman with five children who hopes to be the nation 's second most powerful executive - a heartbeat away from the presidency - is cause for concern in the harsh spotlight of a presidential contest .
It 's especially troubling because voters have just been introduced to the virtually unknown Palin , her biography and her record as a Republican , a party that has long trumpeted its support of conservative " family values . "
And the Palin news , at the start of the Republican National Convention , came just 72 hours after McCain had named her his running mate .
It raised questions about whether she had been properly vetted , if the story would be a distraction to the campaign and whether there might be more unexpected news .
" It shows the problems of picking someone out of the blue , " said Hoover Institution media fellow Bill Whalen .
" It does n't happen with someone well known like Mitt Romney , " and whose every detail of business and life experience has been examined with a magnifying glass by media .
Support at convention
The surprising announcement of Palin 's impending status as a grandmother first surfaced with Internet rumors that daughter Bristol may be the mother of Palin 's 5 - month - old son , Trig .
The McCain campaign strongly denied such rumors , but the news of the daughter 's pregnancy - never mentioned this week during Palin 's formal introduction to the press and voters - still had GOP loyalists buzzing at the start of the party 's nominating convention here .
Most staunch Republicans in St. Paul , hearing the news , tried to accentuate the positive : Palin 's daughter is keeping the baby and getting married , a plus - the embodiment of family values , they said .
" I 'm not a feminist , never have been , and I opposed the Equal Rights Amendment because it was bad law , " said Jo Ellen Allen , a delegate from Newport Beach .
" But women ought to be applauding her ... this happens to the best of families . "
" As a delegate , and as a woman , I respect them even more now , ' said Miryam Mora , 26 , a GOP delegate from Los Angeles , whose reaction mirrored many others ' inside Xcel Energy Center .
" It 's a family with real issues and real problems ... but it 's an amazing family . "
Mixed views outside
Demonstrators outside the convention center had varying reactions .
Mary Kay Ryan , 54 , of Chicago said she was " of two minds when I heard the news .
From a feminist point of view , I hate it when people use women 's bodies to make a point . "
But as someone who says she does n't want McCain to win , " the bratty side of me says , ' Na - ne , na - ne . '
I feel really , really bad for the girl . "
Sarah Smith , 21 , a marketing manager from Chicago , said that the story " proves to me that we really need more sex- positive sexual education programs in the United States .
If the potential vice president 's daughter is n't getting the message - then what does that say ? "
The latest news could exacerbate doubts in voters ' minds about Palin - doubts reflected in a focus group of undecided voters this week organized by GOP pollster Frank Luntz .
The group of 25 Midwestern voters , by a 2 - 1 ratio , said they had deep concern about Palin 's experience .
At least one focus group participant said she was deeply troubled that Palin - a mother of five young children whose husband also works - had chosen to seek one of the nation 's highest offices instead of looking out for what she said should be the governor 's first priority , her kids .
The irony
Whalen said the strongly pro-life Palin " will be pounded in some circles " for her support of abstinence education - and in her own situation , " people will glady point out the irony . "
But he said , " the problem would be even greater if there were hypocrisy involved ... if she were sneaking her daughter off to get an abortion . "
One Republican operative at the convention , who did n't want to be identified for fear of being seen as critical of McCain , said McCain 's pick of the virtually unknown Palin - whose conservative values excite the grass roots - as his vice presidential candidate has been a risky move indeed .
" It 's kind of like Babe Ruth pointing to the bleachers and saying , ' That 's where I 'm going to hit it , ' " he said .
" If you actually get it out there , you 're a hero , " the operative said .
" But what are the chances that it 's going to happen ? "

From The Desk Of Clarence Bass
" At the Texas SWAT Competition 2000 , two officers from the Houston area told me that they had upped their pull - up max from 10 to 20 with the ‘ I go , you go ’ approach .
Just like that . "
Pavel Tsatsouline , Milo magazine , December 2000
Pavel ’s Ladder
Alternate approach to synaptic facilitation delivers more volume in less time
In " A Small Experiment with Chin-ups " ( article No. 49 ) , I related how Pavel Tsatsouline ’s " grease the groove " technique allowed me to do the most chin-ups I ’d done since high school .
By doing multiple sets of chin-ups spread out over the course of the day , several days a week , I was able to work up to 20 full - range chin-ups .
The theory is called synaptic facilitation , which simply means doing frequent , non-exhaustive sets of a specific exercise to strengthen the nerve pathway .
Bulgarian and Russian Olympic weightlifters have been using the method for years to beat the pants off the rest of the world .
The problem is scheduling time to do many sets of an exercise throughout the day .
It ’s just not practical for most people .
That ’s why I was excited to find an article by Pavel in the December 2000 issue of Milo magazine explaining " how to grease the groove on a tight schedule . "
He says it ’s a method used by the Soviet Special Forces to meet the Spetsnaz requirement of 18 dead hang pull - ups wearing a 10 - kilo ( 22 pound ) bullet - proof vest .
I tried it and it seems to work – with much less training time .
It allowed me to reduce my chin - up sessions to one or two a day , and more then double my reps , while still staying fresh .
Here ’s how Pavel describes the technique used by special forces personnel to work pull - ups into their busy classroom and training schedule : " We would file out to the pull - up bars and perform what we called ladders .
I do a pull - up , you do one .
I do two , you match me , etc. until one of us cannot keep up .
Then , if we still had time , we started over .
One rep , 2 reps , 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ... 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 , ... 1,2,3,4,5 .
We totaled hundreds of pull - ups almost daily without burning out , and the extreme PT tests of our service were a breeze . "
If you train alone , you can simply time your breaks by estimating how long it would take a partner to match your reps .
That ’s what I do , and it works fine .
In fact , Pavel says it ’s better that way , because " your odds of burning out are lower . "
To maximize volume without overtraining , you should stop each ladder one or two reps short of your limit .
In other words , if you can work up to 10 reps at the top of the ladder , it ’s best to stop at about 8 , and then begin at 1 again .
The non-competitive approach allows you to stop at a preset number that suits your capacity , not that of your partner .
The beauty of the technique is that you get a break each time you return to the bottom rung , which allows you to do more total reps .
If you tried to do repeated limit sets or used the pyramid approach ( 1,2,3,4,5 , 6,7,8,9,10 , 9,8,7,6,5 ... ) , for example , fatigue would build much faster and volume would be compromised .
As Pavel says , " The ladder , on the other hand , enables the strong man to grease the groove of his chosen feat with extraordinary volume . "
I ’ve found that to be true .
During the experiment described in my earlier article , I generally did sets of 12 or 13 , for about 50 total reps a day .
Using the ladder technique , I can easily do 150 chin-ups in two sessions lasting a little over 15 minutes each , or occasionally in one session of about 35 minutes .
( I generally do chin-ups only two days a week , because I do n’t want to interfere with my regular training sessions . )
Ladders are obviously a more efficient use of one ’s time , and they give your synapses plenty of work .
As Pavel says , they allow more volume , without burnout , than any other structure .
I have n’t tried for a new PR , but if Pavel ’s " high - volume plus specificity minus burnout " principle works as well as he says , it should n’t be long before I am doing more than 20 chin-ups or , better yet , working my way up to the Spetsnaz requirement of 18 chin-ups with a 10 - kilo plate attached .
Give it a try , and let me know what happens .
You ’ll have fun , and you may be surprised at what you can accomplish .
Thanks to Pavel and his commandoes for the tip .

( CNN ) -- Iran 's deputy foreign minister said Friday that almost 4,000 uranium - enriching centrifuges are now operating at the country 's Natanz enrichment facility , the national IRNA news agency reported .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has defended Iran 's right to develop nuclear technology .
Spinning centrifuges are used to separate uranium atoms to produce uranium concentrated enough for a nuclear weapon 's fission chain reaction .
Ali-Reza Sheikh Attar told Iranian TV that another 3,000 centrifuges are being installed , IRNA said .
Iran announced nearly a year ago , in September 2007 , that it had more than 3,000 active centrifuges .
In April , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad promised to install 6,000 more over the coming year .
The United States and other Western nations believe Iran 's nuclear program is intended to develop nuclear weapons , but Iran insists it is only for peaceful purposes .
The United Nations already has three sanctions resolutions against Iran for failing to suspend the program .
Attar said Thursday the sanctions are " futile and ineffective , " IRNA reported .
" Had Westerners become certain that the resolutions would bring us down to our knees , they would have definitely intensified ( the sanctions ) , " IRNA quoted Attar as saying .
The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany -- a group called P5+1 -- offered a package of economic and other incentives to Iran in July if it suspended its nuclear enrichment program .
Iran failed to meet the group 's deadline to accept the offer , leading the P5+1 to discuss further sanctions against Iran , a State Department spokesman said this month .

Five things Joe Biden brings to the table for Barack Obama
While there is still a lot of research to be done on this , here are five areas that Senator Joe Biden could help Barack Obama in as they begin their fight to defeat John McCain .
Helps bring in Catholic vote : Joe Biden is very open about the fact that he is Catholic , there will be no emails circulating around the internet questioning the authenticity of his Christianity .
Sorry guys , you wo n’t be seeing emails questioning whether or Joe Biden ever attended a madrasah .
Yes , Joe Biden is pro-choice , however there are many Catholics who will always support “ their own , ” regardless of where they stand .
Helps bring in the female vote : Joe Biden has an extremely interesting life story when it comes to his family and taking charge as a father .
Here is a brief summary from his Wikipedia page talking about just one of the tragedies that have made him the family man he is :
“ His wife and infant daughter died in a car accident shortly after he was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 .
His two young sons , Beau and Hunter , were seriously injured in the accident , but both eventually made full recoveries .
Biden was sworn into office from their bedside .
Persuaded not to resign in order to care for them , Biden began the practice of commuting an hour and a half each day on the train from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington , DC , which he continues to do .
Does n’t create a wealth distraction :
One issue that many candidates run into when seeking office is their own personal fortunes and what has been handed down to them , which makes it hard to paint themselves as the candidate for the “ middle class . ”
While Barack Obama and Joe Biden are not poor by any standards , they both come from very humble beginnings ( Obama raised by a single mom , Biden by a used car salesman ) .
This is in contrast to John McCain , who is the son of an oil heiress and married an heiress himself ( though I personally see nothing wrong with it , but I ’m sure some Soros ad will go after it ) .
Foreign policy experience :
As we all know , in terms of foreign policy experience , Barack Obama really does n’t have much .
However , Joe Biden is currently the Chairman on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations , a committee he has been on consistently since 1973 .
Those 35 years on the committee have given Joe Biden insider access to all of the international hostilities that have occurred during his tenure .
A son currently serving in the military :
While it seems that the economy is going to be the biggest debate for this election , you cant sidestep the fact that we are still a nation at war .
Barack Obama has said repeatedly that his goal is to get our troops out of Iraq as soon as possible , which has left many moderates questioning whether he understands how the military works and the consequences .
When you mix the fact that Joe Biden ’s son will more than likely be in Iraq when ( if ) he is innaugerated , with his years of service on the Senate Committee of Foreign Relations , many voters may feel reassured knowing that he has a personal and a professional stake in the military , meaning he wont take action that does n’t make sense for the troops and for the country .
Please do n’t hesitate to leave your comments , and additional things that you think Joe Biden brings to the table for Barack Obama .
Of course , expect a post in the coming days of “ 5 ways Joe Biden hurts Barack Obama . ”
Russia has launched a major " invasion " of Georgia and is now in control of half the country after a military operation by air - and - ground forces , Georgian military officials claimed this afternoon .
Georgia appealed urgently for international help and said it was planning an all - out defence of the capital , Tbilisi , from Russian attack .
It said it had withdrawn its troops as Russian forces surged across the west and centre of the country .
Russian tanks and armoured vehicles seized the town of Gori - 36 miles from Tbilisi - at about 5 pm local time , after advancing southwards this afternoon from the breakaway republic of South Ossetia , Georgian officials said , smashing the Georgian line in two places .
Tonight Saba Tsitsikashvili , a Gori resident and local Georgian journalist , said that Russian troops had occupied the main road on the edge of Gori .
The troops were in the north of the city but had not yet moved towards the centre , he said .
He told the Guardian : " They are on the central highway which links the east and west of Georgia .
This is the situation .
People are leaving their villages .
They have been told by policemen to leave their villages and houses .
" It 's a very bad situation .
People are in panic .
Nobody knows what to do .
This road where the troops are is about 2 kms from the city centre .
It 's very near .
The road is closed now . "
At the same time Russian troops were moving across the west of the country from Georgia 's second breakaway republic of Abkhazia , in what appeared to be a significant escalation in the five - day conflict .
Georgian military officials said Russian troops had seized the towns of Kutaisy and Senaki and were also planning to move forces to the port town of Porti .
" This is a classical full - scale invasion under the umbrella of peace enforcement , " Irakli Batkuashvili , the head of Georgia 's military planning division told the Guardian tonight .
He added grimly : " This is an occupation . "
" Half of Georgia is under Russian control .
Our aim now is to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of Tbilisi .
We will fight defending Tbilisi . "
The pace of the Russian attack appears to have caught Georgia 's vastly inferior armed forces by surprise .
Russia had previously insisted it had no intention of moving beyond the existing conflict zone in South Ossetia - briefly captured and then abandoned by Georgian forces .
Amid a day of claims and counter - claims , a senior Russian general had said there were no plans to move its troops deeper into Georgian territory .
Russian officials denied that Gori had been occupied and Georgian assertions that it had fallen to Russian forces were disputed by some witnesses , who said they saw no troops in the deserted town .
The Georgian president , Mikhail Saaskashvili , visited Gori earlier in the day , before being bundled away by his security staff .
Georgia has asked for a ceasefire but Moscow has refused , arguing Georgian troops are still fighting in South Ossetia .
Tblisi said up to 50 Russian bombers attacked its territory overnight , with one Russian bomb reported to have landed near the civilian airport of Tblisi , shortly after the French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , had touched down .
News of the latest fighting came as Britain condemned the Russian attacks as " deplorable " .
Gordon Brown called on Russia to accept Georgia 's offer of a ceasefire , saying Russian military action threatened regional stability and could damage Moscow 's ties with other countries .
" There is no justification for continued Russian military action in Georgia , which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe , " the prime minister said in a statement .
" There is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in South Ossetia .
Nato 's secretary general , Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , joined the US president , George Bush , in criticising Russia for " disproportionate " use of force .
Nato said in April that Georgia would one day be a member of the alliance .
Bush told a US sports broadcaster in Beijing , where he was watching the Olympics , that he had spoken firmly to the Russian prime minister , Vladimir Putin .
" We strongly condemn bombing outside of South Ossetia . "
Moscow has justified strengthening up forces in Abkhazia as an attempt to prevent what it called Georgia 's " genocide " in South Ossetia 's capital , Tskhinvali .
Putin in turn criticised the US for flying 2,000 Georgian soldiers back from Iraq , where they make up the third - biggest troop contributor after the US and Britain .
" It is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but , essentially , are hindering us .
I mean … the transfer by the United States of a Georgian contingent in Iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone .
The very scale of this cynicism is astonishing - the attempt to turn white into black , black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims . "
Moscow says 1,600 civilians have been killed in South Ossetia , along with 15 Russian peacekeepers killed and 70 wounded .
Saakashvili , told reporters at a press conference this afternoon Russia 's attack against Georgia was " the pre-planned , cold - blooded murder of a small country ' ' .
He accused Russia of attempting to occupy the whole country .
" This provocation was aimed at occupying South Ossetia , Abkhazia and then all of Georgia . "
Saakashvili said 90 % of Georgian casualties were civilians .
" They are specifically targeting civilian targets .
They 've been targeting highways in Georgia which are especially crowded at this time of year because of returning holidaymakers , " he said .
Georgia had previously said 80 % of casualties were military .
Georgia 's envoy to the EU , Salome Samadashvili , said the EU must tell Russia to pull back or " risk their future relationship with the European Union " .
EU foreign ministers are expected to meet over the crisis on Wednesday .
There are concerns that oil prices , which have fallen in recent weeks , may rise again because of the crisis .
Saakashvili told the US vice - president , Dick Cheney , in a phone call that Russian aggression must not go unanswered .
Cheney did not spell out what might follow , but threatening to expel Russia from the G8 is one possibility that has been raised in the past by the Republican presidential candidate , John McCain .
The Russian ambassador to Nato , Dmitry Rogozin , said Moscow had asked for a meeting with the alliance to explain its actions .
Nato ambassadors are meeting tomorrow with Georgia 's foreign minister , Ekaterina Tkeshelashvili .
The World Food Programme has started distributing food to help displaced people , and has said the number of people needing assistance is " rising by the hour ' ' .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama said on Friday he supported efforts by the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve to shore up confidence in the financial markets and said he would hold off from presenting his own economic recovery plan .
“ The events of the last few days have made it clear that we must take further bold and decisive action to shore up confidence in our financial markets and avoid a deepening economic crisis that could jeopardize the life savings and well - being of millions of Americans , ” Obama said in a statement .
Obama said he supported efforts by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to work with the Congressional leadership to find a solution to the deepening crisis .
As Wall Street grapples with the worst crisis since the Great Depression , the financial turmoil has become the top theme on the campaign trail where Obama is locked in a tight race with his Republican rival John McCain .
The Illinois senator said he would be discussing the Fed - Treasury proposal with his top economic advisers on Friday morning .
Among those who have been advising Obama on his response to the financial crisis are former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and former U.S. Treasury secretaries Lawrence Summers and Robert Rubin .
“ Given the gravity of this situation , and based on conversations I have had with both Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke , I have asked my economic team to refrain from presenting a more detailed blue - print of how an immediate plan might be structured until the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have had an opportunity to present their proposal . ”
Obama said it was critical that the markets and public have confidence in the Fed and Treasury ’s efforts and that their work be “ unimpeded by partisan wrangling . ”

On Thursday Obama urged the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to take emergency steps to keep credit flowing to the troubled housing market , saying it would help stem the crisis sweeping financial markets .
In his statement on Friday , Obama said the government needed to also take action to create jobs and help support distressed homeowners and communities .
He also said any taxpayer - funded support plan by the U.S. government needed to have a long - term goal of creating a stable financial market and a growing economy .
“ This plan must be temporary and coupled with tough new oversight and regulations of our financial institutions , ” he said .
“ There must be a clear process to wind down this plan and restore private sector assets into private sector hands after restoring stability to the system . ”
Obama also urged that the plan be part of a globally coordinated effort .
The unemployment rate jumped to 6.1 percent in August , its highest level in five years , pushing the troubles of American workers to the center of the political debate as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks .
For the eighth consecutive month , the nation ’s employers shed jobs , 84,000 last month , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday .
In all , 605,000 jobs have been lost since January .
The steady rise in unemployment , from 5.7 percent in July and 5 percent in April , is one that many economists associate with recession .
Both presidential candidates  Senators Barack Obama and John McCain  said through spokesmen that they would favor an economic stimulus package from Congress this fall .
Mr. Obama jumped on the latest report , declaring that Democrats would do more to help struggling Americans .
“ You would think that George Bush and his potential Republican successor , John McCain , would be spending a lot of time worrying about the economy and all these jobs that are being lost on their watch , ” he said at a campaign stop in Duryea , Pa. But , “ if you watched the Republican National Convention over the last three days , you would n’t know that we have the highest unemployment rate in five years . ”
This is the first in a series of articles on Metaprogramming in the C API .
This series will explain how to implement dynamic method definition , eigenclass and metaclass manipulation , and ultimately DSL construction in pure C .
This particular article will discuss Ruby blocks , and how we use them in C .
Blocks
In Ruby , blocks hold a central role in Metaprogramming and this is equally true in the C API .
Blocks can be passed to methods both implictly :
def my_method if block_given ?
then yield else raise ArgumentError , " a block is required " end end
And explictly :
def my_method ( &block ) if block then block .
call else raise ArgumentError , " a block is required " end end
Implicit Blocks
We will examine the implicit case first from the C perspective .
Here is the corresponding code in C :
static VALUE my_method( VALUE self ) { if ( rb_block_given_p ( ) ) rb_yield ( Qnil ) ; else rb_raise ( rb_eArgError , " a block is required " ) ; return Qnil ; }
Looking over the C and the Ruby code it should strike you how similar they are and it should be immediately obvious that rb_block_given_p ( ) and rb_yield ( ) are the C counterparts to Ruby ’s block_given ?
and yield .
The prototypes for the two C functions are :
VALUE rb_block_given_p ( ) ; VALUE rb_yield ( VALUE argv ) ;
The return values for rb_block_given_p ( ) and rb_yield ( ) are identical to their Ruby equivalents ; rb_block_given_p ( ) returns a boolean true or false ( Qtrue and Qfalse in the C API ) and rb_yield ( ) returns the value returned by the block .
No surprises here .
Now let ’s look at another example of implicit block passing , converting an implicit block into a proc :
def my_method if block_given ?
then p = Proc.new p.call else raise ArgumentError , " a block is required " end end
Here is the corresponding C code :
static VALUE my_method( VALUE self ) { VALUE p ; if ( rb_block_given_p ( ) ) p = rb_block_proc( ) ; rb_funcall( p , rb_intern ( " call " ) , 0 ) ; else rb_raise ( rb_eArgError , " a block is required " ) ; return Qnil ; }
Similar to Proc.new the C function rb_block_proc ( ) converts the implicitly passed block into a proc .
The rb_funcall ( ) function ( which you should be familiar with ) then executes the proc by invoking its ‘ call ’ method .
The prototype for rb_block_proc( ) is as follows :
VALUE rb_block_proc ( ) ;
Where the return value is the newly created proc .
One more function that exists only in the C API but is nonetheless very useful is rb_need_block ( ) , it throws a LocalJumpError exception if no block is present , use it as follows :
static VALUE my_method( VALUE self ) { rb_need_block ( ) ; rb_yield ( Qnil ) ; return Qnil ; }
Here is its prototype :
void rb_need_block ( ) ;
Explicit Blocks
To refresh here is the Ruby code for explicit block passing :
def my_method ( &block ) if block then block .
call else raise ArgumentError , " a block is required " end end
And here is the corresponding C code :
static VALUE my_method ( int argc , VALUE * argv , VALUE self ) { VALUE block = Qnil ; rb_scan_args ( argc , argv , " 0& " , & block ) ; if ( RTEST ( block ) ) rb_funcall ( block , rb_intern ( " call " ) , 0 ) ; else rb_raise ( rb_eArgError , " a block is required " ) ; return Qnil ; }
From above , C does n’t have any native way of defining a parameter as a ‘ block parameter ’ so to achieve the equivalent we must use rb_scan_args ( ) and a variable length parameter list .
The “ 0& ” parameter to rb_scan_args ( ) indicates we have no ( 0 ) ordinary parameters and one block ( & ) parameter .
The &block tells rb_scan_args ( ) to save the block in the variable called ‘ block ’ .
And , as in previous examples , rb_funcall ( ) invokes the block ( now really a proc ) .
Caveats
Blocks in C do not behave entirely like their Ruby counterparts .
Take the following Ruby code :
def my_method yield instance_eval " puts ' heya ' " end
and its C “ equivalent ” :
static VALUE my_method( VALUE self ) { VALUE cmd = rb_str_new2 ( " puts ' heya ' " ) ; rb_yield ( Qnil ) ; rb_obj_instance_eval ( 1 , &cmd , self ) ; return Qnil ; }
When we invoke the Ruby version of my_method on receiver ‘ obj ’ we get :
obj.my_method { puts " hello " } output : hello heya
But for the C version we get :
obj.my_method { puts " hello " } output : hello ArgumentError : wrong number of arguments ( 1 for 0 ) from ( irb ) : 3: in `my_method ' from ( irb ) :
3
Why the difference in behaviour ?
The error is due to the fact that in the C API blocks passed to methods are still ‘ live ’ and are automatically passed - on to other methods that can take blocks .
So , the line that errors in C appears to Ruby as :
instance_eval ( " puts ' heya ' " ) { puts " hello " }
Which is an error : instance_eval can take either a String or a block , but not both .
So how do we get the behaviour we want in C ?
static VALUE my_method( VALUE self ) { VALUE cmd = rb_str_new2 ( " puts ' heya ' " ) ; rb_yield ( Qnil ) ; rb_funcall ( self , rb_intern ( " instance_eval " ) , 1 , cmd ) ; return Qnil ; }
It is important to understand this difference as it can be the source of many headaches and frustrations .
Summary
The intention of this article was to provide some groundwork for the more advanced Metaprogramming articles to come .
Although not technically ‘ Metaprogramming ’ blocks are an integral part of the field and a thorough understanding of them is necessary before moving onto the more advanced material .
In the next article we ’ll learn about dynamic method definitions and singletons .

Our mantra of late has been that the serial bailout plans from the Treasury and Fed will undermine the US ’s AAA rating and exact a considerable toll on the dollar .

From Bloomberg :
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ’s plan to end the rout in U.S. financial markets may derail the dollar ’s three - month rally as investors weigh the costs of the rescue .
The combination of spending $ 700 billion on soured mortgage - related assets and providing $ 400 billion to guarantee money - market mutual funds will boost U.S. borrowing as much as $ 1 trillion , according to Barclays Capital interest - rate strategist Michael Pond in New York .
While the rescue may restore investor confidence to battered financial markets , traders will again focus on the twin budget and current - account deficits and negative real U.S. interest rates .
“ As we get to the other side of this , the dollar will get crushed , ” said John Taylor , chairman of New York - based International Foreign Exchange Concepts Inc. , the world ’s biggest currency hedge - fund firm , which manages about $ 15 billion .
The dollar fell against 14 of the world ’s most - traded currencies on Sept. 19 , including the euro , as Paulson unveiled the plan , while the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index rose 4 percent … .

Tom Brady will miss the entire season with a left knee injury that needs surgery , leaving the New England Patriots without one of the game 's great quarterbacks and severely damaging their hopes of a return trip to the Super Bowl .
The 2007 NFL Most Valuable Player will be placed on injured reserve , the Patriots said Monday , one day after Brady 's knee collapsed under him when he was hit by Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard in the first quarter of a 17 - 10 victory over Kansas City .
" As a team we all just have to do our jobs .
That really does n't change , " New England coach Bill Belichick said .
" He played one position , he played it very well .
We have somebody else playing that position now . "
A one - paragraph statement issued by the team confirmed that the two - time Super Bowl MVP will have surgery , ending a 128 - game starting streak that is the third longest for a quarterback in league history .
Belichick would not say what the injury is , but the play , Brady 's reaction and the prognosis all point toward a torn anterior cruciate ligament .
Brady sounded optimistic about the Patriots in an e-mail to NBCSports.com .
" It will all be OK , " he wrote .
" I 'm excited to see what our team is made of ... I still like our chances . "
Matt Cassel , who guided New England to its 20th consecutive regular - season victory after Brady was hurt , will start Sunday at the New York Jets .
It will be the first meaningful start since high school for Cassel , who backed up Heisman Trophy winners Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart at Southern California and spent the past three years holding a clipboard for Brady .

Multiracial activists - and some Barack Obama supporters - are seething over best - selling economist Steven Levitt 's assertions that mixed - race people are inherently more likely to engage in " bad behavior . "
There are those who saw in it the acrid tang of conspiracy : a casual , yet explosive Aug. 12 blog post by the celebrity economist , co-author of " Freakonomics . "
Titled " The Plight of Mixed - Race Children , " it outlined the conclusion of a paper Levitt had co-authored : Multiracial kids are more likely to engage in bad behavior than single - race kids .
In short , rather than being the " best of both worlds , " mixed kids were far more likely to be the worst .
( Though , said Levitt , they do have one thing in their favor : Multiracial kids are significantly " more attractive " than their single - race peers . )
The post enraged multiracial activists , who saw it as mirroring pernicious stereotypes .
It also prompted some to see a hidden attempt to sandbag Obama , the man whose rise has propelled mixed identity into the forefront of American culture .
" You have this paper with ' provocative ' conclusions on multiracial identity that was first written in July 2005 , being published in this final version in August 2008 , " Jason Sperber , Japanese American co-founder of the parenting blog RiceDaddies , said in a telephone interview .
" Hmm , why is this issue suddenly on the national horizon ?
Oh , right , the presidential campaign !
It 's hard not to wonder whether there 's a larger agenda . "
Given that " Freakonomics " is all about hidden incentives , it would be surprising if there were n't an ulterior motive - though it 's less likely a drive by Levitt to torpedo a fellow Chicagoan and Harvard alum 's presidential ambitions than a simple desire to recapture public attention .
Levitt and his collaborator , Stephen Dubner , are close to completing their new book " Superfreakonomics " ; a " Freakonomics " documentary is scheduled for early next year .
With these franchise extensions imminent , it only makes business sense to revive the brand 's awareness through " shocking " positions on topics in the media spotlight .
It 's that cultivation of controversy that has drawn fire from the likes of prominent economist John DiNardo , who has blasted the book 's methodology and conclusions as " scholarship in the service of storytelling . "
The study , co-authored with Harvard 's Roland Fryer and two other economists , seems particularly suspect , even to social scientists whose work the study cites .
" I do n't know what their objective was , but this is a paper with a surprising number of problems , " said Yoonsun Choi , associate professor of social service at the University of Chicago , Levitt 's home base .
" There 's so much more going on here than what they 're saying that the decisions they make look capricious , at a minimum . "
Discredited theory
The central issue voiced by critics is n't the study 's raw findings ; it's the researchers ' interpretation of those results , particularly their decision to use them to support a 1920s - era sociological concept called " marginal man " theory , which holds that people with multiple contrasting identities are , essentially , broken at birth .
But marginal man is almost universally considered to have little credibility today .
" Among scholars who study multiracial identity , I do n't think any of us believe in that hypothesis , " said University of Pennsylvania sociology Professor Grace Kao , whose work is also cited in " Plight . "
" It 's the most controversial take ; it 's basically the reason used to keep interracial marriages illegal until the 1960s .
At best , we might use it as a straw man . "
It 's also interesting to note that the marginal man concept was n't originally associated with multiracial identity , but rather , the assimilation issues of immigrants .
And where that topic is concerned , it 's still regularly invoked : Suggestions of divided allegiance , of being trapped between two cultures and belonging to neither - those are at the core of how Asians continue to be positioned in the great American racial dialogue .
Lost in the mix
This makes it only more confounding that Asian Americans are excluded from the " Plight " study , which defines " multiracial " solely as those of black - white heritage - despite the fact that Asians are far more likely than any other group to be part of an interracial couple , and , thus , to produce multiracial offspring .
Part of the problem is the dataset the study uses , the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ; though it 's the richest pool of youth data available , it dates back to 1994 , when the Asian American population was just 8.8 million and mixed - race Americans numbered about 1.3 million .
Since then , the Asian American population has nearly doubled , and America 's mixed - race population has more than tripled , with much of that growth due to multiracial Asian Americans .
It 's hard to believe that conclusions about identity from a 14 - year - old dataset have much to say about the " plight " of mixed - race individuals today - especially when restricted to a rigid black - white definition .
And that gets to the heart of the concerns critics have with the study 's sensationalistic claims .
" You have this assumption that blacks are one monolithic population , whites are another monolithic population , and multiracials are the monolithic blending between them , " Jenn Fang , who blogs on race and identity at Reappropriate.com , said by phone .
" But that 's just not representative of racial reality . "
In fact , most studies suggest that the advantage of being competent in multiple cultural contexts creates more benefits than problems .
" Take , for example , growing up in a multilingual environment , " Choi said .
" You may be a little slow to acquire language , but once you do , you find it easier to understand syntax and pronunciation for other languages as well .
Straddling cultures may add risks , but if we can address those risks , it flips over into a strength . "
And a big part of the flipping of that switch has been the arrival of multiracial role models .
" We 're talking about mixed identities in the public arena like never before , " Sperber said .
" Over the last 10 years , you 've had a new prominence of people who identify in fluid and dynamic ways - Barack Obama being just one example . "
In short , those who owned a multiplicity of identities may once have been " marginal " - but today ?
Today , they 're at the center of everything .
US Dept . Of Energy Installs Large Solar System at Headquarters
September 9th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Say what you will about the United States government ; at least the Department of Energy practices what it preaches .
Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman led the inauguration of a large solar power system at the top of the DOE ’s Forrestal Building today — a gesture that both symbolically and practically shows the DOE ’s commitment to solar .
The photovoltaic ( PV ) system will generate 200 MWh of electricity — enough to provide eight percent of the building ’s energy during peak hours .
The system will also save up to $ 26,000 in energy costs during its first year of operation .
The DOE ’s new PV system , which was developed by the SunPower Corporation , is 40 - 50 times larger than a residential system , and is integrated into the Forrestal building ’s current roof .
In addition to providing the DOE with plentiful power , the PV system will serve as an educational tool for the public .
A large video display installed in the building ’s lobby shows the amount of electricity generated by the solar array .
Unfortunately , the Forrestal building is only one of two federal buildings in Washington DC to earn ENERGY STAR certification .
We look to the federal government — or at least the DOE — to monitor our country ’s progress , so I do n’t think it ’s a stretch to expect more than two government buildings to show success in energy conservation .
Let ’s hope more federal institutions follow the Forrestal complex ’s lead .

Democrat Jason Osgood 's Series of Amusing Satirical Spots Said to Highlight the Many Problems With Electronic Voting ...
Brad Friedman Byon 9/25/2008 , 12:56 pm PT
The Democratic candidate for Secretary of State in Washington state has released what he says will be the first of a series of campaign spots , satirizing the well - known " Mac v. PC " commercials , to highlight the differences between touch - screen voting machines and paper ballots .
Jason Osgood , a long - time election integrity advocate and opponent of unverifiable electronic voting systems , is running against the incumbent Republican Sec. of State , Sam Reed .
Osgood joins several other citizen advocates across the country --- inlcuding Susan Rose Pynchon in Volusia County , FL , and Ellen Harriet Brodsky in Broward County , FL --- who have stepped up and decided to run this year against incumbent election officials who , they allege , have not been as responsive or transparent , in regard to voter concerns and citizen oversight , as they should be .
The 60 - second spot released today by the Osgood campaign is seen below ( text transcript is posted at the end of this article ) .
It features two men standing in front of a white background , one who identifies himself as " Paper Ballot " and the other , dressed in a slick white leisure suit with sunglasses and headset , who declares , " I'm a high - tech , touch - screen votin ' machine ! "
It quickly becomes apparent , as the spot begins , as " Voting Machine " searches through his pockets , that he 's lost something --- " a few thousand votes is all " ...
The comical ad , Osgood tells
The BRAD BLOG , is to be the first of several in a series , highlighting the differences between electronic voting systems and paper ballots .
" These videos are funny , " wrote Osgood in an email this morning .
" Each spot highlights just one problem with the voting machines .
This is a very effective way to explain a complicated issue . "
Osgood believes the ads may also help the issue of election integrity nationally , as they serve to simplify the concerns that advocates , as well as computer scientists and security experts , have been trying to share with the public .
" We 're steeped in the arcana of computers and election administration , " Osgood , who is himself a software engineer , told us .
" When we talk to others [ about these issues ] , we quickly lose them .
Which is a shame , because counting votes should be simple !
To be effective , we need to tailor our message to reach the broadest audience .
We need to engage every voter in the fight to reclaim our democracy and restore integrity to our elections , " he said ...
Osgood has been critical of the Republican Reed , the state 's chief election official , charging that he 's " made many bad decisions that threaten democracy . "
The Democratic candidate , a co-founder of the watchdog group Washington Citizens for Fair Elections , cited bar codes added to ballots in the state which " allow government officials to determine exactly how you voted , " as well as Reed 's support of new high - speed mail - in - ballot tabulators made by Diebold , as reasons he 's opposed to the current administration .
The bar codes are " a gross violation of our voter privacy , " he charges .
" We 've recently protected voter privacy in King County by banning unique bar codes on our ballots .
If we do n't get a new Secretary of State , these bar codes are going statewide , and possibly nationwide , " he warned .
Osgood says that Reed " continues to certify voting equpiment that makes it impossible to verify our votes are counted correctly . "
" We all know about the notorious DREs , like Diebold 's touchscreens , " he says .
" But there 's new systems on the way .
The incumbent champions new Diebold highspeed mail ballot tabulators .
We need to stop these new systems now , before they go nationwide . "
He said that more spots are coming soon .
" My campaign has more of these videos coming .
They 're terrific !
They 'll be released every few days .
If the idea catches fire , we 'll make more . "
Given the breathtaking scope of failures and concerns that have been revealed with electronic voting systems across the country over the past several years , Osgood and company say they have no shortage of ideas for new spots in the series .
" With all of the problems with voting machines , we could be making these videos for a long time . "
The text - transcript for the campaign 's first spot , follows in full below ...

In a kitchen in the south of England , two women are devising a recipe that could change the world .
James Flint reports
On a kitchen table two young women have assembled a variety of items .
There are brown bottles , bags of white powder , a pestle and mortar , a collection of funnels , a roll of silver gaffer tape .
There is a drill .
There is a whisk .
Are they making bombs ?
Are they making drugs ?
No .
They are doing something far more likely to change the world we live in .
They 're making their own version of Coca - Cola .
Codenamed " Merchandise 7X " , the list of ingredients that go into Coke - 922 million litres of which were drunk in the UK last year - has been kept carefully shrouded in mystery since the drink 's inventor , a medicinal chemist called John Pemberton , first wrote it down in 1886 .
These days it is supposedly kept under 24 - hour guard in a vault in Atlanta , Georgia , which is odd considering that author Mark Pendergrast published it in his exposé of the cola industry For God , Country & Coca - Cola ( Basic Books ) in 1993 .
The company maintains that this recipe is not the same as the one it uses .
Kate Rich and Kayle Brandon are bar managers at the Cube Microplex , an " alternative " cinema in central Bristol .
Opposed in principle to the business and environmental practices of the Coca - Cola corporation , the Cube bar has never served Coke .
That does n't mean there is n't a demand for it .
" We 'd tried Pepsi and Virgin Cola and various others too , " says Brandon , " but they were n't really a positive alternative .
They were acceptable , but they were n't Coke .
And people really want Coke . "
After conducting various taste tests , they felt the preference had less to do with flavour than the power of the brand .
Any alternative they were going to offer had not only to taste almost identical but overcome the incredible pull of Coca - Cola 's marketing .
" Given that most of the Cube 's customers come because they like the place 's DIY attitude , " Brandon explains , " one way of doing that was to make the cola ourselves . "
Cola is basically a mix of caramel , caffeine , sugar , fizzy water , citric or phosphoric acid , and eight essential oils .
It 's the precise blend of these oils that lies at the heart of the 7X secret formula .
A trawl of the web soon uncovered several 7X - type recipes , the most promising of which was adapted from the one in Pendergrast 's book .
But turning the recipe into a palatable drink turned out to be more difficult than it looked .
" The oils we had to import from the US , " says Rich .
" The caramel had to be sourced direct from DD Williamson , a large operation based in Manchester which actually provides the caramel for all the Coca - Cola manufactured in the UK .
And the caffeine we found at MyProtein.co.uk , a body - building website . "
When they had assembled most of the kit , they invited friends along to an " open lab " to help them make the drink .
" Unfortunately none of us had any scientific knowledge whatsoever , and it's quite a scientific process , " says Rich .
" We spent half our time running out to get ingredients that we did n't have , and we kept having to go round to the local post office to weigh things on their parcel scales . "
Though they came up with something like cola by the end of that first day , they could n't replicate their success .
The problem was getting the oils to mix with the other ingredients , a process called emulsification , or binding together .
The emulsifier used in most soft drinks is dried acacia sap , better known as gum arabic .
But Rich and Brandon could n't get this to work .
" We managed to destroy a whole series of kitchen mixers , completely trashed them .
The gum arabic scoured the sides , the blades snapped ... it was really violent and very distressing . "
After the fourth mixer went west they realised it was time to seek help .
A mass email to the Cube 's mailing list uncovered Dr Peter Barham , adviser to the Fat Duck restaurant and expert in food emulsification .
He pointed out that they were using the wrong kind of gum arabic .
" We 'd bought ours from the local Indian food shop , but it was n't particularly homogenous , so each time it was giving us different results . "
Barham also pointed out that making an emulsion was all about force .
Rich and Brandon had scaled up their quantities , but not their mixing power .
They were looking forlornly at the constituents of their cola lab when they noticed the tubular metal handle on one of their hand whisks was about the same thickness as a large drill bit .
Bingo !
Whisking the mixture with a hammer drill produced the desired effect .
All they needed to do now was to add caffeine , caramel , sugar , citric acid and sparkling water - and suddenly , from a single cup of emulsion , they had enough cola for a month .
So how does it taste ?
First , we try the real Coca - Cola .
A restrained sweetness , low cool notes of caramel , dry on the tongue , quite flat on the palette .
Very refreshing , but with little depth .
Now for Rich and Brandon 's home - made product .
The initial surprise is that it really does taste like Coke .
Very slightly sweeter than " the real thing " but less acidic .
A satisfying , complex flavour , subtly different from the brand leader , but easily as good .
Having found their liquid gold , Brandon and Rich plan to sell concentrate kits to other small bars and businesses .
They maintain that they are not out to challenge the Coca - Cola hegemony , but they " do hope that along the way we 'll help produce a small reality - shift .
It 's social change through science and baking .
Sort of DIY aesthetic meets the WI . "
The mega corporation remains unfazed .
" As the saying goes , imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , " says a Coca - Cola spokesman .
" But our product is unique .
Anyone with a selection of ingredients could make a type of cola , but there can only be one Coke . "
Thanks to Rich and Brandon , we have a much better idea of what that really means .
Brew it yourself
NB . 1 batch of 7 x formula will produce three batches cola syrup , or approximately 54 litres of cola .
Step 1 : 7 x formula :
Using food - grade essential oils , assemble 3.75 ml orange oil ; 3 ml lime oil ; 1 ml lemon oil ; 1 ml cassia oil ( nb. reduce cassia content for next production ) ; 0.75 ml nutmeg oil ; 0.25 ml coriander oil ( 6 drops ) ; 0.25 ml lavender oil ( 6 drops ) ; 0.25 ml neroli oil ( optional / removed due to high cost ) .
Using a measuring syringe , measure out the oils into a glass or ceramic container .
Keep covered to avoid volatile oil fumes escaping .
Then dissolve 10g instant gum arabic ( equivalent to 22 ml ) in 20 ml water ( low calcium / low magnesium , Volvic is good ) with one drop vodka - Cube uses Zubrowka .
( Be aware that total quantity of vodka will be 0.0007 ml per litre of Cube - cola ) .
Place the gum / water / vodka mix in a high - sided beaker - stainless steel or glass are best .
Using a high - power hammer drill with kitchen whisk attachment , whisk the gum mixture at high speed while your assistant droppers the oils .
Mix in steadily with the measuring syringe .
Continue to whisk at high speed for 5 - 7 minutes , or until the oils and water emulsify .
The resulting mixture will be cloudy .
Test for emulsification by adding a few drops of the mixture to one glass of water .
No oils should be visible on the surface .
You now have a successful flavour emulsion , which should hold for several months .
Step 2 : The mixers
This makes two allied concentrates , Composition A and Composition B , which can be stored separately before being mixed into cold syrup with the addition of sugar and water .
Composition A
Mix 30 ml double strength caramel colouring ( DD Williamson Caramel 050 ) with 10 ml water .
While stirring , add 10 ml 7 x flavour emulsion ( oils / gum / water mix ) .
Composition B
Mix 3 tsp ( 10 ml ) citric acid with 5 - 10 ml water , then sieve in 0.75 tsp ( 2.75 ml ) caffeine .
Mix thoroughly using a pestle and mortar until caffeine granules are no longer evident .
The mixture may behave erratically , turning either white or clear for no apparent reason .
If it goes white , add more water .
Pass through muslin or jelly bag to remove any anomalies .
At this point , A+B can be packaged separately and later reconstituted into cola syrup .
Step 3 : The cola syrup
2 litres water ; 2 kg sugar
Compositions A & B
Make a sugar syrup ( mix in a cooking pot on low heat to dissolve quickly ) using 1.5 litres of the water and all the sugar .
Filter if unsure .
Mix Composition
A into the remaining 500 ml water .
Add Composition B , then the sugar syrup .
You now have 3 litres Cube - Cola syrup or approx 18 litres cola .
Step 4 : The cola
As required , make up your cola as a 5:1 mix , five parts fizzy water to one part cola syrup .
Cube uses 350 ml syrup in a 2l bottle of Tesco Ashford Mountain Spring .

A person close to presidential candidate John McCain said " there is no deal " — a sentiment echoed by sources close to some Democrats involved in the negotiations .
Credit Markets Frozen : ' No One Is Trading '
Banks Need Another $ 500 Billion : Gross
The uncertainty followed a turbulent day in Washington , with some officials asserting that an agreement in principle had been reached , only to be contradicted moments later by other lawmakers .
The source close to McCain told CNBC that the agreement as it has been described publicly by Congressional and Senate staffers is " dead . "
However , McCain will work with Congressional staffers tonight to craft a deal , the source said .
Meanwhile , a source close to Democrats in the negotiations described the deal late Thursday as " cratering . "
The Democrats also plan to continue work into the night , the source said .
President Bush convened the meeting at the White House Thursday afternoon to hammer out an agreement on the bailout .
The president urged lawmakers to work out a deal soon .
" We 're in a serious economic crisis in the country if we do n't pass a piece of legislation , " Bush said at the beginning of the meeting .
" We know we 've got to get something done as quickly as possible .
My hope is that we can reach an agreement very shortly . "
The president was flanked by Democratic and Republican House and Senate leaders as well as the two presidential candidates , Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama .
In a dramatic turn , GOP Sen .
Richard Shelby emerged from the White House meeting to say : " I do n't believe we have an agreement . "
Watch Shelby 's White House remarks
But in a subsequent interview on CNBC , GOP Rep .
Peter King of New York said that Shelby may have been too hasty in saying there was no deal .
" I would n't say that at all , " King said .
Republican Sen. Lamar
Alexander also told CNBC that at least 40 of the 49 Republican senators will back the bailout .
In the earlier CNBC interview , Shelby said he would raise several objections to the plan at the White House meeting .
" I have my doubts , " the Alabama senator said .
" I do n't know this will solve all the problems in the economy . "
Shelby 's comments came after House GOP leader Rep. John Boehner of Ohio , said his party has not reached a deal yet on the bailout plan .
" I am encouraged by the bipartisan progress , " Boehner said in a statement .
But " House Republicans have not agreed to any plan at this point . "
Though no agreement has been reached , there are several key provisions that are being discussed .
They include :
- The $ 700 billion rescue fund would be made available in several installments , starting with $ 250 billion followed by $ 100 billion when the president certifies a financial emergency continues and another $ 350 billion in May .
- Government would get warrants for equity in participating companies as a way of protecting taxpayers .
- Restrictions on chief executive compensation at companies that participate .
- Two oversight boards would be formed — one with congressional representation , another would have the power to undo decisions by the Treasury Secretary .
- The Treasury Secretary would be prohibited from acting in an arbitrary or capricious manner or any way inconsistent with existing law .
- Regular , detailed reports would be made to Congress disclosing exercise of the Treasury Secretary 's authority .
- An independent inspector general would be set up to monitor the use of the Treasury Secretary 's authority .
- The Government Accountability Office would be required to perform audits to ensure proper use of funds , appropriate internal controls , and to prevent waste , fraud , and abuse .
- Maximize and coordinate efforts to modify mortgages for homeowners at risk of foreclosure .
- Loan modifications would be required for mortgages owned or controlled by the federal government .
- A percentage of future profits from the bailout fund would be made available to the Affordable Housing Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund to meet America 's housing needs .

A SLOWING world economy is not welcomed by many .
But business schools may have some reason for good cheer .
Applications for full - time Master of Business Administration ( MBA ) programmes are booming .
Executives , keen to hone their money - making skills , are choosing to sit out the economic downturn in the confines of the world 's business schools .
And if attempts to gain admittance to MBA courses are a useful indicator of economic activity then the global economy is in for a rough future too .
Applications next year are expected to climb even higher .

Schumer : ' The McCain / Palin campaign has peaked ' David Edwards
Published : Sunday September 14 , 2008
Print This Email This Sen. Chuck Schumer said on NBC that the McCain campaign had a reached a peak in popularity that could not sustain a lead over Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama .
NBC's Tom Brokaw asked the senator to comment on the surge in national polls for John McCain 's campaign .
" It 's still an even race , " Schumer said .
" And I hate to keep reiterating , as this campaign unfolds , I think in a certain sense , the McCain / Palin campaign has peaked .
They had all the excitement .
Everyone 's excited that for the first time the Republican Party chose a woman candidate .
But the fundamentals matter in a race like this and they do n't have the fundamentals .
You cannot -- you cannot win an election if it 's premised on a fundamental mistruth , which is that they are change .
They are not change from George Bush . "
Schumer went on to criticize Palin for cronyism , support for Senator Ted Stevens , abuse of power , not releasing her tax returns .

President George W. Bush has announced the start of the war against Iraq .
Bush addressed the nation on television at 10.15 pm Eastern time ( 2.15 pm March 20 , AEST ) .
He said : “ At this hour American and coalition forces are in the early stage of military operations to disarm Iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger . ”
Transcript of President George W. Bush ’s Address to the Nation on Iraq .
My fellow citizens , at this hour American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger .
On my orders , coalition forces have begun striking selected targets of military importance to undermine Saddam Hussein ’s ability to wage war .
These are opening stages of what will be a broad and concerted campaign .
More than 35 countries are giving crucial support , from the use of naval and air bases , to help with intelligence and logistics , to the deployment of combat units .
Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense .
To all of the men and women of the United States armed forces now in the Middle East , the peace of a troubled world and the hopes of an oppressed people now depend on you .
That trust is well placed .
The enemies you confront will come to know your skill and bravery .
The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military .
In this conflict , America faces an enemy who has no regard for conventions of war or rules of morality .
Saddam Hussein has placed Iraqi troops and equipment in civilian areas , attempting to use innocent men , women and children as shields for his own military ; a final atrocity against his people .
I want Americans and all the world to know that coalition forces will make every effort to spare innocent civilians from harm .
A campaign on the harsh terrain of a nation as large as California could be longer and more difficult than some predict .
And helping Iraqis achieve a united , stable and free country will require our sustained commitment .
We come to Iraq with respect for its citizens , for their great civilization and for the religious faiths they practice .
We have no ambition in Iraq , except to remove a threat and restore control of that country to its own people .
I know that the families of our military are praying that all those who serve will return safely and soon .
Million of Americans are praying with you for the safety of your loved ones and for the protection of the innocent .
For your sacrifice , you have the gratitude and respect of the American people and you can know that our forces will be coming home as soon as their work is done .
Our nation enters this conflict reluctantly , yet our purpose is sure .
The people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder .
We will meet that threat now with our Army , Air Force , Navy , Coast Guard and Marines , so that we do not have to meet it later with armies of firefighters and police and doctors on the streets of our cities .
Now that conflict has come , the only way to limit its duration is to apply decisive force .
And I assure you , this will not be a campaign of half measures and we will accept no outcome but victory .
My fellow citizens , the dangers to our country and the world will be overcome .
We will pass through this time of peril and carry on the work of peace .
We will defend our freedom .
We will bring freedom to others .
And we will prevail .
May God bless our country and all who defend her .
Ceasefire in Georgia Putin Outmaneuvers the West
Russia 's strongman Vladimir Putin has achieved his goal in Georgia -- the country has been destabilized .
And the West will have to look on powerless when its ally , Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili , is eventually driven from office .
This is not the JCPenny store I remember .
They 've given up talking about price , sales , styles , selection and that crap .
Now they 're marketing clothes teens can take on and off real fast - that way they wo n't get caught having sex by their parents .
I think that 's the message here anyway .
I can't wait to see all the up tight folks in the USA go ape sh*t over what this is implying .
POST UPDATE : This ad looks to be a fake and JCP is none too pleased .
Sept. 9 , 2008  --
One of the few things Mandy Sellars wanted out of life was something many people tried to avoid .
" In life , a lot of people do n't like to be labeled as this or that or the other , " Sellars said .
" But all my life , I 've been kind of searching for a label for myself . "
The label , she thought , would be the answer to a mystery that her doctors had not been able to solve .
" There 's been hardly any contact with doctors , " she said .
" I 've been kind of , in my own words , put on the shelf and kind of forgotten about . "
Sellars is 33 years old and weighs 285 pounds .
Her upper torso is a petite size 8 and accounts for only about 70 or 80 pounds of her weight .
The rest is in her legs and feet .
" When I was born , there was a noticeable difference between my upper body and my lower body , " Sellars said .
" They did n't actually expect me to live further than about a few , a few days or so . "
A Tough Job for the Shoemaker
Throughout her childhood , the growth of her legs continued to outpace the rest of her body until she could no longer move on her own .
She walks now with the aid of crutches and drives a specially equipped automobile .
Near her home in northwestern England , Sellars goes to a private shoemaker .
Her right foot is 16 inches long and 7 inches wide , and her legs are of differing lengths because the left foot -- a club foot , 11 inches long -- faces backward .
So the fittings are delicate .
It takes weeks of trial and error to produce the final molds for a pair of boots , and they will cost around $ 4,000 -- money she has to raise because she is unemployed .
The public 's reaction to her has sometimes been brutal .
She recalled being heckled once by a gang of youths .
" Just walking through the park with a friend , that 's all .
And , there must 've been three , four , five , teenagers on bikes , or something , " she said .
" And they just started making the usual kind of comments , you know , ' Oh , my God , look at that . '
You know , ' Is n't that disgusting ? '
And just kind of circling myself and my friend on their bikes .
Something like that is very intimidating . "
Because her condition remained such a mystery , she often seemed to be on the edge of disaster .
In college , she was once suddenly paralyzed because of a blood clot that required 10 weeks of hospitalization .
When a plastic surgeon tried liposuction to reduce the bulk in her legs , more tissue grew back than had been removed .
" In my mind , the condition has a mind of its own , " Sellars said , " because whatever you take away grows back bigger and bigger . "
Finding Help Online
It was through the Internet that she finally began to get a clue about what her condition might be .
A friend of hers came across the site of an organization in Great Britain called the Proteus Syndrome Foundation U.K. .
That finally led to a diagnosis , one that Sellars had been waiting years to receive .
The unusual growth of her legs and knees was common to people with Proteus syndrome
" This is a very rare disorder .
Certainly , less than one in a million , " said Dr. John Graham , director of clinical genetics at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles .
" Proteus syndrome is named for the Greek God who could change his form .
And because it was such an apt description of how these individuals rapidly change form from appearing relatively normal as young children to this startling overgrowth , the name has remained with the disorder ever since then . "
The most famous case of Proteus syndrome in history was that of Joseph Merrick , also known as the Elephant Man , who died in 1890 and was the subject of a well - known movie about his life .
Merrick 's condition affected his head and facial features as well as his arms and legs .
Different patients may be affected in different areas .
Doctors can't say what an average lifespan might be .
The syndrome is poorly understood , but it is not believed to be hereditary .
Thinking Ahead
Sellars lives independently in a home that has been only slightly modified for her , but even common household tasks -- fixing a cup of tea -- can be exhausting .
She visits a nutritionist , hoping she can lessen the effects of Proteus syndrome through diet , but so far , it has n't helped .
She has been told that eventually she may need to amputate her legs .
She 's already considering how she will live her life then and has even thought about entering the London Marathon as a wheelchair racer .
" I 'd love to do that , " Sellars said , " and hopefully then be able to wheel myself and train hard enough to be able to do that , and raise money for charity that 's helped me . "

A Queens man who survived an electric shock and fire two years ago when he climbed atop an empty , stopped Amtrak train after a night of bar hopping in Boston is suing the railroad – because Amtrak did n’t do enough to protect trespassers like him .
Brian Hopkins , 25 , of Astoria , was discovered engulfed in flames at about 4 a.m. atop the high - speed Acela train , having been jolted by 27,500 volts from arcing overhead wires .
Hopkins had been visiting friends in Boston when he suddenly proclaimed that he “ wanted to get back to New York ” and left a friend ’s house at about 2 a.m. , according to published reports at the time of the July 2006 incident .
Hopkins , an architect , apparently tried to pry open one of the parked trains before climbing on top .
He suffered third - degree burns over 85 percent of his body , and doctors have since amputated his left hand and leg , according to the lawsuit filed last month in Brooklyn federal court .
Amtrak “ should have known that persons trespassed ” in the South Station area where Hopkins was found , he and his parents contend in court papers .
The family claims that Amtrak should have monitored the area , cut off the electricity going to the overhead wires , and even parked its trains somewhere else when they were n’t in use .
Amtrak declined to comment on the pending litigation .

There ’s no science to coming up with a good comic idea , even though we ’ve pushed the idea of a magical formula in the past .
Inspiration can come from anywhere , and this week ’s comic was inspired by my wife ’s toothpaste tube of all things .
When your toothpaste promises it will give you 25 % stronger enamel , how can you refuse ?
Then I dug through our pantry and realized that this kind of on - product advertising was pretty common .
I ’m not talking about just health conscious advertising because everything advertises low calories , fat - free , no suger , etc .
I ’m talking about other benefits , like my cereal that says it improves attentiveness by 20 % , or my Nesquik that says it helps build strong bones .
For an RPG fan , those stat improvements are too much to resist !
Taking
Tim ’s idea about putting exciting labels on products led to the idea of creating a standardized labeling system on foods targeted towards kids .
It would replace the boring “ nutrition facts ” on the back ( no kid wants to look at that ) and provide incentive as to why they would want to eat something .
Think about it , kids will do the most boring thing over and over again in a video game just to let their character gain stats in a certain area , so why not apply the same logic to Spinach ?

Her latest column really is a must - read .
Yeah , she ’s bitchy sometimes ( are n’t we all ? ) , but sometimes her inner rhymes - with - witch is just what ’s needed .
I think this column is one of those times .
Obama also allowed Hillary supporters to insert an absurd statement into the platform suggesting that media sexism spurred her loss and that “ demeaning portrayals of women … dampen the dreams of our daughters . ”
This , even though postmortems , including the new raft of campaign memos leaked by Clintonistas to The Atlantic — another move that undercuts Obama — finger Hillary ’s horrendous management skills … .
It would have been better to put this language in the platform : “ A woman who wildly mismanages and bankrupts a quarter - of - a - billion - dollar campaign operation , and then blames sexism in society , will dampen the dreams of our daughters . ”
The chemistry teacher came in with a box under her arm .
" Does anyone believe that I have something here that can lift a tonne weight a thousand metres into the air ? "
She opened the box to show a litre bottle of petrol .
" In the engine of a car at the bottom of a hill this much petrol can do just that . "
Petrol is a truly amazing substance – it is readily stored and transported while packing an immense amount of energy into a small volume .
Married to the internal combustion engine , it fuelled the transport revolution of the 20th century and became crucial to the entire global economy .
The mineral oil from which petrol and diesel are produced is now expensive – a fact that is intimately bound up with the world 's current economic woes .
To try to work out what this means for the global environment , the first obvious questions are these : why are prices so high ?
And how long will the high prices last ?
Oil is expensive because everyone wants it and supplies are limited , with no sign of a significant increase any time soon .
Prices have always been somewhat volatile and underlying trends tend to be masked by shorter - term factors such as refinery capacity , weather , politics and wars .
But the stark reality is that we now know the earth 's oil and gas reserves pretty well and most of the readily accessible ones are significantly depleted .
There 's still a great deal of oil and gas in the ground , but it will be expensive to recover .
In addition , 80 per cent of the remaining reserves are controlled by governments – as opposed to companies – and these governments are starting to regard their shrinking oil and gas resources as something to be guarded .
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia recently described his response to new finds : " No , leave it in the ground … our children need it . "
Before the credit crisis hit , oil producing nations saw that $ 100 oil did not cause the world economy to collapse and it seems likely that they will defend a price that is at least that high going forward .
Moreover , the decline in the value of the US dollar in which oil is traded has reduced their real income .
In other words , they have little incentive – and probably minimal practical capacity – to accede to pleas to produce more and charge less .
High oil prices , then , are probably here to stay .
What will this mean for emissions ?
Will high oil prices limit consumption and cause a dip in the world 's CO2 output ?
I suspect that energy demand from developing countries will continue to grow – albeit slightly more slowly .
So although emissions wo n't fall , it 's possible they 'll stop accelerating quite so fast .
On the other hand , high oil prices might make coal power more attractive or encourage countries to keep old , inefficient power stations in service .
Since coal is more carbon - intensive than oil , this could offset any emissions benefit .
More significant is what the high oil price and the credit crunch will mean for the transition to low - carbon energy sources such as wind , nuclear and second - generation biofuels that do n't threaten food supplies .
On a 40 year time scale , I am fairly confident that a low - carbon economy is possible , with electrical and biofuel surface vehicles ; aircraft partly on biofuels ; ships on micronuclear or biodiesel ; electricity powered by renewables and electrical storage to manage intermittency , as well as some nuclear and gas .
It 's too early to say how big an impact the downturn will have on this low - carbon transition .
In reality , though , it will probably prolong it – even if the political and industry rhetoric remains unchanged .
That is n't good news for emissions .
It 's true that , with oil prices of more than $ 100 , alternatives energy sources become more financially attractive .
But coal is still abundant and cheap , and it can be processed into synthetic vehicle fuel for much less than the present price of oil , as well as being burned to generate electricity .
The three most energy hungry economies in the world – China , India and the USA – have more than half the world 's coal reserves and look likely to use them .
China , in particularly , is commissioning about two medium - large coal - fired power stations each week ( in addition to a very ambitious wind , nuclear and hydro programme ) .
Perhaps the key question , then , is how quickly the world develops and rolls out CCS – carbon capture and storage , the technology which allows power stations to capture the CO2 as it is generated and immobilise it for tens of thousands of years .
The preferred option is to store the CO2 underground in geological structures such as abandoned gas fields .
Because this may not be practicable everywhere , and because at high pressure the gases form dense liquids , experiments have been proposed to explore whether they could be accommodated in hollows in the deepest parts of the ocean floor .
Such storage would be against present international law but it might turn out to be the lesser of two evils .
If a viable technology were developed to pull CO2 directly from that atmosphere , that too would be helpful .
My feeling is that on the crucial question of CCS , the economic downturn wo n't make a huge difference , because the heavy expenditure on deploying the technology is a decade away .
As long as governments and companies invest now in the research and development of the technologies – and as long as breakthrough made in the west are shared with developing nations – then we will still have a chance to control our emissions in time .
What seems certain , however , is that we are entering a new era .
The century of cheap energy is behind us and the present crisis is not one to be struggled through with the prospect of going on as before when it is over .
Energy and everything that depends on energy will be relatively more expensive in the future – we are all going to have to work longer and harder to pay for it .
That is the other inconvenient truth .
Playing the Keating card
The Obama campaign , which has previously declined to comment on John McCain 's two - decade old brush with allegations that he was too close to a figure with the Savings & Loan disaster , plays the card today in response to Steve Schmidt 's demand that the press investigate Obama more .
From his email to reporters :
# of probing stories the NY Times has written over the course of the campaign about Barack Obama , his life , his religion , his childhood , his politics , his time in the state senate , his time in the U.S. Senate , his family , his religion , his friends , his fundraising and all other manner of associations : more than 40 ( see below ) # of stories the NY Times has written over the course of the campaign about the last major financial regulatory crisis , resulting in a huge bailout , and which John McCain was centrally involved in with his political godfather Charles Keating : 0
The Keating Five scandal , though , is hardly a secret .
Indeed , the story is central to McCain 's political narrative .
He 's called his actions a mistake , and the episode is what transformed him into a self - stylled reformer .
“ He has basically dedicated his career since that moment to the cleaning up of Washington , ” McCain aide Douglas Holtz - Eakin told me last week .
A clinic in Britain is offering a cure for migraine sufferers by removing a muscle in the forehead that triggers pain , nausea and dizziness .
Each year millions of people suffer from migraine headaches , which is a severe pain felt on one , or sometimes both , sides of the head .
Affecting most people between the ages of 15 and 55 , the cause for a migraine is unknown , but many researchers believe that blood flow or chemical changes in the brain can cause these painful headaches .
Migraines are usually treated with medication but a clinic is now offering a solution .
Most migraines are started when the nerves in the head and the corrugator muscle ( located above the eyebrows ) interact .
Patients have to go through a screening process in order to find their migraine trigger points , because not all migraines are triggered in the same places .
Patients are given Botox injections in order to paralyze the corrugator muscle .
After waiting eight weeks , they are then to report whether there has been a significant improvement in their migraine symptoms .
If so , they are then allowed to have the operation to remove the corrugator muscle .
Professor Thomas Muehlberger has performed this surgery over 500 times on migraine sufferers .
He says , “ Although the migraine procedure will not be suitable for all patients , it will offer many of those affected a real chance of freeing themselves from their migraines completely or at least reducing the severity and frequency of their attacks . ”
This sounds like a new breakthrough for people with migraines , but it would be interesting to know if there would be any kind of scarring or especially nerve damage if anything were to go wrong .
But I ’m sure that people with migraines would try anything to get rid of them just to be free of the pain .
Would any of you migraine sufferers out there every think of getting a surgery like this ?

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
House conservatives urged Congress on Tuesday to " take a breath " and consider other alternatives before rushing to pass a $ 700 billion plan to bail out Wall Street , a measure the White House says must pass by the end of the week .
Rep .
Mike Pence says Congress should look at free - market options before passing a $ 700 billion bailout .
" I must tell you , there are those in the public debate who have said that we must act now .
The last time I heard that , I was on a used - car lot , " said Rep. Mike Pence , R - Indiana .
" The truth is , every time somebody tells you that you 've got to do the deal right now , it usually means they 're going to get the better part of the deal . "
Congress is rushing to finalize legislation that would authorize Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to buy up to $ 700 billion worth of mortgage - related securities and other assets that are dragging down Wall Street institutions and freezing up credit markets .
When Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke proposed the bailout last week , congressional leaders gave initial support for the measure and said they would work to pass it quickly .
Watch Bernanke call for urgent action »
But after the Treasury proposal arrived on Capitol Hill last weekend , lawmakers vowed to modify the plan .
The changes being floated include adding oversight of the program by an independent board , helping homeowners who are facing foreclosure , allowing the government to take an equity stake in the companies it helps , and limiting the CEO pay of companies that are aided by the bailout to the $ 400,000 salary of the top elected official in the land : the president .
An aide to Rep. Barney Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said negotiators had agreement on an oversight board and some form of help for homeowners facing foreclosure .
The aide said the negotiators were " not there yet " on whether the government could take a stake in the companies it help .
Watch Paulson call for bipartisan action »
CEOs of companies aided by the taxpayers could continue to bring down multimillion - dollar salaries , and that has sparked widespread anger on Capitol Hill .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that if the bailout passes , " the party is over " for the companies that it helps .
Watch Pelosi use tough language on Wall Street »
" The party is over for this compensation for CEOs who take the golden parachute as they drive their companies into the ground .
...
The party is over for financial institutions taking risks [ and ] at the same time privatizing any gain they may have while they nationalize the risk , asking the taxpayer to pick up the tab , " Pelosi said .
When asked by a reporter what would happen to the economy if the measure were not passed by the end of the week , White House spokesman Tony Fratto said , " I think you should think of that as unthinkable . "
" I mean , every business , every employer and so every employee in America depends every day on the flow of money coming through our financial system to sustain their normal business operations , " Fratto said .
However , many lawmakers on both the left and the right are asking how they can justify risking $ 700 billion of the taxpayers ' money to help out Wall Street when many Americans are hurting economically .
And conservatives , in particular , object to the large departure from free - market principles .
Watch more about Secretary Paulson »
" They are saying this is failure of the free markets of capitalism when , in fact , this is a failure because government injected itself into the free market , created this easy credit , these guaranteed loans , and these loans are what have turned into the bad paper that are bringing all these financial institutions down , " said Sen. Jim DeMint , R - South Carolina .
Watch DeMint slam the bailout »
Rep. Jim McDermott , D - Washington , also asked why Congress should trust the administration to administer the bailout plan properly when , in his view , it has lost its credibility with the American people .
" Trust is something that is already bankrupt .
The bank of trust in this administration is absolutely bankrupt , " McDermott said .
" They have misled , lied , misrepresented , whatever word you want to use , on issue after issue .
And now they give us seven days to come back , take out your wallet and give them everything that 's in it . "
But Rep. John Boehner of Ohio , the top Republican in the House , said the gravity of the situation requires quick action .
" Nobody wants to do this .
Nobody wants to be involved in this .
Nobody wants to take the chance , but I would argue ... if we do nothing , we are jeopardizing our economy , jobs and people 's retirement security , " he said .
CNN 's Deirdre Walsh , Lesa Jansen and Scott J. Anderson contributed to this report .

I 've never felt much kinship with Dorothy or Cinderella - or with Carrie , for that matter - but here I am , making decisions and changing my habits , purely on the basis of shoes .
They are , to be fair , talking shoes , which I was hoping would make the whole situation sound more rational , but I realise now only makes me sound madder .
And , this being the 21st century , they do n't talk to me but to my iPod .
The Nike + system takes something I hate ( running ) and turns it into something I love ( gaming ) .
Thanks to a pedometer on my foot that broadcasts to a receiver on my Nano , my iPod knows how far , how fast and how often I run , and tabulates my efforts on the Nike + website so I can compete against the world .
I 'm currently running in the great international Talls vs Smalls race , the Innies vs Outies face - off , and am 14th on the leader board for the beginner 's challenge .
I 'm 14th on the international leaderboard !
If only my Mutant Storm scores had ever got so high .
Virtual jogging
And , to further sate my gamer brain , the site gives me a profile reminiscent of an Xbox Live GamerCard , and there are even Easter Eggs - those hidden , unlockable treats so beloved of videogames - which reward particular achievements with unexpected treats .
Five weeks ago I was running sporadically , lazily and slowly .
Controversy rages over how fit Wii Fit can make you Now , thanks to videogame style incentives , I 'm clocking up miles come rain or shine .
And I 'm not alone in this new adventure of becoming fitter through fun .
Millions of people around the world are currently really jogging around virtual parks , cheered on by the virtual avatars of their real friends thanks to Wii Fit .
Games , which have long dallied with the possibility of being fitness tools , have now established themselves as a genuinely useful addition to many people 's active lives .
It 's not a shift that 's been universally welcomed .
Wii
Fit has sparked a lot of negative comment about how effectively it can deliver on the promise of its name , with even its creator Shigeru Miyamoto back - pedalling to say that the game is n't actually supposed to make you fit , just more aware of your body .
However , those who only look to measure its cardio - vascular effects risk missing the real benefit it does to people 's hearts .
Video game Olympics
For those of us who 've spent a lifetime being picked last for football , or wheezing our way back from a run after everyone else has already showered and changed , the experience of being 14th in the world , or of having a cheering squad greet us when we run is a healing , heartening experience .
In China winning is associated with gaming more than sport
It helps associate physical activity with feeling good , not feeling bad , and that 's a powerful , life - changing shift .
But is that the full extent of how games will change the world of sport ?
Are they destined to nothing more than motivational tools which plug in to shoes and exercise bikes and balance boards
By no means .
It 's now only a few weeks before the Olympics begin in Beijing , and already for hundreds of millions of Chinese the experience of losing or winning is one which is indelibly linked with videogames , not sport .
The immense popularity of games such as ZT Online and Fantasy Westward Journey demonstrate that these pastimes have become a truly mainstream activity .
How long before gaming finds itself fighting to achieve Olympic inclusion ?
On the face of it , it 's a ridiculous proposition , but activities such as pool , snooker and chess are all recognised Olympic sports , and there are many StarCraft players who would argue that the dexterity , speed and co-ordination their game requires far outweighs the physical demands of something like bridge - also recognised by the International Olympic Committee .
More to the point , with the rise of physical input games such as those seen on Wii and Sony 's EyeToy , the argument against classifying videogames as sports on the basis of their lack of physical exertion is weakened even further .
Why would two tennis opponents need to be on the same continent , let alone the same court ?
Margaret Robertson Something such as EyeToy : Antigrav , a much overlooked PS2 game by Guitar Heroes Harmonix , is a good case in point .
An air - boarding game , it requires that you use your full body as a controller , leaning and twisting to steer , jumping to jump , and waving to pull off stunts .
It 's exhausting and exhilarating , and it's hard to see how it fundamentally differs from an activity like gymnastics , even if the skill and fitness levels required are currently substantially lower .
Ball sensors Indeed , one of the great advantages that electronic gaming offers over gymnastics or synchronised swimming is that it can be conclusively scored .
There are no suspicious national loyalties , no nakedly spiteful 5.7s .
And it's this latter benefit which demonstrates the most straightforward way in which videogaming will change physical gaming .
It 's not just a question of games converging with sport , it 's that sport is also converging with games .
No-one who has watched the evolution of Wimbledon 's Hawkeye , or has enjoyed the virtual fielding overviews of Sky 's cricket coverage can have missed the way in which sport is learning to incorporate technology .
It 's not a straightforward proposition , as the debates surrounding the introduction of instant video replays in football and the refusal to allow automated LBW calls in cricket proves , but as technology advances the arguments against these systems will become harder and harder to sustain .
There 's no reason - in principle if not in practice - that we could n't ultimately have sensors in ball and bat , in racquet and shoe , to measure to a millimetre exactly who was where and when .
And , continued to its logical conclusion , this line of technological integration could take sport to a place where we barely recognise it .
If we could measure every movement of the racquet and consequently model every movement of the ball , why would we need a real ball at all ?
And if we do n't need a real ball , why would two tennis opponents need to be on the same continent , let alone the same court ?
Why would two runners need to be on the same track , or indeed need to run at the same time , if one could download the other 's ghost ?

What are these ?
Let me get this straight .
John McCain ’s top economic advisor , former Sen. Phil Gramm , is the guy who authored the deregulation law that most agree is the ultimate cause of today ’s financial meltdown .
Tomorrow ’s and probably next week ’s too .
But let ’s not get ahead of ourselves .
John Thain , CEO of Merrill Lynch , which swirled into brokerage oblivion today , is one of McCain ’s top economic advisors too .
And now McCain says he ’s going to clean up the mess by putting in tighter regulations and oversight even though he ’s always supported lax oversight and his top economics guy is the one who loosened the rules in the first place .

Back in February , Andrew Revkin , climate and environment reporter for the New York Times ( and fellow SEJ member ) wrote in his DotEarth blog that there were a number of people and organizations hoping to have the Presidential candidates debate on various science topics .
The group most directly involve in trying to organize this debate was Science Debate 2008 , and while they were unable to get Barack Obama and John McCain to agree to a science debate , they were able to get a list of 14 questions submitted to the campaigns , and responses to those questions back .
The 14 questions were , with the help of several science organizations , culled from 3400 questions submitted by scientists and engineers representing nearly every American science organization , Nobel laureates , and over 100 universities .
I ’ve excerpted the questions and answers below in an attempt to understand and explain why the questions , and the candidates answers to each , matter .
If you want to read the complete questionnaire and the actual answers to each instead of my summaries , check out this link .
— — —-
Question 1 : What policies will you support to ensure that America remains the world leader in innovation ?
Obama believes that our place as the world leader in innovation is threatened because of a lack of federal investment and insufficient interest by young people in the science and engineering fields .
His response is to fund high risk / high payoff research , more grants for new scientists , more emphasis on quality teaching of both mathematics and science , and more grants and fellowships for science and engineering students in college .
McCain believes that his experience on the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation makes him uniquely qualified to address the problem of innovation , and that lower taxes and deregulation will make companies more innovative .
His specific recommendations are to appoint a science and technology adviser , improve government management and promote fiscal responsibility within the government ’s science and technology departments , reallocate wasted earmark money to science and technology , reform science and math education , and develop the federal agenda with the aid of business and academic leaders .
Question 2 : What is your position on the following measures that have been proposed to address global climate change — a cap - and - trade system , a carbon tax , increased fuel - economy standards , or research ?
Are there other policies you would support ?
McCain believes that global heating is real and must be addressed .
He wants to institute a cap - and - trade system that incentivizes emissions reductions for companies and that returns to 2005 carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) levels by 2012 , 1990 levels by 2020 , and 60 % below 1990 levels by 2050 .
He wants to increase CAFE standards and make the financial penalties for not meeting them stronger .
McCain wants to spend $ 2 billion per year on “ clean coal ” technology development , $ 5,000 in tax credits for every family that buys a zero-emission vehicle , and a $ 300 million prize for a radically more advanced battery technology .
Obama also believes that global heating must be addressed , although his ultimate cap - and - trade CO 2 emissions target is 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 and to 1990 levels by 2020 , although he wants to auction all cap - and - trade permits .
Obama also says that he ’ll not only work with the UN and the G8+5 energy consuming / CO 2 emitting nations to create a global energy forum , and he says he ’ll develop a mechanism to export clean coal , advanced automobile , and green building technologies to the developing world .
Ed. Note :
The IPCC estimates that , in order to achieve a stabilization target of 490 ppm CO 2 , emissions must peak no later than 2015 and must be 50 % or more below 1990 levels by 2050 in order to keep the peak below 450 ppm and global heating below 2 °C .
More recent modeling puts the target much lower – total decarbonization ( 0 tons of emitted CO 2 ) by 2050 at the latest .
Question 3 : What policies would you support to meet demand for energy while ensuring an economically and environmentally sustainable future ?
Obama has proposed $ 150 billion over 10 years in new research into alternative fuels and chemicals , green buildings , fuel efficiency improvements , energy storage , a smart electricity transmission grid , carbon capture and sequestration , and a new generation of nuclear power plants .
He gives specific targets as well : reduce the energy intensity of the economy by 50 % by 2030 , improve new building efficiency by 50 % and old building efficiency by 25 % , boost fuel efficiency by 4 % per year , institute a renewable electricity standard that requires 10 % of the nation ’s electricity be produced from renewables by 2012 and 25 % by 2025 .
And Obama says he wants encourage the development of sustainable communities and mass transit nationwide .
McCain wants sustainable energy as a way to improve the environment , the economy , and national security .
He wants 45 new nuclear reactors by 2030 , but that ’s the only specific target McCain gives .
Instead , McCain proposes a permanent renewable power tax credit , that government ensure a level playing field for all renewable energy sources , and to make the United States the world leader in innovative green technologies .
He believes that research and carbon reductions will spur revolutionary innovations that will , as a result , lower energy costs and boost economic growth .
Question 4 : What role do you think the federal government should play in preparing K - 12 students for the science and technology driven 21st Century ?
McCain believes that a well trained workforce is vital to growing an innovative economy .
He also feels that the country needs to do more to retrain workers who find their jobs downsized or outsourced in addition to graduating more students in science and technology fields .
Further , McCain believes not only that the U.S. is facing a critical shortage of scientists and engineers , but that we should leverage the creativity of corporations to help us train those new scientists and engineers .
He wants to dedicate 35 % of Title II funds directly to schools and the principles who know their school ’s needs 60 % of Title II funds to performance incentives for teachers who teach in difficult schools or who teach difficult subjects such as mathematics and science , and for performance bonuses to teachers who can boost test scores , raise student achievement , or qualify as high performance according to peer evaluations .
And he ’ll provide $ 250 million for the development of online learning .
Obama believes that science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ( STEM ) education is a vital tool for all Americans , and so he ’ll support cutting edge educational and assessment programs and the creation of several sub- departments and offices dedicated to STEM education .
He wants to attract the best educators to education in STEM fields via scholarships , residency programs , and carreer ladders .
Obama wants all students to be ready to learn when they enter school by engaging the federal government with community leaders and parents , and he wants to provide $ 4,000 in the form of a tax credit to every student who wants to go to college .
Question 5 : What is your view of how science and technology can best be used to ensure national security and where should we put our focus ?
Obama believes that the U.S. is facing a Sputnik moment as it deals with asymmetric warfare , cyber attacks , and biological and nuclear terror .
He wants to boost basic defense research in order to deal with the new threats , and he wants to connect the researchers more closely to the soldiers , airmen , seamen , and marines whose lives will rely on the new technologies .
Obama believes that the Department of Homeland Security needs better management at all levels , and he considers reduced oil consumption to be a national security issue .
Finally , Obama wants to boost domestic manufacturing so that the U.S. does n’t lose any more of its manufacturing strength .
McCain says that he has been a strong advocate for the military in the past and will continue to be one in the future as well .
He wants to ensure that the military has all the tools it needs to deter conflict or , if not successful in deterrence , to win any conflict the military is forced to fight .
McCain will also strengthen our alliances and boost homeland security .
In order to ensure the nation is protected , McCain will boost military R&D funding .
Question 6 : What steps should the United States take to protect our population from global pandemics or deliberate biological attacks ?
McCain wants to keep the government focused on preparing for a global pandemic , either from the H5N1 bird flu virus or some other virus .
He lays out the steps that the government needs to take in order to limit the spread of a pandemic , with a focus on preparedness , communication , detection , and the actual response .
In the event of bioterror attack , however , while all the preparations and steps for a pandemic stilly apply , McCain believes that the best defense is to prevent the attack in the first place , and that means boosted intelligence and counterintelligence capabilities .
McCain also feels that there are several key technologies that should be researched , namely fast means of detecting the presence of automated pathogen detectors and new medicines and vaccines .
Obama also believes that intelligence and law enforcement on the international level is vital to protecting our country from bioterror attacks , and he wants bioterror to be declared as a crime against humanity .
He will also invest in the development of new broad - based medicines , vaccines , and diagnostic technologies , and he believes that the development of these things will create new high paying jobs .
Obama also plans to give hospitals tools with which they can better coordinate their response to a pandemic or bioterror attack collectively .
Obama wants to work with state and local governments to streamline the combined federal , state , and local responses with better communcations and fewer expensive , redundant programs .
Question 7 : What is the right policy balance between the benefits of genetic advances and their potential risks ?
Obama recognizes the importance of genetic research and advances in medicine and food crops , but also recognizes that there are dangers when the risks of those advances are not well understood .
He supports the analyses and recommendations of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee and the creation of genetically engineered crops , albeit with stronger regulatory oversight and strict environmental and health testing than has occurred in the past .
And Obama believes that genetic testing for disease risk should not be used by insurance companies to discriminate .
McCain also feels that genetic medical information must be protected and kept private .
He considers the scientific and ethical concerns surrounding genetics to be complex enough that he will seek out expert advice .
McCain also believes that genetic engineering could lead to a new Green Revolution , with special focus on feeding Africa with high - yield crops .
Question 8 : What is your position on government regulation and funding of stem cell research ?
McCain supports embryonic stem cell research and hopes that adult stem cell research will render moot any need for embryonic stem cells .
He opposes “ fetal farming ” and any creation of embryos for research purposes .
Obama also supports embryonic stem cell research with strong oversight and will reverse the Bush Administration ban on federal money being used for embryonic stem cell research on post - April 9 , 2001 stem cell lines .
He believes that the hundreds of thousands stored in fertility clinics that will not be used for reproduction should be made available for research , and while he hopes that adult stem cells will continue to show promise , he believes that the promise of adult stem cells should not detract from research on embryonic stem cells , especially when overseen by the National Research Council .
Question 9 : What steps , if any , should the United States take during your presidency to protect ocean health ?
Obama wants to develop a strong , integrated , and well managed ocean stewardship program with cross-department organization .
He believes that addressing climate change via CO 2 emission reductions will help protect ocean health .
He supports the international Law of the Sea Convention and will work with other countries to protect the health of the ocean .
Obama also will work to protect marine sanctuaries and other federal acts that presently protect the ocean .
McCain considers managing the oceans , and by extension the Great Lakes , one of the more complex management tasks of the federal government because of how susceptible the oceans are to effects that originate hundreds or thousands of miles away .
He believes that , in order to manage the oceans effectively , the management offices must get buy - in to the changes from lots of different interested parties .
McCain supports more research into the carbon cycle and how it applies to the oceans , and he belives that ocean science and engineering in general need more attention .
And he belives that he ’s best qualified due to his time in the U.S. Navy .
Question 10 : What policies would you support to meet demand for water resources ?
McCain understand that water is the lifeblood of the country , and especially the West , and he believes that conflicts over water rights are best handled out of the courts .
McCain believes that all levels of government need to work together to develop , manage , and use the limited water supplies that the nation has .
He believes that the best approach to managing water is within existing agreements and compacts .
Obama believes too that all levels of government need to work together .
He feels that water pricing structures need to be updated to promote conservation and efficiency , and that aid may be necessary to get citizens and businesses to transition away from high water usage landscaping and technologies to lower water options .
And Obama feels that the research and development of technologies to aid in the reduction of water use should be a federal priority .
Question 11 : How would you prioritize space in your administration ?
Obama wants NASA to not only run the human and robotic space flight missions , but also to be in the forefront of research addressing climate change , energy independence , and aeronautics research .
He ’ll reestablish the National Aeronautics and Space Council in order to organize all of the United States ’ interests in space – military , intelligence , scientific , civilian , or commercial – and ensure that they are all working in tandem wherever possible .
McCain believes that the U.S. relies more on our space - based assets than ever before , from communications and intelligence satellites to satellite - based weather radar and scientific instruments .
He credits the space race as one of the engines of the last forty years of U.S. technological dominance .
With a number of other countries competing with the U.S. in space exploration , McCain believes that we need to continue to invest in space not only for the technological advances it will bring us , but also for the national prestige our human spaceflight program accords the U.S. McCain plans to keep the space shuttle program going until Ares / Orion are available , to maintain existing space facilities , and to divert money from other sources to help keep the U.S. space program (s ) running .
Question 12 : Is it acceptable for elected officials to hold back or alter scientific reports if they conflict with their own views , and how will you balance scientific information with politics and personal beliefs in your decision - making ?
McCain believes that good politics depends on good policy , which in turn depends on sound science .
He wants to bring the Office of Science and Technology Policy back into the White House and to hire the most qualified scientists and engineers for all technical positions within the federal government .
And McCain believes that integrity , as opposed to denial of facts , is critical to sound science .
Obama wants to return to a government that makes decisions based on the best - available , scientifically - valid evidence instead of on ideology .
He believes that open scientific debate is the best way to formulate those decisions .
Obama will also appoint people with science and technology backgrounds to those administrative positions that need an understanding of science and technology .
He will establish a new Chief Technology Officer for the United States , make the President ’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology advisory to the President , and issue an Executive Order requiring transparency in the release of all government publications .
Question 13 : Given that the next Congress will likely face spending constraints , what priority would you give to investment in basic research in upcoming budgets ?
Obama believes that basic and fundamental research into many areas of science is essential to the continued well - being of the United States , and he plans to double basic research funding over the next 10 years .
And Obama believes that the basic research will help address the “ grand challenges ” facing the United States : energy , health , food and water , national security , information technology , and manufacturing .
McCain wants to ensure that basic research is not slighted in a world of constrained spending and also wants to make sure that the highest quality research wins the money .
He will continue to support increased funding for the departments and labs that perform basic research , but he wants to be sure that all the research supports the needs of the country .
Question 14 : How do you see science , research and technology contributing to improved health and quality of life ?
McCain believes that new medical research and technologies will lower the costs of health care , and he believes that developing new treatment models will also help lower health care costs .
Obama believes that we should be proud of the medical advances that our doctors , scientists , and companies have produced , but that we need a health care system that serves everyone and does n’t cost unreasonable amounts of money like the current system does .
He believes that our health care system should n’t benefit drug companies and insurers at the cost of the patient , and that efficiency improvements , biomedical research , and some form of universal health care should be the cornerstones of the U.S. health care system .

A brief editorial comment
It ’s more than just unfortunate that John McCain and Barak Obama will not be involved in a science debate – it ’s tragic .
Science and engineering have built the foundation of American progress for decades if not centuries , and yet the public continues to view scientists , engineers , mathematicians , and other similar intellectuals and experts as fundamentally less important than ministers , jocks , celebrities , et al .
The fact that this debate did not occur only reinforces this anti-intellectual perception in the public mind .
Indeed , if the presidential candidates do n’t care enough about science and technology to debate it publicly , why should the public care ?
I am hopeful that greater understanding of science and technology , and of the people involved in those endeavors and fields , will become more mainstream in the culture over the next few years .
While there was no science debate this election cycle , both candidates still felt obligated to answer these 14 questions , and their answers illustrate that both candidates believe that science and technology development and education are vitally important to America ’s future .
After eight years of government by ideology and loyalty instead of by science and ability , both McCain and Obama would be necessary breaths of fresh air .
That said , however , I believe that the answers above make it it clear that one of these two candidates would be better than the other .
In too many cases , John McCain ’s answers will filled with buzzwords ( bingo ! ) instead of clear answers .
The financial realities of the next few years will be such that his favored spending reductions will ultimately lead not to stronger scientific research and technology development , but instead to weaker education , less basic research , and less innovation .
After all , John McCain who said that basic research should be targeted and who suggested that medical technology would enable reductions in heath care expenses .
He apparently failed to realize that basic research is , by definition , not targeted at specific developments – it ’s research done for the sake of acquiring a better understanding of reality , and the targeting into specific areas comes later when the engineers get a hold of the research .
And McCain also failed to recognize that one of the main reasons that U.S. health care costs so much is the overemphasis on medical technology by our doctors , insurance companies , hospitals , and yes , even the patients .
Finally , a request – send the link to the answers of the 14 Science Debate 2008 questions around to anyone you believe would benefit from knowing these things .
Knowing how the candidates view science and technology may be enough to push a voter toward one candidate or the other .
And having all the information necessary to make an informed decision about which candidate would make the better President is always a good thing .

Prisoner ’s Dilemma Visualisation
I recently read Richard Dawkins ’
The Selfish Gene and was fascinated with his discussion of Prisoners Dilemma ( PD ) , a classic example of game theory , in relation to evolution .
On the lookout for inspiration for my first Processing project , I decided to use this idea to create a visualisation of the game in progress .
First a brief explanation .
PD involves two players and a banker .
Each player has the choice to either cooperate or defect and are awarded points for the various outcomes of the game .
If they both cooperate they each get 3 points , if they both defect , they each get 1 point and if one cooperates and the other defects , the defector gets 5 points and the cooperator gets no points .
Iterated PD is where this game is played a number of times .
The winner is the player with the most points after the last game has been played .
For more detailed information click here .
Within my Processing sketch , there are 8 different “ animals ” .
Each uses a classic PD strategy .
They are as follows :
Green = Tit -For - Tat – Always begin by cooperating then copy the last move of the opposition .
Blue = Tit - For - Two - Tats – Like Tit -For - Tat but the opponent must defect twice before the player retaliates .
Red = Always Defect .
Yellow = Random .
Each play has a 50 % probability .
Purple = Always Cooperate .
Turquoise = Grudger –
The player cooperates every move until the opponent defects once .
The Grudger defects every move after this .
Orange = Naive Prober – Tit - For - Tat but with random defection .
Grey = Adaptive – Starts with c , c , c , c , c , c , d , d , d , d , d and then makes each choice by calculating the best average scores for defection and cooperation .
Each time two animals come into contact with each other , they have 40 games of Iterated PD .
The scores of these games are gathered and once an animal scores over 250 points , it reproduces .
Each animal is given a limited lifespan at birth which depends upon the amount of animals .
As the amount goes up , the given lifespans decrease .
This “ disease ” avoids overcrowding by limiting the population to 600 - 800 .

Results
This visualisation differs from the original experiments in that the games are not played in an organised structure but through random interactions .
However , the results are quite similar to reports from the original scenario .
The more negative strategies , “ Always defect ” , “ Random Prober ” and “ Random ” are always the first to go .
These are usually followed by “ Always cooperate ” and “ Adaptive ” .
The last three “ Tit - For - Tat ” , “ Tit - For - Two - Tats ” and “ Grudger ” ( who always cooperate with each other regardless ) tend to hold the top 3 positions in a random order .

The annual rate of UK inflation rose to 4.7 % in August from 4.4 % the month before , a higher - than - expected jump .
In a letter to the chancellor , Bank of England governor Mervyn King warned that inflation could reach a rate of 5 % before falling back .
Mr King blamed food and energy price rises for inflation rising beyond the government 's 2 % target .
Inflation as measured by the Retail Prices Index ( RPI ) - often used in pay negotiations - fell to 4.8 % from 5 % .
See what 's going up and what 's falling Food and fuel costs rise
The largest contributor to August 's rise in inflation was higher gas and electricity bills , with a number of energy firms raising their prices last month , the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) said .
Interest rate cuts seem likely to come at some stage .
Today 's message from the Bank is do n't expect anything in a hurry
Hugh Pym , BBC economics editor
The Bank 's inflation dilemma
This outweighed the fall in the price of heating oil and petrol , which fell by 5.5 pence per litre between July and August to stand at 113.3 p .
This followed sharp falls in the price of oil since July when it reached almost $ 150 a barrel .
The rising price of food and non-alcoholic drinks was also a factor behind the pick - up in inflation , mainly as a result of the increasing cost of meat , fruit and pizzas .
The fall in the RPI inflation measure was attributed to bank mortgage interest payments remaining static , compared with last year when banks passed on a Bank of England rate rise to home owners .
Global phenomenon
If inflation hits a rate more than one percentage point above or below the government 's 2 % target , the Bank of England governor must write a letter to the government to explain what action it is taking to control consumer prices .
DEAR CHANCELLOR ...
The expected peak in inflation later this year is now likely to be significantly higher than anticipated
Bank of England governor Mervyn King Mervyn King 's letter to the chancellor Chancellor Alistair Darling 's reply Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here
The governor must write to the chancellor again every three months if inflation stays out of the target band .
Mr King last wrote to the chancellor in June .
In his latest letter , Mr King blamed " sharp , largely unanticipated " increases in food and energy prices for pushing inflation well above the government 's target .
He said that these pressures were pushing up consumer prices around the world , with eurozone inflation at 4 % and US CPI inflation at 5.6 % .
Adding to this was a steep pick up in import prices , with the value of the pound falling by 15 % against other currencies since sterling 's peak in July last year .
Slowdown needed Mr King hinted that he may have to write more letters to Alistair Darling as he predicted that CPI inflation was likely to remain stubbornly above the government 's target until " well into 2009 " .
In order to prevent inflation expectations from becoming entrenched , he said that the Bank of England has " become firmer in its belief that a period of muted economic growth is necessary to dampen pressures on prices and wages " .
The chancellor agreed with Mr King 's assessment of inflationary risks and outlook , which some analysts said suggested that an interest rate cut may still be some way off .
" Given the Bank 's caution , it does suggest that they are not particularly keen to loosen monetary policy just yet and that it would take some severe financial market problems or a major downward revision to the activity outlook to get them to move rates in October or even November , " said James Knightley of ING .
However , the British Chambers of Commerce ( BCC ) called for swift action .
" As the global financial crisis worsens , there is an urgent need to act promptly , in order to counter severe threats of recession , " said David Kern , economic adviser to the BCC .

What are these ?
Tuesday , September 9 , 2008 Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist Bob Woodward revealed to Larry King last night that the U.S. has embarked on a " secret killing program " in Iraq which has dramatically reduced attacks on coalition troops by wiping out terrorists , but what could this secret weapon possibly be ?
A CNN report details Woodward�s revelations .
The program � which Woodward compares to the World War II era Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb � must remain secret for now or it would " get people killed , " Woodward said Monday on CNN�s Larry King Live .
" The top secret operations will " some day in history � be described to people�s amazement , " Woodward told King .
While he would not reveal the details , Woodward said the terrorists who have been targeted were already aware of the capabilities .
" The enemy has a heads up because they�ve been getting wiped out and a lot of them have been killed , " he said .
" It �s not news to them . "
For the weapon to be comparable to the atomic bomb , one would speculate that it must employ some kind of exotic new technology and is potentially related to neutron bomb and electromagnetic weapons research .
As far back as 2002 , a Cox News Service report entitled Super - Secret Microwave Weapons May Be Used In Iraq , speculated that the military was preparing to utilize high - powered microwave weapons that send bursts of electromagnetic energy which completely disable enemy electronic devices .
However , Woodward�s discussion of the secret weapon wiping out alleged terrorists in large numbers suggests it may be a far more barbaric device than an EMP weapon , which would more traditionally be used against standing armies rather than scattered insurgents .
One possibility is that the weapon is something similar that described to film maker Patrick Dillon by Iraqi infantryman Majid al - Ghazali - a frightening giant flame - thrower type device that instead shoots out " concentrated lightning bolts " or radiation bursts that result in vehicles and people being almost literally liquidized .
During a street battle in Baghdad on April 12 2003 , Al - Ghazali describes witnessing American troops unveil an oddly configured tank which " suddenly let loose a blinding stream of what seemed like fire and lightning , engulfing a large passenger bus and three automobiles . "
" Within seconds the bus had become semi-molten , sagging " like a wet rag " as he put it .
He said the bus rapidly melted under this withering blast , shrinking until it was a twisted blob about the dimensions of a VW bug .
As if that were not bizarre enough , al - Ghazali explicitly describes seeing numerous human bodies shriveled to the size of newborn babies .
By the time local street fighting ended that day , he estimates between 500 and 600 soldiers and civilians had been cooked alive as a result of the mysterious tank - mounted device . "
Al - Ghazali adds that following the battle , U.S. troops were scrupulous about burying the evidence of the weapon�s deadly consequences , but that telltale signs remained which he showed to journalist Dillon .
Dillon , a battlefield medic in Vietnam , Somalia and Kosovo , stated , " I�ve seen a freaking smorgasbord of destruction in my life , flame - throwers , napalm , white phosphorous , thermite , you name it .
I know of nothing short of an H - bomb that conceivably might cause a bus to instantly liquefy or that can flash broil a human body down to the size of an infant .
God pity humanity if that thing is a preview of what�s in store for the 21st century . "
An interview with Majid al - Ghazali can be viewed below along with a further exploration of exotic weapons systems being employed in Iraq .
Aid workers and others have backed up reports of terrifying new weapons systems being deployed that cause horrific injuries and agonizing deaths .
Woodward�s characterization of the victims merely as " terrorists " conceals the fact that a great number of the victims of these brutal weapons are no doubt innocent people caught up in the fighting .
Some people are better at farting than others due to various anatomic differences and dietetic habits .
If your anus has been widened , by for example a stint in prison , you might find it very hard to fart without soiling yourself .
Conversely , if you 're a tight *** , you might build too much pressure and ... you guessed it .
But you can't expect to receive a simple answer to that question because fart recognition is a skill that needs to be honed and perfected over time .
Most people master this by age 4 .
The Smythe Method is sometimes useful with persons who have recently waken from a coma .
It 's best to start out on something you do n't mind soiling ... like , oh I do n't know ... a toilet ... and bring a steno pad and pencil with you .
On this pad you 'll need to two columns .
One labeled " fart " and the other labeled " dookie " .
Attempt a fart .
If you find that more than wind passes your bowels , label that " dookie " Keep track of all attempts .
At the end of 30 days , total up the columns .
If you find you have a favorable f:d ratio is at least 98:1 ( +/ - 1 ) then you 're good to go !
If not , then I 'm afraid you 'll need to keep practicing .
Stephen Colbert soon to be sent to space
Should NASA continue being government funded ?
Yes No Not until they come up with something worth the funding
Let me preface this by saying - I 'm quite a fan of Stephen Colbert and , in fact , much to the chagrin of some , a bigger fan of his than of Jon Stewart .
However , I must admit :
If humanity faced extinction , and it were up to some brilliant Aliens to reconstruct humans by analyzing our DNA , I would n't really want a world filled with Stephen Colberts .
For one , the oversaturation of Colberts would result in an overall lack of humor , as Colbert 's success largely hinges on his ability to poke fun at others .
But besides that , there are far better specimens to repopulate the earth with .
That 's why it comes as somewhat a peculiar sign that Stephen Colbert 's DNA is being sent off into space .
( see : Stephen Colbert to have his DNA sent into space )
Without denying Colbert 's comedic brilliance , has he truly attained such stature to be immortalized forever among the other greats who have walked this planet ?
Or is this just an obvious note on NASA 's part that they 're really not taking themselves , and their missions all that seriously anymore .
Has a diehard Beatles fan , I 'd always found it odd - though interesting - that NASA had sent a few Beatles songs up into space .
The most recent time being last February '08 when Across the Universe was beamed into space .
But when you consider how vast space is , the chance that this signal would be picked up is pretty slim - let alone understood .
Perhaps the bug -eyed guys prefer radio-static .
My point really is though - well , what is their point in doing all this ?
All that comes to mind is just the desire to generate some media buzz about themselves - to keep NASA relevant in pop-culture .
Hard to do , when Richard Branson is so keen on sending anyone - including himself - up into space .
Assuming they can afford a ticket .
Why else send up Stephen Colbert 's DNA ?
Do we really want a man famous for his sarcastic wit to be humankind 's ambassador to the aliens ?
Maybe he 's good with first impressions , but there are many other notables that I can think of .
Sending up Colbert is an appeal to the college student age group , the Digg users , the YouTube generation , the XKCD readers , the people who would help generate significant buzz at the excitement that one of their favorite media men are being shipped into the beyond .
And maybe NASA 's deemed this the best way to remain relevant .
Afterall , sending off Hulk Hogan 's DNA may be more appealing to WWE fans , but when it comes to generating buzz , it 's the cult of the internet that has shown how much more effective they can be .
Consider the iPhone , which to my knowledge , was never once advertised .
Here 's my real problem with all this though .
For 2008 , NASA received $ 17.3 billion in funding from the American Government .
That number may not be particularly staggering compared to other government funded projects , but $ 17.3 billion is one hefty sum of money , all the same .
Particularly when the two major projects so far have been beaming a song - albeit , one of my favorite songs - into space , and soon sending Colbert 's DNA encoded on a Hard Drive off into infinity .
So I 'm left with one question to pose to the masses : Should NASA continue being government funded ?
Be sure to leave some comments , let me know where you stand on the issue !
Switzerland Misses Olympics Ceremony Squirrel's Nut Hunt Halts TV Broadcast
A squirrel looking for nuts in a power plant inadvertently caused an 80 - minute power outage that shut down Switzerland 's main television broadcaster just as the final ceremony of the Beijing Olympics was about to be shown .
OK , folks , it ’s time for another round of Health Lessons We Can Learn From the Amish .
Four years ago we discovered that the Amish maintained super - low obesity levels despite eating a diet high in fat , calories and refined sugar .
They key was their level of physical activity — men averaged 18,000 steps a day , women 14,000 .
That ’s monumental compared to the paltry couple of thousand or so most of us eke out in a day .
A recent study revealed even more about the Old Order Amish :
They maintain low obesity levels despite having a gene variation that makes them susceptible to obesity .
The secret here ?
You guessed it — lots of physical activity .
" A lot of the Amish are farmers and participate in manual activities , " says Evadnie Rampersaud , associate research professor at the Miami Institute for Human Genomics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine , and the study ’s lead author ( the study was done when she was at the University of Maryland ) .
" Even household chores are intense because they do n’t have the conveniences that we have . "
Those in the high ranges were active six to nine hours a day , others , three to four .
The 711 participants in the study , published in the Sept. 8 issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine , had their daily movements tracked for a week with accelerometers , devices that monitor activity .
The FTO gene , shown in other studies to have an association with obesity and high body mass index , showed up among the Amish — some had two copies of the variation , and some had none .
But even some who had the double variation avoided being overweight .
" The studies show that if you have two copies of the gene and you ’re incorporating physical activity in your daily life , you ’re less likely to become obese , " says Rampersaud .
" This tells us that we ’re not doomed by our genes . "
But she does n’t recommend people run to the nearest geneticist and get tested .
" Obesity is n’t really determined by genetics alone , but by environmental factors as well .
( This quote has been modified from the original to render it more accurate , at Rampersaud 's request .
The original quote was : " Obesity is n’t really determined by genetics , but by environmental factors . " )
We ’re not doomed to become obese because we have this gene that we may or may not know about .
By living a healthy lifestyle , getting physical activity , eating a proper diet , you can actually impact the final outcome . "
Similarly , those without the variation should n’t deem it a license to sit on the sofa and pig out .
Rampersaud also cautions against believing that this means people have to exercise six to nine hours a day to keep off the pounds .
" You are going to have an increased benefit depending on the amount of exercise you get , " she says .
" But we need large scale studies in the general population to really figure this out . "
In the meantime , anyone want to go out and plow the back 40 ?

September 23 , 2008
This past week , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ( one of an endless number of government functionaries formerly employed by Goldman Sachs , one of the two remaining investment banks in America ) announced yet another bailout of Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , this time to facilitate the increased purchase of mortgages in the near future .
How much ?
" Hundreds of billions of dollars , " is all that he would admit .
This must be added to the $ 300 billion bailout announced just two weeks ago ( ranging up to $ 1 trillion , in effect , by some estimates ) .
Paulson ’s announcement followed a rare meeting including " WhirlyBen " Bernanke , Federal Reserve chairman , and a large number of government and private financial industry functionaries and leaders .
Now , congressional hearings are in progress to rubber stamp Paulson ’s demand for $ 700 billion more to buy any sort of financial " asset , " no matter how worthless , from any sort of financial institution , both American and foreign .
Here ’s Your Share
Let ’s put the figures into perspective .
Of approximately 350 million American residents , perhaps 150 million households exist .
Of those , less than half pay anything meaningful in taxes .
Let ’s be generous and say that there are 75 million tax - paying households in America today and that the Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac bailout is limited to only $ 1 trillion .
Yours almost certainly is one of the tax - paying households .
Your share of the mortgage giant bailout , therefore , is $ 13,333 .
And that does n’t take consideration of the fact that half the tax - paying households rely upon a government paycheck , either .
Of course , you already are on the hook for twice that amount , or nearly $ 30,000 , for the current Iraq war , which was started on a lie told by Bush and Cheney about Saddam Hussein ’s " weapons of mass destruction . "
This pre-emptive Bush doctrine is the same one now so favored by McCain / Palin and which will lead us into WWIII via Iran , most likely .
Already , many have forgotten the precedent - setting bailout of Investment Bank Bear Stearns , to the tune of $ 60 billion .
That kept Bear Stearns afloat .
Think it wo n’t be back for more ?
Your share : $ 800 , so far .
AIG was just rescued by us , too .
$ 85 billion , or $ 1,133 from you .
AIG is part of the cartel that illegally has been shorting silver and costing you big , incidentally .
Do n’t forget the Bank of America bailout of Merrill Lynch this past week ( $ 50 billion ) and , previously , of Countrywide .
Those were brokered by the Federal Reserve and , you can bank on it , funded by us .
Let ’s guess and say your share is $ 1,333 .
What about Lehman Brothers , you might ask ?
After all , it was allowed to go bankrupt , thereby exposing all its dirty laundry for us to see .
That $ 600 billion mess is being carved up right now by other financial companies and will end up pledged as assets to the Fed and the Treasury for future loans , rest assured .
You can count on up to half of the Lehman corpse ending up as a dead loss .
Your share : upwards of $ 40,000 .
This does n’t include the banks already taken over by the FDIC so far this year , a mere hint of things to come .
Nor does it include the other financial giants teetering on the edge of financial oblivion .
For those keeping track , just the figures above put you in hock for nearly $ 100,000 .
Make that a quarter - million dollars if we consider that your government - employee neighbor gets paid with your tax dollars , too .
How do you plan to pay that off , Bunky ?
Especially since the prices of everything just keep going up and you just lost your job ?
But the fat cats are just fine , thank you , and thanks to you .
Fannie Mae ’s departing CEO took $ 14 million in severance and Freddie Mac ’s ex-honcho walked with $ 9 million .
Henry Paulson ’s personal fortune is nearly a half billion dollars .
The $ 700 billion about to be handed over to Treasury Secretary Paulson will carry no oversight and no regulatory authority whatsoever :
He gets a blank check .
Section 8 of the proposed legislation provides that " ( d) ecisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency . "
How about that , eh ?
The arrogance of the Bush Administration continues to new heights , surpassing even that which buoyed up the Patriot Act .
The USSA
Some form of this new legislation will pass , rest assured .
In the course of just two weeks , America ’s entire financial system – banks , S&Ls , insurance companies , brokerages , etc. – have become adjuncts to the US government .
This is nationalization , pure and simple .
Paulson is being given unlimited authority to order these organizations to do whatever he demands and force our children and their children to pay for it .
If you do n’t see this is as the most significant two weeks in American economic history , a period that transformed our country into a purely - socialistic state – the United Socialistic States of America – then you quite simply have not been paying attention .
What is going on right now goes well beyond anything that FDR dreamed when he set America on the path toward socialism .
To the right is a graph that provides just a hint of the problem as it really exists today .
Look at it again – the vertical line on the right side is not the chart ’s border !
Now , imagine it being much , much worse .
It will be as we follow the path charted by the Bush Administration .
By the time this is all over , the Federal Reserve Bank will own virtually all of America .
Remember that the owners of the Federal Reserve , a private corporation , are almost all foreign central banking families .
What We Can and Cannot Do
We can’t feed and clothe all of America ’s children , but we can afford $ 60 billion to bail out Bear Stearns .
We ca n’t provide decent medical care to America ’s seniors , but we can give $ 85 billion to AIG insurance .
We ca n’t lift one finger to help out Americans losing their homes , but we can hand over up to $ 1 trillion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
We have n’t the funds to provide proper care and support to American veterans , but we can afford up to $ 600 billion to buy pledged Lehman Brothers assets .
We ca n’t do a thing to stanch to flow of jobs offshore and alleviate the suffering of out - of - work Americans , but we can hand $ 700 billion over to a guy who , until two years ago , ran the main problem - creating company : Goldman Sachs .
We ca n’t afford to properly educate our children to fit into a changing America , but we can afford $ 1 trillion for a war that Cheney and Bush knowingly lied us into .
The Dollar is Dead
Whirly Ben Bernanke recently was quoted as admitting : " We have lost control .
We cannot stabilize the dollar . "
Read that quote again .
Consider how much Bernanke has lied to us and then imagine just how bad is the real truth .
During the past four years , the Federal Reserve Bank has created $ 4 trillion out of nothing .
Every dollar created in this way dilutes the purchasing power of every already - existing dollar .
The recent runup in the dollar index from 71 to 80 was stupidly transparent – an obvious sham and machination of these guys who have created the very problems which they now demand so much more money in order to " solve . "
The prices of precious metals were hammered down as a consequence , so much so that now there exists a divide between physical metal prices and the artificial " paper metal " prices .
And these guys – these outright failures – have the gall to come and tell us to hand over the legacy of our children and their children so they can create more failures and further feather their own nests ?
US Out of America !
Are you mad yet ?
You ought to be fit to be tied .
We should all be marching on Washington , DC with firebrands and pitchforks , in fact .
Throw them all out on November 4 .
Vote against every single incumbent for every single office at all levels , local , county , state and federal .
Vote against both Obama and Palin … er , McCain .
New America .
An idea whose time has come .

Comcast has finally provided the FCC with details of its new congestion management system , and there 's a lot to like .
Deep packet inspection it out .
P2P protocol targeting is out .
Management systems that affect entire regions are out .
Instead , Comcast will deploy a highly - targeted , protocol - agnostic management system that has nothing to do with the applications a customer uses and everything to do with the total bandwidth being used in the last few minutes .
It 's a huge step forward from the previous system that relied on falsified TCP reset packets to interrupt P2P uploads .
The company plans on rolling it out later this year despite its lawsuit against the FCC over the ruling that forced this new approach .
When the FCC issued its Order against the company 's P2P throttling scheme last month , Comcast was given 30 days to describe its current congestion management and the changes that the company would make to comply with the FCC ruling .
Those 30 days are up today , and Comcast has just filed its document with the agency .
Ars also spoke to the company to flesh out our understanding of the new system .
Here 's how it works .
A better congestion management system
Comcast 's new technique is based on a simple premise : during periods of congestion , heavy users of bandwidth on a local node ought to see speed reductions before light users .
To make that happen , the system tracks each customer 's uploads and downloads separately using software from Sandvine that runs on Linux servers ( Comcast stresses to us that this is not deep packet inspection software , but basic " shallow inspection " code that simply counts packets . )
" Our management system is designed so that the effect on all customers is as minimal as possible , even those whose traffic is being managed , " Comcast spokesperson Sena Fitzmaurice told Ars .
" We want to make sure that all of our users are getting a fair share of resources during times of congestion . "
When any port ( think neighborhood node ) on the Cable Modem Termination System ( CMTS ) in the local cable company office enters a " near congestion " state , the system looks up the heaviest users of bandwidth during the preceding few minutes .
Those users then have their traffic tagged as " Best Effort " rather than the default " Priority Best Effort . "
At this point , nothing happens to anyone 's traffic .
When congestion actually occurs , the Priority Best Effort users should see no slowdown in their connections ; all traffic will go through ahead of the Best Effort traffic .
Best Effort folks may not notice any slowdown , either .
They are not speed - limited , but they do go to the back of the quality of service ( QoS ) line .
At this point , if traffic does in fact fill the pipe , users in the Best Effort category will experience delays in their connections , though their traffic will still be sent on whenever possible .
A CMTS has separate upload and download ports , and the new management system is port - specific .
If congestion only appears on the upload link , no one 's download links will be affected .
In addition , when the system begins to tag users as Best Effort , it only considers their traffic on the specific port being managed ; heavy downloaders wo n't be tagged if it is only the upload link that starts to have problems .
Fitzmaurice told
Ars that the traffic reprioritzation would typically affect only a handful of customers when it goes into effect .
" On a typical day , less than one percent of people had their traffic put in the Best Efforts category , " she said .
" It 's measured in 15 - minute increments and is only in effect for as long as your traffic level was over a specific threshold . "
The new system also applies management only to the nodes actually experiencing congestion , which means that neighborhoods , rather than entire cities , would be affected .
If your friend across town is in a neighborhood filled with crazed P2P uploaders , her network segment may experience management even while yours remains completely unaffected .
The moment that congestion vanishes , all traffic flows without delay even though some users are still tagged with " Best Effort " ( the system monitors congestion and responds nearly in realtime ) .
The tag will only be applied for a few minutes at a time and has nothing do with the company 's new 250 GB monthly data limit , which remains in effect .
Comcast has trialled the new approach in five cities : Chambersburg , PA , ? Colorado Springs , CO , East Orange , FL , Lake City , FL , and Warrenton , VA .
In the course of its testing , Comcast has paid special attention to the way that the system will affect realtime protocols like VoIP and gaming .
Somewhat incredibly , it claims to have received zero complaints about the new approach from any household in the five markets .
" We have had no consumer complaints that can be traced to the new practices in the pilot areas , " Fitzmaurice told Ars .
" It 's compatible with Internet standards and supportive of Internet innovation . "
What the FCC will think of the new system remains to be seen .
A contrite Labor MP has apologised unreservedly for using the House of Representatives as a platform to complain about the size of a portion of beef stroganoff served to his wife in the parliamentary cafeteria .
- Labor MP ' sorry '
- Stroganoff ' t oo small '
- Raised in Parliament
John Murphy , member for the NSW seat of Lowe and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade , called for an investigation this week into serving sizes following his wife 's dissatisfaction with a beef and rice dish she had ordered for lunch .
His wife had earlier complained to cafeteria staff about at the small amount of hot food available after 7 pm .
" My wife was told by cafeteria staff that management had told staff they had been serving big food portions and the manager had instructed them to make the portions smaller , " Mr Murphy told Parliament .
HIDDEN in rugged ranges in north - west Arnhem Land , a spectacular treasure - trove of Aboriginal rock art is set to rewrite the history of Australia .
In a find that has stunned archaeologists and anthropologists , a vast wall of about 1500 paintings chronicles the history of Aboriginal contact with outsiders , from Macassan proas and European sailing ships to 19th - century steamships and a World War II battleship .
Alongside exquisite rock art more than 15,000 years old are paintings that capture some of the 19th and 20th centuries ' most important technological innovations - a biplane , bicycle , car and rifle - as well as portraits of church ministers , sea captains and traders .
Christopher Conkey / WSJ | July 30 , 2008
WASHINGTON — The Bush administration unveiled a plan to impose new tolls on freeways and encourage more private investment to finance road and mass - transit projects , a move aimed at stirring debate as lawmakers prepare for a major overhaul of transportation policy .
The White House says more tolls and public - private partnerships can solve perhaps the biggest problem confronting the nation ’s aging infrastructure :
There are limited funds available to upgrade transportation networks and too many federal funds are doled out inefficiently through earmarks and pet projects that do little to improve mobility or reduce congestion .
The search for alternative funding sources is ramping up because Americans are driving less and shifting to more fuel - efficient vehicles .
That means they will be paying less in gasoline and diesel - fuel taxes , which traditionally have been the biggest source of federal funding for highway and mass - transit construction .
Many states are moving to increase existing tolls .
Pennsylvania , for example , is hoping to win federal permission for new tolls on a standing interstate .
Meanwhile , several states are turning to business consortiums to finance , build and operate new highways , bridges and tunnels , although a political backlash has slowed the push in recent years .
The administration ’s proposal comes as Congress gears up to start work later this year on a six - year transportation spending bill that could cost well more than $ 400 billion .
The last multiyear bill , which expires in September 2009 , carried a $ 286 billion tab .
Earlier this year , a bipartisan commission concluded the nation is spending only about 40 % of what is needed to reduce congestion , improve safety and spur economic growth .
Transportation Secretary Mary Peters served on the commission but dissented from the majority view that gas taxes should more than double in coming years to support a big increase in transportation spending .
Ms. Peters says gas - tax rates should hold steady — at 18.4 cents a gallon for regular gasoline and 24.4 cents a gallon for diesel , where they have stood for more than a decade — and private money and toll revenue can address any needed increases in funding .
She declined Tuesday to say how much more the U.S. needs to increase its overall spending on transportation infrastructure .
Instead , she suggested ways to make transportation spending less wasteful .

Russian Scientists Create Small Electromagnetic Pulse Machine
Russian scientists have developed a generator that is being called a genuine scientific breakthrough , and it is already clear that the defense industry will not be the only field where the new super device is going to be used .
" The device is generating such power – billions of watts – but takes up a very small area that it could be mounted on a vehicle .
This appliance has a very short impulse , which makes it possible to be a very compact device , ” the Director of Lebedev ’s Institute of Physics , Vice President of the Russian Academy of Sciences , Gennady Mesyats said .
Mikhail Yalandin , one of the creators of the miraculous machine , said that the scientists had assembled two of such devices in Yekaterinburg – a bigger and a smaller one .
Never before had a relatively small device ever been able to generate electromagnetic impulses the capacity of which could be comparable to a huge water power plant .
It is ten times as much as anything that has been manufactured to date .
The new device can be used practically anywhere .
The invention will let specialists create radar telescopes and radars of new generation .
The new generators can also be used to check the stability of large energy objects and systems .
The device is capable of imitating the strays which appear as a result of a lightning strike or even a nuclear blast .
It is impossible to take photographs or film a video of the new generator in action because it immediately puts all electronic devices out of order .
The research that was used for the creation of such a device can also be applied in the development of electromagnetic weapons .

Hitachi sure does love some perpendicular recording , and in between making trippy videos about the tech , it seems like it 's busy improving it -- the company just announced that it 's increased the max storage density of magnetic recording to 610 Gb per square inch .
That 's far denser than current techniques , and it could lead to a 2.5 x increase in capacity for hard drives -- and what 's more , Hitachi says it shows that hard drive capacities have the ability to increase at a rate of 40 percent annually for the foreseeable future .
Looks like the Tera Era might actually be here , eh ?
After refusing to answer questions for more than a week about Gov. Sarah Palin 's administration 's construction of a $ 26 million dead - end road , a McCain campaign spokeswoman told CNN earlier this week that Gov. Palin had no choice .
But Alaska and federal officials say otherwise , and the record shows that she canceled a comparable project .
As we reported in detail last week , Palin 's administration oversaw the construction of the Gravina Island Highway , a 3.2 - mile access road to the " Bridge to Nowhere . "
Since it was obvious in 2007 that the $ 398 million bridge from Gravina Island to Ketchikan would never be built , government watchdogs urged the Palin administration to put the brakes on the project .
Construction began in June of 2007 , more than six months after Palin took office , and completed last week .
The McCain campaign did not directly address our questions about the road , but on Tuesday , a CNN report ( which includes some striking aerial shots of the empty cul - de - sac at the road 's end , seen above ) included a detailed response from the campaign .
Spokeswoman Meg Stapleton explained that the governor " had no option " but to build the road , because an earmark had " dictated " that the money had to be spent on it .
When CNN pressed as to whether Palin could have stopped construction , Stapleton responded with a statement that " under ordinary circumstances , Gov. Palin would not have allowed the Gravina Road project to move forward , but given the federal earmark and because the contract for the road was already signed before she got into office , the governor was left no viable alternative . "
But the governor did have a viable alternative .
Gov. Frank Murkowski ( R ) signed the contract for the road on Dec. 1 , 2006 , three days before he left office .
Palin could have cancelled that contract upon taking office , according to Alaska Department of Transportation spokesman Roger Wetherell .
In such cases , contractors are reimbursed for any expenses incurred in association with the project .
For instance , in her first month in office , Palin cancelled a $ 18.6 million contract to build a one - lane , 11 - mile gravel road out of Juneau .
That contract had also been awarded by Murkowski at the end of his term , but Palin , judging the project wasteful and the contract award insufficiently transparent , terminated it .
The state reimbursed the contractor for $ 65,500 in expenses , Wetherell said .
Gov. Palin also had a " viable alternative " when it came to the earmark .
It 's true that the Gravina Island Highway presented a more difficult case than the Juneau road , which was funded entirely with state money .
But it 's not true that the earmark forced Palin to spend the money on the road .
Palin could have opted not to use the money , and Congress has the power to send it to other federal needs , said Federal Highway Administration spokesman Doug Hecox .
There is , in fact , a prominent example of such a thing happening recently with another earmark from that same legislation , the mammoth , pork - filled 2005 transportation bill .
Rep. Don Young ( R - AK ) earmarked $ 10 million for the Coconut Road interchange project in Florida , but the earmark became a controversy after news reports pointed out that a local developer , who stood to gain from the project , had thrown Young a fundraiser shortly before he inserted the earmark .
Soon after , the local planning organization in Naples , Florida voted to return the $ 10 million and ask that it be used for a broader highway project .
Congress subsequently amended the earmark in a technical corrections bill earlier this year .
Young , of course , was also responsible for the $ 223 million in earmarks for the " Bridge to Nowhere " in the 2005 bill , along with Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) .
The McCain campaign did not reply to our request for comment .
I was not a big admirer of Rudy Giuliani on the campaign trail , since ( as Joe Biden pointed out ) his foreign policy boiled down to variations on : " 9/11 -- any questions ? "
But he is by far the most joyously effective speaker so far in making the anti-Obama / Biden case .
His little riff on " Maybe Gov Palin 's home town is not .... cosmopolitan enough for Senator Obama " had its nasty undertone but as delivered was pretty funny .
If the Republicans know what they 're doing , they 'll have him as point man of the attack machine for the next two months .
OTOH : By the logic of his " zero " passage -- Obama has never led or run anything , zero , a passage that was wildly popular in the arena -- what , exactly , has McCain ever run ?
Unless he was head of a unit of naval aviators , it would seem that his managerial experience is identical to Obama's :
They biggest thing each has run is a nationwide campaign this year .
Still , an effective job by Rudy .
UPDATE : Did I hear this right ?
Early in the speech , Giuliani quoted the old saw about jury trials , which usually goes : " If the facts are against you , cite the law ; if the law is against you , cite the facts . "
But as I heard it , Rudy said : " If the facts are against you , change them . "
Could he really have said that ?
Freudian slip ??

Obama to pressure McCain on openness
Sen. Joe Biden ( D - Del. ) plans to release 10 years of his tax returns on Friday morning , pressuring his Republican counterpart , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , to do the same , Politico has learned .
The move is part of a fresh aggressiveness from Barack Obama 's campaign , which wants to discredit the new posture by John McCain as the candidate of real change .

Disclosure , or transparency , is a big way for a candidate to make that case during a campaign .
News reports from Alaska have said that Palin collected per diem travel payments even when she was at home , and the Obama - Biden campaign wants reporters to see if she paid taxes on it .
McCain has disclosed little about his family finances .
He files separately from his wife , Cindy , and he has put out only his 2006 and 2007 returns .
The campaign released her two - page tax return for 2006 , but not complete returns .
The Obama campaign calls this “ a disappointingly low bar for disclosure . ”
Obama has released tax forms for each year beginning in 2000 .
The FBI disclosed today that it had " improperly obtained " phone records of reporters at the Indonesia bureaus for the New York Times and Washington Post in 2004 .
Robert S. Mueller III , director of the F.B.I. , disclosed the episode in a phone call to Bill Keller , the executive editor of The Times , and apologized for it .
He also spoke with Leonard Downie Jr. , the executive editor of The Washington Post , to apologize .
F.B.I. officials said the incident came to light as part of the continuing review by the Justice Department inspector general 's office into the bureau 's improper collection of telephone records through " emergency " records demands issued to phone providers .
The records were apparently sought as part of a terrorism investigation , but the F.B.I. did not explain what was being investigated or why the reporters ' phone records were considered relevant .
WASHINGTON - Senate majority leader Harry Reid has found a refuge in the nation 's preoccupation with record energy prices .
While the push by President Bush and congressional Republicans for more oil drilling is resonating with voters , the Nevada Democrat is focused on solar and other renewable energy sources , which happen to be more abundant in his home state than almost anywhere else in the country .
At some political risk for the gold miner 's son , Reid also is leading the opposition to new coal - burning power plants planned for Nevada , where unions and the energy - hungry casino industry wield far more political clout than environmentalists .
He faces reelection in 2010 in a state up for grabs by both parties .
Reid briefly had the most - watched video on YouTube several weeks ago after the Drudge Report linked to a television clip of him declaring that " coal makes us sick . . . it 's ruining our world . "
A conservative advocacy group , the American Future Fund , is using the comments in radio ads in Nevada and Washington , D.C. , this week that claim " Reid says ' yes ' to higher energy taxes . "
But Reid sees potential for jobs and economic benefits if he can advance his goal of transforming Nevada into " the Saudi Arabia of geothermal and solar energy . "
" Nevada does n't have a whole lot of oil or coal or gas .
But it has a whole lot of sun and thermal , " said Karl Gawell , executive director of the Geothermal Energy Association .
" Senator Reid is an old - fashioned politician - he watches his constituency .
He understands , with geothermal , how big the potential is for the state . "
Nevadans now get about 9 percent of their energy from renewable sources , a number that under state law must rise to 20 percent by 2015 .
Many energy specialists say the potential is far greater .
Despite its relatively small size , Nevada leads the nation in solar and geothermal resources , according to trade groups and government statistics , and also has potential for wind energy development .
Its fossil fuel stockpiles , by contrast , are negligible .
More renewable energy projects are coming online rapidly .
As of early this year Nevada had 40 geothermal projects in development to squeeze energy from hot water and steam drilled from the earth , more than any other state .
Reid contends that growth of the renewable energy industry could provide a bonanza of new jobs for Nevada and reduce dependence on fossil fuel , much of it imported from out of state .
" It 's too bad that it takes an energy crisis like we 're having to cause a focus on renewables .
It 's a situation where we have these gas prices that are sky high , and it is an opportunity , " Reid said in an interview .
" Renewables are good for the economy , create lots of jobs , and are very good for the environment .
That 's a pretty good combination of things . "
Reid might have preferred a little less recent focus on renewables , an industry that depends in part on $ 6 billion in tax credits that have stalled in Congress because of a dispute between Democrats and Republicans led by Nevada 's other senator , John Ensign .
Reid pulled a major housing bill from the Senate floor last month after Ensign attached the renewable energy tax package to it , leading Ensign to complain , without naming Reid , that Democratic leaders were n't committed to renewable energy .
Reid said there was no point in passing the bill because it would fail in the House , where Democrats insist that it be paid for with tax increases that Ensign and other Senate conservatives reject .
Both senators insist they support the tax credits , but the fate of the package is now uncertain .
Though the government projects that coal use will grow to meet rising energy demands in Nevada and around the country , Reid is adamantly opposed to plans by the state 's leading utility , Sierra Pacific Resources , to build a new coal plant in eastern Nevada .
Two outside companies are also pushing coal plants in the state .
Coal , Reid says , is " filthy , it 's dirty stuff . "
The only way for the renewable energy industry to grow in Nevada is for coal plants to stay out , he contends .
It is a point coal advocates dispute .
" You 're not going to be able to provide enough power in the short term with renewables , " said Frank Maisano , spokesman for Toquop Energy Project , one of the coal plants trying to come into Nevada over Reid 's opposition .
" Las Vegas , Arizona , places like that - they need more power now . "
One low - pollution energy source Reid almost never mentions is nuclear , a sore subject in Nevada , the government 's designated dumping ground for radioactive waste .

Poor agricultural habits can lead to dust and desertification .
Joel Sartore / National Geographic / Getty Images
What happens when climate variations and human actions such as land clearing , urbanization and unsustainable agricultural habits mix ?
The combination results in an ecological crisis : land degradation .
When land degrades , it can no longer properly absorb , store and recycle water , nutrients and energy .
Land degradation in arid , semi-arid and dry , subhumid areas ( drylands ) is called desertification .
Seventy percent of drylands worldwide are degraded , and one - third of the world 's land surfaces are threatened -- lands become more prone to flooding , wind damage and erosion , the quality of soil becomes poor , and productivity plummets [ sources : UNCCD , UNESCO ] .
Areas affected by desertification are faced with not only environmental consequences but also economic effects .
The World Bank estimates areas affected by desertification lose income greater than $ 40 billion annually [ source : UNESCO ] .

In dryland a­reas , soil is fragile , vegetation is thin and the climate is merciless .
Drylands cover more than 40 percent of our planet , and their susceptibility to desertification puts more than 1 billion people at risk for poverty and starvation [ source : USDA ] .
­ While you may think this problem affects only areas we consider hot and arid , such as Southern Africa , desertification affects every continent except Antarctica .
And the United States is n't immune to this crisis .
Data from the last 30 years indicates the American Southwest is getting warmer and drier .
Could the continental U.S. become a desert within the next 50 years ?
Let 's look at how the stresses on our ecosystem -- brought on both by humans and nature -- are dramatically changing our landscape .

Since he burst on the scene in 2002 with three impressive wins in the UFC , " Ruthless " Robbie Lawler ' scareer has been a rollercoaster ride of chaotic proportions .
Despite being just 26 , he ’s experienced the kinds of dizzying ups and downs that often define a fighter ’s entire career .
Six years ago , he seemed the future face of Team Miletich .
After debuting in the organization with a decision over granite - chinned Aaron Riley , Lawler scored knockouts over Steve Berger and Tiki Ghosn .
With stablemate Matt Hughes running roughshod over the division , Lawler seemed the heir apparent to Miletich ’s welterweight reign .
Then everything came apart .
Lawler lost three of his next four matches , suffering setbacks against Pete Spratt ( injury TKO ) , Nick Diaz ( KO ) and Evan Tanner ( submission ) sandwiched around a split decision over Chris Lytle .
Suddenly , the go - for - broke , free - swinging slugger seemed exposed as an explosive but limited fighter , with rumors of lax training habits not helping his reputation .
In MMA , it ’s easy to pile on a guy especially when expectations ran so high .
And , as Lawler ’s re-emergence in the middleweight division has shown , sometimes talent needs equal parts experience and maturity to achieve results .
Since leaving the UFC in 2004 , Lawler ( 16 - 4 , 1 NC ) has established himself as one of the game ’s best middleweights , winning the Elite XC belt with a textbook performance over Murilo Rua last September .
He showed a tempered approach and a disciplined game plan against Rua , picking him apart en route to the third - round knockout .
And , off the heels of a gutty fourth - round stoppage of Frank Trigg in March 2007 , it ’s clear that Lawler has learned to pace himself , unlike earlier in his career .
On Saturday he ’ll defend his belt against Scott Smith in a rematch of their three - round brawl May 31 that ended in a no-contest .
Lawler has the chance to take another step up the middleweight ladder in a bout that promises red meat galore to the fans .
If he ’s to retain his title in an extended back - and - forth stand - up battle waged entirely on the feet -- and extensively in nose - to - nose clinch slugging -- the new and improved Lawler may have to garner up a little more of the “ Ruthless ” style that earned hisearlier in his career .
Here ’s a closer look : Athletic and explosive , Lawler brings a southpaw stance with solid stand - up , backed by a good takedown game and merciless finishing instinct .
With ample head movement and the eyes of a predator , he stalks foes , changes angles and explodes with punches , kicks , knees -- everything but the proverbial kitchen sink .
Likes a stand - up battle but will unload with both hands if he can put opponents on the ground .
Years of training with Team Miletich early in his career have given him plenty of gym time with some of the world 's best .
As a result , he fights with the kind of cocksure attitude and confidence you 'd expect .
While Lawler is competent at avoiding submissions , he 's only scored one in his 22 - fight career , mostly because he prefers to blast opponents out rather than sink an available sub , such as a rear - naked choke .
Earlier in his career , tended to overextend himself in exchanges and get caught at times , or try to do too much at once .
Recent fights have shown a more measured approach , as his tactical brain seems to have caught up to his abilities .
However , facing Smith , a naturally bigger fighter , the battle down the stretch could be tough if Lawler can't stop the Sacramento - based slugger and finds himself taken down or in the kind of match where cardio determines the winner .
( No contest in the third round , May 31 , 2008 ) ( KO 3 , Sept. 15 , 2007 ) ( KO 4 , March 31 , 2007 ) ( KO 1 , Oct. 21 , 2006 ) While the debut of MMA on network television received mixed reviews with Kimbo Slice ’s stoppage of James Thompson , Lawler 's brawl with Scott Smith was an instant classic , if not for the fact that the bout was stopped short after Smith sustained an eye poke in the third round .
After starting fast and seemingly having the challenger in a bit of trouble , Lawler tasted Smith 's power and the two waged a hard - nosed battle for 13 minutes before the unfortunate end .
Smartly , CBS is using the rematch as the headliner on Saturday night 's card .
With the tactically sound performance against Smith , as well as the smarts he showed in dismantling Rua and Trigg -- along with no small degree of gumption in the latter -- Lawler 's style has matured considerably since his free - swinging UFC days .
And as his 22 - second flying - knee stoppage of the capable Joey Villasenor showed , Lawler 's early - fight explosiveness is still there .
It 's just that he is n't as gung - ho as he used to be .
Now he smartly picks his shots and uses his excellent speed .
Capable of effective strikes from virtually any position , Lawler 's game plan against Rua was a career - defining masterpiece .
He used angles , high - percentage attacks and constant pressure to take the belt from the Brazilian .
Against Smith , he 'll have to walk the fine line between imposing that kind of strategy versus the temptation to explode and , perhaps , get a little reckless , which has provided some of the defining moments of his career , both good and bad .
When Lawler is bombing away on an opponent in his trademark devil - may - care style , there 's nobody more exciting in MMA .
Lawler 's wrestling has always been a tad overshadowed by his big - time striking , but he is a competent takedown artist with solid ground - and - pound .
Since moving up to 185 pounds a few years ago , he seems to have made the transition well to compete against top middleweights .
In the fight against Smith , however , he only shot for one takedown , and it was capably stuffed by Smith , who debuted at heavyweight and is a pretty strong middleweight himself .
Whether Lawler decides to try and take the fight to the ground could be a not - so - subtle hint of his confidence in the stand - up game .
( Submission 3 , Sept. 2 , 2006 ) ( Submission 1 , Oct. 4 , 2004 ) ( KO 2 , April 2 , 2004 )
All three defeats have a common theme -- Lawler starts big , then comes apart after the other guy capitalizes on a mistake .
Against Tanner , he scored a monster body - slam takedown , only to fall victim to an expert triangle from the submissions whiz .
While slugging it out with the then - unknown Nick Diaz at UFC 47 , Lawler scored some big shots early , then walked into a right hand and suffered a flash - knockout defeat .
And , battling Miller in a rousing scrap in Icon Sport , Lawler had a big second round , pounding the durable " Mayhem " with some potent ground - and - pound , but Miller survived en route to securing a choke victory in the fourth .
Comparing these results to the modern - day Lawler is still a bit of a stretch , considering that he 's only lost once in his last nine fights and has obviously improved as a fighter .
But watch the tape of the Smith bout again , and it seems that Lawler became overly cautious once it became apparent Smith was n't going to crumble in the early exchanges .
Lawler smartly downshifted to a patient attack , using pesky jabs mixed in with occasional haymakers and clinch work , but in a five - round fight , anything can happen .
Given that Smith tends to be a slow starter and Lawler a fast one , " Ruthless " needs to jump out ahead early and establish his stand - up without expending too much energy and robbing himself of a closing should it go five rounds .

Superpower Similarities
Official propaganda has always tried to portray superpower conflict as an obvious and inevitable consequence of the irreconcilable differences between the two sides .
One 's own side was represented as the manifestation of all that is good and just in the world and the other as all that is evil and repressive .
There was usually a catchy label to go with the description that tested well with the target audience , such as the " Imperialist Aggressor " or the " Evil Empire . "
When you switched sides , the orientation of the propaganda you had just heard flipped automatically : it was like stepping through a mirror .
But what is interesting for our purposes is to identify and describe the key elements that made these superpower contestants so evenly matched that their sparring went on for decades .
None of these key elements can be sustained forever .
The hypothesis I wish to test is that the lack of these same key elements , readily identifiable in the Soviet collapse , likewise spells the demise of America , definitely as a superpower , probably as a major part of the world economy , and possibly as a recognizable entity on the political map .
The Myth of Inclusiveness
Like that of our metaphorical heavyweight champion , a super - power 's diet must contain plenty of red meat , in this case , human flesh .
A superpower must continually ingest plenty of highly skilled and motivated personnel managers , scientists , engineers , and military officers , who must be willing to endure hardship , give up their best years , ruin their health , perhaps even give their lives , slaving away designing and building things , fighting and doing all the dirty work .
Motivating the needed quantities of people with money is out of the question , because that would not leave enough for the ruling elites to siphon off .
The upper classes tend to already be highly motivated by both money and status , but they also tend to be allergic to dirty work , and they can never be numerous enough to satisfy a superpower 's appetite for flesh .
The only thing that can possibly provide the necessary motivating force is an idea : a communal myth powerful enough to cause people to commit their insignificant yet essential selves to the righteousness and glory of the great whole .
A superpower 's vitality is critically dependent on the sustaining power of this myth .
Shortly after it fails , so does the superpower .
Both the Soviet and the American models featured an inclusiveness myth as their centerpiece .
In the Soviet case , it was the myth of the classless society .
The great revolutionary upheaval was said to have erased class and ethnic distinctions , creating an egalitarian society that provided for everybody 's basic needs , curbed excesses of wealth and allowed people from humble origins to become educated and rise to positions of respect and authority .
This myth proved to be so powerful that it propelled a poor , industrializing but still mainly agrarian nation on a trajectory to becoming a leading military and industrial power .
As the decades wore on , the myth gradually lost most of its luster .
The satisfaction of basic needs gave rise to an insatiable appetite for imported consumer goods , which were either inaccessible or in short supply , except to the elite , and this , in turn , ruined the appearance of egalitarianism .
" They pretend to pay us , and we pretend to work , " went the saying , and morale plummeted .
This led to a situation where no new common effort could be organized .
As everyone started thinking for themselves , a slow rot set in , and the superpower gradually became enfeebled .
America 's belated and half - hearted answer to the classless society of the Soviets is the middle class society .
After wallowing through the Great Depression and grasping at straws during the New Deal , the United States reaped a gigantic windfall following World War II , as the only large industrial player left standing .
Much of the rest of the world 's industrial infrastructure had been bombed to rubble , giving the United States an opening .
They used it to put every American within striking distance of achieving a cheap simulacrum of landed gentry , symbolized by a detached house surrounded by a patch of land big enough to accommodate private parking , a patch of grass and some shrubbery , and adorned , as an absolute necessity , by one 's own private automobile .
American society is classless , at least in theory , since no one wants to admit to being either upper or lower class .
There is , supposedly , one large and homogeneous middle class ; in fact , though , there is a small upper portion and a large and rapidly expanding lower portion .
The wonderful thing about the American middle class concept is its malleability , because it is almost entirely symbolic .
You could be middle class , own an ancestral mansion in an old brick and fieldstone suburb , drive a Mercedes and send your children to an Ivy League school .
Or you could be middle class , live in a dolled - up trailer home , drive a souped - up pickup truck , and send your children to a community college that teaches them how to milk hogs .
The least common denominator is that you have to drive a motor vehicle , otherwise you can no longer perform this charade .
This is why there is so much denial about it being necessary to give up the car and all the current talk about resorting to bio-fuels to continue feeding the car addiction .
Biofuels amount to burning one 's food and destroying what is left of the topsoil in order to continue driving .
This is also why so many Americans would forgo a healthy diet , a reasonable work schedule , education for their children , needed medical treatment and even give up their house , rather than give up their car .
Not having a car makes one , within the American suburban landscape , a non-person .
The universal right to drive a car is the linchpin of the American communal myth .
Once a significant portion of the population finds that cars have become inaccessible to them , the effect on the national psyche may be so profound as to make the country ungovernable .
Solving the underlying transportation problem , through the reintroduction of public transportation or other means , is beside the point : the image of the automobile is indelibly imprinted on the national psyche and it will not be easily dislodged .
For many , their car is a public extension of their persona , a status symbol and even a symbol of sexual potency , and this makes the automobile , along with the gun , a sacred national fetish .
Like the gun , the car is also a potent weapon that can be used for murder or for suicide .
It is propelling the American communal myth toward a flaming crash with the reality of permanent fuel shortage , compared to which the gradual fading away of the Soviet communal myth will have been gentle and benign .
Militarism
The arms race is commonly viewed as the key element of the superpower standoff known as the Cold War ( one hesitates to call it a conflict or even a confrontation because both sides diligently practiced conflict avoidance through deterrence , détente and arms control negotiations ) .
Military deterrence and parity is seen as the paramount defining factor of the bipolar world that was dominated by the two superpowers .
Military primacy between the United States and the Soviet Union was never actively contested and there was quite a lot of inconclusive militaristic preening and posturing .
While the Americans feel that they won the Cold War ( since the other side forfeited the contest ) and are about to start awarding themselves medals for this feat , it is actually something of a success story for Russia .
Beyond the superficial and assumed offensive parity , the historical landscapes that underlie Soviet and American militarisms could not be more different .
The United States considers itself a victor country : it goes to war when it wishes and it likes to win .
It has not been invaded during any of the major modern conflicts and war , to it , is primarily about victory .
Russia is a victim country .
It has been invaded several times , but , since the Mongol invasion , never successfully .
To Russians , war is not about victory , it is about death .
The epithet that Russians like to apply to their country is nepobedimaya , " undefeatable . "
The United States is a country that enjoys bombing other countries .
The Soviets , having seen much of their country bombed to smithereens during World War II , had a particularly well - developed sense of their vulnerability .
To compensate for it , they devoted a large part of their centrally planned economy to defense .
They produced a staggering number of nuclear missiles , nuclear submarines , tanks , bombers , fighter jets , warships and other military junk , much of which now sits quietly rusting somewhere and perpetually threatening to wreak havoc on the environment .
The nuclear stockpile continues to pose a particularly nasty problem .
Much of this war production was a complete waste and even the object of some humor : " I work at a sewing machine factory , but every time I bring the parts home and assemble them , I end up with a machine gun ! "
But they did not get bombed by the Americans , hence victory .
The list of countries which the US has bombed since the end of World War II is a long one , from " A " for Afghanistan to " Y " for Yemen ( that the list does not run " A " to " Z " is presumably explained by the fact that Zambia and Zimbabwe do not present a sufficiently target - rich environment to America 's military planners ) .
The Soviet Union did not do nearly as much bombing .
Czechoslovakia and Hungary received what amounted to a slap .
Afghanistan was the one significant exception , playing host to a sustained and bloody military confrontation .
Perhaps one positive effect of having one 's homeland extensively bombed is that it makes one think twice about inflicting that experience on others .
And so it is quite a satisfactory outcome that the United States has not been able to bomb a single country within the former Warsaw Pact and to this day has to play careful with Russia and her friends .
This is because mutual assured destruction remains in effect : each side has enough nuclear weapons to obliterate the other .
Since this is an affront to the American military ego , Americans have continued to preen and posture , announcing a defense doctrine that allows nuclear first strikes and actively pursuing the development of strategic missile defense .
The Russians do not appear to be impressed .
" We believe this strategic anti-missile defense system is somewhat chimerical , to put it mildly , " said Sergei Ivanov , Russia 's first deputy prime minister .
" One can find a much cheaper response to any such system . "
The cheapest response I can think of is simply having Mr. Ivanov periodically stand up and say a few words .
Perhaps that is all the response the situation calls for , but Russia sells a lot of weapons , including a new generation of supersonic missiles and torpedoes , against which the US has no adequate defense , and successfully marketing them requires taking a stand in defense of national military prestige .
And so we are bound to hear a great deal more about Americans destabilizing the security of Europe , and about Russia countering this threat with some anti-missile chimeras of their own , much cheaper ones .
The United States needs a new Cold War to show itself and the world that it still matters , and Russia , finding the venture not too risky and quite profitable , is willing to hold up a mirror to American militarism .
But the whole thing is a farce , and Vladimir Putin was quick to offer an old Russian saying by way of explaining it : " Do n't blame the mirror if your face is crooked . "
Russia has scaled back defense spending considerably after the Soviet collapse , but the defense budget of the United States has kept growing like a tumor and is on course to match and surpass what the entire rest of the world spends on defense .
While one might naively assume that the rest of the world is quivering before such overwhelming military might , nothing of the sort is occurring .
There is a little secret that everyone knows : the United States military does not know how to win .
It just knows how to blow things up .
Blowing things up may be fun , but it cannot be the only element in a winning strategy .
The other key element is winning the peace once major combat operations are over , and here the mighty US military tends to fall squarely on its face and lay prone until political support for the war is withdrawn and the troops are brought back home .
The United States could not conquer North Korea , resulting in the world 's longest - running cease - fire .
It is a stalemate punctuated by crises .
The United States could not defeat the North Vietnamese with their underground tunnels and their primarily bicycle - based transportation system .
The first Gulf War was precipitated by a misunderstanding caused by diplomatic incompetence : Saddam Hussein was a generally cooperative and helpful tyrant and all could have been resolved amicably had not April Glaspie , the US ambassador to Iraq , told him : " We have no opinion on your Arab - Arab conflicts , such as your dispute with Kuwait . "
Saddam took her at her word and thought that he could punish the Kuwaitis for stealing his oil .
Bush Senior then proceeded to stand poor April on her head , declaring that " this will not stand ! "
The ensuing skirmish ended inconclusively , with Iraq humiliated and in stasis for a generation .
This was considered a victory , with endless parades and much flag - waving .
The US military was said to have recovered from " Vietnam syndrome . "
But nothing could hide the fact that it was a job left unfinished .
The more recent Iraq war is a full - blown , complete disaster , like Vietnam , or like Afghanistan was for the Soviets , but actually a lot worse , because Iraq is situated in the region which produces most of the oil .
The longer US troops stay in Iraq , the worse the situation there becomes .
The longer they wait to withdraw , the worse the situation will be once they do .
Iraq started out as a war of choice ( a startlingly poor choice ) but it is now a war of survival , certainly of America 's status as a superpower , and quite possibly of its economic survival as well .
Moreover , it is a war that appears to have already been lost .
The rest of America 's recent military conflicts either consisted of or centered around a bombing campaign , and generally fall into one of two categories : strategic spoiling attacks , and attempts to bolster the presidential manhood .
A strategic spoiling attack is a preventive action against a potential enemy who , if left unchecked , might attack you some time in the future .
It is more or less a bullying tactic , and , as such , already an admission of defeat on the diplomatic front .
One should prefer to live among strong friends , not weakened enemies .
Presidential manhood - bolstering bombing campaigns have come from both sides of the political spectrum ( not much of a spectrum , it turns out , since both sides are shades of ultra-violent ) .
There was the bombing of Panama , ostensibly to punish the apostate CIA asset Manuel Noriega , but really to mitigate against Bush Senior 's so - called " wimp factor . "
There was also Clinton 's despondent bombing of an aspirin factory in the Sudan and the bouncing around of some rocks in Afghanistan , ostensibly to punish terrorists for bombing US embassies in East Africa , but really to express frustration over the inordinate difficulties faced by the leader of the free world as a result of procuring oral sex .
I feel his pain , but , to paraphrase Freud , sometimes a cruise missile is n't just a cruise missile .
It may appear that the US military is not capable of prevailing over any enemy , no matter how badly armed , demoralized or minuscule .
While the Koreans and the Vietnamese were formidable , the US military could not bring to heel even the starving Somalis with their pickup trucks full of narcotic cud-chewing , Kalashnikov - toting youths .
Nor could they pacify the Iraqis , even after softening them up with bombs and sanctions for more than a decade .
There is one notable exception .
If we look at any of the military conflicts that involved the US military since World War II , there is one that stands out as a complete success : the liberation of the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada .
There , valiant American troops dislodged an unsavory and frightening Marxist regime which was supported by Cuba and Nicaragua and replaced it with a democratic , pro-American regime , much to the satisfaction of Grenada 's Caribbean neighbors and cruising yachtsmen alike .
The Soviets never learned their lesson in Afghanistan .
The slow , relentless , senseless carnage of that war did much to tarnish the image of the Red Army , which was until then still regarded as the people 's champion for defeating Hitler and for standing up to the Americans .
It took the disaster of the two campaigns in Chechnya after the Soviet collapse for the message to finally sink in .
Russia eventually got Chechnya under control , through political rather than military means .
A military effort alone can never defeat a popular insurgency .
The insurgents never have to win , they just have to continue to fight .
In fighting them , the military is forced to fight the people of the country , and by perpetuating a state of war it continually thwarts its stated purpose , which is to establish peace .
There is no room for victory in this scenario , but only for an ever - widening spiral of murder , hatred and shame .
The lesson that the United States desperately needs to learn is that their trillion - dollar - a - year military is nothing more than a gigantic public money sponge that provokes outrage among friends and enemies alike and puts the country in ill repute .
It is useless against its enemies , because they know better than to engage it directly .
It can never be used to defeat any of the major , nuclear powers , because sufficient deterrence against it can be maintained for relatively little money .
It can never defuse a popular insurgency , because that takes political and diplomatic finesse , not a compulsion to bomb far - away places .
Political and diplomatic finesse cannot be procured , even for a trillion dollars , even in a country that believes in extreme makeovers .
As Vladimir Putin put it , " If grandmother had testicles , she 'd be a grandfather . "
The long sequence of American military failures in its many wars of choice may not be significant in and of itself .
People throughout the world may cringe , but it is easy for Americans to consign these unhappy adventures to oblivion .
They are skilled at rewriting , if not history , then at least their strangely foggy recollections of it .
But at some point a key national interest becomes involved and the military adventure becomes more than just a way for the military to justify having an outsized budget .
For the Soviets , this point came when they lost Afghanistan .
They were in Afghanistan in accordance with the Brezhnev Doctrine , which stated unequivocally that no Socialist country would be allowed to backslide toward barbarous Capitalism .
Once they let go of Afghanistan the tide turned , and the Communists had to let go of the Warsaw Pact , the Soviet Union , and finally Russia itself .
It is common knowledge that the US forces invaded Iraq for no adequately explained reason .
What few people realize is that there is an American counterpart to the Brezhnev Doctrine .
It is the Carter Doctrine , which states that the United States would use military force if necessary to defend its national interests in the Persian Gulf region .
Carter announced it in a State of the Union speech in January of 1980 , in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan .
It is in the national interest of the United States to be able to efficiently exploit the oil resources of Iraq and direct the resulting flow of oil to eager motorists back home .
The military failure in Iraq ( which as of this writing appears complete ) is tantamount to a declaration that the Carter Doctrine is no longer in effect .
The ensuing backslide will mean more than just the loss of Iraqi oil production ; it may force the US out of the entire region .
Coupled with other unhappy developments , such as the ongoing devaluation of the US dollar , widespread oil production shortfalls due to oil field depletion and increasing political instability in several oil - exporting countries , this may cause the US to lose access to oil in other regions as well .
This will not make motorists back home happy .
Moreover , it will spell the end of the American dream of global dominance and the definitive loss of superpower status .
After the Soviet Union collapsed , Russia faced a dilemma .
It had stationed a great many troops abroad in Eastern Europe and particularly in East Germany .
These troops were not all Russian : some were recruited from the various Soviet Republics , and their allegiance was to the Red Army  an entity that no longer existed .
Repatriating and resettling these troops turned out to be a logistical nightmare .
There was no housing and no jobs for the returning troops .
But this was nothing compared to the problem that will be faced by the United States , which has over a thousand overseas military bases .
The vast majority of these serve no vital purpose and are further examples of massive military bloat .
In the coming years , starved of fuel and other resources , they will become worse than useless .
Liquidating them and repatriating the troops will pose a far greater challenge than that faced by the Soviets .
Amid the general confusion , some of the smaller military installations are likely to be simply forgotten , with the troops left to fend for themselves and their weapons going missing .
The last aspect of the superpower arms race worth mentioning is the arms sales race .
The US and the SU both supplied weapons to their client states .
The US conducted their arms trade on better terms , by lending the client state money with which to buy the weapons or by forcing the client state to spend its oil export revenue on weapons systems .
The Soviets more or less gave their weapons away to the brotherly peoples they held in their sway .
Russia , which inherited most of the Soviet defense industry , has updated its business plan , and is now positioned to surpass the United States in weapons sales .
Military defeats do not make for successful weapons marketing campaigns .
World 's Jailers
The jails race once showed the Soviets with a decisive lead , thanks to their innovative Gulag program .
Under Lenin , and later under Stalin , millions of people were herded into labor camps to provide slave labor for massive construction projects such as the Belomor Canal , which links the Baltic to the North Sea .
Over the years , the inmate population was comprised not only of criminals , who were always plentiful , but also of aristocrats associated with the ancient régime who were not fleet enough to emigrate to a new career of driving taxicabs in Berlin , Paris or New York .
The inmates also included ethnic minorities such as the Chechens ( who found themselves in disfavor after they welcomed the Nazi invaders ) , soldiers who had surrendered to the enemy instead of dying heroically ( surrender was considered a form of desertion ) , priests and nuns ( to rid the country of unscientific " religious superstitions " ) and plenty of innocent bystanders , who were swept up by a well - oiled judiciary machine .
The arrests often happened in the middle of the night and those arrested simply vanished from society .
Their disappearance was studiously ignored and the families of the disappeared were shunned by society .
Society was afraid , but since any admission of fear could be misinterpreted as an admission of guilt ( of suspecting that the system itself was criminal ) , even the fear had to remain hidden .
After Stalin 's death , a gradual liberalization took place .
Many of those falsely accused and imprisoned were rehabilitated , often posthumously .
Thereafter , the ranks of the political prisoners shrank steadily .
The appearance of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago became a watershed event , lifting the veil on a secret parallel universe , with its own language and customs , yet one that was very recognizably Soviet .
It could operate in the shadows , but once thrust into the broad light of day it immediately became obvious for what it was : a world - class abomination , on par with the Nazi holocaust .
A popular movement developed , devoted to keeping track of prisoners of conscience and communicating their names to foreign news sources .
The resulting external pressure on the Soviet government made it difficult for the judiciary meat grinder to operate normally .
The monsters running this system generally did not crave parading their monstrousness before a world audience , and this gradually starved the system of new blood .
Near the end , under General Secretary Andropov , there was an attempt to stem the tide by rounding up a few dissidents , who by this time had grown quite bold in their opposition , but it was futile and died along with Andropov when he , as it were , dropped off .
And so the Soviet Union gradually fell behind in the jails race .
By the time the Soviet Union fell apart , its worst atrocities had started to recede into history .
There were no widespread calls for reprisals against those who had committed them , who were by then either retired or dead .
In the end the jails race has been won by the Americans , who are currently holding the world record for the percentage of population held in jail .
Here , the judiciary meat grinder relies less on secrecy than on obscurity , gorging itself on the poor and the defenseless , while being careful around the moneyed and the privileged .
To mask its naked aggression against its citizens , the United States has traditionally used the fig leafs of constitutional rights and due process .
But the ill winds now blowing across the country have wilted this decorative flora , and not a week seems to go by without some new reports of abuses or atrocities .
The American justice system favors the educated , the corporations and the rich , and takes unfair advantage of the uneducated , the private citizen and the poor .
It would seem that almost any legal entanglement can be resolved through the judicious application of money , while almost any tussle with the law can result in financial penalties and even imprisonment for those who are forced to rely on public defenders .
In essence , any sufficiently complex system of laws is inherently unjust , favoring those few who have the resources to grapple with its extreme complexity .
This is clearly the case in the United States where , in civil disputes , those with more money can almost always prevail over those with less , simply by threatening to sue .
Many people believe that a criminal is someone who commits a criminal act .
This is not true , at least not in the American system of justice .
Here , a criminal is someone who has been accused of committing a criminal act , tried for it and found guilty .
Whether or not that person has in fact committed the act is immaterial : witnesses may lie , evidence can be fabricated , juries can be manipulated .
On the other hand , a person who has committed a criminal act but has not been tried for it , or has been tried and exonerated , is not a criminal , and for anyone to call him a criminal is libelous .
It therefore follows that , within the American justice system , committing a crime and getting away with it is substantially identical to not committing a crime at all .
Wealthy clients have lawyers who are constantly testing and , whenever possible , expanding the bounds of legality .
Corporations have entire armies of lawyers and can almost always win against individuals .
Furthermore , corporations use their political influence to promote the use of binding arbitration , which favors them , as the way to resolve disputes .
The US is by no means unique in jailing or executing innocents and in neglecting to punish the guilty .
But while in other countries such injustices can be put down to corruption , oppression or other problems with the justice system , in the US they are designed into the justice system itself .
This state of affairs makes it hopelessly naive for anyone to confuse legality with morality , ethics or justice .
You should always behave in a legal manner , but this will not necessarily save you from going to jail .
In what manner you choose to behave legally is between you and your conscience , God or lawyer , if you happen to have one , and may or may not have anything to do with obeying laws .
Legality is a property of the justice system , while justice is an ancient virtue .
This distinction is lost on very few people : most people possess a sense of justice and , separate from it , an understanding of what is legal and what they can get away with .
The US legal system , as it stands , offers a fine luxury model , but its budget model is manifestly unsafe .
It is good for those who can afford it and bad for those who cannot .
In recent years , appalling numbers of those awaiting execution have been exonerated as a result of DNA testing .
This amounts to an attempted murder rate high enough to condemn the entire criminal justice system that is responsible for it and , at the very least , ban everyone involved in it from further public service .
But nothing of the sort is likely to happen , since most of the victims are poor and are therefore of no consequence to the larger system .
As ever - increasing numbers of people find themselves lapsing into poverty , they will also find that they cannot pay what it takes to secure a good legal outcome for themselves .
They will start to see the system not as one of justice but as a tool of oppression , and will learn to avoid it rather than look to it for help .
As oppression becomes the norm , at some point the pretense to be serving justice will be dispensed with in favor of a much simpler , efficient , streamlined system of social control , perhaps one based on martial law .
To some extent , this shift has already occurred .
America now has secret jails , indefinite detention , secret tribunals , Soviet - style show trials , torture of prisoners , family detention for those who happen to cross US - controlled territory without the proper papers , and psychiatric imprisonment for both adults and children , where they are subjected to regimens of experimental anti-psychotic drugs .
Those who bemoan the out - of - control American criminal justice system would like to find ways to make it more effective .
But perhaps the real problem is that it is too effective , and needs to become much less so .
It is obvious that the jails race serves the purposes of the law enforcement class , providing them with employment , status and ample funds .
But it bears pointing out that it serves the interests of the criminal class even better .
The prison system offers many services to criminals : it allows them to congregate , network and hold seminars on the finer points of criminal technique and new ways to commit bigger and better crimes without getting caught .
Furthermore , it gives criminals a periodic sabbatical , making room for two million more criminals than the victim population could otherwise sustain , ensuring that whenever there arises a fruit ful opportunity to commit a crime , an ample supply of well - rested and highly trained specialists is available to make use of it .
The rationale for imprisoning over two million people in the United States , the world 's highest rate of incarceration , is that it deters crime .
Sociologists slice and dice crime statistics looking for a correlation between increased rates of incarceration and decreased crime rates .
The best they seem to be able to find is a correlation of about 0.25 between an increased rate of incarceration and a decrease in the crime rate .
That is , the measurable effect of incarceration levels on crime levels is not significant enough to state that an increase in the former causes a decrease in the latter .
More evidence would be needed to declare that the mass incarceration program is in any sense functional .
It is sometimes possible to find a stronger correlation between , say , rain dances and rainfall amounts .
While the criminal justice system seems like an effective way to promote crime , it may be even more effective in serving the atavistic desire of the population to see punishment doled out , which in more barbaric times brought crowds to gaze up at the sacrificial altar atop a pyramid , or the scaffold , the stake or the guillotine , and which even today brings a strange glint to the eye of American elected leaders when the subject of capital punishment comes up during political debates .
It is in the nature of powerless people to vicariously enjoy the exercise of arbitrary power by others .
Whereas the Nazis had to tattoo identification numbers on their concentration camp victims , Americans now have access to more modern technology , such as implantable radio frequency identification ( RFID ) tags , biometric and face recognition systems , satellite surveillance , ubiquitous surveillance cameras and globally networked databases .
These can theoretically enable the United States to turn much of the planet into a single large Gulag , or at least to overextend itself and collapse while trying .
When this system finally collapses ( as they all do ) , its surviving victims , who have no experience of anything better , will likely perpetuate this culture of abuse at an ever lower and more miserable level .
At this point , there is really very little to be done about the American culture of crime , except suffer from it , reaping what has already been sown .
The long - term effect of perpetuating an unequal and unjust social order , amplified by a program of mass imprisonment , is to create a vast society of victims .
Evil Empires
When Ronald Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as the " evil empire , " this label , impolitic though it was , made sense to a great number of people and the label stuck .
But what a difference two decades can make !
Shortly after Reagan stood at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin and spoke the words , " Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall ! , " the Berlin wall was indeed broken down into souvenir - sized pieces , but twenty years later big political walls are again fashionable , except now it is Americans and their clients that are putting them up .
There is a wall along the US - Mexican border , countless walls carving up Palestine into a pattern Jimmy Carter accurately labeled as " apartheid , " a currently stalled plan to partition Baghdad into Shiite and Sunni ghettos and numerous walls within the US itself around gated communities and exclusive compounds .
For an American , hiding behind a wall is becoming an increasingly good idea .
Over the last two decades , memory of the Soviet Union has faded from view , while the United States has taken its place as the symbol of all that is evil throughout much of Europe , the Muslim countries and many other parts of the world .
Wherever there is public protest , be it against war , injustice , globalization , violations of human rights , environmental destruction or policies that accelerate catastrophic climate change , it is the United States that offers a conveniently large and easy target .
While much of the population throughout the world is dead set against cooperation with the United States , their political leaders have to be careful : the United States is still a little too powerful to oppose directly .
On the other hand , any appearance of overt appeasement of American ambitions has come to spell automatic disaster at the polls , so the politicians stall and bide their time .
As the ultimately futile nine - year Soviet occupation of Afghanistan wore on , the economy stagnated and a succession of dour , gray - faced , geriatric General Secretaries succeeded each other atop the Lenin mausoleum , a number of people within the higher echelons of the Communist party started to find their evilness somewhat humiliating .
The imperial status was non-negotiable , as was the socialist ideology , but some sort of work - around strategy was clearly required for the evilness bit .
Gorbachev gave voice to these official yearnings through his glasnost and perestroika campaigns .
A great number of partial excuses , of the " mistakes were made " variety , were offered .
I remember a certain conversation that took place around that time , in the late 80s .
The topic of discussion was , " What could these bastards ( meaning the Soviet government ) possibly want now ? " A wizened old lady offered an answer that seemed nonsensical at first , but made a lot of sense upon reflection : they want shame .
They are tired of being bad as in " evil " ; now they just want to be bad as in " not very good . "
They are even willing to feel a little bit ashamed about it and to offer some vaguely worded apologies , provided that these fall well short of them actually accepting any responsibility .
You see , evil and incompetence do not mix .
Our imagination cannot conceive of the Devil who would have your immortal soul in a jiffy , if only he could locate the paperwork .
It 's one Hell of a mess down there .
The demons who handle the paperwork have become so lazy it 's a sin .
" To hell with them ! " the Devil would like to say , but that 's where they reside already , plus he can't recall the details of who lost what when , and so there is nothing to be done .
As mistakes continue to be made , the sinners can breathe more easily .
Twenty years later , it is the American officials that are making a spectacular show of their incompetence .
But rather than mincing words Gorbachev - style , the Americans are able to achieve a wonderful theatrical effect , thanks to their plain - spoken , straight - talking President .
From " Mission accomplished , " spoken as the Iraqi insurgency takes off , to " Brownie , you 're doing a heck of a job ! " as New Orleans drowns , to many other , similarly preposterous statements , we hear a Presidential clarion call to national incompetence .
It is a mistake to view such utterances as gaffes or blunders or flights of whimsy : they are true thought leadership .
Other high officials have their own strategies : the Vice President pretends to be delusional , producing a steady stream of strongly worded statements of fiction , while the former Attorney General simulates early onset Alzheimer 's with a compelling display of fogged memory .
Other administration officials make a show of accidentally destroying important documents but , for added effect , they destroy them incompetently , so that copies are soon retrieved .
American officials at all levels should fall in line with this brilliant strategy that has been handed down to them from on high as stone tablets from Mount Sinai .
Should they fail to do so , history will remember them as evil .
Should they succeed , history will mercifully consign their memory to oblivion , judging them to be merely incompetent .

10 Reasons Why Buying Penny Stocks Is Nothing But A Mistake
Why buying penny stocks can bite you .
Two words : Massive Risk .
I received a reader question some time ago about the subject of penny stocks , which are also known as “ stocks that are priced for under $ 1 per share ” .
I ’ve replied privately to the individual who asked me the question , but I thought the subject merited some discussion here , so I ’m reprinting their inquiry and the gist of my response .
Reader Question : I wondered if you would give me your opinion on a stock I own …it ’s so little known that I can’t find qualified opinions elsewhere .
It ’s a company called Serenic that trades on Canada ’s TSX Venture Exchange , which is mostly known for mining .
The ticker symbol is SER .
I had long talks with management after my broker recommended it and really liked their top - line growth story , but I was convinced because the valuation seemed unreal :
The company has about an 8 million market cap and more than 10 million in revenue ( small I know ) .
They also earned 7 cents a share last quarter , yet they are trading at 57 cents !
I hope I ’m not missing something , the management seems very credible and understated .
What follows are all just my opinions as a small investor .
At the same time though , my thoughts are pretty much in line with the general consensus about penny stocks — that they are extremely risky to delve into .
While these stocks will more than likely cause you trouble as an average investor , they may , however , work pretty well for a certain group of traders .
There is a market for penny stocks , but it ’s not the kind of market to get into if you are inexperienced and lack the knowledge to work with this type of “ investment ” .

I found this document from the State of Wisonsin ’s Department of Financial Institutions alerting us to the issues surrounding the purchase and trading of penny stocks .
After I scanned through it , I could only ask — could penny stocks have any redeeming qualities as an investment ?
Given the risk elements surrounding them , I could only come to the conclusion that trading in them is much like rolling the dice .
Ten Reasons Why I Wo n’t Touch Penny Stocks With A Ten Foot Pole
Some notable points I picked up from the document :
# 1 Information on penny stocks is hard to come by .
Price and volume data may not be easily or directly accessible to the public and may only be made available to you by the stock brokerage you ’re dealing with .
Typically , pink sheets for penny stocks are only made available to brokerage firms .
# 2 Penny stocks are easily manipulated because they are so thinly traded .
More on this later when I write about my own woeful tale about a failed penny stock trading experiment that went sour .
# 3 Brokers may want to push penny stocks upon customers because they can charge more for such a stock .
Be watchful of the charges a brokerage can impose on you for trading such stocks .
# 4 Penny stocks are often marketed aggressively .
# 5 These stocks are hard to unload .
You ’ll need to sell them through your broker , who may not exactly be happy about your decision to sell .
Beware of brokers who may be less than supportive of your wishes to sell your stock , and who convince you to keep hanging on or trading these so - called “ investments ” .
# 6 Penny stock brokerage firms may be inflating their track records .
Your broker may not be telling you everything there is to know about a stock : who knows ?
They could be committing “ sins of omission ” by skipping out on certain negative aspects of a stock .
It ’s also possible that the glowing stories you are hearing are actually exaggerated or embellished in order to attract and keep your business .
# 7 This industry is vulnerable to abuse , fraud and questionable sales practices as seen in their history , and fraught with brokers who use high pressure sales techniques and cold calling .
# 8 An oft - quoted statistic states that at least 70 percent (! ) of penny stock investors lose their shirts ( okay , they lose money ) , not counting the risks of fraud or abuse .
# 9 Trading penny stocks is highly risky .
If you somehow make money from penny stocks , be careful about attributing this stroke of fortune entirely to your skill or careful analysis or the due diligence you poured into making your investment decision .
It may simply be due to pure luck .
These stocks are extremely hit or miss , just like at the slot machines .
High risk , high reward , right ?
# 10 Do n’t get fooled by the stock ’s low price .
Just because you can buy a lot of stock at an incredibly low price does n’t mean that the stock is cheap .
I ’ve had friends tell me that they prefer buying low - priced stocks because they are so “ cheap ” .
You ’ll have to gauge a company ’s true valuation before you can determine whether its stock is worth buying .
Who knows , could a stock be so cheap because it ’s virtually worthless ?
~ooOoo~
Contemplating The Reader ’s Question …
Now my biases aside , let me zero in on some elements of the reader ’s question :
By his own admission , the reader found it difficult to find qualified information about his stock ( ticket symbol : SER ) .
It ’s a Canadian stock and it ’s in mining .
Good place to be in general , given today ’s economic climate .
Those are a couple of good things going for it ( along with the highly positive spins from management and the brokerage ) , so I can see the attraction to this stock .
It was trading at 57 cents ?
This was many months ago , so let ’s see where it ’s at now ( quotes are from Alphatrade Finance ) :
Just looking at it now , I hope the reader decided not to continue his relationship with this stock .
But one never knows about stocks like these as they tend to be extremely volatile , given how easy they are to “ move ” .
From a personal level , I ’ll also give you one final bonus reason why I ’m avoiding penny stocks like the plague .
It ’s because of my own personal experiences with them .
For those stories , you ’ll have to stay tuned for my follow up post on how I was dumb enough to succumb to greed and the siren call of a penny stock whose company promised a marvelous future .
Yeah , right .
If you ’ve got some tips or advice for our reader , or any thoughts on this topic , we ’d love to hear about it !
A penny stock for your thoughts ?

Doctors manage to halt 7ft 12 - year - old from growing any bigger
Lofty : Brenden Adams is 7ft 3ins and is only 12
Doctors first realised Brenden Adams was unusually big at two months , at four months he had all his teeth , and by the age of eight he was the same height as a 15 - year - old .
Now at just 12 years old he is a staggering 7ft 3ins and until a recent medical breakthrough it was feared he would not stop growing .
Brenden 's runaway growth - caused by a unique genetic condition - has baffled doctors for years and they have frantically tried to find a way of slowing it down .
Speaking to the Daily Telegraph , Dr Melissa Parisi , a geneticist at Seattle Children 's hospital , where Brenden has been cared for since he was four , said :
' We were concerned that he would continue growing and there 'd just be no stopping it .
' He really is a remarkable young boy .
He 's unique . '
The extraordinary condition is caused by a fault in Brenden 's DNA and he is the only person in the world known to suffer from it .
His 12th chromosome broke off during embryonic development , flipped around and reattached itself upside down , disrupting a gene that controls growth .
This caused his bones to stretch to extreme proportions .
For the last six months Brenden has stopped growing thanks to Gad Kletter , an endocrinologist at Seattle 's Swedish Hospital , who treated him with high doses of testosterone to help him begin puberty early .
This accelerated the process by which the growth plates at each end of human bones naturally close themselves off .
Dr Parisi said : ' Before treatment , he was on a trajectory that was still taking him up and up , rather than reaching a plateau .
' Plotting his growth curve , we think he would have been over eight feet now ' .
Brenden , who has also appeared on ABC News in America , was a normal 7lb 3 oz at birth and was also a regular length at 19.5 inches .
His mother Debbie Ezell , 40 , said : ' At his two month check - up the doctor kept re-measuring and said ' something 's just not right , he 's way too big for his age , too long . '
' At four months , he got all his teeth at once and they were like , ' OK , something 's going on here .
' Sometimes he would grow several inches a month . '
Brenden lives in Ellensburg , a small town in Washington state , and Mrs Ezell said the community have been very supportive and rallied around the youngster .
Complications with the condition - including fatty tumours , one which is on his brain , painfully enlarged joints , a heart condition and bleeding problems - mean he has no idea how long he has left to live .
Mrs Ezell said : ' He was happy as a baby and he 's happy now .
' You can see pain on his face when he 's struggling , but he does n't want anybody to know , he just deals with it . '
Family and friends have done all they can to make Brenden 's existence easier .
The doors and ceilings of his home have been enlarged , he has a custom - made bed and his mother buys him over - sized clothes on the internet .
Mrs Ezell said : ' The hardest part is just not knowing what the life expectancy is .
' But it 's truly Brenden that keeps everyone on the positive side .
If he's not here in a couple of years , we 'll look back and think ' Yes , but when he was here , was n't it good ? '
Initial thoughts on Google Chrome
03 Sep 2008
When I wrote the last post , Google Chrome seemed like vaporware , but just as I hit publish , a release time was announced for later that day .
Now that I ’ve had a chance to have a play with the beta , here ’s a brain dump of initial reactions :
It ’s fast and nimble .
In a Camino way .
It looks like a Fisher Price browser .
Simplicity is good , but the style is very child - like , and it makes me worry about the OS X version * ( Update : I think the Fisher - priceness is more of an XP issue , it looks much better on Vista ) .
I thought the tab icons were nicely executed though :
: I think the Fisher - priceness is more of an XP issue , it looks much better on Vista ) .
I thought the tab icons were nicely executed though :
The location bar search is much better than I thought - giving solid URLs rather than just a ‘ search Google for X ’ option .
For example , typing ‘ Jeremy Ke ’ brings up ‘ Adactio.com ’ .
It does n’t look as if the ‘ drawing layer ’ in Chrome is quite up to scratch yet .
It shows my naivety that I though such things were all part and parcel of Webkit , but it seems not .
Text - shadow and border - radius in particular are broken .
It does include the Webkit Web Inspector , so right - clicking reveals the familiar ‘ Inspect Element ’ command .
I mentioned yesterday about the problem of multiple tabs , and lo , it was a problem .
Yeah , yeah , yeah , it ’s a beta , yadda , yadda .
The ‘ New Tab ’ view is more useful than I thought it would be , with it ’s inclusion of history and recently bookmarked and closed tabs .
It does allow the use of other search engines , which is a good sign .
It ’s a fairly promising start , but it feels more like a browser I would recommend to my parents than use myself .
It also worries me using a Google browser , it feels like too many eggs in one basket .
Or too many potentially prying eyes ?

Conrick 's History of the Australian Labor Party originally appeared in Direct Action ( the precursor to Green Left Weekly ) , newspaper of the Socialist Workers League of Australia , between December 21 , 1972 , and June 14 , 1973 , and was published as a pamphlet by the Socialist Workers Party in 1979 .
The SWP is now the Democratic Socialist Perspective ( DSP ) .
This digital version was created by Ozleft .
The pamphlet reflected the DSP 's attitude towards the ALP at that time , however significant changes were introduced to this viewpoint in the 1980s .
This document should be read in conjuction with The ALP and the Fight for Socialism .
See also The ALP , the Nuclear Disarmament Party and the 1984 elections .
For a deeper analytical treatment of the social origins of social democracy in general and the ALP in particular , please consult Jonathan Strauss ' series of Links articles on the concept of the labour aristocracy .
1. Origins of the Labor Party
There is no set date for the emergence of the Australian Labor Party .
Its formal appearance in the early 1890s coincided with an upsurge in working class militancy , but it was by no means a product of that upsurge .
The Australian Labor Party was the product of an evolutionary process in trade unionism that began in the 1880s and culminated in the spread of mass unions to important sections of the working class such as miners and bush workers .
The corresponding growth of elementary forms of class consciousness was expressed in the collectivist ethos of these new bush unions .
The roots of the ALP lay solidly in these unions , and their organisational structures were manifested in the emerging political party .
To understand the evolution of Labor political representation it is necessary to trace the strands of union development in the 1880s .
Initially , the conditions of labour created by the gold rush and its aftermath gave a characteristic shape to the Australian labour movement .
The peculiar development of the Australian economy gave the working class a new composition and weight substantially different from their European proletarian counterparts .
Thus we find ( at least until 1890 ) that the Australian working class occupied a relatively strong bargaining position with wage increases and reductions in hours .
The perennially heavy demand for labour in the pastoral industry was matched by the growth of light industry in Melbourne and Sydney and the demand for skilled and unskilled workers in the housing boom of the 1880s .
Parallel to such heavy labour requirements was the disorganisation and individualism rife among the bourgeoisie .
It was not until 1890 that an effective squatters ' organisation was formed and ready to take on the Shearers '
Union to win back some of the concessions made to labour in the relative prosperity of the 1880s .
The story was repeated in the maritime industry , with the organisation of the Shipowners ' Association , as well as the mining industry .
The growth of unionism before 1890 appeared in those industries where capitalist ownership was highly concentrated and where the basis of exploitation was more open .
Hence the capitalisation of the mining industry in the decade 1865 - 75 and the close concentration of labourers in this industry saw the growth of the Amalgamated Miners ' Association in 1874 , first in Victoria and later extending into other colonies .
Similarly the tight grouping of itinerant workers such as shearers facilitated the rapid unionisation of agrarian workers .
In short , the mass unions were organisations of unskilled workers , centred on the most developed sectors of primary industry .
Despite the expansion of manufacturing in the urban centres of Melbourne and Sydney , unions here still tended towards the more exclusive , craft - orientated organisations of skilled workers .
The urban labour movement became a complex of small craft guilds dedicated to the maintenance of an aristocracy of labour .
It was these craft unions that were to prove the greatest obstacle to the growth of independent working class political action .
The basic successes of union action in the decade 1880 - 1890 laid the essential groundwork for the emergence of a political organisation , based on these newly developed structures .
Of course , the recognition of the necessity for labour political representation did not blossom overnight .
As far back as 1856 Victorian Stonemasons had lobbied parliamentarians on the question of an eight - hour day .
The Miners ' Reform League was a prototype of this approach .
Created after the Eureka stockade in 1854 , the League pursued purely parliamentary goals such as the abolition of property qualifications and payment of members .
The Reform League sustained the essentially petty - bourgeois approach of Australian trade unionism towards political action .
Yet even at this early stage we can find the contradiction that has plagued Labor Party leaders throughout the party 's history :
The Reform League and its unionist progeny were organisations of working class origin , but at the same time the leadership hierarchy of organised labour restricted its political direction to parliamentary gradualism and reformist measures .
This ambiguity has remained in practically the same form to this very day .
This dualism appeared in two of the first speeches made in parliament by Labor representative George Black in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales in 1891 .
" The men we represent " he said " are the wage - earners — those who labour with either hand or head , with either mind or muscle " .
But on the previous day he had said : " We have been told that we have come into this House to represent a class .
Well , that may be ; but that class is the class of all classes .
It is a class as wide as humanity — so wide that you may describe it as the class out of which all other classes are built up . "
Fifteen years later W.G. Spence , the founder of the AMA and at this time a Labor member of federal parliament wrote : " Our only hope is with the mass of the people , and above all , with the wage - earners . "
At the same time Spence could write : " There are only two parties now ; the Anti-Social Party — those who are against society and in favour of class dominance and the Labor Party who stands for justice , for right , for high moral principles ...
Labor is not for class but for all . "
The strikes of 1890 - 94
The movement that placed men such as Spence and Black into parliament was precipitated by the bitter strikes of 1890 - 94 .
Within the space of three years the colonial unions had conceded almost every major concession won from the capitalist class to that date .
The national confrontations between the unions and capitalist organisations involved all sectors of production .
Seamen , waterside workers , shearers , coal miners , silver - lead miners , transport workers , were all locked out by their bosses .
Police and military actions were used , thousands of special constables were sworn in and detachments of light horse brought out from the barracks .
The bosses ' demands for " freedom of contract " raised during the strikes struck at the root of every gain made by the working class in the previous ten years .
In the context of the depression , as tentative prosperity crumbled around the edges , the bosses ' ultimatum threatened to smash the basis of unionism itself .
The defeats experienced by the working - class organisations in this period produced a variety of responses .
Most union post - mortems stressed the broadening of their organisations , removing restrictions on membership and the like .
If the strikes did nothing else , they forced upon the smug labour leadership the realisation that the old exclusionist policies of membership were relics of more prosperous years .
In the context of mass unemployment in the 1890s and attacks on wage levels , union membership suffered a decline as owners found workers willing to labour at below average rates .
Also to emerge from these defeats was an increased emphasis on amalgamation and federation .
Without the growth of intercolonial trade union congresses , the national basis for the formation of the Labor Party would have been impossible .
Again , the demand for federation did not originate in the strikes themselves but was the product of union growth in the 1880s .
Turn to the political arena
The political lessons drawn here have two aspects .
On the one hand the shattering of unionist hopes by this latest confrontation encouraged many flights to utopianism .
The response of William Lane was but an extreme version of this malaise .
Lane 's answer to the class struggle was to gather together a few dispirited followers and start an Owenite community in Paraguay .
Needless to say , this venture ended in abject failure .
On the other hand , the majority of trade union bodies pointed to the necessity of an independent political party whose aim should be the direct representation of trade union interests .
At no stage did this proposition contemplate a movement outside parliament .
In the minds of men such as Spence , the aims of political labour were as an integrating force , where the party could serve as the go - between and point of contact with unions and the capitalist class .
In the words of Spence , the leaders of the trade union movement saw the Labor Party as " introducing co-operation instead of competition ... not because we are going to abandon the principles that guided men in the days of the old unionism " but because " we must unite on the common platform when we speak , and when we vote for reforms that are necessary " .
Nothing could have been more alien to the leadership of the trade unions than a party adapted to a conscious challenge to the power of the state , let alone to any form of socialism .
The confusion in the union leadership over the class basis of the emerging party was not reflected in its rank - and - file support .
Although the early Labor Party sought the support of groups other than trade unionists and workers , it was from the working class through the trade unions that the political power of the ALP arose and was reflected .
The call for a party
The impetus for the formation of a Labor Party was not confined to the trade unions .
The Australian Socialist League , formed in May 1887 , announced a meeting for " the purpose of forming an Australian Labor Party " .
The call was stillborn and while the ASL could claim the credit of being the first working - class body to propose a Labor Party , it was left to the Trades and Labour Council to launch the party as a practical objective .
In 1874 the TLC set up a Parliamentary Committee to act as a lobby and successfully sponsored a worker for parliament .
Direct representation was hampered , however , by the heavy financial burden on the unions .
It was this realisation that prompted the TLC at the Inter - Colonial Trade Union Congresses of 1884 and 1886 to support payment of members of parliament .
It was not until mid-1890 that the TLC moved seriously towards parliamentary action .
The decision to commit trade unions ' funds to form Labor Electoral Leagues was in one sense a measure of desperation as reactions against the strikes hardened .
While the union leadership sought some form of refuge in parliamentary action , the mass of the working class found in the Labor Leagues what they saw as the means by which to defeat both the capitalists and their parliamentary machine .
Structure of the party
The collapse of the Maritime Strike in November 1890 accelerated TLC interest in taking concrete organisational steps for a political party .
On November 28 the executive passed a motion for the establishment of the Labor Electoral Leagues , and the TLC parliamentary committee was delegated to investigate the establishment of branches in all electorates .
The impetus for this formation originated within the movement itself .
Only socialist fringe groups such as the ASL exhibited any external pressures for independent political action .
In the early years of its existence the ALP 's trade union origin and connections gave it a cohesion that no bourgeois political groupings had possessed in Australia .
This was despite the fact that the party suffered from a lack of definition over program and composition .
The division that evolved between the parliamentary and extra- parliamentary wings was in reality the most concrete statement of the party 's ambiguity .
Many of the prospective candidates for Labor representation still retained strong links with established bourgeois parties .
The imprecision of the party structure was reflected in fratricidal conflicts over the pledge of loyalty to the ALP program .
It had to be firmly established that the ALP candidate was not a free agent , but was bound to a common program .
Perhaps in no period in its subsequent 80 - year history has the ALP experienced the contradictions and confusions of its dual role more than in its formative years .
For many socialists this confusion remains .
Revolutionaries cannot ignore or bypass the ALP today .
As in 1890 , the Labor Party represents a fundamental political step forward for Australian workers .
It is the only alternative to the parties of the Australian bourgeoisie , but it also remains an obstacle to the construction of the mass revolutionary party that is necessary for the achievement of socialism and the final emancipation of the Australian working class .
2. Labor in power , 1895 - 1914
The Australian Labor Party grew to political maturity in a period when great changes were taking place in the nature and function of the Australian state .
Federation became the central question to divide the embryonic political groupings of the bourgeoisie .
It is no task of ours to go into the debate over federation .
Suffice it to say that stripped of its legalistic coating , the problem of federation turned around the question of which clique considered itself the most efficient and loyal defender of the intertwined interests of British and Australian capitalism .
The ALP had its part to play in this movement , particularly in dealing with immigration and arbitration , both key functions of the new , centralised state .
As we shall see later , the role of the ALP in the federal arena was as a national , centralising force , as opposed to the more parochial loyalties of the bourgeois parties .
It is in this sense that Lenin emphasised that " the Labor Party has to concern itself with developing and strengthening the country and with creating a central government .
In Australia the Labor Party has done what in other countries was done by the Liberals . "
( V.I Lenin , The Labor Government in Australia , Collected Works Vol 19 )
Federation and the colonial economy
Federation was the most concrete political and administrative expression of the development of each individual colonial economy .
In spite of rifts over tariffs and protective devices , the overwhelming trend in these economies was towards national planning , distribution and marketing , accompanied by expansion of exports .
The period 1895 - 1914 was one of slow recovery from the sharp break in the expansion of Australian capitalism that had occurred in the 1890s .
In primary industries the general recovery was punctuated by drought , but then offset by a rise in wool prices and the growth of butter as an export commodity .
The expansion of the manufacturing industry was assisted by the elimination of customs barriers between the states .
Manufacturing activity , stimulated by the reallocation of resources under federation , became more specialised and tended to concentrate in the major states of Victoria and NSW .
( See Boehme , Twentieth Century Economic Development in Australia , pp 18 - 20 )
It is in these two states that rising prices and unemployment most severely affected Australian workers .
The unions hit back
Despite this erratic recovery , the opening years of the twentieth century saw a rising confidence in the workers ' movement .
After the depression one of the major tasks of the unions was to restore wages to their pre-1890 levels .
Some victories were won , although any rise in wage rates was quickly accompanied by the inevitable price rise and jump in the overall cost of living .
The comeback of the working class movement after the defeats of 1890 - 94 can only be understood in terms of the rapid and often spectacular advances of political Labor .
In the context of these gains the trade unions were more prepared to take the initiative and assumed an altogether less defensive posture .
Their confidence was further reinforced by the build - up in union membership in the late 1890s and early 1900s .
Though unemployment remained at a constant 5.5 per cent , it was far more difficult for capitalists to obtain scabs than it was during the depression .
Most unions began where they left off in 1890 , developing amalgamation and federation and strengthening their organisational structures .
By 1900 there had been substantial confirmation of the unions ' offensive through the return of Labor representatives in NSW , Queensland , Victorian and South Australian parliaments .
As yet , the Labor leadership had had little chance to prove its capacities for strike - breaking , and maintained the fundamental confidence of the whole trade union movement .
( Those unions that had initially opposed the formation of an ALP soon recanted when presented with a fait accompli .
Quick electoral success brought the affiliation of most unions by 1904 . )
The first Labor governments
The ALP did not have to wait long before its conception of ballot - box reform became a possibility .
In fact , barely five years had lapsed before it was swept into office in the 1899 Queensland elections .
On the federal plane , Australians had only to wait until 1904 before J.G. Watson became the first Labor Prime Minister .
Watson 's ministry soon fell victim to the chronic political instability of the period and the party saw its first taste of power fade within four months .
In 1905 the ALP was involved in Lib - Lab alliances ( coalitions with liberal groupings ) in Queensland and South Australia , nowhere having the numbers to form a stable government on its own .
The party supported constitutional reforms by conservative governments , often making unprincipled blocs with bourgeois parties .
However , pressure from the trade unions to adopt principled stands in parliament severely limited horse - trading .
At the 1905 Commonwealth Conference the federal parliamentarians pleaded to be allowed to decide their own tactics , including alliances with other groups .
These pleas were ignored by the majority of the conference and any idea of alliances was rejected .
This decision led to early breakaway movements in Queensland , where the ALP had entered a temporary coalition to achieve adult suffrage .
When instructed by conference to break the alliance , some 12 members refused and left the party , relegating Labor to opposition for another decade .
The hard line taken on parliamentary alliances at the founding conference of the federal party and expressed again in 1905 marked a definite break with the old methods of loose organisation and lack of control over individual members .
These initial problems were resolved as the parliamentary wing increased its strength and political cohesion and was able to co-opt the effective leadership of the whole movement .
While Labor grappled with these problems , the bourgeois groupings began to crystallise , into more precise formations — receiving full confirmation in the emergence of the Deakinite Liberal Party , which held government until 1910 .
The instability of the first years of federal government came to an abrupt end when the ALP , under the leadership of Andrew Fisher , won the 1910 general elections .
It became the first federal party to win a clear majority over all other parties in both houses .
In the House of Representatives , Labor won 41 seats to 31 for the Protectionist Liberal alliance ( the Fusion ) .
The main Labor gains were in New South Wales ( five seats ) and in Victoria ( six seats ) .
The Senate result showed that the swing was Australia - wide ; Labor won all 18 seats contested , yielding a Senate of 22 Labor and 14 Fusionists .
The 1910 election was Labor 's honeymoon in Australian politics .
More than anything else this victory snapped the bourgeois groupings out of their protectionist - free trade bickering and laid the foundations for a decisive feature of Australian politics in the century : the permanent anti-Labor bloc of all capitalist parties .
From here on , Labor faced a reasonably coherent opposition .
Having traced the electoral fate of the ALP in its first 15 years , it is now necessary to analyse the issues that arose inside the workers ' movement during this period , and which shaped the politics of the movement outside the purely parliamentary sphere .
Arbitration and conciliation
The question of arbitration and conciliation formed one of the most crucial issues confronting the workers ' movement in Australia .
Both of these devices , dedicated to the end of ensuring " industrial peace " , were an integral part of the thinking of the ALP 's leadership .
They constituted a key position in the empirical policies of that leadership and remain there to this day .
In the development of the conflict between the day - to - day struggles of unions and the strategic goals of political Labor , arbitration and conciliation have been the most consistent points of contention .
One of the main tasks of the new federation was in this area .
Labor 's role during federation consisted mainly of demanding safeguards and " checks " in the constitution in spheres such as arbitration .
It fell upon John Watson and William Morris Hughes to champion the cause of flexibility in what was otherwise an extremely rigid bourgeois constitution .
Arbitration proved to be yet another area where the party leadership could be more " subtle " than the bourgeois parties themselves .
The growth of arbitration and conciliation as legitimate methods of settling basic confrontations proved to be an important weapon for governments in attempting to crush workers ' militancy and substituting negotiation for direct action .
W.A. Holman , later a Labor premier of NSW , outlined perfectly the objective role of arbitration when speaking in favour of the 1900 Arbitration Bill : " Today there is one way of settling a dispute ; if the bill passes there will be another way of settling it .
All that the passing of the bill will do is to substitute the method of reason , arbitration , common sense and judgment for the methods of brute force . "
Holman did not elaborate any further on the meaning of those methods of " brute force " , upon which he had so conveniently arisen to power .
Holman 's elevation of " industrial - peace " to the level of a social cure - all did not go unchallenged .
Attempts to push through arbitration legislation met with strikes from the coal miners and maritime unions in particular .
However , these challenges were the exception rather than the rule and the strikes did nothing to stop the passage of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act .
Parliamentary orientation
The ministry of Andrew Fisher ( 1910 - 1913 ) regarded arbitration as one of its most valuable weapons in maintaining its own political stability .
Fisher mapped out what has become a standard manoeuvre for the party 's leadership once in power .
The ALP in government has seen arbitration as a way of escaping its obligations to the workers ' movement — a method of avoiding commitment to unions in industrial disputes .
Thus Labor has been content to demand that unions accept the jurisdiction and decisions of " independent " industrial courts .
Such concepts were closely linked to the need felt by the reformist leadership to become the inheritors of Australian nationalism .
Their policy was to transcend class .
It was " a national one which they felt sure would result in the development of the Commonwealth along right lines and the general well - being of the people " , said one of Fisher 's ministry .
( Cited in I.H. Turner , Industrial Labour and Politics in Eastern Australia , 1900 - 1914 )
While there was talk of Labor 's " national tasks " , it was not perfectly clear how , or for whom , these tasks would be resolved .
It was argued that : " The worker 's great concern is not how he might temporise with the robber , not how he might persuade the robber to take a little less of what he produces ; his great concern is rather how to get rid of the robber . "
But how was this to be done ? —
It was the mission of Australian workers " to effect the social revolution by means of an intelligent use of the ballot " .
( Platform of the ASL , in People , July 14 , 1900 )
Clearly , this confusion had its repercussions in the early stages of the ALP .
It had to be established once and for all that Labor was a parliamentary party , no matter how unclear its political ideology .
White Australia Policy
One issue over which there was very little argument was defence .
The defence policy of the ALP was closely related to the sponsoring of the racist White Australia Policy — to the preservation of a white , democratic Australian nation .
Many early Labor leaders such as George Black and William Lane reinforced and popularised some of the basest fears and lies .
During the 1901 House of Representatives debate , one Labor member claimed that those Asians " who do raise themselves to the level of the whites get as cunning as foxes ... they beat us at every turn " .
( Cited in H. McQueen , A New Britannia , p 50 )
With both immigration and defence , Labor leaders invoked the worst fears and most backward elements present in the working - class movement .
Class interests were made to appear complementary to " national interests " and " national interests " to imperial interests .
The struggle that arose inside the ALP over such questions of war and peace were to foreshadow the pressures building up in relation to conscription — an issue that was to split the party in 1917 .
The rise of syndicalism
Around this time two influences emerged in the trade union movement .
Both were syndicalist - type currents , one personified by the English socialist Tom Mann , the other by the strongly anarcho - syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World .
The ALP 's monopoly of working - class support had pinpointed two distinct responses from Australian socialists in the period before the outbreak of the First Imperialist World War .
Some , such as the IWW had correctly diagnosed the ALP as a non-socialist " party , but then proceeded to turn away from the ALP altogether .
In the long run groups that tried to ignore the ALP were condemned to oblivion .
One member of the Chicago - line IWW recognised this when he explained that the result of the IWW 's sectarian campaign against Labor was that " workers who regarded the ALP as bona fide were antagonised " .
( Member of Broken Hill IWW local , cited in I.H. Turner , Industrial Labour and Politics in Eastern Australia , p 61 ) .
Other socialists took the view of Tom Mann , and made some sort of attempt to concretely relate to the ALP .
Mann was a former secretary of the Independent Labor Party , a forerunner of the British Labor Party , and had been brought out to Australia by the ALP to work as an organiser at the Trades Hall in Melbourne .
It was under Mann 's influence that the Victorian branch of the Labor Party adopted what came to be known as the " socialist objective " .
In reality , this concept was fairly remote from socialism .
Nonetheless
Mann made it clear that any attempt to ignore the ALP altogether was " doctrinaire , exclusive , pedantic , narrow ... comparatively useless and perhaps mischievous " .
( T. Mann , Memoirs , London , 1923 , p 197 )
Mann 's influence , like that of the IWW , was short - lived .
Yet in the brief period 1910 - 1914 syndicalist ideas had a remarkable influence on the workers ' movement .
The influence of syndicalism was at its height when an important dispute broke out in Brisbane during the opening months of 1912 .
The Brisbane general strike
A direct confrontation between the conservative Queensland government and the workers pushed the ALP leadership to the front of what was to be its first experience of a workers ' mass movement since the party 's inception .
The strike followed a refusal by the state to recognise union rights in public service industries such as transport .
If the strike did nothing else , it did illustrate a new consciousness within the movement , as shown by the publication of a Strike Bulletin .
The January 31 edition of this Bulletin carried this remarkable passage : " The Workers Raise the Flag of Solidarity .
First Simultaneous Strike in the World At 6 o'clock last night the signal was given to down tools .
Brisbane unionists nobly responded ... Superb demonstration this morning ...
City business ceases ... Unparalleled proof of the Solidarity and Power of Labor ... Brisbane toilers class conscious at last . "
The industrial action was accompanied by daily processions through the streets .
In each case demonstrations were led by state and federal Labor MPs .
The state threatened that " this strike must end in the downfall of socialism " .
In spite of its militancy , the Brisbane strike ended in defeat after lasting out five weeks .
The return to work was not accompanied by any real gains .
( Strike Bulletin , January 31 , 1912 , cited in I.H. Turner , Industrial Labour and Politics )
The Brisbane strike was to be the last major struggle before the imperialist war .
In the years leading up to 1912 Labor had made some spectacular gains .
The ALP began its drive into the 20th century from a minority position , but by August 1914 Labor had created a national party , in office in three of the six states and fighting to regain control of federal parliament .
Labor could now look forward to becoming the dominant factor in Australian politics .
3. Labor and the war
War is an acid test for all political parties , particularly parties of the working class .
The pressures of an imperialist war such as the one that opened in 1914 , proved to be no exception .
Capitulation , chauvinism and narrow national interests triumphed in the European sections of the Second International .
Only the Bolsheviks and a handful of individuals remained steadfastly in line with the principles of internationalism .
If parties under the leadership of men with the capabilities of Kautsky and Plekhanov succumbed so effortlessly to bourgeois patriotism , what of the reaction of a dual - class party such as the ALP ?
Labor 's response to the war
Given the hegemony of imperial economic ties and ideology in pre-war Australian society , it was destined that large sections of the masses would temporarily swing in favour of the war in its initial stage .
The claim of the Labor Party leadership to represent a variety of classes and interests melted into an open and enthusiastic support for the prosecution of the war .
It was Labor Prime Minister Fisher who attempted to call off the federal elections scheduled for September 1914 in the name of " national stability " .
The conservative government in control of the House of Representatives went ahead and called an election , which the ALP won , gaining control of both the Representatives and the Senate .
The support of the party 's leaders for the war was not an isolated and precipitous act of patriotism .
It flowed from the class - collaborationist line pursued by the leadership well before the war and was the extension of the militarist foreign policy advocated by Hughes and others to maintain Australia as an outpost of European civilisation .
The characteristic reaction of the union movement was usually along the lines that " we must protect our country .
We must keep sacred from the mailed fist this splendid heritage . "
( The Worker , August 6 , 1914 )
Among the followers of the Second International in Australia , the Victorian Socialist Party offered a public condemnation of the war .
At the same time the VSP chose to work inside the ALP because of the influence of " the unions and leagues and conferences at the back of the Labor Party " .
Besides , claimed the VSP , the workers stood a better chance with Fisher than with the conservatives .
( The Socialist , September - August 1914 )
Other socialist sects expressed their opposition to the war outside the context of support for the ALP .
Rather than drawing towards the masses of workers who blindly followed the ALP leadership into the war , the majority of the socialist groupuscules adopted the approach that the leaders of the federal party were " fakers , twicers and bloodsuckers " .
Such predilections belied a fatal attempt by some of the early socialists to bypass the hold of the ALP on the organised working class .
As for the parliamentary wing of the ALP , its position on the war was defined thus : " Our interests and our very existence are bound up with those of the Empire .
In time of war half measures are worse than none .
If returned with a majority we shall pursue ... every course necessary for the defence of the Commonwealth and the Empire . "
( The Labor Manifesto )
There was never any question among the Labor leadership about national defence .
Even national republicanism was prepared to forego " independence " in favour of imperial service to Great Britain .
Hughes and conscription
The pressures on the right - wing leadership , from Britain , for troops , increased during 1915 , when William Morris Hughes replaced Fisher as Prime Minister .
Hughes immediately launched an attack upon the working - class organisations .
His first move was to ban the IWW , which had maintained a persistent antiwar stand and by late 1915 was gaining some influence among government workers in the railways and transport industries .
Concurrent with this note of repression was the calculated weight of Hughes ' own political base in the trade union movement .
In Hughes ' case , his influence lay in the Australian Workers Union , which had the largest number of delegates to ALP conference .
The AWU was a conservative union , which favoured arbitration to settle disputes and usually condemned strike action .
The dilemma of Hughes ' position was this : on one side stood the British War Council demanding new divisions of troops for the war of attrition that was developing on the Western Front and on the other was his realisation that there would be fierce opposition to the introduction of conscription .
When in August 1916 the War Council cabled to the Australian government a threat that one of Australia 's divisions would have to be disbanded , Hughes was forced to move .
The proportionally enormous casualties suffered by the Australian Imperial Forces at the Battle of the Somme and throughout the allied imperialist summer offensive in 1916 severely extended the already strained Australian Army .
Hughes took great pains to point out to his audiences that the homogeneity of the AIF would be destroyed unless conscription was introduced .
He did so in the most calculated demagogic and chauvinistic terms possible : " every Australian is bound by every sacred tie of honour and of duty , every instinct of loyalty and self - preservation to do his fair share in the mighty efforts of the Empire " .
Hughes had a long record of militarist sympathies and he needed no great moral persuasion from the allied command to commit Australian troops to Europe under compulsion .
( W.M. Hughes , Melbourne , September 21 , 1910 , cited in J. Main , Conscription : The Australian Debate , p 40 )
The union opposition to Hughes
The Prime Minister did not speak for the rest of the ALP , nor for the whole Labor movement .
Opposition to the conscription proposals inside the working - class organisations rested on the assumption that national service would weaken the trade union movement and open the way for a capitalist class attack on wages and conditions .
Under the wartime circumstances of state intervention in industrial production , the manufacturing sector had expanded and diversified into chemicals and rubber .
But unlike European capitalism , wages in Australia remained at a relatively high level .
The threat of compulsory military service to the worker became a welcome medium for the industrial bourgeoisie to cut costs .
In particular , the replacement of adult males by female and child labour resulted in the reduction of wages by 50 per cent in certain industries .
The allegation that conscription would turn Australia into a " black man 's hell " was an integral and racist component of the campaign against Hughes organised by the Labor bureaucracy .
While the more progressive sections of the workers ' movement rejected the blatant racism of some trade unionist arguments , others tended to centre on the ambiguous , but just as dubious issue of " mass immigration " .
Of course , Hughes was just as guilty of racist paranoia as some of his opponents .
As a matter of fact , a large measure of the Prime Minister 's assessment of the danger to Australia lay in an undisguised fear of Japan .
It was the Melbourne Trades Hall Council that delivered the first blow against Hughes ' promise to the British government .
In May 1916 a special conference was convened to define Victorian Labor 's attitudes towards conscription , which resulted in a resolution being passed opposing conscription .
Hughes returned to Australia from a trip to London in July 1916 , as yet uncommitted to national service .
On September 1 of that year he attacked a meeting of the Victorian executive and tried to gain support for his conscription proposals , but failed .
Despite an alliance with Premier Holman in NSW Hughes failed to carry the party in his own state .
On September 15 Hughes and Holman were expelled from the Labor Party .
Hughes walked out with a ginger group of four ministers and 17 parliamentarians , although there was still no formal split .
The conscription campaigns
Hughes was forced to abandon his hopes of getting conscription through parliament .
Even if he had been able to steer the bill through the House of Representatives , he would have faced an open revolt of Labor senators .
The decision to put the question of conscription to a referendum was precipitated by several ministerial resignations .
Ultimately the referendum was the only way for Hughes to oppose the demands of the unions that he drop his militarist posturing .
Besides , he thought he could win .
The mass campaign that followed the announcement of the referendum was the largest and most intensive confrontation between the industrial and political organs of the working class and the front organisations of the Australian bourgeoisie .
For scope and depth of mass involvement Australia has never witnessed a more open battle .
Conscription and the issue of whether working people should be forced to fight and die for imperialist wars became the touchstone of a renewed radicalisation of the working class .
Under pressure from thousands of workers , the Labor Party eventually swung behind the upsurge of strikes and lockouts that followed the aftermath of the referenda and the 1917 general elections .
The first referendum , decided on October 28 , 1916 , resulted in a rejection of conscription .
Hughes ignored this edict and a second referendum in December 1917 brought an even firmer rejection of conscription .
Both results were crushing victories for official Labor and a clear , unmistakable voice against Australia 's continued involvement in the war .
The true winning margins of the referenda have never really been released .
One sector of the vote was especially embarrassing for the supporters of conscription — that was the voice of the Australian Infantry Force .
The official statistics registered the army vote as a narrow victory for compulsion , however many reports have since indicated that the final figures were tampered with .
On several occasions Hughes ' agents in London reported on the unrest of AIF soldiers at the front .
If the army did record a Yes vote , it was only because of reservists uninitiated in trench warfare .
The mass campaigns and the IWW
Socialists and syndicalists alike played a leading part in rolling back conscription .
The audacity of the IWW and their stress on rank and file organisational forms won them the support of a considerable section of the labour movement during the war .
Moreover , the IWW produced a weekly newspaper , Direct Action , which sold , around 10,000 per issue at the height of its influence .
The importance of Direct Action as a focus for building the anti-conscription campaign cannot be underestimated .
Its attraction was borne out by the considerable attention the Wobblies received from the state repressive apparatus , including those former Labor men gathered around Hughes .
One of the most influential organs of the imperial bourgeoisie , The Round Table , gives this revealing summation of Hughes ' position in the Labor machine .
" Mr Hughes has always been at daggers drawn with any section which has sought to identify the Labor Party with the outlook of industrial unionism .
The Round Table benignly excused the working class for accepting " that the governing classes of all countries were responsible for the war " .
The journal concluded that the conscription campaign had been largely a struggle between Hughes and " the alternative of violence and the class war — the social revolution to be achieved through ... the brute force of organised unionism " .
( The Round Table , Vol 7 , 1910 - 17 , pp 389-391 )
The unremitting anti-conscription campaign of the IWW resulted in a growth of support for the movement among the working class .
This influence could have been extended into the army .
But rather than having an interventionist orientation towards the army , the IWW exhibited a naive anti-capitalist puritanism , which ultimately led to isolation from thousands of workers already in the AIF .
The abstention from army agitation work was in line with a general syndicalist rejection of all forms of political struggle .
Thus the IWW rejected all parliamentary action .
It made no distinction between reformist politics and revolutionary politics , and analysed the opportunism of the ALP purely in terms of its commitment to parliamentary activity .
Direct Action claimed that " for the first time in the history of the working - class movement in Australia a paper appears which stands for straight - out direct - actionist principles , unhampered by the plausible theories of the parliamentarians , whether revolutionary or otherwise " .
( Cited in E.W. Campbell , History of the Australian Labour Movement , Sydney , 1945 , p 70 )
The IWW was to learn that such sectarian parity did nothing to mobilise the ranks of Australian workers who shackled their hopes and aspirations to the ALP .
The indictment of the IWW twelve
In 1916 the central leadership of the IWW was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit arson .
It is quite probable that this was a false charge , but the government availed itself of the opportunity presented by the trial to pass the Unlawful Associations Act , banning the IWW and the publication of Direct Action .
Still the bulk of the IWW remained unreconciled towards the ALP .
Some sections of the movement re-formed themselves under new names to avoid the act .
The ban on the IWW led directly to the formation of the One Big Union , which unsuccessfully attempted to unite all trade unions into one massive organisation along the lines of industry , rather than by craft .
The stillborn plan for the OBU had the support of those who were to become the nucleus of the Communist Party .
Its most enthusiastic supporters were the Socialist Labor Party , independent socialists , left - wing ALP members and former members of the IWW .
In real terms the OBU had cashed in on a period of upsurge in 1917 , otherwise its organisational and political influence was negligible .
The 1917 general strike
Two upsurges on the industrial front represented the culmination of widespread discontent over wartime profiteering , high food prices , long hours and speed - up methods in production , plus the refusal of the arbitration courts to increase wages sufficiently to offset the increased cost of living .
The lead - up to the big strike of August 1917 was the coal mining dispute of October 1916 , which effectively closed down all mines in the Commonwealth , causing a serious dislocation of most other industries .
Despite its limited demands for shortened hours , its political impact was magnified by the threat to wartime production .
This tactic was extended to other industries by the adoption of go - slow methods .
In the railway workshops in NSW , where syndicalist influence considerable , posters began to appear , proclaiming : " Slow work means more jobs .
More jobs means less unemployed .
Less competition means higher wages , less work , more pay . "
( IWW poster , 1916 , In I.H. Turner , Sydney 's Burning , p 90 )
Attempts were made by the government to speed up work , but all such efforts met with walkouts throughout Australia .
The strike rapidly spread to other industries : coal and metalliferous miners , seamen , waterside workers and others such as carters and storemen , who refused to handle blackbanned goods .
At its climax , close to 100,000 workers were involved in what turned into the biggest industrial upheaval experienced in Australia .
It was not until September 19 that the strike was defeated by the unions agreeing to sign application forms for re-employment .
( See J.A. Sutcliffe , A History of Trade Unionism in Australia , pp 225-232 , and E.W. Campbell , op cit , pp 78 - 102 , for details of the strike . )
The effect of the split
When Hughes finally broke away from the ALP in early 1917 to form the Nationalist Party , he left the parliamentary wing of the ALP demoralised and defeated .
This was in spite of the success of the anti-conscription campaign .
The political demoralisation of the ALP was concretised in the victory of the Nationalist coalition in the 1917 elections .
It left the Labor Party unable and unwilling to lead the thousands of workers involved in the industrial upheavals of 1917 .
The role of the ALP during the general strike was not so much a betrayal as almost complete ineffectiveness .
It was not the ALP but the bourgeois Nationalists and employers who smashed the strike .
In the parliamentary arena Labor paid the price of the split : virtual political oblivion throughout the 1920s , until the rise of Scullin 's government in 1929 .
4. Labor in the 1920s
The final war years
There exists a deep feeling of war weariness that if taken in hand can be used to checkmate the jingoism and sophistry of the patriots and ultimately bring about a stop - the - war feeling . "
F.J. Riley , secretary of the Peace Alliance , 1917 .
( Cited in I.H. Turner , Industrial Labour and Politics , p 172 )
The author may well have added that Labor did not sense this change in mass feeling towards the war .
ALP parliamentarians continued as the most enthusiastic supporters of the war , despite their opposition to overseas conscription .
At the same time , pressure from below had forced the passage of a strongly worded antiwar resolution through the NSW branch , which tended to be under the control of more progressive unionists .
The motion was passed at the NSW conference in June 1917 , declaring that war was the inevitable outcome of capitalism and " peace can only be accomplished by the united efforts of the workers of all the countries involved " .
In spite of opposition from Labor parliamentarians this motion was passed unamended .
It was an accurate and revealing reflection of the tenor of ALP politics : on the one hand there was a militant and responsive industrial - based wing , on the other a flabby and timid parliamentary body .
As the war became more and more unpopular , the tension between these rival tendencies increased .
Labor emerged from the war in complete political disarray , still licking its wounds after the exodus of the Hughes group , which now held parliamentary office in coalition with anti-Labor forces .
Like most deserters from Labor 's ranks , Hughes moved effortlessly along a right - wing , nationalist road .
The explanation for this rapid shift was not a sudden " ratting " by Hughes , but the logical outcome of the pro-imperial wing of parliamentary Labor .
The 1917 split had effectively liquidated Labor 's electoral fortunes and ushered in almost a decade of Nationalist government , first under Hughes , then under the mediocre leadership of Stanley Bruce .
The social and economic upheaval of the war had resulted in new divisions and alignments in Australian politics and the creation of new parties , all of which tended , at one stage or another , to displace the ALP as the focus of working - class politics .
The failure of the ALP to command national politics in the 1920s was due partly to the destructive influence of the split , but also to the division in the labour movement itself between sectors that actively supported the October 1917 Revolution and others that remained committed to parliamentary reformism .
The impact of the Russian Revolution , and its morale - boosting effect on rank - and - file militants , necessitated an even firmer reaffirmation of the principles of gradualism by the official Labor bureaucracy .
New directions in the economy
The upheaval in political life was an approximation of the new directions of the Australian economy in the closing stages of the war and the years immediately following .
Except for a brief recession in 1922 manufacturing industry enjoyed a period of expansion and diversification under solid tariff protection , high export prices and continued government spending .
An important change in manufacturing was the growth of heavy industry and a move away from the old comprador industries of the colonies .
In real terms this meant a lessening of direct company ties with British imperialism .
The history of manufacturing in the 1920s was that of government aid to industry helping to make inroads into imports and ultimately capture the home market from Great Britain .
Despite tariff preference , British imperialism found its share of the Australian market had dwindled to almost two thirds of its pre-war position by 1928 .
The United States benefited from these developments , doubled its share of the market and established a firm hold in the local economy .
( See Forster , Industrial Development in Australia , 1920 - 30 )
The growth of heavy industry was epitomised by the founding of a large - scale iron and steel works nourished by government contracts and protection .
The nullification of the old colonial industries and corresponding rise of modern manufacturing produced a general instability in the allocation of labour .
Particularly in the years 1919 - 22 people found themselves out of jobs and thrown into new work situations .
All the militancy of the final years of the war did not fade away but was carried on into a series of bitter and prolonged strikes and lockouts .
The influence of the Russian Revolution
One of the reasons for the upsurge in the closing months of the war was the impact of and widespread sympathy for the first successful proletarian revolution in Russia .
News of the February Revolution reached sympathetic ears in large sections of the population .
A dearth of factual material had condemned the Bolsheviks as liberals in most peoples ' eyes .
Little authentic news was available , since most international socialist publications had been banned by regulation under the war Precautions Act .
However the Bolshevik victory and the peace on the Eastern Front were widely welcomed by almost all extra-parliamentary sections of the labour movement .
Australian socialists tended to support the majority of the British and French sections of the Second International .
News of the minority Zimmerwald Left led by Lenin and Luxembourg was scant and it was left to Russian emigres in Australia , many of them Bolshevik sympathisers , to explain the details of the factional situation in the European Left .
From the beginning of 1918 the most militant of the Australian industrial organisations , the Barrier ( Broken Hill ) AMA and the Brisbane Industrial Council , were calling for a Commonwealth labour and trade union conference to put pressure on the government to declare itself for immediate peace .
By and large the official labour bureaucracy ignored this call and supported Hughes ' demand for Germany 's unconditional surrender .
Labor 's reaction to the Russian Revolution
The general upturn in the revolutionary movement internationally gradually seeped through to many in the ALP .
E.J. Holloway , secretary of the Melbourne Trades ' Hall Council , wrote a preface to " a wonderful speech " by Trotsky ( The World Crisis , by Leon Trotsky , preface by E.J. Holloway , Melbourne , 1922 ) , concurring with his analysis of the imperialist crisis .
Holloway 's position typified that of many inside the ALP , who responded to the October Revolution in a romantic , sometimes semi-mystical fashion .
Basically , the concept of a Leninist party ( such as it was understood ) was seen as irrelevant because Labor 's dominance in Australia " had firmly laid the basis of a new nation " .
Labor ideology was to seek an Australian exception to the unfolding of a class society .
While acknowledging the existence of class in Australia , the ideologies of parliamentary labour hoped to unite all classes in a utopian state that was above class itself .
More than any other event , the Russian Revolution and the mass support that it evoked , inspired a " genuine revolt of the unionist background of the party against the time - serving and inaction of the politicians " .
The formation of the Communist Party of Australia
Few radical Australian historians have grasped the peculiar circumstances leading to the formation of an Australian Communist Party , and the repercussions that these circumstances had on the orientation of the CPA to the mass working - class party .
It would be impossible in the space available here to analyse this in detail , but perhaps our understanding of the nature of the relationship between the CPA and the ALP will be clarified by recalling that the CPA was formed largely by militants disillusioned with the Labor Party .
In this sense the CPA at its emergence in October 1920 began with a rather eclectic and haphazard attitude to the ALP .
The indigenous suspicions and fears of early Party leaders such as Miles and Sharkey were compounded by the intervention of the Stalinised Communist International after 1927 .
Now one way , then the other , the Communist Party scuttled about the fringes of the labour movement searching for a line of clarity , which it never found .
The confusion continues to this day .
The Communist Party of Australia was formed at a meeting in Sydney on October 30 , 1920 , which was attended by 26 people .
At its foundation the party encompassed three main groupings , already dealt with in previous articles in this series : former IWW militants led by Jock Garden , members and former members of small socialist parties , and the largest socialist party then in existence — the Australian Socialist Party .
( R.S. Ross , Revolution in Russia and Australia , Melbourne , 1920 , p 49 )
Two months after its formation , the CPA split over its strategy towards the ALP .
The IWW group favoured " white - anting " or boring from within , the remnants of the socialist sects opted for an even more sectarian approach , befitting their petty bourgeois outlook and former isolation in the labour movement .
Rivalries carrying over from the pre-amalgamation period led the ASP also to distrust the Garden group and it shortly refused to pool its resources into the new party .
The ASP and the CPA thus came to compete with one another for the honour of becoming the Australian section of the Third International , the world revolutionary party founded by Lenin and Trotsky in 1919 .
Finally , after delegates from both parties had attended the third congress of the International , the CPA was granted affiliation ( August 1922 ) .
The bulk of the membership of the ASP then left their former party to its fate and joined the CPA .
While the founding congress of the Third International had adopted a policy of open hostility towards the labour and social democratic parties , which had betrayed the working class in the war , it changed that in 1921 , after the ebb in the world revolution .
It changed to a policy of forming united fronts with labour parties , a tactic devised by Lenin and Trotsky to prevent the newly formed communist parties from becoming isolated sects , sealed off by traditional working class allegiance to mass parties such as the ALP .
Reluctantly and gradually , the CPA took up this policy , but the ebb of militancy in Australia reduced its influence in the labour councils to almost zero .
Notwithstanding the CPA 's recalcitrance , some members of the party joined the ALP .
A proposed official united front policy at leadership level between the ALP and CPA was defeated due to the ALP bureaucracy ' suspicions and instinct for survival .
ALP leaders too , had heard Lenin 's dictum that communists should support them " as a rope supports a hanging man " .
Only in 1924 did the CPA win a brief success at the NSW ALP conference , when it was granted provisional affiliation .
It was expelled a few months later .
For the remainder of the 1920s the CPA was forced back into an essentially propagandist role , where it lay estranged from the mass of workers .
Labor , on the other hand , secured the support of a new layer of militants with its so - called socialisation objective .
( V.G. Child , How Labor Governs )
The socialist objective
The adoption of a policy in favour of the socialisation of industry , production , distribution and exchange by the Labor Party in 1921 was conceived from two contradictory directions .
While acknowledging its vulnerability to the new - found working - class militancy , Labor leader Scullin also went to great pains to point out that the objective was an attempt " to prevent revolution by force " .
( Cited in H. McQueen , Glory Without Power , in Australian Capitalism , ed Playford and Kirsner ) .
Years later Arthur Calwell explained that the socialist objective would combat " the spurious claims of the communists to be a working class party " .
Indeed , one of the more remarkable aspects of the socialist objective was the procession of repudiations it suffered immediately following its adoption .
Despite its aura of progressiveness , the objective was never more than talked about .
In many ways it became the concentrated expression of Labor 's role as a block to a genuine socialist movement in this country .
This was especially true in the years of NSW Premier Jack Lang 's pre-eminence in the 1930s .
Nevertheless , those proposals for socialisation , in the words of one ALP delegate were " from 700,000 trade unionists " , not just from the delegates at ALP conference .
While the post - war period saw a rapid growth of the confidence of the workers ' movement , this growth soon stagnated and by the mid-1920s the Nationalist government felt prepared to struggle to win back concessions it had made in the past .
The rate of growth of the economy had slowed down from a reasonable 3.5 per cent per annum in 1920 - 21 , to 1.5 per cent in 1926 .
The impetus of a backlog of demands on consumer durables , and new industries under tariff protection , had spent themselves by 1926 .
The government offensive
The ruling party throughout the 1920s was a combined Nationalist and Country Party coalition under Bruce .
Factional interests and personality clashes meant that Bruce 's government was a precarious one .
It was never solid within itself .
That problem was largely negated by the absolute ineffectiveness of Labor as an opposition to Bruce .
In pure parliamentary politics the ALP was an erratic and rather flabby current ; a reflection of its confusion in the debate between the supporters and opponents of the October Revolution .
The Labor bureaucracy just did not know where it stood .
Bruce suffered no such confusion .
He was perfectly unequivocal about where his class interests lay and led off an enthusiastic redbaiting attack on Labor for the 1926 general elections .
In so doing Bruce pioneered the first of many desperate red- scare election campaigns that have been used by the anti-Labor forces .
The 1926 campaign of non-issues was won easily by the Nationalists and Bruce returned for another three years .
The maintenance of " industrial peace " became an obsession with Bruce and his pursuit of this goal ultimately led to his downfall .
The lull in the working class movement between 1922 - 26 ended with the re-election of Bruce and his efforts to shackle labour to increased hours and strengthen the power of the Arbitration Court .
He tried to amend the Crimes Act to deal with militants and also introduced a bill to maintain essential service industries in the event of disputes .
Bruce was never subtle about his sustained attempts to smash unionism .
In doing this , he frightened the parliamentary ALP into submission .
The result was that Scullin threw his support behind the amendments to extend the Commonwealth 's powers in Arbitration .
This was , of course , in harmony with the ALP leadership 's traditional view that instruments such as arbitration were vital to maintaining the neutrality of the state apparatus .
Scullin declared that anyone who opposed the proposed amendments was a " traitor " .
Despite the support of Scullin the amendments were rejected by the majority of Australians in a referendum .
In characteristic style , Bruce , undeterred by this overwhelming rejection of his anti-working - class legislation , proceeded to amend the Arbitration Act in 1928 .
This refusal and an inability to respond to the interests and desires of the majority of the population cost Bruce an election .
In 1929 Labor won in a landslide and Bruce became the first and only Australian Prime Minister to lose his seat .
The end of the 1920s
Although Labor had been eclipsed nationally throughout the 1920s it had enjoyed a resurgence in state politics .
There were Labor governments in all states at various periods during the decade .
But the militancy of the workers ' struggles , particularly the timber workers and coal miners in the last years of the decade took Labor by surprise .
The willingness and audacity of the trade unionists to adopt innovative forms of action , aside from the use of the strike , only drove the Labor bureaucracy back even more firmly to arbitration and reconciliation with the industrial courts .
Under the witch - hunt atmosphere of the Bruce government the workers looked to political Labor for leadership .
Instead , Scullin , and other Labor politicians such as " Red Ted " Theodore responded with support for some of the most reactionary anti-union legislation ever framed in this country .
While ALP parliamentarians carefully avoided the task of leading the working class in a political fight against Bruce , the industrial section of the party made some token efforts to carry on " an unremitting and intensive fight against the arbitration proposals . "
Again , the ACTU effectively sidestepped the key issue by refusing to indicate what form of action should be taken against the amendments .
Thus the way was left open for the Nationalists to protect the NSW coalmine owner John Brown , who had locked out thousands of miners from his colliery .
The refusal of Bruce to prosecute Brown was a triumph for the capitalist offensive , despite the fact that the Brown case finally provoked political Labor into action .
Labor 's return to power was aided by the government 's " pledge to defeat the class struggle " and the ruthless attempts to defeat the seamen 's strike in 1925 by deporting leaders of their union , Tom Walsh and Jacob Johnston .
( Report of the 1921 Commonwealth Conference of the ALP , p 26 )
Out of office for 15 years , Labor had no difficulty in persuading Australians that it would be a step forward from the most reactionary politics of Bruce — it was a negative example , but a good one , and so Australian capitalism entered its most severe crisis — the depression of 1929 - 32 under the Federal Labor government of James Scullin .
5 . The Scullin government , 1929 - 32
Australia 's second major Labor administration was the government of James Scullin .
There were complex changes in the labour movement during the depression of the thirties and these were reflected in internal divisions and splits of the federal Labor Party through the years of the worst crisis Australian capitalism has yet faced .
The economic depression that overwhelmed the advanced capitalist world in the early 1930s was of unprecedented magnitude and intensity .
Australia , involved in the cataclysm , was to be wracked by the most profound social and economic crisis in its history .
It would be difficult to overestimate the significance of the depression for the Australian Labor movement , which proved unable to cope with the formidable challenges it encountered .
Workers ' interests were not successfully defended by either the trade unions or the Labor governments , which were in office in the Commonwealth and three states .
Under the impact of the crisis , the effectiveness of the unions as the basic economic organisations of the working class crumbled and the political labour movement was shattered .
On the other hand , the Communist Party was to become a real force in trade union life .
More than any previous historical example , the fortunes of the Scullin Labor government offer an unparalleled view of the class contradictions that exist within the ALP .
One of the decisive factors in the demise of Scullin was his refusal to take a clear stand on the basic issues of the right to strike , unemployment and welfare , which confronted the whole workforce during the depression .
Scullin at first opted for the opinions of the conservative bankers against the more radical Lang Plan , then under pressure from Labor caucus , adopted a mid-way position .
His vacillation resulted in the desertion of Labor 's supporters , who had looked to the party in the crisis and ended in splitting the ALP from left to right .
In federal politics , Joseph Lyons stepped into the vacuum as the new representative of anti-Labor , and from the left of Scullin Jack Lang emerged to lead the NSW branch of the ALP into direct confrontation with the federal Labor Party .
Prelude to a crisis
In 1929 Labor won its most resounding victory ever in Australian politics .
From a weak and ineffective opposition of 23 in the House of Representatives , Labor defeated the ruling Bruce - Page coalition with an enormous majority .
The general elections of 1929 followed the dissolution of the House of Representatives only , and Scullin faced considerable limitations on his government 's freedom of action .
In the Senate , seven Laborites faced 29 Conservative opponents , and bill after bill was thrown out .
Timidity and an irresponsible satisfaction with the newly won " fruits of office " frittered away the chances of a double dissolution .
So Labor 's office was restricted to negative government rather than effective political power .
In the long run it was this timidity that prevented Labor following up on its most resounding victory ever .
One of the first confrontations of the depression was the Hunter Valley coalmines lockout .
Ted Theodore , as deputy leader of the Labor Party , had promised as part of Labor 's election campaign that the mines would be reopened on the miners ' terms within a fortnight of being elected .
Pressured by the labour movement at large , Scullin could scarcely disavow this promise .
However , upon election , Scullin refused to force the owners to reopen the mines .
The only excuse the Prime Minister could make was that there was no " constitutional means " open to him to ensure a workers ' victory .
Lang advised Scullin to " forget the constitution " , but Scullin did not heed this advice and the mine - owners triumphed .
The NSW industrial working class movement denounced the Labor leader 's treachery and cowardice and thus laid the political basis for the organisational split between the Lang - controlled NSW branch and the centre faction of the federal party , headed by Scullin .
On the other hand the Australasian Council of Trade Unions supported Scullin , his cabinet was undivided and only three members of caucus expressed their opposition to his handling of the coal dispute .
The blatant sellout of the Hunter valley actions was the prelude to many similar concessions to bourgeois public opinion , the press and conservative financial interests , which the Scullin government was prepared to accommodate .
Drift into depression
Political instability and the intensification of class confrontations highlighted the serious problems of the country .
At the same time these immediate conflicts diverted attention away from the worsening international monetary crisis .
The more conservative ( and politically influential ) sections of the bourgeoisie reflected the view that there should be immediate wage cuts .
S.M. Bruce 's pursuit of this policy had been one of the factors in his crushing defeat in 1929 .
Although Bruce had departed , the new Labor government inherited his specially chosen top civil strategists , including the reactionary head of the Commonwealth Bank Board , Sir Robert Gibson .
Scullin 's second major blunder after the sellout of the coal lockout was to retain Gibson as director .
It was Gibson who was behind the move to bring Sir Otto Niemeyer , the British financier , to " solve " the crisis .
Scullin 's sponsoring of Niemeyer ran up against opposition in the federal executive of the ALP , which resolved that " any such wage reduction propaganda would be at the expense and sacrifice of the workers by reducing their wages and living standards " .
( Resolution of the ALP federal executive , adopted October 1930 , cited in L.J. Louis and I.H. Turner , The Depression of the 1930s , p 64 )
By any comparison , the Australian economy fared badly during the depression .
Its fate was in common with all countries where world conditions had encouraged the rapid development of agricultural and pastoral production , and the prosperity of which , therefore , depended to an unusual degree upon the prices of the products of these industries .
Corresponding with this vulnerability was Australia 's newness to the capitalist system , which in times of upswing attracted a considerable flow of capital from abroad .
Even if this inflow had been restrained within the most conservative limits , any sharp fall of prices was likely to impose a severe strain if the efforts to keep up interest payments were to be maintained .
One of the recurrent problems of the Scullin government was its failure to pay the rapidly mounting external debt .
( See C.B Schedvin , Australia and the Great Depression , pp 108ff )
Labor 's attempt to deal with the crisis
Scullin 's subservience to financial orthodoxy had led him to suggest that Labor drop every plank in its platform in order to find a way out of the depression .
Despite the fact that one in three of the workforce was unemployed , despite the creaking welfare and benefits system , Scullin refused to adopt any of the measures of socialisation to which Labor had been committed .
A proposal to put into effect the government 's election promise to nationalise banking was fobbed off as " impractical " .
The crowning disgrace of Labor 's domestic welfare performance in the depression was its decision to cut back pensions and similar payments by 20 per cent in the interests of balanced budgets and reduced costs .
It was the attempt of Labor to core to grips with the crisis that led directly to the development of the three plans of Lang , Theodore and Lyons .
All the plans , despite apparent differences of method , worked for economic stability within the confines of capitalism .
In practice , the Labor governments of the depression sought to promote what they loosely defined as the interests of the people as a whole .
On both state and federal levels they saw their responsibility to " national interests " transcending any allegiance to class interests , notwithstanding the pressure of the union movement .
Despite emergency measures , Australia continued to slip deeper into depression , so that as the months passed it became increasingly apparent that the government could not , or would not , do much in the way of redeeming its election promises .
A hostile Senate and the growing confidence of a right - wing rump in the federal Labor Party reduced the influence of the union movement to wishful thinking .
The Prime Minister bluntly dismissed the unemployment insurance scheme drawn up by the 1930 ACTU Congress as " financially impracticable " and at the Victorian ALP annual conference of the same year , Scullin did not offer any prospect that the workers ' interests would be advanced .
Although the governments ' records and pronouncements were hardly the basis for optimism , the trade unions throughout 1930 continued to assert that determined action on the part of the federal government would check the depression .
Despite tremendous pressures from all quarters of the labour movement , Scullin remained unmoved .
Theodore 's defeat
The personalities of Lyons , Scullin and Theodore dominated the federal Labor cabinet .
Theodore resigned in 1930 as federal Treasurer when the Queensland ( non-Labor ) government set up a royal commission to inquire into the sale of mines at Mungana .
( See W. Denning , Caucus Crisis , p 105 ) .
The commission found that Theodore , while Queensland Premier in 1919 , had conspired with others to defraud the government of £ 30,000 .
Theodore asked for a trial , but this was not granted .
When , however , the Queensland government took action during the following year to recover money from him and his associates , the jury found in Theodore 's favour and he returned to the treasury .
Theodore did not remain in the Labor Party for long as he was one of many Labor MPs to go down in the disastrous 1931 elections .
Theodore was a bitter opponent of the extreme conservatism of Lyons as well as an antagonist of the Lang party machine .
Since he had entered Federal parliament through a safe Labor seat in Sydney , he had been regarded by Lang as a rival for dominance in NSW Labor .
Lang 's determination to destroy
Theodore had drawn Scullin 's cabinet straight into the centre of another NSW faction fight .
Soon after Theodore became treasurer again , the death occurred of the member for East Sydney , a very safe electorate .
The federal and NSW Labor governments began a fierce contest to gain the affection of the Labor vote in this distressed inner-suburban area .
This contest sharpened because it coincided with a premier 's conference on the economic crisis , at which the first battle of the three plans was fought .
Theodore and Scullin devised a plan which was intended to placate Lang , and at first the NSW premier seemed ready to accept .
Lang was not ready , however , to appear to compromise himself in the eyes of the East Sydney rank - and - file militants .
In response to the federal plan , Lang concocted an even more radical economic draft in an effort to stem the rising combativity of the Sydney working class .
Lang eventually won the fight to represent Labor in East Sydney , and E.J. Ward thus entered the House of Representatives , whereupon Scullin ruled that the new member was not eligible to enter the federal ALP caucus .
Ward and some sympathisers then left the party room .
All told , two senators and five members of the House broke away , robbing Scullin of his majority in the lower house .
Eventually a Lang attack on Theodore brought down the Scullin government , the five Langites in the House joining hands with the conservative opposition ( For details see J.R. Robertson , Scullin as Prime Minister , in The Great Depression in Australia , ed Robert Cooksey , pp 31 - 32 ) .
Scullin had seriously miscalculated the strength of opposition within the party to Theodore and at the same time failed to recognise the incipient power of the mass workers ' movement that was developing behind Lang .
Lang used the militancy of the workers as a lever for bargaining with Scullin .
Within a few months , the extraparliamentary movement of unemployed and oppressed workers was making its own impression inside the federal cabinet .
Whereas a non-Labor government could sit in relative isolation from the demands of the workers ' movement , Scullin could not .
Bereft of a viable alternative , the workers ' aspirations remained directly focused upon the Labor government in Canberra .
By the end of his office it was not the conservative financiers that dogged Scullin , but the mass movement of workers , which had thrust him into power only 20 months previous .
By March 1931 the NSW ALP executive had been expelled by a special interstate ALP conference and soon there were to be two rival Labor parties in NSW .
Confusion in the party
As mid 1931 approached , the federal government was faced with the prospect of imminent defeat .
Workers were being informed by Scullin and other Labor leaders that the bottom had been reached , but the way out was clouded by the bitter differences of opinion over financial policy that were convulsing the movement .
As a correspondent in the Labor Call complained :
Despite the desperate position of the nation and the sufferings of hundreds of thousands of unemployed , half a dozen schools of thought within the Labor camp are broadcasting their opinion vehemently , bewildering most of their supporters and rendering it almost impossible for the average elector to thread the maze of conflicting policies .
( Labor Call , April 30 , 1931 )
Lang 's plan adopted
In the end it was the simple , yet economically naive , plan of Lang that was to be taken up by the Labor movement .
At the core of Lang 's proposals were the reduction of interest on government borrowings and the abolition of the gold standard .
The essence of Theodore 's plan was " the creation of additional bank credit , concurrently with reductions in government expenditure , and a reduction of costs in industry .
( Cited in L.J. Louis , Trade Unions and the Depression , p 91 )
The attempt by Labor to cope with the 1930s depression produced many strange theories of international monetary plots .
More often than not the theories of " money power " ascribed the world 's ills to the " nefarious operations " and " selfish incompetence of financiers " .
( Cited in L.J. Louis , Trade Unions and the Depression , p 91 )
Not only did such beliefs conjure up conspiratorial ideas on the functioning of capitalist society , they also facilitated the rise of a new wave of economic nationalism .
Once more high tariff rates and protection became the cornerstone of the ideology and politics of the Labor leadership .
But this time , the faith of Labor caucus in its national role was virtually ignored by the thousands of unemployed and starving unionists who now sought the apparently more radical solutions of the Lang Labor Party .
6. Lang and the 1930s
J.T. Lang is unique in the rather tepid and uninspiring history of the Australian working - class movement , and indeed , in Australian politics .
For three vital years ( 1930 - 33 ) Lang held the most powerful industrial and political combination of Labor forces in the palm of his hand .
Within his own stronghold of NSW , Lang dominated Labor politics for the entire 1930s .
It was not until 1939 that he was successfully removed from the leadership of the NSW Labor Party , or " Lang Labor Party " as it was known .
Apart from this unparalleled political strength , Lang was possessed of a strong character and even a ( somewhat limited ) dosage of charismatic leadership .
In part , this charisma has been mythologized over the years by Lang 's estrangement from the official Labor movement and also reinforced in his own writings since the depression .
The three major works Why I Fight , The Turbulent Years and The Great Bust , offer no special historical insights , although sections of each can be valuable , and generally serve the doubtful purpose of clouding and mystifying the actual role played by Lang .
These books , as Lang himself later admitted , were and still remain , valuable tools in concretising his figure as some sort of legend , albeit a minor one .
Lang and the depression
No matter how large the person of Lang emerges in this period , it should be stressed that it is not Lang himself but the social forces on which he drew for support that are significant .
The real actors in this scene are the militant rank - and - file ALP activists , the organisers of the unemployed and , of course , the workers and unemployed themselves .
At the height of his power Lang could have led the NSW working class in any direction he chose .
In the final analysis it was the path to parliamentary solutions , not revolutionary conclusions that Lang decided upon .
Behind the rhetoric of " financial imperialism " and " foreign masters " lay a new sort of revolution which " has come — is being fought , and will continue a little into the future .
It has come without our streets being barricaded , without the accompaniment of fire - arms , but in the way the Labor movement has always said it would come , by Act of Parliament . "
( Sydney Morning Herald , October 5 , 1931 )
The promise of socialism through " act of parliament " was used time and time again by Lang to pacify and redirect workers at his meetings who were calling to be armed .
It was in this sense that Lang was more valuable to the conservative powers than their hysterical attacks on him were willing to acknowledge .
For three years he consciously pushed back and rechanneled the fundamentally revolutionary demands of the mass of workers by a skilful combination of demagogic populism and caution .
Lang threw up a veritable smokescreen of non-issues to divert the dynamics of the workers ' movement .
As Robert Cooksey has illustrated in his study , Lang and Socialism , he could " cancelise the motions of his audience " .
Lang 's populism has been best preserved in part of a speech that he gave to the opening session of the 1931 Easter Conference of the NSW branch of the ALP .
" The Labor movement in this state requires more solidarity than ever before .
We must press on our ( socialist ) objective and do it quickly .
You must get out among the people ; you must point out to them the benefit of socialisation , you must make them ready to receive it . "
( April 3 , 1931 , cited in Cooksey , Lang and Socialism )
All the strength of the Labor premier 's rhetoric appeared as a favourable contrast to the time - serving vacillation of the Federal Labor government under Scullin .
Sitting in the audience at the 1931 Easter conference were men and women who took Lang 's invitation to socialisation seriously , and who proceeded to organise themselves along the lines of " socialisation units " .
The growth of these units within the Labor Party was so rapid and their influence so far - reaching that ultimately they struck at the basis of Lang 's power .
Socialisation Units
In its original form , the movement for unconditional nationalisation of all basic industries was to be a limited propaganda campaign .
The aim of this campaign was simply " to propagate the objective of the Labor Party , ie the Socialization of Industry " ( Labor Daily , May 6 , 1930 ) .
One of the basic functions of the directing committee was that it was a weapon against Theodore , who had once loomed as a rival to Lang in NSW .
The educative role of the committee boosted its more overt political aim of frightening the federal Labor caucus .
While the Socialisation Units were firmly in the grip of the Lang machine , the concept of socialism was a conveniently far - off objective , although just close enough to worry Scullin .
However , for thousands of rank - and - file of the party , the units were seen as serious organisations fighting for an immediate objective .
The emergence of the Socialisation Units in 1931 as potential tools of mass struggle was a clear challenge to Lang 's control .
Their growth outside the context of the Lang machine illustrated the willingness of Labor supporters to rally around an alternative , anti-capitalist leadership within the party itself .
Lang 's reputation as a radical , partly derived from his initial sponsoring of the units , was not justified by his subsequent rejection of them .
By mid-1931 , units had been formed in most urban and semi-urban party branches , each group a potential opposition to Lang 's leadership .
The salient weakness of the units ' organisation was their failure to establish stronger union links , particularly at the factory level .
Had the units been seriously organised in the trade union movement , the outcome of the struggle against Lang may have been different .
The units and the Communist Party
In line with the general ultraleftist turn taken by the Stalinised Comintern in 1929 ( known as the Third Period ) , the CPA had altered its moderately sectarian appraisal of the ALP to one of extreme hostility .
Local Communists denounced the Labor Party as " social fascist " and exhorted the workers to create their own " independent " organisations .
This turn away from the mass working class party left the CPA stranded at the most crucial time .
Instead of working within the ALP , they stood outside and were largely ignored .
The CPA 's denunciation of federal Labor as being " social fascist " was matched only by its characterisation of Lang and the Socialisation Units as " left social fascist " .
According to the twisted logic of the Communist Party , the left social fascism of Lang and the units was even worse than the unadulterated social fascism of Scullin .
To the CPA , Lang was a cunning master of deception , whose trickery of the workers was only exceeded by that of the Socialisation Units themselves .
The failure to separate the units from Lang cost the CPA thousands of potential recruits .
This was despite the fact that certain central leaders of the units , notably Tom Payne , were quite sympathetic to the CPA .
( Payne eventually joined the CPA .
The other key leaders were McNamara and Kilburn , both active in and around socialist groupings for some years .
Donald Grant , another unit leader , was one of the famous IWW 12 . )
Throughout the depression , the Communist Party 's principal influence had been in the Unemployed Workers Movement , and its offshoot , the Workers Defence Corps , which offered physical resistance to evictions and the withdrawal of essential services for debt .
In some cases desperate fighting took place between the anti-eviction committees and police .
( Sydney Morning Herald , June 20 , 1931 , cited in Turner and Louis , The Depression of the 1930s , p 116 ) Nonetheless , the sensationalism of these actions was no substitute for the mass work that was required to lead significant sections of the workforce away from the dead - end of Langism .
Unbeknown to the Communist Party , the Socialisation Units were the organs through which such an alternative could have been posed .
The demise of the units
For two years the Socialisation Units formed the strongest left formation that has ever existed within the ALP .
Whereas in the past socialist groupings had skirted the fringes of the Labor Party , usually devoid of any impact , the units constituted an effective socialist left .
The main reason behind their success lay in the depression and the crisis of Australian capitalism .
In such a period , the way became open for an alternative to the reformist solutions of traditional leadership .
When one in every three unionists in NSW was unemployed , the units were seen by workers as a way out of the " chaotic miseries capitalism had forced them into " .
( Labor Daily , July 24 , 1931 )
Despite their mass organisation , the units failed , partly through a lack of programmatic clarity and partly because of their weakness within the unions .
The units were eventually severed from the Labor Party at the 1933 Easter conferences .
Lang had reacted violently to their action - orientated program , but it was only when they posed a real threat to his machine that he cut them off .
After the dissolution of the local units , some members joined the Communist Party , others remained inside the ALP , most returned to grey mass of political apathy from which only the great depression and the Socialisation Units had drawn them .
The fall of the Lang government
The short - lived influence of the Socialisation Units corresponded to a general political upheaval in NSW during 1930 - 33 .
In 1930 , Lang won his second term of office as Premier of NSW , after a short , unspectacular period of government from 1925 - 27 .
His first term as premier had produced some indication of his radicalism through a number of reforms in the interests of unions , and new social services .
It was in this period that Lang built up a considerable following in the official union leadership , enough even , to defeat an attempt to remove him from the position of parliamentary leader .
Later , many unionists came to regret this support , when they found it impossible to dislodge Lang from the NSW executive .
There was none of Lang 's aggressive reformism in his policy speech for the 1930 general elections .
It was in fact a surprisingly conservative effort .
The elections were held on October 25 , and Labor was returned with 55 of the 90 seats , obtaining 55 per cent of the total vote .
The result was a personal victory for Lang against the diminishing fortunes of the federal Labor government .
At the conference of Commonwealth and state leaders , held in Canberra in February 1931 , Lang unsuccessfully moved that the Australian governments " pay no further interest to British bondholders until Britain had dealt with the Australian overseas debts in the same manner as she settled her own foreign debt with America " .
( Shann and Copland , The Battle of the Plans ) Lang 's proposal was opposed by Commonwealth treasurer Theodore , whereupon the NSW premier introduced legislation to reduce interest payable within NSW to 3 per cent , and then on April 1 , 1931 , defaulted on payments to British bondholders .
Theodore retaliated by withholding Commonwealth finances to NSW and sued the government of NSW for refusing to pay the bondholders .
After the defeat of the Scullin government , the dispute continued with the new Commonwealth ministry under Lyons .
By a process of retaliation and counter - retaliation the conflict between NSW and the Commonwealth came to a head .
Finally the Commonwealth pressured the governor of NSW not to sign one of Lang 's more radical financial policies , which provided for the state to acquire unpaid mortgages , as well as directing civil servants not to collect Commonwealth revenue .
When Lang refused to withdraw this piece of legislation , he was asked to resign , but he declined .
The governor 's response to this refusal was to dismiss Lang , and Lang quickly withdrew , obviously frightened at the revolutionary forces he had unleashed .
In the absence of an alternative leadership to Lang , the massive class movement he had set in motion floundered and was left without direction .
In his memoirs Lang rather belatedly claims he had considered extraparliamentary action .
However , he goes on to say : " I was not willing to risk the creation of a situation resulting in bloodshed , particularly as the Commonwealth would have its forces fully armed and our supporters would largely be the unemployed , without weapons of any kind . "
Thus Lang has persisted with the myth that he considered a mobilisation of the working class .
He is more honest when he admits that " rather than risk civil war and have bloodshed in the streets of Sydney , I decided to accept the dismissal " .
( J.T. Lang , The Turbulent Years , pp 208-209 )
Labor in the 1930s
It is often stated that the Great Depression did not end in 1933 , but continued to the Second World War .
For the majority of Australians this was true ; their lives were visibly unaltered from the days of 1929 - 32 .
Unemployment remained at a steady 8 - 10 per cent throughout the 1930s , and productivity and output remained stagnant at a little above depression levels .
Only in capital inflow and outflow was there anything like a recovery to the norm of the mid-1920s .
Even so , this largely superficial recovery was exploited by the government and press as propaganda that " an end was in sight " .
But for the majority of Australians , the depression did not end until after the war .
As far as the Labor party was concerned , it faced yet another decade of reconstruction and realignment after the shattering blows it had been dealt in the depression .
In NSW the newly constituted Federal Labor Party fared miserably against the Lang party .
In federal parliamentary politics , Labor was outmanoeuvred by the Lyons United Austalia Party — the anti-Labor bloc of the 1930s .
At the 1934 elections Scullin made little impact on the position of the Labor opposition .
The instability of the ALP 's parliamentary group was compounded by the nagging presence of nine Lang supporters , led by J.A. Beasley , who functioned as the only effective Labor opposition until 1935 .
In 1935 Scullin resigned from leadership of the ALP , and was replaced by John Curtin , who saw it as his task to reconstruct the Labor Party as " a popular movement , not a class movement " ( Cited in H. McQueen , Glory Without Power , in Australian Capitalism , ed Playford and Kirsner ) .
Again the catchcry became national unity .
So Curtin fought the 1937 elections on the basis of Australia 's defences , arguing more fervently than the UAP for air and sea power for Australia .
This belief by Curtin and successive Labor leaders in the ALP 's destined role as a party of national unity , has always been a focal point of the ideology of official Labor .
In a working - class party so imbued with parliamentary traditions as the ALP , it was the commitment to a " national destiny " that enabled the parish pump politics of Curtin ( and for that matter Lang ) to function on the broader stage of Australian and international politics .
7 . The Curtin government , 1941 - 45
Australia in 1939
World War
Two was the most significant turning point in Australian economic and social history .
Throughout the 1930s the Australian economy remained fundamentally linked to the British economy through markets , equipment imports and capital flow .
But by 1945 , due to a series of military and political circumstances , plus the virtual break - up of the British economy in the war , the way had been paved for the United States to enter as the dominant foreign power .
Describing this change one observer has noted : " In the long period from the 1890s to the Second World War , the economic performance of Australian capitalism had been erratic and spotty ...
The understanding of capitalism held by Australian socialists was identified with unemployment , widespread poverty and the failure to meet even the most elementary needs of the masses . "
( K. Rowley , The Political Economy of Australia Since the War , in Australian Capitalism , ed Playford and Kirsner )
The basic groundwork for the stability and growth of the economy since the war was laid in the years 1941 - 45 by the Labor government of John Curtin .
To understand Labor 's role in the strengthening of Australian capitalism during the war years it is helpful to outline the main features of the economy on the eve of the war .
In 1939 Australia 's economy was still largely dependent for its export income on primary production .
Even so , this sector was handicapped by drought over much of northern and central Australia 's wool - growing areas , and by a growing glut in the world wheat market .
Mining , after the gold boom of the early 1930s , was tending to level out .
The promise of building up an overseas trade in iron ore was thwarted in 1938 by a federal embargo on its export .
Manufacturing , although still protected by high tariffs , contributed only a modest share to the gross income .
Unemployment , although much lower than at the worst of the depression , still stood at 8 - 9 per cent in 1938 - 39 .
And in parliamentary politics , the colourless leadership of the ruling United Australia Party ( UAP ) passed from J.A. Lyons to R.G. Menzies .
Labor 1937 - 39
The Australian Labor Party emerged from the sustained depression of the 1930s , badly battered , disunited and incapable of asserting its traditional political hegemony over the working - class movement .
This weakness was reflected by the federal party 's poor performance throughout the latter half of the 1930s , when it remained in opposition to the relatively stable anti-Labor bloc under Lyons .
Despite a shaky unity on the federal level , political Labor suffered from the continued existence of spilt - off groups in South Australia and in New South Wales .
In South Australia a left - wing formation opposed federal leader Curtin 's attitude towards defence in the form of " collective security " , thus necessitating the adoption of multiple Labor endorsements in disputed electorates .
( G. Sawer , Australian Federal Politics and Law , ed Playford and Kirsner , p 265 ) The New South Wales position was far more complex .
By 1937 J.T. Lang and his followers were recognised by the federal party as the legal executive , but their position was challenged by a progressive left group , the Industrial Labor Party , which included , many sympathisers of the old socialisation units , as well as members of the Communist Party .
The factional situation inside NSW Labor was exacerbated by the appearance of J.A. Beasley 's Non-Communist Labor Party .
This latter group was comprised largely of remnants of the moderates who had been faithful to Scullin in 1931 and who were now embittered by the federal executive 's decision to recognise the Lang faction .
( See L.F . Crisp , Ben Chifley , chapter VII )
Curtin , aware of the delicate balance of forces over which he presided , took to the centre .
As Dr J.F. Cairns ( minister for overseas trade in the Whitlam government ) expressed it : " Curtin was able to find sufficient important issues on which left and right agreed .
Curtin left the impression that the other important issues would , if this were done , soon find their place on the agenda " .
( J.F. Cairns in the foreword to Irene Downing 's Curtin of Australia , p vii )
One issue that Curtin could not avoid by his policy of attempted reconciliation between right and left was international affairs .
In place of conflicting policies over domestic management that had divided the radicalism of Lang from the conservatism of Scullin , Labor now faced alternative foreign policies of isolationism and involvement .
Curtin maintained that a strong air and naval force could make Australia the " policeman of the Pacific " .
By contrast , the traditional Labor left advocated a strongly neutralist posture .
An indication of the potential schisms that could have erupted over international events in the late 1930s was the conflict inside the party over the Spanish Civil War .
Curtin confided that he was quite prepared to openly support a Republican Spanish government , but the intensity of feeling among the left wing and the Catholic right " all pointed to one moral : that unity depended on avoiding the issue of the Spanish Civil War " .
( E. Andrews , Australian Labor and Foreign Policy , 1935 - 39 , in Labor History , No 9 , p 27 ) One word on Spain , Curtin admitted , would split Labor from top to bottom .
The Communist Party and political instability 1939 - 41
Australia 's neocolonial ties with Britain were still firm enough for Menzies to announce on the day following Britain 's declaration of war on Nazi Germany that Australia was also at war .
The first two years of the conflict were highly unstable ones in Australian politics .
With the UAP rapidly destroying itself , the parliament went through four successive ministries formed either by Menzies or the Country Party leader A.W. Fadden .
Finally , the UAP coalition crumbled in October 1941 and the first Labor government for nearly 10 years took office .
One of Menzies ' first tasks after the declaration of war had been to move against the extra- parliamentary working - class organisations .
An atmosphere of anti-communist , " fifth columnist " hysteria was created , using the Stalin - Hitler pact as a pretext for banning the Communist Party .
The ban , imposed by the first Menzies government in June 1940 ,

We owe our lives to trees .
Trees provide far more than furniture and fuel .
Everyone finds forests to be beautiful , but not many know how hardworking forests really are .
The world ’s great forests help make our planet hospitable to life ; they purify the air , manage nutrients , capture greenhouse gases , create soil , regulate wind and ocean currents , house two - thirds of the world ’s plant and animal species , cool the globe , provide subsistence or jobs to 1.6 billion people , and even play a role in weather systems .
And yet , the world ’s forests are critically threatened .
Though , like amazing threatened species , there are hundreds of endangered forests and other beautiful aspects of nature , the following forests are visually stunning , ecologically precious , unique and simply wondrous and you do n’t have to go vegan to help them out .

Yes , that Sherwood Forest .
What was once a thick and dark mass of trees covering 100,000 acres is now a spartan 450 acres .
Intense harvesting of the forest ’s massive , ancient oaks for several centuries is the cause of the deforestation of this legendary woodland .
Outcrops of Sherwood ’s trees exist beyond the 450 acres but are not dense enough to be considered intact forest .

2. Cork Bark Forest
The odd and distinctive cork bark forest of the Mediterranean is a case where industry actually preserves this unique biome .
In fact , the advent of the screw - top wine stopper is the cork bark forest ’s greatest threat .
As vintners switch from cork plugs to alternative wine stoppers , millions of hectares of cork forest will be cut and replanted with other more viable crops ; the loss of jobs to the cork bark industry would be another side effect .
Experts say we will lose cork forests in the next decade if the wine industry continues to turn to alternative corks .
Cork oaks are really fascinating ; they can be “ shorn ” , much like sheep , for many years with proper maintenance .
Without market incentive , though , these forests may fall into disrepair or be cleared all together .

3. The Christmas Tree
The unique Fraser Fir , better known as the original Christmas tree for its iconic , plump cone shape , has been struggling with a pestilent insect called the adelgid since the 1950s .
( The adelgid eats the tree down to the bare wood , leaving swaths of naked branches behind . )
Most of what is left of the Fraser Fir in nature can be found in the majestic Great Smoky Mountain National Park .

4. Appalachian Hemlock Forests
Several states are home to the Appalachian Hemlock , which is threatened by the woolly adelgid .
This forest is in New Hampshire .
In North America , a range of factors threatens the 155 national forests , with at least a dozen being critically endangered ( some experts consider the number to be closer to 30 ) .
Forests are at risk due to the following factors : pestilence , invading species , human activity and climate change .
Human activities such as mining , logging , air and groundwater pollution , noise pollution , deforestation , clear - cutting , the “ island effect ” and other poor silviculture methods have the greatest impact .
( The “ island effect ” involves breaking up forests into smaller sections , as in the case of Sherwood Forest . )
5 . The Cloud Forests
Cloud forests , or montane forests , are unlike any others .
Known as “ nature ’s water towers “ , cloud forests play a unique role in evaporation and precipitation , helping to purify both water and air .
Not only do these forests supply fresh water to nearby residents , they contain some of the most amazing biodiversity on earth .
Most cloud forests are found in Asia and Central America , but they ’re particularly threatened in Central America .
In places like Guatemala , where 40 % of the water comes from the cloud forest , preservation is essential .
Though cloud forests are located around the world , Guatemala is emblematic of the cloud forest problem because its national symbol , the Resplendent Quetzal , is in danger of extinction as its habitat continues to be destroyed by logging , non-native species , development and climate change .
( These fantastic images are from Costa Rica ’s Monteverde Reserve , Guatemala , and Ecuador ’s Los Cedros cloud forest . )

6. The California Old - Growth Forests
The famous redwood forests of Northern California are home to some of the largest , oldest trees on earth .
In 2008 , much of these old - growth areas , including stands of massive redwoods , continue to be sold to industry .
If you are interested in further information , read about 10 recent sales of old - growth forest that have concerned researchers and scientists .
7. The Tongass : the Only Coastal Temperate Rainforest
The Tongass is one of the world ’s only temperate rainforests ( the Hoh in Washington State is another ) .
Many Americans have been surprised to learn that the United States is home to a tropical rainforest – and even more surprised to learn that its virgin trees are being rapidly logged for the production of goods exported to Asia .
The Tongass is truly a wonder – at 17 million acres , it is the largest forest in the United States and the only coastal rainforest remaining in North America .
8. The Inland Rainforest
Did you know there ’s a rainforest in the frigid inner reaches of Canada ?
400 miles away from the coast of British Columbia , the Inland Rainforest is home to the unique mountain caribou .
Environmental challenge : 1/3 of the caribou have been wiped out since 2001 as clear - cutting continues to affect the Inland Rainforest .

9 . The Great Bear Rainforest
Covering most of the West Coast of Canada , the 15 - million acre Great Bear Rainforest was once severely threatened .
A landmark agreement to guarantee protection of 5 million acres of this forest was made in 2006 , and efforts are being made to protect all 15 million acres .
This is a welcome example of a positive development in forest conservation .
Trivia :
Did you know that just 14 of the world ’s countries are home to 92 % of its forests ?

10 . The Daniel Boone National … Tree Farm
The Forest Service has been working to convert the historic Daniel Boone forest to a regulated tree farm .
While forestry leaders have always had to balance the interests of development and industry with those of conservation activists and scientists , scientists believe the environmental costs of such an initiative would be too great .
When forests are cut down , not only are working greenhouse conversion “ factories ” destroyed , but the harvesting process itself creates millions of tons of carbon dioxide pollution .
And when monocultures of rapidly - growing tree species replace these organic , diverse forests , the ecological impact is often severe .

11 . Oregon Heritage Forests
Some of the last remaining pristine virgin forests in North America are in Oregon .
Perhaps the most famous is the grand Siskiyou forest tract .
Current status : the Bush Administration has faced criticism because it has supported the timber industry ’s interests , both in litigation and with the Healthy Forests Initiative .
The facts : 90 % of these heritage forests are gone forever ; of the 10 % ( 2 million acres ) remaining , the logging industry is hoping to gain greater access to 40 % of what remains ( 800,000 acres ) .
These heritage forests have been somewhat protected under the existing Northwest Forest Plan ; logging is still permitted but the attempt is made to manage the logging in a way that is sustainable .
Oregon may be a less worrisome example than others , however .
According to leading organizations , many of earth ’s forests are critically threatened .
A report by the United Nations found that the world loses 13 million hectares of forest every year .
( That ’s 36 football fields every minute , every day . )
Perspective : 30 % of the world is still covered in forest ; but less than 8 % of this land is protected .

12 . South America : the Murici Reserve
South America contains most of the planet ’s tropical rainforests , although tropical rainforests are found around the world .
( Forests are classified as tropical , temperate , boreal , and montane ; they simply follow latitude .
Forests nearest the equator , then , are tropical .
The one exception is the montane or “ cloud ” forest , which is determined by altitude . )
South America , particularly Brazil , has come to symbolize the controversy over forest management .
There have actually been some encouraging success stories , such as in Bolivia , where most of the forested regions are now protected and managed sustainably .
But despite public awareness of tropical rainforest deforestation in South America , and a handful of remarkable success stories , the reality remain complex .
( Biofuel development has been controversial to say the least . )
The infamous “ slash and burn ” tactic is responsible for billions of tons of carbon dioxide output , harm to indigenous peoples , and reduced biodiversity .
Unemployment , economic troubles , and global demand spur the conditions .
For example , in one of the most fragile forests , the Murici Reserve , locals are caught between trying to live off the land and preserve the forest .
They grow seedlings in an independent attempt to replace what has been logged ; but they are given little federal assistance and without tenable employment opportunities their situation is as precarious as that of the forests .
13 . Mau Forest Complex
Mau is one of the world ’s most ancient forests .
It is threatened by agricultural and residential encroachment .
The 400,000 acre preserve in Kenya is seriously endangered – and at present the government is trying to kick tens of thousands of squatters off of it .
This is a global challenge .
Poor communities struggling with unemployment , civil unrest or war , and inadequate resources are often forced to use the endangered forests to survive .

14 . The Strangest Forest on Earth
Chile is home to some of the most bizarre forestland on earth .
Trees exist there that grow nowhere else .
The alerce is a tree that lives over 3,000 years ; the “ monkey puzzle tree ” has some of the quirkiest features around .
Current status : the logging industry wants to convert most of this forest to tree farms ; plans are in the works to increase the tree farm range from 5 million to 10 million acres over the next 12 years .
In short , South America is plagued with forest management issues .
Trivia :
Half of the world ’s tropical rainforests are gone , accounting for 25 % of the annual greenhouse gas figure .

15 . Down Under
Australia is home to some beautiful forests .
The Blue Gum High Forest and the Sydney Turpentine Ironbark Forest are both listed as critically threatened .
Together they comprise fewer than 230 hectares .
The major threats to these forests are development and sheep grazing .
Both forests contain some amazing and beautiful tree species .
16 . Weld River Valley
In Southern Tasmania , the Weld River Valley is home to great old - growth forests that look like something out of another era .
Loggers have continued to encroach upon the forest , and tensions have been high in recent years , leading to protests and incidents of violence .
Political gridlock and fraud by industry have been defining characteristics of the fight to preserve the Weld River Valley .
The upper region is protected but the lower virgin forest is still being logged .
17 . The Sierra Nevada
California ’s Sierra Nevada provides 60 % of the state ’s drinking water and is an important carbon sink for the entire planet .
Like many North American forests , it is threatened by pests , fire , development , logging , off - road vehicle use , and mining interests .
18 . North American Boreal Forest
The North American Boreal Forest is one of the grandest forests in the world .
It stretches from Alaska to the Atlantic Ocean , sweeping through Canada and parts of the United States .
Unfortunately , it is threatened by none other than junk mail and catalog companies .
The Boreal Forest holds more carbon than any other ecosystem on earth ( second only to the oceans ) , purifies most of the world ’s air , and holds the largest stores of freshwater anywhere on earth .
Yet only 8 % is protected and it is logged at the rate of 2 acres a minute , 24/ 7 .
Half of the Boreal has already been destroyed as it is transformed from tree to junk mail and displaced to the landfill .

19 . Mauna Kea and Kilauea
Forest land around these two volcanoes is threatened by invading tree species , namely the tropical ash and the Canary Island fire tree .
The slow - growing native species can’t compete , and now nearly half of this Hawaiian forest is comprised of non-native species .
20 . Papua New Guinea : Gone in 13 Years ?
PNG is the subject of intense study by scientists and conservationists .
A recent joint study with PNG and Australia found that the PNG rainforests may be gone in as little as 13 years .
PNG is losing 1.4 % of its forestland every year .
Some pretty creative solutions are on the table .
One idea would involve a viral internet campaign that would pay villagers to prevent forest being logged .
There are dozens of additional threatened forests around the world , from unusual micro-biomes to the taiga to Russia to Africa and beyond .
This post is an introduction to the wonder of forests – and seeks to highlight how important they truly are .

AS A special - forces agent in the French Navy , Michel Malalo has clandestinely entered several African countries by sea to extract endangered French nationals .
Almost all the enemy fighters he encountered carried the AK - 47 , a widely used assault rifle renowned for its rugged reliability .
But the AK - 47 has a serious drawback : glint , which gave Mr Malalo an advantage in firefights .
Made with steel , the AK - 47 reflects light .
“ It 's flashy — and from afar , ” says Mr Malalo , who took advantage of glint giveaways when shooting at the enemy .
Mr Malalo , who left the special forces uninjured six years ago , says the French assault rifle , the Famas , is superbly non-reflective even in bright light .
Developing new metal alloys to reduce rifle glint is just one facet of the effort to develop better camouflage , concealment and deception technologies that is under way at defence contractors , military research bodies and university laboratories .
Most of this research is being conducted in America and Europe .
Much is classified .
The results are often remarkable .
Even the most common form of camouflage — the coloured patterns printed onto combat fatigues — is being given a high - tech twist , as designers work with new software that incorporates neuroscientists ' understanding of human vision .
Pattern - generation software analyses a large number of photographs of a given theatre of operations .
By crunching meteorological data on typical lighting and visibility conditions , combined with information about the colours and predominance of shapes visible in cities , fields and wilderness areas , the software proposes new , improved patterns .
“ It really does get technical , ” says Réjean Duchesneau , a lieutenant - colonel with NATO in Casteau , Belgium , who helped design a Canadian camouflage pattern called CADPAT .
Some camouflage designers , including those at America 's Army Research Laboratory , also study the reflective and light - absorbing properties of materials common to an area , such as sand , cement and foliage .
As well as being used by the camouflage - generation software , this information is used to manufacture fabric inks with the desired optical properties .
Similar software optimises colours and patterns for vehicles and aircraft .
The ability to customise camouflage for particular theatres has increased the use of temporary camouflage , which is painted on hardware before missions and washed off afterwards .
For decades most fatigues , now referred to as battledress uniforms , incorporated wiggly patterns of solid colours known as tiger stripes .
But research in the field of “ clutter metrics ” — the study of how well observers locate and identify objects — has recently discredited tiger stripes .
With the help of eye - tracking devices that follow iris movements to determine where subjects are looking , researchers have determined that fabrics with small squares of colour , known as pixels , are harder to see .
These new pixel patterns are now worn by many Western armies , including those of the United States , Britain , Canada , France and Germany .
Canada has improved its camouflage so much in recent years that to spot soldiers in some conditions , observers must be 40 % closer than they would have to have been in 2000 .
“ Adaptive ” camouflage that changes rapidly in response to the environment is also in the works .
TNO , a Dutch defence contractor based in Soesterberg , is using thin , textile - like plastic sheets embedded with light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) .
A small camera scans the environment , and the colours and patterns displayed on the sheet are changed accordingly .
The material is not yet flexible enough to be worn comfortably by soldiers , but it is being tested in Afghanistan with Saab Barracuda , a Swedish maker of camouflage equipment .
Pieter Jacobs , TNO 's chief technologist , says the defence ministries of Canada , Germany and the Netherlands , which have funded the development of the technology , consider such “ chameleon ” sheeting to be an urgent requirement .
Maarten Hogervorst , a vision neuroscientist at TNO , says its performance is formidable .
A tank draped with the sheeting and parked in front of a grassy slope displays an image of grass on its exposed side , for example .
Another kind of adaptive camouflage is based on flexible plastic decals .
A small camera , powered by a solar cell , senses the colours and patterns of the surroundings .
The surface of the decal is a crude computer display which then replicates these colours and patterns .
The US Army wants to use this approach to wrap artillery and munitions containers .
Daniel Watts , who leads the project at the New Jersey Institute of Technology ( NJIT ) , says it works well but is still too expensive for battlefield use .
Some like it hot
Concealing things on the battlefield does not just mean hiding them visually .
A lot of research is also being done to reduce thermal signatures , too .
Infra-red and thermal - vision equipment can reveal a soldier 's heat signature at a large distance .
Such equipment is becoming less expensive and is now so readily available that the Taliban in Afghanistan are well equipped with it — unlike a few years ago , says Hans Kariis , a senior technologist at the Swedish Defence Research Agency , a government body in Stockholm .
Fabrics designed to block human heat - signatures are improving rapidly .
John Roos , a retired US Army colonel in Newport News , Virginia , recently observed a night - time test of an infra-red “ stealth ” poncho developed by AAE , a small defence contractor based in Fullerton , California .
It was the most impressive infra-red protection he had seen .
The man disappeared like “ a black void ” , Mr Roos says .
( The head of AAE , Rashid Zeineh , declined to discuss the fabric 's composition . )
America 's existing heat - blocking garments already provide a remarkable combat advantage , says Mr Roos .
They are similar , but inferior , to the AAE stealth poncho , he says .
During some night operations , American soldiers may be heard approaching while remaining concealed in the dark .
“ You can imagine what that would do to enemy morale , ” Mr Roos says .
One way to block body - heat signatures is to use particles called cenospheres — tiny hollow spheres of aluminium and silica that can be woven into fabrics .
A leader in the field , Ceno Technologies , in Buffalo , New York , is developing a cenosphere body - paint for the face and hands which does not block necessary perspiration .
Britain 's Ministry of Defence is testing it .
Researchers at the NJIT , meanwhile , have developed insulating decals that can be applied to hot objects — even firing artillery cannons — to mask their heat signatures .
Even if the heat signature cannot be concealed entirely , decals can be placed so that they alter the signature 's shape .
Mr Watts says his team has been successful in partially insulating tanks so that observers with night vision see the shape of a car .
Illustration by Derek Bacon
This is a useful trick , because entirely eliminating a vehicle 's heat - signature can be extremely difficult .
Intermat , a Greek supplier of concealment materials to defence contractors including British Aerospace , Lockheed Martin and Thales , produces a foam coating that also smothers heat signatures .
Bill Filis of Intermat says that selectively applying a one - centimetre layer of heat - insulating foam can make an armoured personnel - carrier resemble a motorcycle when viewed through thermal - vision goggles .
“ Make him wonder , and this buys you time , ” Mr Filis says .
Some thermal coatings are as thin as a coat of paint , so they can be applied to aircraft .
But warplanes present an additional problem .
When flying high to avoid anti-aircraft fire , white condensation trails , or “ contrails ” , can form “ a giant arrow in the sky pointing to where the plane is , ” says Charles Kolb , chief executive of Aerodyne Research in Billerica , Massachusetts .
Researchers at the firm , which is a contractor to America 's air force , are examining the thermodynamic processes that lead to the formation of contrails , in the hope of reducing them using chemical additives .
Even as people , weapons and vehicles become harder to spot , however , new detection technologies are also being developed .
In the spring of 1999 NATO warplanes flew more than 38,000 sorties over Serbia , in a bombing campaign that succeeded in pushing Serbian forces out of Kosovo .
But surprisingly little damage was done to Serbian materiel .
Duped NATO pilots had destroyed dummy tanks , artillery and other items of military hardware made out of wood and tarpaulins .
Much of Serbia 's real military kit was hidden safely under foliage , which interferes with standard radar .
Engineers at Lockheed Martin , a large American defence contractor , have designed a radar system called FOPEN , short for foliage penetration .
It became operational in 2005 , but still requires further development and is deployed on just one active American warplane so far .
But Lockheed Martin's FOPEN programme manager , Robert Robertson , says the radar “ will see whatever man made ” under a leafy triple canopy , or under netting designed to foil conventional radar systems .
“ Stealth ” aircraft , designed to avoid detection by radar , have been around since the 1970s .
Radar systems illuminate the target with radio waves and then look for reflections , so absorbing incoming radiation , or deflecting it in a totally different direction , can shrink an aircraft 's radar signature dramatically .
Half a dozen countries now build stealth aircraft , at great expense .
A new type of radar system , however , is capable of spotting such aircraft .
It relies on the proliferation of mobile - phone signals .
When a plane flies through an environment filled with such signals , the “ aircraft shadow in this chatter ” becomes visible , says John Pendry , a radar expert at Imperial College in London .
Mike Burns , the president of MSE , a small defence contractor in Billerica , Massachusetts , says stealth bombers have indeed been detected against backgrounds of mobile - phone radiation because “ a hole ” appears in the constant chatter of signals .
This technique can be used only in populated areas , with lots of mobile phones .
But it has an edge over standard radar , in addition to being able to spot previously invisible aircraft .
It is “ passive ” , because it uses ambient radiation to illuminate the target .
This means the target aircraft cannot tell that it is being watched ( whereas it can with traditional radar ) .
In short , it is the radar - detection system , rather than the aircraft , that has become invisible .
It is just the latest example of the arms race between concealment and detection .

They serve the same Queen , fight the same foe and lay down their lives with equal valour and sacrifice .
But when the fallen heroes of Canada and Britain come home , the welcome is very different .
At airbases in both countries there is only sombre respect .
But today
The Mail on Sunday publishes extraordinary pictures that contrast the final road journeys : in Canada , there is a police escort and crowds line the route ; in Britain , the hearses are denied outriders and go unremarked .
Should we show more respect to our returning war dead ?

Shameful : In Canada , ( above ) , roads are cleared and police stand to attention to welcome home fallen heroes .
In Britain , ( below ) hearses carrying our war dead routinely get stuck in traffic without even so much as a police escort
Coffins carrying the Canadian soldiers ' bodies are driven 107 miles from the airbase at Trenton , Ontario , to a coroner 's office in Toronto ; in Britain the trip is 50 miles from RAF Lyneham , Wiltshire , to the morgue at Oxford 's John Radcliffe Hospital .
In Canada the road is cleared and a police escort of several squad cars ensures a smooth passage as onlookers pay tribute and police and fire officers salute .
But in Britain most of the journey is spent ignored and stuck in traffic – because Thames Valley Police refuse to provide an escort as they " focus on community safety rather than ceremonial roles " .
Last night MP Quentin Davies , who is heading a Ministry of Defence study into strengthening public support for Britain 's Armed Forces , labelled the failure to provide an escort for our war dead " despicable " .

Tale of two homecomings : The Canadians , above , were killed by a bomb near Kandahar , Afghanistan .
British Marine David Marsh , 23 , ( below left ) and Lt John Thornton , 22 , were killed while on patrol in Helmand province .
Other Service personnel and police from other Forces concur .
The intensely moving pictures of the Canadian repatriation are being emailed among British soldiers and have been posted on the internet .
Canada currently has 2,500 troops in Afghanistan and has so far lost 82 .
Britain has lost 91 from a total of 7,800 .
The series of pictures includes emotional scenes last year when six Canadian soldiers were flown home .
Captain Jefferson Francis , 36 , Captain Matthew Dawe , 27 , Master Cpl Colin Bason , 28 , Corporal Cole Bartsch , 23 , Corporal Jordan Anderson , 25 , and Private Lane Watkins , 20 , were killed together in their armoured vehicle by a massive roadside bomb near Kandahar .
Along the entire route , on 50 motorway bridges , at roadsides , intersections , on the sides of roads , in fields and even on the central barrier of the busy motorway , local people , firefighters and police stood to attention , Royal Canadian Legionnaires lowered flags and whole families proudly waved " We support our troops " placards .

Sombre : The Canadian heroes , above , arrive at an airbase , while in Britain , below , the dead troops are ceremoniously carried to a hearse at Wootton Bassett
Remember or forget :
In Canada , flag waving crowds cram motorway bridges , above , while the cortege carrying the British soldiers from Wootton Bassett , below , is abandoned in traffic
The spectacle was so striking that the highway , part of which was known as the Queen Elizabeth Way , has now been renamed the Highway of Heroes .
Since then , every body travelling along the Highway of Heroes has been greeted by hundreds of ordinary Canadians who often wait for hours in the bitter Ontario winter to show their respect and support .
Lieutenant Colonel Jim Legere , Provost Marshal for the 1st Canadian Air Division Headquarters , wrote of one such journey in a letter to a Toronto newspaper .
He said : " Although words cannot possibly do justice to this heart - wrenching experience , I thought it important for you to be aware of the overwhelming – and I mean overwhelming – support provided by law enforcement , fire services , ambulance services and , indeed , the public at large , for this very solemn occasion .
" I could not believe my eyes as we made the solemn journey from Trenton to the coroner 's office in Toronto .
" Every on - ramp had a police vehicle blocking traffic , with members standing by the vehicles saluting .
" Entire police detachments stood along the route , saluting in front of their vehicles .

Patriotic :
In Canada , flag waving crowds line the route , while locals honour the British soldiers in Wootton Bassett , below , without a flag in sight
" Fire halls had their trucks out , with their members in full dress uniform out front paying respects to our comrades .
" People stopped their cars along the side of the road , got out and saluted or held their hands over their hearts .
" As we neared downtown , the streets were lined with crowds waving Canadian flags and paying their respects .
" The outpouring of support for our fallen heroes and their families was beyond belief . "
Lt Col Legere 's letter concluded : " Never before have I been as proud to wear this uniform . "

Honour : Former servicemen and women line the streets in Canada to pay their respects , above , and in Britain the hearse passes without notice , below
Highways for Heroes have been designated in other Canadian cities and many people pay their respects when a fallen soldier returns .
Police escorts are the norm .
The spectacle contrasts strongly with the progress of a British cortege which The Mail on Sunday was given special permission to follow earlier this month .
Lieutenant John Thornton , 22 , and Marine David Marsh , 23 , both of 40 Commando Royal Marines , were killed in a vehicle explosion while patrolling in Helmand Province .

Hand on heart : Firefighters stand by the engines to salute the hearse in Canada , but , below , the British hearse is tied down in heavy traffic
Their two black hearses and an empty spare hearse accompanying them were initially escorted by Wiltshire Police .
The cortege first passed through the village of Wootton Bassett where locals , forewarned by the RAF base , gather at the war memorial to pay their respects .
But for much of the rest of the trip to Oxford – where the bodies undergo post - mortems before being returned to their families – the hearses are on their own , led only by an undertaker 's car .
They were cut up by impatient motorists at roundabouts , stuck in traffic and generally ignored by the public , their significance lost because of a lack of the gravitas that a police escort would provide .
The problem has arisen because the Wiltshire Constabulary escort – normally three motorcycle outriders and two patrol cars which stop other traffic along the route – has to " peel off " at the Oxfordshire border where the Thames Valley force area begins .
The corteges then have to fend for themselves on Oxford 's notorious ring - road .
Inspector Mark Levitt of Wiltshire Police has taken up the matter with Thames Valley .

Respect : Scores of police get out of stopped cars as the Canadian soldiers are driven past .
In Britain , below , the streets remain empty
He told The Mail on Sunday : " I phoned one of the road policing managers and asked if they would continue the repatriation escorts to Oxford and he said it was not in their force policy to provide one for this type of thing . "
Insp Levitt , who has helped organise the stops at Wootton Bassett war memorial , added : " We have officers who come in on their days off to help with the escort duties , because they want to show their respects to the young soldiers who died for us and are genuinely touched by the tribute and respect shown by the people of Wootton Bassett .

Salute :
As night falls in Toronto , firefighters stand to attention ahead of the cortege .
In Britain , police peel off at the Thames valley border and go unnoticed
But Thames Valley Police defended their failure to provide an escort .
They say that even before April last year , when RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire rather than Lyneham was used for repatriating war dead , the force provided escorts only if there was an " operational need " , such as large numbers of vehicles , families or people involved .
Assistant Chief Constable Brian Langston claimed that " most of the time " escorts were not required or requested .
" I 've spoken to my counterpart at Wiltshire Police and I understand they provide escorts because of the people involved at the Wootton Bassett events .
" We try to provide what people say are their priorities , and so far that 's been to focus on community safety rather than ceremonial roles . "

A man holds a hand to his heart on the motorway as the Canadian cortege passes , above .
But the British hearse passes without so much as a wave from passers by , below
But Labour MP Mr Davies said : " It is very much to the credit of Wiltshire Police that they are stopping traffic and giving dignity and respect to those who have given their lives to this country .
" I think it is disgusting that the police in Oxfordshire do not do the same . "
Thames Valley Police are , however , well versed in escort duties .
The force operates its own Protection Group which provides security for the Royal Family at Windsor Castle , escorts visiting heads of state and guards the many Government officials and other VIPs who have homes in Berkshire , Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire .
Quentin Davies acknowledged that a Canadian - style Highway for Heroes may not be right for Britain but added : " It is very comforting to the families to know that places like Wootton Bassett have paid direct and specific tribute .
" It is very important to let the public reflect on their sacrifice .
Indeed they [ the families ] might even feel they have been betrayed without it . "
Conservative MP Patrick Mercer , a former Army colonel , said : " This is the latest breach of the military covenant .
" Even in death our men are being scorned .
" The compensation our Servicemen receive is pitiful , the shortages of body armour are scandalous , the way the Government is trying to gag coroners over the death of Servicemen disgusting .
" Now we have this .
All of these things shout of shabbiness . "
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment , claiming it was " a local issue " .
There is something incongruous about the stretch of beach just under the Hilton Hotel 's high perch .
For there , below the bluff , are two so - called " specialty beaches . "
The Hassidic beach , surrounded by an eight - foot concrete wall , features a polite sign at its entrance : Sundays , Tuesdays , and Thursdays are women 's bathing days , it announces .
Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays belong to men .
It 's the municipality 's solution to the ultra - orthodox dilemma of how to body surf without breaking the halachic , Jewish law , prohibition on unmarried members of the opposite sex seeing one another in immodest dress .
At the beach directly adjacent to the walled compound , every day is men's bathing day .
This is the unofficial gay beach .
Tel Aviv , with its warm Mediterranean weather , trendy cosmopolitan feel , and lively nightlife , has , over the past few years , become a hot destination for gay travelers .
But this is also a country where there is no separation between religion and state , and in which the majority of tourists come here for some form of religious experience – which all leads to a rather ambivalent official attitude toward the phenomenon .
According to Thomas Roth , president of Community Marketing Inc. , a San Francisco - based gay market research firm , gay travelers make up 10 percent or more of the travel industry , spending tens of billions of dollars yearly .
They are a valuable niche market , he points out , with higher than average disposable income , and a typically strong interest in both shopping and culture .
While no research has been conducted on gay tourism to Israel specifically , says Mr. Roth , who just returned from his own visit to the country , " …we do know from focus groups and anecdotal conversations with travelers that the destination is growing in appeal . "
Shai Doitsh , head of the gay tourism department at Agudah , Israel 's Association of Gay , Lesbian , Bisexuals , and Transgenders , says that thousands of gay tourists – both independent and groups – have come to Israel this year , infusing the economy with millions of so - called " pink dollars . "
Five years ago , the numbers were in the hundreds .
A decade ago there was virtually no market at all , he says .
But David Katz , a travel agent with Sar - El Tours in Jerusalem , whose main clients are religious pilgrims , points out that evangelical Christians make up the single largest group of tourists to the country , followed by Jewish interest tourists .
According to Ministry of Tourism statistics , some 44 percent of the 2.3 million tourists who came to Israel last year were religious Christians of different denominations .
Highlighting " gay tourism , " says Mr. Katz , could easily unsettle some of the many visitors coming to experience the " land of the Bible . "
" Dealing with gay tourism has to be done in an intelligent and sensitive way , " says Yaniv Poria , a professor in the department of hotel and tourism management at Ben Gurion University in the Negev region and an expert on the subject .
" It is wanted – it 's just tricky .
Like so many things in Israel . "
Part of Israeli's appeal to the gay market , says Roth , is the perception that it's a very liberal , open - minded country .
Sodomy was decriminalized by the Supreme Court 20 years ago ; there are equal opportunity laws protecting workers against discrimination based on sexual orientation ; gays can openly serve in the army , inherit their spouse 's property , and be registered by the government as married .
As of this year , gay Israeli couples are also allowed to adopt children .
But in contrast , Israel also has a history of intolerance toward the sector .
In Jerusalem , the small annual gay pride parade has to be protected by hundreds of police .
Last year , the 2,000 marchers in Jerusalem were threatened and stoned by ultra-Orthodox protesters .
Also last year , the Tourism Ministry was forced to stop its support for a campaign to promote gay tourism after details were published in the local media .
At the time , dozens of religious members of parliament threatened to bring down the government over the campaign , saying such images as one of two young men in skullcaps about to kiss near Jerusalem 's Mount of Olives were offensive .
" This is a delusional campaign for a minority with a normative defect , " Deputy Prime Minister Eli Yishai , from the ultrareligious Shas Party , told reporters .
" Those who fail to recognize Jerusalem 's holiness should stay away from it . "
The government 's solution to such sentiment has led them to take their support for gay tourism into the closet , so to speak .
" [ Like ] other religious countries trying to attract gay tourism , like Spain , the government has turned over marketing to the local level or taken it underground , " says Poria .
What this means , he explains , is that cities are free to market themselves as they see fit , while the country , officially , continues to market a far more traditional set of attractions .
Meanwhile , any official marketing to the gay community is done in a subtle , even unconventional way .
" You will not find [ Israeli Foreign Minister ] Zippi Livni talking about this – but you will see promotional spots for such tourism , supported by the ministry , but not attributed to them , on , say YouTube , " says Poria .
Three years after Subaru introduced America to landfill - free car manufacturing , General Motors has announced plans to turn half of their 181 factories waste - free by 2010 — and they ’ve made the process profitable .
The company explains that while lessening their environmental impact is a main goal , they ’re now seeing realizing a high cash flow from the sale of their recycled materials .
Scrap metal , cardboard , wood , plastic , and oil will be spared from the junk yards that surround 80 of General Motors ’ factories , including 10 in the United States and 33 in Mexico .
The company began its recycling program in 2000 , but its few test projects cost the company $ 32 million to operate , but through streamlining and some creativity , they ’ve moved the program out of the red .
Recycling scrap metal alone already generates a $ 1 billion annual profit and recycling other materials at some plants generated $ 16 million last year , and further profits are expected once the program is fully in place .
While 96 % of the waste will be reused in some way , the remainder of trash will be sent to waste - to - energy facilities .
In a 2007 interview , Ray Tessier , General Motors ’ Global Director of Environmental Services , explained specific avenues the company took in order to decrease the program ’s cost at the first eight plants to use it .
Oil was cleaned by an outside source , and then purchased back at 25 % the cost of new oil ; the steel scraps were used in their own foundries and “ used to make engine blocks , transmission casings and other parts that we use in the power train of our vehicles ; ” and wood pallets to be reused or recycled .

One of my first posts at CodeBetter was in regards to side effects and how , when unmanaged , can be truly evil .
Today , I want to revisit that topic briefly in regards to functional programming and managing side effects .
When I was out in Redmond a couple of months ago , I had the opportunity to sit down with Erik Meijer to discuss functional programming among other topics .
In there , we discussed a number of issues around managing side effects and state in your code , and how both C# and F# do n’t intrinsically support such a concept .
Languages like Haskell , of course do with IO monads and other such monadic structures .
Whether languages such as F# and Erlang are not pure functional programming languages is another matter , due to the fact that you do n’t have to declare when you are side effecting ( reading a database , writing to console , spawning a process , etc ) .
Erik will be giving a talk at JAOO about why functional programming still matters .
I think in the day and age of where Moore ’s law is changing , we need to recognize that functional programming has a unique place in this due to the way that it handles both purity and immutability .
Today , let ’s cover some of those issues when dealing with functional constructs and side effects to see what kind of an impact they can have on us .
The Problem of Purity
In some previous posts , I talked about function purity in regards to things you should keep in mind with a functional mindset .
In order to qualify as such , you need to meet the following criteria :
Evaluate with the same result given the same input , and perform no state change .
Evaluation of the given function does not cause observable side effects ( write to console , write to database , etc )
Things get even more clouded as we bring lazy evaluation to the table .
One of the great things that came to C# in 2.0 and especially in 3.0 with LINQ was the idea of lazy evaluation through the yield keyword .
This gave us the ability to defer work until it was absolutely needed .
That ’s one of the hallmarks of functional programming , especially a lazy language such as Haskell .
Let ’s look at a code snippet both written in F # and the equivalent in C # and let ’s determine the order of side effects .
Can they be predicted here ?
When do the side effects happen ?
Do I just get a nice list of my integers at the end ?
F #
# light let divisible_by_two n =
printf " %i divisible by two ? "
n
n % 2 = 0 let divisible_by_three n =
printf " %i divisible by three ? "
n
n % 3 = 0
let c1 = { 1 .. 100} |> Seq.filter divisible_by_two
let c2 = c1 |> Seq.filter divisible_by_three c2 |> Seq.iter ( printfn " %i " )
C #
static bool DivisibleByTwo( int n )
{
Console .
Write ( " {0} divisible by 2 ? " , n ) ;
return n % 2 == 0 ;
} DivisibleByTwo(n ) Console .
Write ( , n ) ;n %== static bool DivisibleByThree ( int n)
{
Console .
Write ( " {0} divisible by 3 ? " , n ) ;
return n % 3 == 0 ;
} var c1 = from n in Enumerable .
Range ( 1 , 100 )
where DivisibleByTwo(n )
select n ; var c2 = from n in c1
where DivisibleByThree(n )
select n ; foreach ( var c in c2 ) Console .
WriteLine ( " {0} " , c ) ;
Well , what do you think ?
If you said that the list will print out nicely at the end , you ’d be very wrong .
In fact , our output might look something like this :
Why is that ?
Well , because in LINQ , the return type is always IEnumerable < T > , and in the case of F# , I was using sequences , which unlike the List < ‘a > , is lazily evaluated .
What can we do about it ?
That ’s another matter altogether .
Unfortunately , the language constructs in .NET do n’t forbid such things , so there ’s no way of really preventing it , instead , you must be vigilant on your own to make sure this does n’t happen .
Spec# can help in just a little way as it can ensure state change will not occur during a given operation , but does not prevent you , nor warn you if you do such things as write to the console , logs , databases , etc .
Let ’s move onto another example and let ’s see what happens .
Exception Management and Lazy Evaluation
Exception management in terms of lazy evaluation is another interesting topic .
When it comes to lazily evaluated functions and structures , how do we handle exceptions that may occur is a very good question .
Let ’s look at an example of trying to catch an exception that may happen in our code due to a DivideByZeroException .
What do you think will happen here ?
Will it be caught and just return us an empty collection ?
Let ’s find out :
F #
# light let numbers = seq [ 1 ; 5 ; 2 ; 3 ; 7 ; 9 ; 0 ] let one_over n =
try
n |> Seq.map( fun i -> 1 / i )
with
| err -> seq [ ]
numbers |> one_over |> Seq.iter ( fun x -> printfn " %i " x )
C #
static IEnumerable < int > OneOver ( IEnumerable < int > items )
{
try
{
return from i in items select 1 /i ;
}
catch
{
return Enumerable .Empty < int >( ) ;
}
} IEnumerable <> OneOver ( IEnumerable <> items ) from iitems select / i;Enumerable .Empty <>( ) ; var numbers = new [ ] { 1 , 5 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 9 , 0} ;
foreach ( var number in OneOver( numbers ) )
Console. WriteLine ( " {0} " , number ) ;
What did you expect ?
Did we in fact catch the exception ?
The answer is no , because the returned structure is n’t evaluated until later , there is n’t any way for this try / catch block around our code to possibly work .
The question is to you , how might you fix this ?
The logic here is fundamentally flawed .
Let ’s move onto another scenario , this time dealing with resource management .
Resource Management and Lazy Evaluation
Another area of exploration is around resource management and lazy evaluation .
How do you ensure that your resources will be cleaned up once your evaluation is complete ?
It ’s relatively easy to make minor mistakes that may come back and haunt us .
Let ’s look at a quick sample of using lazy evaluation and reading a file to the completion .
What happens in the following code ?
F #
# light open System .IO let readLines =
use reader = File .
OpenText( @" D:\Foo.txt " )
let lines ( ) = reader .
ReadToEnd ( )
lines printfn " %s " ( readLines ( ) )
C #
string > readLines = null ; Func <> readLines = using ( var stream = File.OpenText(@" D:\foo.txt " ) )
readLines = stream .
ReadToEnd ; Console.WriteLine(readLines ( ) ) ;
The answer of course is that we get an ObjectDisposedException thrown due to the fact that the stream is long gone by the time we want to invoke our function of readLines .
Our reader has long fallen out of scope , and therefore we get that exception .
So , how do we fix it ?
Closures and Lazy Evaluation
One last topic for this post revolves around variable instantiation around closures and what it means to you in regards to lazy evaluation .
Let ’s look at a quick example of some of the issues you might face .
C #
var contents = new List < Func< int >>( ) ;
var s = new StringBuilder ( ) ; contents = List >( ) ;s = StringBuilder ( ) ; for ( var i = 4 ; i < 7 ; i++)
contents .
Add (( ) => i ) ; for ( var k = 0 ; k < contents .
Count ; k++)
s.Append( contents [ k ] ( ) ) ; Console. WriteLine(s ) ;
What we might expect the results to be in this case would be 456 .
But that ’s not the case at all here .
In fact , the answer you will get is 777 .
Why is that ?
Well , it has to do with the way that the C# compiler creates a helper class to enable this closure .
If you ’re like me and have Resharper , you ’ll notice that it gives a warning about this with " Access to modified closure " .
If we change this to give ourselves a local variable inside the loop closure construct to initialize the value properly .
If we do that and change our code , it will now look like this :
C #
var contents = new List < Func< int >>( ) ;
var s = new StringBuilder ( ) ; contents = List >( ) ;s = StringBuilder ( ) ; for ( var i = 4 ; i < 7 ; i++)
{
var j = i ;
contents .
Add (( ) => j ) ;
} for ( var k = 0 ; k < contents .
Count ; k++)
s.Append( contents [ k ] ( ) ) ; Console. WriteLine(s ) ;
Jason Olson has a pretty good explanation in his post " Lambdas – Know Your Closures " .
But where does F# fall into this picture ?
Well , let ’s try the first code sample written in F# to see what kind of results that we get .
F #
# light open System .
Text let contents = new ResizeArray <( unit -> int ) > ( )
for i = 4 to 6 do
contents .
Add(( fun ( ) -> i ) )
let s = new StringBuilder ( )
for k = 0 to ( contents .
Count – 1 ) do
s.Append( contents . [ k ] ( ) ) |> ignore
printfn " %s " ( s.ToString ( ) )
When we run this code , we get what we were expecting all along , " 456 " .
Why is that ?
The F# team handles the code just a little bit differently than the C# compiler does .
This to me seems a lot less error - prone .
Wrapping It Up
I ’d like to see how you might fix some of these issues ?
What would you do differently in each example to ensure the correct result with lazy evaluation ?
Functional programming and side effects are important topics .
I hope this post shed some light on how with lazy evaluation , side effects , when not managed properly , can be quite evil .
The ideas in functional programming is to strive towards a side effect free style .
When we start introducing lazy evaluation , concurrency and other issues , we need to be mindful of side effects and how we manage them .
I highly encourage you to see Erik ’s presentation that I linked above as it contains ideas that may help make you a better programmer .
And while you ’re at it , watch the video of Simon Peyton Jones and Erik Meijer on Channel 9 called " Towards a Programming Nirvana " .
It ’s definitely an eye opener !
The internet is still very young .
It was only November 1977 when a group of computer scientists successfully connected three networks around the world , including one at University College London .
It took until 1989 for the internet to become commercially available and about another decade after that for it to achieve widespread household use in Europe and the United States .
Only then did we emerge from what I think of as the ' internet comma ' days , when its mention in the media was always followed by a comma and a short description .
From there , we 've got to the point where I , because of my long history with the technology , now run afoul of The Observer style guide .
I remain convinced that as a unique entity the word requires capitalisation .
You 'll see that the newspaper is so comfortable with the term that it does n't .
This reflects that in a very short time the internet has had a profound impact on the way we live , so it 's hardly surprising that some people have expressed scepticism of its effects .
Writing in Atlantic magazine , for example , Nicholas Carr recently asked whether Google is making us stupider , while Doris Lessing 's Nobel lecture last December included what many saw as an attack on the internet .
Yet such a transformative technology is bound to ruffle a few feathers .
I have no doubts that its social repercussions will take decades to be fully understood , but it has already done much to benefit the world .
It has provided access to information on a scale never before imaginable , lowered the barriers to creative expression , challenged old business models and enabled new ones .
It has succeeded because we designed it to be both flexible and open .
These features have allowed it to accommodate innovation without massive changes to its infrastructure .
And innovation on the internet happens at a rapid pace .
Ten years ago , Google was simply an idea being explored by two graduates in California .
The years to come will offer more that is new and exciting .
It 's easy to forget , sitting in the UK or the US , just how far the internet still has to go .
Today , there are only about 1.4 billion users , representing a bit more than one - fifth of the world 's population , and a substantial amount of the content on the web is still written in English .
But the internet is becoming more global .
Asia has more than 500 million users and Europe nearly 400 million and internet - enabled mobile phones will help extend the net to Africa , Latin America and the Indian subcontinent .
We 're about to see further waves of innovation .
There are more than three billion mobiles in use today and more than 80 per cent of the world 's population live within range of a network .
In areas where wireline or WiFi access barely exists , many new users will first experience the internet through a mobile phone .
In developing economies , people are already finding innovative ways to use mobile technology .
Grameen 's micro-finance and village phone programmes in Bangladesh and elsewhere are known and respected around the world , but there are many less famous examples .
During the Kenyan elections , Mobile Planet provided its subscribers with up - to - the - minute results by text message .
As the cost of mobile technologies fall , the opportunities for such innovation will continue to grow .
We 're nearing the tipping point for mobile computing to deliver timely , geographically and socially relevant information .
Researchers in Japan recently proposed using data from vehicles ' windscreen wipers and embedded GPS receivers to track the movement of weather systems through towns and cities with a precision never before possible .
It may seem academic , but understanding the way severe weather , such as a typhoon , moves through a city could save lives .
Further exploration can shed light on demographic , intellectual and epidemiological phenomena , to name just a few areas .
It 's amazing how quickly those of us with internet access have come to take for granted the remarkable amounts of information we have at our disposal , but we 're only seeing the beginnings .
The bulk of human knowledge remains offline .
As more of us get access to the internet , more of the world 's information will find its way online .
The web is already making strides toward becoming truly global .
While I was chairman of ICANN , one of the organisations that helps ensure that the internet works uniformly around the world , we adopted rules to allow the system of domain names to accommodate non-Roman characters , making the web more accessible to people whose languages use other scripts , such as Arabic , Korean or Cyrillic .
There are improvements in automatic language translation tools and , in particular , the field that we call machine learning .
It is already possible to do a Google search and explore the results in English across web content in 23 different languages , from Czech to Hindi to Korean .
Speakers of any of those languages can now explore content on the web written in any of the others .
The technology is n't perfect yet , but it 's rapidly improving .
Even in its present form , it 's easy to imagine a not - too - distant future in which automatic translation will allow two people in the world to message one another in real time , each experiencing the chat in his or her tongue .
Just imagine what a significant step that will be .
The technological progress of the internet has set huge social changes in motion .
As with other transformative innovations before it , from the telegraph to television , people will continue to worry about the effects ; the printing press and the rise in literacy that it effected were long seen as destabilising forces .
Similar concerns about the internet are being raised , but if we take a long view , its benefits far outweigh the discomforts of learning to integrate it into our lives .
After working on the internet for more than three decades , I 'm more optimistic about its promise than ever .
It has the potential to change unexpected parts of our lives : from surfboards that let you surf the web while you wait for the next wave to refrigerators that can email you suggested recipes based on the food you already have .
My colleagues at Nasa and I are even working on an interplanetary internet , which will make getting information to and from spacecraft in the far reaches of the solar system more reliable .
Closer to home , we 're at the cusp of a truly global internet that will bring people closer together and democratise access to information .
We are all free to innovate on the net every day and we should look forward to more people around the world enjoying that freedom .

" The neoliberal dominance of the State " ( cont'd )
One can only share the exasperation of Ads Without Products about the rash of articles describing the current bail outs of financial institutions as constituting a leftward turn .
It 's puzzling how " a massive transfer of public wealth to the private sector " , how the State buying up bad debts without getting any equity in return , could be considered the return of leftism .
It 's capitalist realism by other means : the only kind of state intervention that is " possible " .
This kind of " nationalisation " could only happen to protect the interests of the speculator class .
As Jodi Dean puts it :
This is the subjection of the state to the demands of finance capital .
It is not the state taking control of banks , markets , finance .
That 's why there were no provisions in the initial 2 page plan for oversight or accountability .
That 's also why it was written by a former head of Goldman Sachs .
That 's what Wall Street is demanding .
This is n't socialism .
It 's the triumph of neoliberal dominance of the state .
What we 're seeing is not the collapse of capitalism , but the disintegration of the illusion that capitalism is about the untrammeled free market .
The developments over the last few weeks only underscore Alex Williams 's point that the State , far from being exterior to capital , is a " vital element of stabilisation " which prevents capitalism from accelerating to the point of self - destruction .
Which is n't to say that nothing is happening .
It could well turn out , as Larry Elliott argues , that this is a sea change moment .
" For Middle Britain , " Elliott claims , " the traders who bragged about their £ 1,000 bottles of Krug have now become as loathed as the bolshie shop stewards of the 1970s . "
New political movements require a shared object of loathing , the emergence of which indicates a symbolic shift at the level of the political unconscious .
The uneasy dreamwork alliance of neoliberalism and neoconservatism has depended on a shared object of revulsion : the nonproductive outsider , the asylum seeker / welfare recipient .
Could a new settlement emerge organised around the symbolic abjection of the figure of the profligate trader ?
Meanwhile , as excruciatingly compulsive as watching David Brent , Sarah Palin explains it all ( via ) :
I ’ve gotten my feet wet with D&D goodness ( or madness ? ) and I ’m here to tell the tale of my first days on the road .
We ’ll take baby steps through the first 3 chapters of the Player ’s Handbook in order to prepare ourselves for the 100 + pages rampage through the classes chapter .
But let ’s not get ahead of ourselves , we have plenty of material to go through and some pretty pictures to look at ( except for the tieflings … you ’ll see what I mean . )
I ’ll be making pretty specific comments on certain parts of the text , but I will always try to give page references so if you want you can follow along and scream about how utterly wrong / right I am .
Everyone ready ?
Let ’s dive in !
Introduction
In case you have just stumbled upon ( no pun intended ) this post , here is the idea and some ground rules .
I ’ll be reading all the core rulebooks for the newest edition of Dungeons and Dragons ( that ’s 4th Edition ) and I ’ll share with you my thoughts and experiences as I go through the tomes .
Also included will be solo play , group play and even ( provided I get some friendly gamers ) running the game myself .
After all this debacle I ’ll be doing some “ house ruling ” on the lovely lad to see if we can move away from the cool tactical minis game .
Once again , this is not a “ D&D is bad ” kind of series and although you will see personal comments that might not be flattering that just reflects my thoughts at the time of the reading .
One last thing , the links for all the articles in the series will always be found in the original topic to make sure that you do n’t miss any episode .
Have fun !
Player ’s Handbook
Chapter 1 : How to Play
To me D&D has always revolved around monster bashing , treasure looting and plain old “ L337 dUD3 $ 7 | -|47 0wnz j00 Z ” ( elite dudes that own you . )
This was just the impression that I got from reading the books a bit and being around players of the game .
It ’s refreshing to know that nowadays D&D has casted all doubt aside and decided to tell us that :
D&D is a cooperative game in which you and your friends work together to complete each adventure and have fun ( …)
You solve puzzles , talk with other characters , battle all kinds of fantastic monsters , and discover fabulous magic items and treasure .
Chapter 1 | page 6
It was one of the first things I pointed out to a friend after reading the book for the first time .
The above is just an example , but there ’s this whole feeling of “ Hey , what we ’re trying to do here is an adventure game where you get to play with minis , bash monsters and get ever cooler items and powers ” during the intro of the game .
This is good since it comes off as being honest , and bad ( to me ) since apparently …
This is the world of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS ® Roleplaying Game ( also referred to as D&D ) , the pinnacle of fantasy roleplaying games .
Chapter 1 | page 4
But hey , I ’m sure I ’d say the same thing about my game .
In any case let ’s move along .
Also another important thing to point out is that we have some very interesting social contract issues spelled out for us in the introduction to roleplaying .
In particular we ’re talking about player roles , the structure for storytelling and narrative permissions …
The DM is a person who takes on the role of lead storyteller and game referee .
The DM creates adventures for the characters and narrates the action for the players .
Chapter 1 | page 6
From reading the book you get the idea that you take part in stories , rather than create the stories .
This setup has you playing out the narrative proposed by the DM and by the fact that you ’re just being there ( and , you know , play ) you create a unique experience and this accumulation of unique experiences is the story that you weave ( sort of ) with your friends .
I ’m personally a little bleh about this , since I ’ve grown attached to a more of a “ shared narrative ” style of play , but maybe this can accomodate both … we ’ll just have to see .
However I think the book is pretty much comfy with that approach :
The DM creates adventures ( or selects premade adventures ) for you and the other players to play through .
The DM sets the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters the players must overcome .
Chapter 1 | page8
That sets the tone for the kind of play we should expect .
From what I can see it focuses on challenging the players ’ wits ( to solve a puzzle , succeed at a social encounter , win a combat or solve riddle ) , rather than creating obstacles for the characters to achieve their goals .
Also important is the classic ( but oft forgotten ) winning conditions :
You “ win ” the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game by participating in an exciting story of bold adventurers confronting deadly perils (…)
You might fail to complete the adventure , but if you had a good time and you created a story that everyone remembers for a long time , the whole group wins .
Chapter 1 | page 6
To tell you the truth my personal experience has not given me a lot of happy moments with D&D .
I ’ve had a bit deal of “ oh great , another 3 hour combat ” or even “ oh great , yet another impossibly powerful person who wants us to fetch the ball and if we do n’t she will kill our very soul ” and sometimes the whimsical “ you trip with your own leg and fall to the floor breaking the fire potion vial , the flames engufl you in the blink of an eye and you burn like a log , you stand up screaming and two bandits shoot arrows at you … they hit you in the chest , you ’re dead … whose turn is next ? ” but I do n’t recall a lot of “ Yippey !
I ’m having fun ! ” kind of moments … however that ’s just me being bitter , not the game ’s fault I ’m sure .
And speaking of being bitter , what the heck is this !?
All DUNGEONS & DRAGONS games have four basic ingredients : at least one player ( four or five players is best ) , a Dungeon Master , an adventure , and game books ( ¿? ) and dice .
Chapter 1 | page 8
What the… I ’ve never heard of a freaking roleplaying game that told me that “ the game ” had “ the book ” as one of its core ingredients ?
I mean I can sort of justify the dice in that list because … well because I guess throwing dice around is fun and it ’s a staple of D&D ( I guess ) , but I just ca n’t see any reasonable explanation for that except the one that says “ Gimme money , buy books ! ”
I ’m not against them selling books , I just thought that marketing could do better ( especially since I already purchased the blasted book . )
In any case I should give the game a chance , it has a whole page and a half explaining what the heck that statement meant , so let ’s have a look .
Player ’s Handbook : Every player needs a Player ’s Handbook for reference .
Dungeon Master ’s Guide and Monster Manual : The Dungeon Master needs a copy of each of these books ( and players might also enjoy perusing the contents ) .
Chapter 1 | page 9
… Fuck you book .
My friends will have copies IF there is the need for that .
I understand that this is a commercial operation and you need books to be sold .
I also consider myself not a moron … each player does not need a Player ’s Handbook for reference , we can share mine …
OK ?
( I ’m beginning to think that I might get a little agitated in the course of this review . )
Also I just do n’t get the fact that the book says ( same page ) that “ you might find some of the following items and accessories useful at your game table ” ( talking about minis and battlemats / dungeon tiles ) and then happily proceed to tell me that I need to have minis and a battle grid .
By the way , you do need those so get them if you ’re going to run this game .
By the way , the idea is that an adventure is basically a series of encounters related to eachother within the framework of a story .
This goes back to D&D being more of a challenge to the players wit , and sure enough we have our challenges divided ( again , page nine on “ How do you play ? ” ) between combat and non combat encounters … and exploration , which seems to be a catch all word for whatever happens in between .
The chapter ends with a very brief description of the core mechanic for the D&D 4th Ed game and I think it ’s really user friendly .
Just roll a die ( high = good ) add a few things and compare to a number you have to match or beat .
Same goes with the three basic rules ( Chapter 1 | page 11 ) to round up the introduction to the game .
So far the game has been quite clear and upfront about what it ’s going to be doing on the following chapters so that ’s a good point .
Intermission
Good lord !
Is this long or what ?!
Fear not because the next chapters ( especially mechanic heavy ones ) will be much lighter and shorter ( well not on the book but here . )
I wanted to give special care to the first one because here the game pretty much sets the ground work for everything that comes later , so I wanted to share my thougts on it .
In any case I already have the material for the next two chapters so the next article is coming your way really soon !
That ’s it for today , we have a lot of material ready but I ’ll be taking it one bit at a time .
Remember that you can find all the links on the original topic and that you can comment on the particular articles if you have a question or want to add your thoughts about the game .
I ’ll be looking forward to hearing from you .
Until next time , Fred .
Every few years , the standards that are associated with computer peripherals change .
For example , the previous CD - Rom standards were upgraded to CD writers , then it became DVD drives and the now , the accepted standard are DVD writers .
LCD monitors are the new standard in computer displays .
Though they have not yet replaced CRT ( cathode ray tube ) monitors completely , LCD monitors are fast rising in popularity because of their extremely sleek looks , lower power consumption and more convenient footprint on a desk .
LCD monitors at this point are still quite expensive though and thus , extra care should be given to the unit so that it will maintain its pristine condition .
Probably the most important part that should be taken care of in an LCD monitor is the screen itself .
The screen is not as tough as the glass tube of a CRT .
If you have an LCD screen you will notice that only a clear , thick plastic separates your fingers from the actual components of the LCD .
It is imperative that you take care of your LCD screen as much as possible and prevent it from being scratched .
There is a way though of repairing a scratched LCD screen though that is inexpensive and very easy .
All you need is Vaseline petroleum jelly to fill the scratch on the LCD screen .
This very simple remedy works because the optical density of Vaseline more closely matches the LCD face compared to air .
All you need to do is to clean the surface of the screen and then take some Vaseline and fill the scratch with it .
Gently wipe off the excess
Vaseline taking care not to wipe too forcefully so that you leave some inside the scratch .
World leaders have for years struggled to determine which ones to recognize , often making decisions and then trying to limit the repercussions by warning that each situation is unique .
The questions now are : whether that hesitance to bestow recognition could be eroding , as witnessed by Kosovo and Russia ’s action in Georgia ; and whether other independence movements will use the recognition of the two enclaves to further their own ambitions by citing similar grievances .
Not far from Georgia , for example , is an Armenian enclave that wants to secede from Azerbaijan , and Kurdish separatists are seeking their own homeland in regions of Turkey and Iraq .
In the past , most countries feared that if they waded into one such conflict , it could be used against them in a future one .
On Tuesday , no other big power followed Moscow ’s lead and voiced support for South Ossetia ’s and Abkhazia ’s independence .
Many in Abkhazia have expressed the desire to be separate both from Georgia and Russia  and some experts say it might be viable as an independent nation , albeit a very small one , because of its larger size and busy port .
South Ossetia , in contrast , has only 70,000 people and borders on the Russian region of North Ossetia .
Suspicions have long arisen that after seceding from Georgia , South Ossetia would be absorbed by Russia and joined with North Ossetia  and most Ossetians say they support that .
The Kremlin said Tuesday that it had no plans to take over South Ossetia .
It has already given Russian passports to many residents of both places , thereby widening its influence .

Mr. Medvedev announced the enclaves ’ independence with unexpected swiftness , only a day after the Russian Parliament unanimously called upon him to do so .
Diplomats and analysts had surmised that the Kremlin might draw the process out as part of negotiations with the West .
( Natural News ) Yogurt maker Dannon has been hit with a class - action lawsuit alleging that the company has made false and misleading claims about the health benefits of its probiotic line of yogurts .
" Deceptive advertising has enabled Dannon to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ordinary yogurt at inflated prices to responsible , health - conscious consumers , " said attorney Timothy G. Blood .
" All of Dannon 's claims for Activia and DanActive are completely supported by peer - reviewed science and are in accordance with all laws and regulations , '' the company responded .
Dannon advertises its Activia and DanActive yogurts as containing probiotic bacteria that help boost the immune system and regulate digestion .
An aggressive marketing campaign by the company includes a high - profile ad campaign and a Web site with links to studies showing the benefits of the probiotic bacteria used in Activia products .
The studies cited by Dannon were all funded by the company .
Filed in the United States District Court in California , the lawsuit says that there is no evidence that the yogurt itself functions as advertised , regardless of what various varieties of probiotic bacteria may do in the laboratory .
Probiotics are microorganisms that provide health benefits inside the body , but some scientists say that probiotics remain poorly understood .
Of the thousands of probiotics that exist , very few have been tested for their effects when consumed by humans as part of their diets .
Laboratory research does not necessarily translate into real health benefits , these researchers say .
" At present , the quality of probiotics available to consumers in food products around the world is unreliable , " says a 2006 report by the American Society for Microbiology .
There are few FDA regulations on marketing claims made on probiotic products , as long as those products do not claim to be equivalent to drugs that have the ability to cure diseases .
My friends and I are planning a long weekend this summer .
Cancun ?
Florida ?
California ?
Nope .
We 're going to spend four or five days wandering around Iowa .
It all started when we were talking a couple of weeks ago and realized that most of us ( Iowa natives ) have never been to the Field of Dreams .
It 's one of the only " famous " spots in Iowa – the other one is Madison County , home of the famous bridges ( which I have actually seen ) .
I lived in Philly for about a year and whenever the locals there found out I was from Iowa , the reactions were usually one of these three things : " Did you grow up on a farm ? "
No .
" Oh , that 's why you have an accent . "
People from Philly telling me I have an accent ?
And the third comment : " Oh , Field of Dreams , right ? "
So it 's probably about time I check out the Field of Dreams in Dyersville .
While we 're at it , we 're going to check out some other strange attractions around the state .
If you 've never been to roadsideamerica.com , I suggest you check it out – it's chock - full of bizarre things to see across the States .
I 'm not under the delusion that Iowa is a hot spot for tourism , but should you ever be in the state and looking for something to do , I thought I 'd share with you some of the interesting ( read : strange ) stops we 'll be making this summer .
In turn , maybe you can share some strange things in your state with me .
I 'm always up for interesting stops .
Grotto of the Redemption , West Bend
My husband went here with his family when he was very small .
There 's a good story his mom tells about him that involves the Grotto and diapers ( or a lack thereof ) , but I 'll spare you .
If you 're thinking Playboy Mansion - style Grotto , you 're way off .
Way , way off .
This Grotto is a religious monument built largely by just three men .
Father Paul Dobberstein almost died of pneumonia when he was younger and promised to build a shrine to the Virgin Mary if she would heal him .
He got better and kept his promise .
In 1912 , he started the first of many travels to Hot Springs and South Dakota 's Black Hills in search of rocks and crystal to use in his blueprint - less creation .
When he obtained these little treasures , he would return to West Bend and set the gems and stones into concrete .
Sounds like a pretty small undertaking , sure , but when you consider that the grottoes take up an entire city block and contain more than $ 4 million in rocks and minerals , you can see why it 's a big deal .

The American Gothic House , Eldon
This one is n't such a big deal to me , probably because I grew up just 20 minutes away .
But my friends have n't been there , and it was in the running to be on the state quarter , so it must be pretty important .
You might recognize the Dibble House from the Grant Wood painting American Gothic .
Apparently Grant Wood came to Eldon in 1930 and thought the contrast of the tiny little house with the " pretentious " Gothic windows was interesting .
He sketched the house and then convinced his sister and his dentist to pose as the father and daughter ( not man and wife , as most people think ) in the foreground .
The rest is history .
The best part about visiting the American Gothic House is that the American Gothic House Center actually provides drab clothes and a pitchfork so you can pose in front of the house with your own sour expression .
I'm a sucker for a ridiculous photo op , so that 's another reason the house makes my list .
Buddy Holly Crash Site , Clear Lake
Buddy Holly , The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens performed at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake on February 2 , 1959 .
In the wee hours of February 3 , the plane carrying the three of them crashed almost immediately after takeoff , killing everyone on board .
There 's not as much of a monument as you would expect , but if you trek out to the middle of the cornfield they landed in ( although I believe it was soybeans at the time ) , you 'll find a stainless steel guitar and three records .

Canteen Lunch in the Alley , Ottumwa
I can't resist the urge to plug my hometown .
Fans of Roseanne surely remember The Lunch Box , the little hole - in - the - wall joint that Roseanne ran with her sister , Jackie .
At the time , Ottumwa native Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne and took her to the Canteen .
She fell in love with the place and decided to base the Lunch Box on it , loose - meat sandwiches and all .
I do n't know that I 'd visit just because of that fact , but I would visit because the food is amazing .
Do n't order a " loose - meat sandwich " , though , unless you want to get a look of contempt .
The burgers there are called Canteens , and do n't you forget it .
But if you want to look like a native ( uh… you probably do n't ) , just order " One " , as in " One with everything " or " One with ketchup - pickle " .
It 's served lunch - counter style and the place seats , oh , maybe 15 people .
Also ?
The chocolate malts are to die for .

The First Train Robbery in the West , Adair
Not only was it the first train robbery in the West and the first moving train robbery in the world , it was conducted by none other than Jesse James .
On July 21 ( my birthday ! ) , 1873 , the James - Younger Gang staged a robbery expecting to make off with $ 75,000 in gold .
Turns out that shipment was delayed , so they only got away with the $ 3,000 in the safe of the Rock Island Express .
The tracks are long gone , except for the little piece that shows where Jesse derailed the train .
Adair celebrates Jesse James
Days the every year on the third weekend of July , including a reenactment of the robbery .

Bank Robbed by Bonnie and Clyde , Stuart
In a funny twist of fate , the bank Bonnie and Clyde robbed in Stuart , Iowa is now houses the police station .
The Barrow Gang paid a visit to Stuart in April of 1934 , a month before they were killed in Louisiana .
Several months earlier , Bonnie and Clyde were in the same area and had a close run-in with a man from a nearby farm .
Marvelle Feller , his parents , sister and uncle were held at gunpoint by Clyde and W.D. Jones .
The gang eventually stole the family 's car and took off .

Bank Robbed by John Dillinger , Mason City
Jesse James , Bonnie and Clyde , and Dillinger – who knew Iowa was such a hotbed for outlaws ?
Just a month before the Bonnie and Clyde robbery , John Dillinger , Baby Face Nelson and their gang hit the First National Bank in Mason City , Iowa .
They took $ 52,000 , which was much less than they had planned on getting .
The building is now called the City Center , but it 's still around .
To commemorate the occasion , the town started holding Dillinger Days ( officially called Dillinger Meets Mason City ) in 2007 .
Derek Arnold from Flickr has some pretty interesting pictures of the Dillinger robbery re-enactment .
OK , your turn !

Obama aide questions McCain 's honor
The Obama campaign took its most personal shot ever at Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) on Tuesday evening , questioning his honor over a claim in a new TV ad that the Democrat calls " perverse . "
The issue was a new McCain advertisement belittling Obama 's record on education , and accusing him of supporting sex education for kindergartners .
Advertisement
" Obama 's one accomplishment ? " the narrator asks .
" Legislation to teach ' comprehensive sex education ' to kindergartners .
Learning about sex before learning to read ?
Barack Obama .
Wrong on education .
Wrong for your family . "
Bill Burton , Obama 's press secretary , responded in a statement : “ It is shameful and downright perverse for the McCain campaign to use a bill that was written to protect young children from sexual predators as a recycled and discredited political attack against a father of two young girls – a position that his friend Mitt Romney also holds .
Last week , John McCain told
Time magazine he could n't define what honor was .
Now we know why . "
" Honor " is a touchy issue to invoke with the former prisoner of war , but Democrats have expressed increasing exasperation — and worry — about what they see as constant distortions in McCain ads .
In an interview the magazine described as " prickly , " McCain repeatedly refused to define " honor " : " Read it in my books .
... I 'm not going to define it .
... I defined it in five books .
Read my books . "

This massive deployment means that hundreds of nuclear - armed warplanes , thousands of troops , and destroyers capable of launching cruise missiles carrying nuclear weapons , bunker busters , or fragmentation bombs will be available for a strike on Iran .
While Russia is bogged down with the crisis in Georgia , and China is occupied with the Olympics , the Bush Administration may believe that this is an opportune time to strike .
This massive deployment is occurring as both Houses of Congress are set to approve resolutions that would mandate a U.S. blockade ( which is an act of war under international law ) .
The time to act is now :
Please sign the petition online at http://stopwaroniran.org/petition.shtml
And please help us get the word out - use the Tell a Friend Link at http://stopwaroniran.org/friend.shtml
Also , in the next few days and weeks , we will be mobilizing in the streets against an attack on Iran .
As we write , we are preparing placards , banners , and printed material to take to the Republican and Democratic national conventions .
We know that the only force that will stop the warmongers in Washington is a grassroots peoples movement .
We need your help to take the message to the conventions and to mobilize for other emergency actions .

This is what we might call the $ 1trillion question .
That 's $ 1,000,000,000,000 , by the way .
It is a little like surgery .
The US government has amputated the gangrenous leg of the banking system to save the patient .
But it is now preparing to graft the infected limb on to the body politic of America .
The US taxpayers will be lucky if they do not feel distinctly unwell as a result of this little experiment .
The truth is that simply buying the banks ' worthless securities has been an option , if an unpalatable one , for the authorities since the credit crunch began a year ago .
All the plans to lend against these assets , such as the Bank of England 's Special Liquidity Scheme , and other " injections of liquidity " , were temporary solutions , born out of a hope , if not an expectation , that the crisis would not be prolonged .
We know better now .
What the American authorities have done is the only sure way to protect the banking system against further destabilisation .
Short - selling or not , left to their own devices , the markets would sooner or later force more banks into the arms of the taxpayer anyhow .
It is a sad day when hard - pressed citizens find themselves subsidising private banks for their stupid mistakes .
But that is what 's happening in the US , and it will surely be done here .
The Bank of England hates the notion ; but Gordon Brown may well feel that he has no choice .

So for the banks and their shareholders and staff , the US rescue plan is already working , and it will save the wider economy from yet more damage .
It is less clear whether it will end the credit crisis or preserve America 's fast disappearing economic hegemony .
Even taking a trillion dollars of crud out of the equation can't save the financial system from damage already done .
Despite the Fed 's efforts , many banks in America and around the world have severely enfeebled balance sheets .
They cannot lend , even if they wanted to .
With the developed world in recession – Japan , Britain , Germany and Spain are leading the way – the banks will soon be losing money on their conventional lines of business , as mortgages suffer defaults and companies go out of business .
We will then see a vicious cycle of bad debts leading to less lending , more job losses , more defaults and so on .
The turning point in all this will be the moment when the US real estate market recovers , and the whole sorry cycle of decline starts to right itself .
Sooner or later American homes will look cheap enough to attract even the most nervous buyer .
That could take another year or two .
The other legacy of the rescue plan will be another huge debt burden loaded on to the shoulder of the American taxpayer ( and the British one , if the precedent is copied ) .
The good news is that the great vitality of American enterprise has survived such traumas before .
Franklin Roosevelt 's Federal Reconstruction Corporation used $ 1.2trillion ( at today 's prices ) of federal funds to fix the banking system and get the economy moving in the 1930s .
The rescue of America 's savings and loans associations at the end of the 1980s cost $ 125 bn .
Yet now we have a different dynamic .
Behind all of this is an irreversible shift of income , wealth and power eastwards ; from America and Europe to China .
The oil price was another tool in this redistribution – they bid the price higher and made us poorer .
The Chinese also , in effect , lent us the money to buy all those overpriced houses .
How ?
Because they had the savings to lend to us to do so , funded , in turn , from the huge trade surpluses – trillions of dollars – they built up with the US and Europe , earned from selling us all of those cheap DVD players , dog food and toys .
All that money looking for a home pushed interest rates down to very low levels ( aided by their cheap electronic goods , which reduced inflation as well ) .
Now China is lending us the cash to get ourselves out of trouble again , by buying yet more US Treasury bills and shares in the likes of Barclays and Citigroup .
For now , they seem content to do so ; but we can not be sure that they , and the Gulf states , the Russians and the others holding dollar assets , will do so for ever .
The savers ' run on Northern Rock , the institutional runs on Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers , and every other run in this crisis will be as nothing to a global run on the dollar itself .
Could the US itself soon suffer a crisis of liquidity ?
The measures announced Wednesday came as somewhat of a disappointment to Wall Street analysts and investors , because they were expected and because some of the moves could take months to complete .
“ I do n’t think the market will be patient for another quarter of losses and uncertainty and promises , ” Mr. Blum said .
“ I think the market is looking for this to be the final fix . ”
Other analysts give Lehman even less time , saying the bank needs to complete a sale within days to satisfy shareholders .
Others are anxious for Lehman to secure financing from an outside investor .
Lehman stock plunged 45 percent Tuesday after its plans for a major investment from a Korean bank fell through , and is down more than 90 percent from the peak last February .
The asset management sale , at least , is not likely to be completed that fast .
Final bids are due this weekend but it will take several weeks to evaluate them , people close to the matter said .
Finalists for the majority stake include the private equity groups Bain Capital , Hellman & Friedman and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts .
The spinoff of the real estate assets is not expected to be completed until early next year , and some analysts questioned whether the $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion in equity Lehman might use to support the new entity , to be called Real Estate Investments Global , would require the remaining “ good bank ” to raise even more money , something it has had trouble doing .
Lehman executives had insisted on Wednesday that the sale of the stake in the money management business would be enough to offset the capital going to support the “ bad bank ” and that no new money would be needed right away .
However , Lehman and other banks have insisted throughout the credit crisis that they had ample capital only to rush out to raise even more .
Mr. Fuld said in his conference call that once the initiatives were complete , Lehman would emerge as a stronger , less - risky bank that should command a higher share price .
The Viking who lay it down probably gave his faeces little thought but more than a millennium later it was , in its hardened form , a York museum 's most treasured excrement .
School parties visiting the Archaeological Resource Centre would admire the artefact in a way that only children could .
And all was well until two weeks ago when its display stand collapsed in the hands of an unfortunate teacher and , crashing to the floor , the rock - like lump broke into three pieces .
A reconstruction job is now under way to glue the Viking faeces back together again .
Named the Lloyds Bank Turd after its discovery on a 1972 dig on the land now occupied by a Lloyds TSB bank in York , it is considered to be the largest complete example of preserved human excrement ever found .
Gill Snape , a student conservator on a placement with the York Arcaeological Trust , who will assist in the operation , said that the natural replacement of organic matter with minerals - a type of fossilisation process known as mineralisation - had given a remarkable weight to the " long and fat " deposit .
" Whoever passed it probably had n't performed for a few days , shall we say , " she said .
Aside from delighting children , and quite a few adults too , the excrement has revealed the diet and health of its human source .
He was not a great vegetable eater , instead living on large amounts of meat and grains such as bran , despite fruit stones , nutshells and other stools containing matter from vegetables such as leeks being found on the same site .
Evidence of several hundred eggs left in the faeces would have meant that his stomach and intestines would have been full of worms .
" This guy had very itchy bowels , " Ms Snipe explained .
Recumbent Bikes By John Andersen
Youve probably seen them , those odd shaped bicycles having more in common with lawn furniture than typical bicycles .
Perhaps you re wondering what they are all about and why are there starting to be more of them around .
You probably would like to try riding one some time , and wonder if they are easy to ride .
Or perhaps you just decided to see if this article would explain just what kind of madness would make a healthy looking bicyclist climb aboard a pedal driven lawn chair .
Im referring to Recumbent Bicycles of course , those sit - down bikes , which are pedaled with the cyclists feet out in front , while the rider is seemingly relaxing in a mesh seat looking for all the world like it is no work at all .
In this article I m going to attempt to answer your questions in a balanced way , because there is a lot of hyperbole both Pro and Con .
Let me start right off by saying I use a recumbent and three diamond - frame ( regular ) bikes as well as a tandem .
I like them all , and have spent enough time on each of the types to know the faults and well as the strong points .
What are these things Recumbent ( meaning seated ) bikes have been around for quite a while , but have never garnered a significant share of the market .
The last I heard , they had just slightly more sales than Tandems , and you know how rare those are .
Yet lately you are starting to see them in increasing numbers .
Recumbents or " Bents " as they are often called in the US and Canada ( but seldom in Britain due to another connotation of the word ) started out as a tinkers project .
Often they were , and some still are , assembled in garages out of pieces and parts of cannibalized bikes by guys with a welding torch in their hand and a gleam in their eye .
Today , there are a couple dozen manufactures of quality production recumbents in the US , Europe , Australia , and the Orient .
Out of this environment came a few bikes with very nice handling characteristics , a fair bit of speed , and a great deal of comfort .
Comfort seems always to be measured against the alleged horrors of the regular bike seat , usually with dramatic exaggeration thrown in for good measure .
Make no mistake about it , the garage mechanics bike and the production recumbents which descended from them are comfortable .
And yes , they are easy to ride , although in your first five minutes on one you may think me daft for saying so .
Recumbent bikes are DIFFERENT .
They ride differently , they steer differently , starting and stopping is different , and climbing hills requires a different approach .
By and large they are quite fun to ride .
The " Recumbent Grin " is the most noticeable attribute of a new bent pilot .
( That term " pilot " comes up often among recumbent riders because the feeling of banking into turns as you swoop around corners has much in common with feelings you get while flying in small planes ) .
Recumbent Variety
There are a lot of different recumbent shapes and sizes .
Once you break the " rules " and deviate from the diamond frame design there is little to hold you back from trying new designs and new shapes .
The two most common classifications of recumbents are based on where the front wheel is in relation to the rest of the bike .
These are short wheelbase and Long wheelbase .
There is arguably a third category called compact long wheelbase , but the difference between this and the other categories is blurred and indistinct .
Short Short , or short wheel based bikes usually have the front wheel about at the riders knees , while the cranks are way out in front .
These tend to be speedy bikes .
Sometimes this yields a harsher ride as you are sitting almost on top of the front wheel .
Long Long Wheel Based bikes have the front wheel out in front of the cranks like a conventional bike .
Such bikes have larger turning radiuses , and some of the smoothest rides of any bike .
These bikes also tend to be the lowest bikes , often having the seat less than a foot above the pavement .
Steering Arrangements
Within the three above general categories of bike geometry , there are two common arrangements of the steering mechanism .
These varieties each have their own strong points and near fanatical adherents .
Both work , both are easy to learn to use .
Above Seat Steering Above seat steering ( ASS ) recumbent have handlebars above the seat , usually about chest high .
This arrangement is often said to be more comfortable for the beginner than is under seat steering .
Above seat handlebars also lead to a more aerodynamic configuration on the bike as your arms are in front of you and therefore do not present an additional wind target .
Under Seat Steering Under Seat Steering ( USS ) has the steering assembly under the riders seat and handlebars protruding out from under either side of the seat .
This usually entails some sort of linkage to the front wheel , except in the case of short wheel based machines , which have the front wheel very close to the rider .
USS is quite comfortable once you are use to it .
There is nothing in front of you .
Some riders find this arrangement makes it easier to get on and off , due to not having to duck under the bars .
Not Just Bicycles
Not all recumbents are bicycles .
Some are Trikes .
Trikes have a special appeal to the touring crowd as you are never at a loss for a place to rest , and the carrying capacity is great .
Plus , your full loaded bike does not try to fall over the minute you turn your back .
Trikes also appeal to those users with balance problems , salvaging an otherwise lost love of cycling .
There is no learning curve , you can ride one instantly .
You can also climb very steep hills because Trikes have incredible gearing ( some as many as 72 gears ) , and also because you do not have to maintain enough speed to balance as you would on a two wheel vehicle .
You can set the brake , and stop to rest anywhere without getting off the bike .
Most commercial recumbent trike designs are of the " tadpole " design with two front wheels and one rear wheel .
The trike pictured here is a Greenspeed Touring Trike manufactured in Australia but sold the world over , available either as completed bikes or kits to build your own .
Reasons for Recumbents
There are several good reasons to ride a recumbent bicycle .
I will cover these below in greater detail .
But first I would like to mention the fact that often people choose a recumbent after they have many years of using other bikes , and after they have reached an age where they are no longer socially insecure .
In prior years , recumbent riders were overwhelmingly middle aged .
Lately you are starting to see more young riders , but still virtually no teenage riders .
This may well change , as recumbents become more common , not to mention cheaper .
Comfort
One of the most frequently cited reasons for riding a recumbent bike is the comfortable seat .
Many people find the having weight on their arms or wrists is unbearable for longer periods with advancing age .
Others just never seem to get used to a typical bike seat and find the lawn chair like seats of recumbents more comfortable .
Make no mistake about it recumbents are very comfortable .
However , many recumbent enthusiasts go way overboard in denigrating the typical bike seat , claiming they would never go back to that " horrible " seat .
However , the upright 's seat would not seem so uncomfortable if the rider rode more frequently .
Long tours are especially comfortable on some of the long wheel based recumbents .
You can ride all day and not have any sore spots .
Also , as you sit in a more natural posture , your neck does not get sore .
and you see more of your surroundings .
Stress Injuries Recumbents are often a way whereby people with repetitive stress injuries to the wrist , neck , or back can continue to ride bikes .
Quite often such injuries make it impossible to bear any weight on ones hands , as is necessary when leaning on the handlebars .
Injuries to the back or neck can also keep people off a regular bike , but seldom present a problem for recumbent bikes .
Cycling is still possible with many such injuries if the position on the bike is changed .
The upright seating posture of most recumbents is more like sitting in a chair , and reduces stress on arms and neck .
Offsetting this , often there is additional stress is placed on knees , especially among new recumbent riders .
We will cover this below .
Speed Recumbents hold all human powered speed records .
Period !
The worlds cycling organizations , or even national cycling organizations such as the USCF recognize none of these records .
These organizations have decided that the diamond frame bike ( traditional road bike ) is the only device they will admit to the record books .
Recumbent enthusiasts insist that this is because they know that recumbents are faster and would take all records if given a chance .
Of course that 's true , but the winners of recumbent records would be the same world - class cyclists who race in the Tour De France .
So a recumbent is nt going to make you a world record holder .
You still need world class legs and lungs .
Therefore the argument that the USCF " fears " recumbents seems rather weak in that the same super athletes ( USCF members for the most part ) would still be winning .
The truth is that every sport has the right , in fact the duty , to limit the equipment that may be used .
Equipment that lends a tremendous advantage does not reflect the merits of the athlete .
Sport , after all , is supposed to be a competition of strength and skill among human beings .
Competitors should rightly be limited to similar equipment .
There was a time , sadly long past , when the Tour provided the same bikes to all competitors .
None of the above does anything to diminish the fact that most recumbents are fast bikes .
This is due predominantly to the better aerodynamics of a recumbent bicycle .
The cyclist is usually seated lower , ( wind speed near the ground is usually less than found just a couple feet higher up ) , and the seating position on most recumbents provides a smaller wind target than most upright bikes .
This translates into measurably faster speeds .
Many cyclists who ride both types of bike ( diamond frame as well as recumbents ) report 3 to 8 mph faster average speeds on the recumbent bikes .
Add to this the low seating position , and the effect is not unlike being in a low slung sports car .
Sitting low to the ground just seems faster than the same speed at a higher elevation .
Safety Virtually all falls from a recumbent dump you unceremoniously on your butt next to your bike .
It is almost impossible to go " over the bars " and land on your head .
Very few crashes result in extensive road rash as is often experienced in falls from higher bikes .
Crashes with Trikes are virtually unheard of .
It is possible to slide out in a tight turn , but if you do so on a recumbent , you will usually have a lot shorter distance to fall than you would from a regular bike .
Because of the novelty factor ( see below ) recumbents often get more attention and consideration from motorists .
View
When was the last time you were able to ride along the road looking up at soaring eagles rather than down at the pavement ahead of you ?
On a recumbent bike the view is wonderful , and you see things you never notice on an upright bike .
After a long ride , your neck is not tired from holding your head up all day .
Fun  Bents are just plain fun to ride .
It s a whole different experience .
Among recumbent enthusiasts there is something known as the " recumbent grin " .
You will see it on the face of every new recumbent rider just seconds after they master the steering and balance .
You bank into corners like a jet fighter pilot .
You are riding low and fast like an Italian roadster on a mountain road .
You can stop and rest still sitting on your bike .
Novelty
There is also a certain novelty factor in riding a recumbent , which is diminishing with each year as more and more of them are seen on the road .
Still , hardly a day goes by without some 10 year old blurting out " Cool Bike , dude ! " as you ride by .
Motorists point you out to car -mates .
Some folks just stop and stare .
Everyone smiles and waves .
Recumbent riders end up answering a lot of questions .
Many people want to know if they are hard to ride , how much they cost , how do you steer that thing ( especially the USS bikes ) , etc .
While paused at a stop sign one day , a guy in a pickup pulled up in the next lane , rolled down his window and asked me " Did your wife put that thing together for you " ?
Disabilities
Finally , there are other types of Recumbents that are designed for people who can't use their legs .
These are Handcycles , and are either " pedaled " with hand cranks or by hand - on - wheel ( like wheel chairs on steroids ) .
These tend to be Trikes , and some are amazingly fast .
There are several companies specializing in these bikes , such as Greenspeed , and Varna , and others .
There are sites that sponsor rides and races .
Reasons Against Recumbents
In spite of all the positive aspects of recumbent bicycles there are some drawbacks .
Not all bents have every one of these disadvantages , but most of them have at least one .
Some are simply perceptions , others are based in fact .
Weight Almost every recumbent weighs more than an equivalently priced road bike .
There are certain exceptions , you can buy a 21 - pound recumbent , but it will end up costing you much more than the 21 - pound diamond frame upright bicycle .
Recumbents sometimes weigh as much as 5 pounds more than the same priced traditional bike .
On flat ground , the recumbent will be faster , so who cares about weight ?
Read on .
Hill Climbing
Hill climbing on a recumbent is different than on a diamond frame bike .
First you cant stand up and charge up the hill .
You have to adapt to a different style of climbing , namely spinning high RPMs on the pedals in a low gear .
( In fact , recumbents generally improve your spinning skills and make you a better all round cyclist even on your upright ) .
Because recumbents are generally heavier , climbing problems are exacerbated by weight .
In fact one school of thought is that weight is the only reason recumbents are said to climb slower .
New recumbent riders typically climb slowly until they develop " recumbent legs " .
This can take one to three months or more depending on how often you ride .
There is something about the seating position that requires different muscle development .
Im not sure if it is because your major leg muscles are hanging from your bones in a different maner or because you are sitting on your " gluteus " .
In either case , every bent rider Ive ever met agrees that it takes different muscles to get back up to the same level of climbing performance as on your upright bike .
On the flats , this is offset immediately by the lower drag , but the hill - climbing disadvantage generally takes much longer to overcome .
However not every recumbent rider agrees that bents climb slower .
Some recumbent advocates dont ride upright bikes much and have become specialized toward the recumbent .
Because of this they cant climb well on an upright and therefore claim that recumbents climb better than upright bikes .
But those riders who switch back and forth between recumbents and uprights generally agree that recumbents do not climb as fast as upright bikes .
Knee Stress Above , I mentioned that you couldnt get up out of the saddle to climb hills .
However , just because you climb sitting down does not imply less physical stress on your legs .
Because your back is against a firm seat back , you are easily able to push harder on a recumbent than you could on an upright bike .
On the upright you cant push much more than your weight .
As soon as you do , your body rises up , and the effort is wasted lifting your body rather than turning the crank .
On a recumbent , you can push against the seat back .
You can therefore put more pressure on the pedals - and your knees .
New recumbent riders frequently complain about sore knees .
Veteran bent riders all reply in unison " Gear Down , Spin Faster " .
The advice is simple .
Downshift to an easier gear , and spin faster rather than pushing so hard .
You achieve the same speed , and its easier on the knees .
Your endurance will be enhanced as well .
It takes time to get used to it .
A cadence computer helps .
Lower Position and Visibility fears
New recumbent riders generally find themselves sitting much lower than they did on their diamond frame bike .
This can be unnerving in traffic , as it is harder to see around or over cars .
On most recumbents you are sitting with your head at the same level as the driver of a modern sedan .
This is not that low , but seems like it .
This often leads to fears that you will not be seen in traffic .
The car immediately behind you will see you just fine .
The one behind that one ( e.g. second car back ) may not see you as well if your bike is low as compared to an upright bike .
This has some ramifications when you are riding beside a steady stream of higher speed overtaking traffic .
Cars may right hook you ( turn into a driveway directly across your path ) .
Most of this is all in the head of the cyclist .
The new lower position simply rekindles old fears of being hit from behind .
Once you get used to it the lower position is not a problem .
Defensive tactics used to avoid the right hook work as well on recumbents as on uprights .
Difficulty of Rearview Because you have your back leaning against a seat back , seeing behind you can be a problem .
It requires greater effort to look back , and may involve leaning forward in your seat .
Because of this , most recumbent riders gravitate toward mirrors , either mounted on the bike or helmet / eyeglass mirrors .
The helmet / eyeglass mounted mirrors have the advantage of no blind spots .
Less Carrying Capacity
Many recumbent designs , most of them actually , have small front wheels .
This makes it difficult to hang front panniers on the bike .
Most recumbents can accommodate rear panniers just fine .
The rear tire of most recumbents is already carrying more weight than the front .
This is true in most , but not all , designs .
Some bikes are set up so that the rear wheel carries 70 % of the weight .
You compound this when you add the weight of loaded panniers .
This calls for a high - pressure tire in the rear .
Still the bike will be very tail - heavy .
This affects handling , but usually presents no serious problem .
To offset the inability ( or simply the uselessness due to small size ) of front panniers , recumbents offer a large area behind the seat that can be used to stow a lot of gear .
Often this area can be enclosed in a cloth - and - wire frame or rigid structure called a tail cone .
This makes an excellent carrying area .
Commercial versions are available , and home built tail cones are constantly being talked up on the Internet .
Tail cones generally improve the aerodynamics of the bike , or at the vary least do it no harm , and provide a large enclosed space for carrying a significant load .
They do add to the weight , but the weight gain is almost always offset by improved aerodynamics that make for a net gain in speed .
Some claims for a 30 % drag reduction are made ( on top of the already lower drag of the bike ) .
Getting Used to a Recumbent Riding a recumbent is different enough from a diamond frame bike that there is usually a period of adjustment where you master the skills .
This period of adjustment varies in length for different people and different skills .
The good news is that most people can transition to a recumbent in seconds .
My first recumbent ride was at the Ryan factory .
Dick Ryan put me on his own personal bike and said he would run along side with one hand on the seat back to prevent a crash .
After six paces , he gave up as it was clear that I would have no problem steering and balancing .
Real competency came within a week or two .
I had to plan starts and stops , and major turns for a few days .
I had to train my legs .
But I could ride instantly .
There are some differences in handling that you might initially be aware of .
Let me cover a few here .
Balancing A bicycle is a steer - balanced vehicle .
You have to steer to balance .
On upright bikes , you can also lean to steer , and lean to make small balance adjustments .
On a recumbent , your back is against a seat back .
This means you can not lean over like you would on a diamond frame bike .
It 's possible to do so , but you cant do it quickly enough to be of much value .
Therefore , recumbent riders rely to a larger degree on small steering movements to fine tune balance .
This comes naturally , as this is one of the fundamental elements of riding a bike , weather you are conscious of it or not .
You cant simply lean to the left to counteract a slow fall to the right on a recumbent as you would on an upright .
As you start falling to the right , you must turn to the right .
This brings the bike back under you and you are once more balanced .
Turning
At first , your rides on a recumbent will be sort of deliberate .
You will be conscious of planning turns , stops and starts .
This lasts about a week , varying somewhat depending on the type of recumbent , and the amount you ride .
Hint : Turns are easier once you understand the concept of counter - steering .
Counter steering means that when you want to turn right , steer left .
This causes the bike to lean to the right ( because the front wheel has moved left of the center of gravity ) .
A lean to the right is followed inevitably by a turn to the right .
Counter steering is usually more effective on a recumbent than and upright bike .
( But it 's used on uprights too ) .
Pedaling
As stated above , gear down and spin .
Even if it means going slower for a while .
It 's better for your knees , and you will be faster in the end .
Starting Out New recumbent pilots tend to be wobbly when starting out from a standing stop .
This is because you cant jump on the bike and mash a pedal before you are even seated .
Some recumbents are configured so that you can push off with your foot , others are just too low for this to work .
Doing a start smoothly requires that you have a pedal cocked and your first stroke must be fairly aggressive .
Wobbly starts add to the " geeky " look of the bike , and are something most recumbent riders aim to avoid .
Often this is just an appearance of wobbly - ness as the rider makes rapid and fairly large steering inputs , but the actual track of the bike is often just a straight as an upright bike .
Note that the appearance of wobbly starts are also the reason , rightly or wrongly , that recumbents are banned from many mass - start bike events .
Accessories
With recumbents , some of the bike clothes and accessories you thought you had to have are no longer necessary .
The first to go are the padded shorts .
Not necessary .
In fact bike shorts are not even necessary or particularly desirable .
Regular shorts work fine .
Jerseys with pockets in back or water bottle holsters are not needed .
Cycling gloves are not really needed because you will not have any weight on your hands , nor will you be reaching down to wipe glass shards from the tire .
You generally can't reach the tire .
Most recumbent riders gravitate to clipless pedals , which prevent your foot from falling off the pedal when you are tired , and improve your cadence .
You will likely want a mirror , and as stated elsewhere , helmet or eyeglass mounted mirrors work best .
Are Recumbents Better ?
Are recumbent bicycles better than the traditional diamond frame ?
The answer is not clear because the question is too broad .
They are better in some ways and not as capable in others .
Recumbents are Different .
The difference makes for a lot of fun .
They generally are faster on the road than a diamond frame bicycle .
Especially on the flats , where they often enjoy a 30 % drag reduction over a the upright .
This drag reduction makes for easier days on long rides .
Coupled with the greater ability to push against the seat back , this drag reduction can yield explosive acceleration and sustained high speed runs .
Recumbents make excellent long distance touring cycles , once you solve the carrying capacity issues with custom panniers etc .
Since you cant bunny hop on a bent , they are less well suited to trail riding than are upright bikes .
Full suspension recumbents are available and are fairly capable in rough road conditions .
There are some riders who are able to negotiate trails of moderate to intermediate difficulty on recumbents , but by and large you do not find them on single track .
Personally , I find that switching between my recumbent and my diamond frame bikes makes me a stronger cyclist .
I exercise slightly different muscles , and different cadences .
Variety is a Good Thing ( tm ) and one can never be too rich or too famous or have too many bikes .
C'mon , who here does n't want their very own supercomputer to do , um , whatever they want with ?
In an effort to make sure every man , woman and child has an absurdly powerful number cruncher in their home ( let 's go with OSPP , or One Supercomputer Per Person ) , Microsoft has tag - teamed with the fabled Cray in order to " drive high productivity computing into the mainstream . "
The Cray CX1 Supercomputer comes loaded with Windows HPC Server 2008 and incorporates up to 8 nodes and 16 Intel Xeon CPUs ( dual - or quad - core ) ; additionally , it boasts up to 4TB of internal storage , 64GB of memory per node and interoperates nicely with Linux .
The CX1 is said to be the most affordable supercomputer offered by Cray ( not to mention the " world 's highest - performing computer that uses standard office power " ) , but it 'll still run you anywhere between $ 25,000 to well over $ 60,000 .

Reagan speechwriter Noonan pans Palin : ' It 's over ' David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday September 3 , 2008
Print This Email This Peggy Noonan -- author , columnist and former speechwriter for Pres. Ronald Reagan -- made some startling observations about McCain vice presidential pick Gov. Sarah Palin on the MSNBC set at the Republican National Convention today .
Overheard on open microphones along with fellow conservative Mike Murphy after an interview with Chuck Todd , Noonan says " it 's over " in reference to the presidential race .
Todd is heard to say , " I mean , is [ Palin ] really the most qualified woman they could have turned to ? "
Noonan replies , " The most qualified ?
No .
I think they went for this , excuse me , political bullshit about narratives and youthfulness and the picture .
" Every time Republicans do that , " Noonan continues , " because that 's not where they live and it's not what they 're good at , they blow it . "
Noonan 's frank assessment is in some contrast to a rambling op - ed published in her name today at the Wall Street Journal in which she says , " The Sarah Palin choice is really going to work , or really not going to work .
It 's not going to be a little successful or a little not ; it 's not going to be a wash .
She is either going to be magic or one of history 's accidents .
She is either going to be brilliant and groundbreaking , or will soon be the target of unattributed quotes by bitter staffers shifting blame in all the Making of the President 2008 books .
Of which there should be plenty , as we 've never had a year like this , with the fabulous freak of a campaign . "
She continues , " Because she jumbles up so many cultural categories , because she is a feminist not in the Yale Gender Studies sense but the How Do I Reload This Thang way , because she is a woman who in style , history , moxie and femininity is exactly like a normal American feminist and not an Abstract Theory feminist ; because she wears makeup and heels and eats mooseburgers and is Alaska Tough , as Time magazine put it ; because she is conservative , and pro-2nd Amendment and pro-life ; and because conservatives can smell this sort of thing -- who is really one of them and who is not -- and will fight to the death for one of their beleaguered own ; because of all of this she is a real and present danger to the American left , and to the Obama candidacy .
" She could become a transformative political presence , " writes Noonan .
" So they are going to have to kill her , and kill her quick . "

MORRIS IEMMA is expected to dump Michael Costa today after late - night talks with his Labor colleagues convinced the Premier that he had no choice if he wanted to remain leader .
A senior party source told the Herald that Mr Iemma had accepted that he could not revive his beleaguered Government if Mr Costa remained .
It was not clear late last night if Mr Iemma would sack Mr Costa or if he would allow his Treasurer a face - saving resignation .
SYDNEY ( AFP ) --
A couple have fled their home in Australia and gone into hiding with their two - day - old son to avoid having him forcibly vaccinated against hepatitis B , a report said on Saturday .
The family , including the boy 's mother who was diagnosed with hepatitis B several years ago , went on the run after a court ordered them to vaccinate the newborn against the disease that can lead to liver cancer and cirrhosis , according to the Sydney Morning Herald .
"
" We gathered some things and fled the house , " " the unidentified father , a financial adviser , told the paper after leaving his Sydney home . "
" I do n't agree with the one - size - fits - all policy .
He is a small baby ( 2.49 kilograms ) and they give the same dose to babies twice his size .
I just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine .
"
" The baby 's father and Chinese - born mother went into hiding Friday when child protection authorities won a state Supreme Court order after the couple refused to have their son vaccinated following his birth in a Sydney hospital .
The couple believe aluminium in the vaccine could cause him more damage than contracting hepatitis B .
They feel the disease could be more effectively managed than any potential neurological damage they fear the child might contract from the vaccine , they told the Herald , While vaccinations are not compulsory in Australia , New South Wales state health policy mandates that parents of all babies born to hepatitis - B- positive mothers must be offered immunoglobulin for the child within 12 hours of birth and four doses of the vaccine over six months .
When the father failed to show up for a doctor 's appointment to find out more about the risks of vaccinations , he was told the child would be taken from him for vaccination , prompting the family to flee , he told the paper .
He also admitted that he had refused to have his daughter vaccinated against hepatitis B when she was born in 2005 .
One of the doctors who alerted state authorities to the couple 's refusal to have the baby vaccinated said the child 's rights were being ignored . "
" I am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse , " " said David Isaacs , a professor in pediatric infectious diseases . "
" We are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they can't make decisions for themselves , " " the Herald quoted him as saying .
The New York Times recently ran a depressing article about the obstacles faced by public school science teachers .
I do n’t envy teachers their job , as important as it is : between surly and unruly students , cash - strapped school districts , incompetent administrators , and the regimented , monotonous teaching needed to drill classes for standardized testing , they have more than enough to deal with .
But this outrage may surpass all the others : religious students who have been programmed by their parents and churches to reject evolution and any other branch of science that infringes on their sacred superstitions .
The last question on the test Mr. Campbell passed out a week later asked students to explain two forms of evidence supporting evolutionary change and natural selection .
“ I refuse to answer , ” Bryce wrote .
“ I do n’t believe in this . ”
The article mentions “ Ten Questions to Ask Your Biology Teacher About Evolution “ , a tract written by the Moonie creationist Jonathan Wells , as one that some religious students are bringing to class .
The National Center for Science Education has done a superb job answering these questions and unpacking the deceitful assumptions built into them ( and the Talk .
Origins Archive has a more in - depth response ) , so I wo n’t spend my time on that .
I have a different idea .
If the creationist churches are prepping teenagers with arguments against science , I think it ’s only fair that they get a taste of their own medicine .
I think there should be a list of questions for Sunday - school students to ask their pastor – questions that cast light on the unsavory parts of Christian theology and raise the difficult , uncomfortable issues that most religious leaders prefer to avoid .
Here are my suggestions for a list .
I ’ve done my best to raise issues that are n’t often addressed by apologists , or to phrase questions in ways that are n’t as susceptible to stock answers .
If anyone has alternatives or additions , feel free to suggest them .
1 . Why is God called loving or merciful when , in the Old Testament ’s stories of the Israelite conquest , he specifically orders his chosen people to massacre their enemies , showing no mercy to men , women , even children and animals ?
2 . Does it make sense to claim , as the Bible does , that wrongdoing can be forgiven by magically transferring the blame from a guilty person to an innocent one , then punishing the innocent person ?
3 . Why does the Bible routinely depict God as manifesting himself in dramatic , unmistakable ways and performing obvious miracles even before the eyes of nonbelievers , when no such thing happens in the world today ?
4 . Why do vast numbers of Christians still believe in the imminent end of the world when the New Testament states clearly that the apocalypse was supposed to happen 2,000 years ago , during the lifetime of Jesus ’ contemporaries ?
5 . Why do Christians believe in the soul when neurology has found clear evidence that the sense of identity and personality can be altered by physical changes to the brain ?
6 . If it was always God ’s plan to provide salvation through Jesus , why did n’t he send Jesus from the very beginning , instead of confusing and misleading generations of people by setting up a religion called Judaism which he knew in advance would prove to be inadequate ?
7 . Since the Bible states that God does not desire that anyone perish , but also states that the majority of humankind is going to hell , does n’t this show that God ’s plan of salvation is a failure even by his own standard ?
If this outcome is a success , what would count as a failure ?
8 . Why did n’t God create human beings such that they freely desire to do good , thus removing the need to create a Hell at all ?
( If you believe this is impossible , is n’t this the state that will exist in Heaven ? )
9 . Is it fair or rational for God to hide himself so that he can only be known by faith , then insist that every single human being find him by picking the right one out of thousands of conflicting and incompatible religions ?
10 .
If you had the power to help all people who are suffering or in need , at no cost or effort to yourself , would you do it ?
If so , why has n’t God done this already ?
Associated Press | August 3 , 2008
WASHINGTON — Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , whose office was a target of the anthrax attacks in 2001 , said Sunday the suicide of the government ’s main suspect does not mean the case is over .
Daschle said the FBI has not given him any new updates .
He also raised questions about the quality of the investigation , noting that the government recently paid out almost $ 6 million to a former Army scientist , Steven Hatfill , who accused authorities of unfairly targeting him in the anthrax case .
“ From the very beginning I ’ve had real concerns about the quality of the investigation , ” Daschle said in a broadcast interview .
“ Given the fact that they already paid somebody else $ 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation . ”
Five people died and 17 others were sickened when anthrax - laced letters began showing up at congressional offices , newsrooms and post offices soon after Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The case re-emerged in the news this past week as investigators prepared to charge a government scientist Bruce Ivins in the case .
Ivins died Tuesday in what has been ruled a suicide .
“ Unfortunately , it does n’t bring anything to closure , ” Daschle said .
“ This probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts . ”

Controlled demolition ?

Jim Rogers has made hundreds of millions of dollars from his investments over the years .
Last year , he made the decision to leave the US and take his money out of the US dollar .
At the time , it seemed like an extreme position to take .
Now , months later , it 's starting to make sense .
Max Keiser holds an even more extreme position , that what 's taking place is a controlled demolition of the US dollar .
It 's hard to argue with his logic .
After all , these are the same people who brought us 9/11 and the Iraq War .
What 's a multi-trillion dollar scam compared to those twin disasters ?

Read about of the new departmental groupings here .
Old Annual Survey Groupings of Doctoral Departments ( 1996 to 2011 )
Beginning with the 1996 Annual Survey of the Mathematical Sciences much of the data in these reports is presented for departments divided into groups according to several characteristics , the principal one being the highest degree offered in the mathematical sciences .
Doctorate - granting departments of mathematics are further subdivided according to their ranking of scholarly quality of program faculty as reported in the 1995 publication Research - Doctorate Programs in the United States : Continuity and Change , 1
These rankings update those reported in a previous study published in 1982.2
Consequently , the departments that now comprise Groups I , II , and III differ significantly from those used in prior surveys .
The reader should keep this in mind when attempting to make comparisons by group with previous Annual Survey reports .
A list of the departments in each of these groupings appears below .
The subdivision of the Group I institutions into Group I Public and Group I Private is new with the 1996 Annual Survey .
With the increase in number of the Group I departments from 39 to 48 , the AMS - IMS - MAA Data Committee judged that a further subdivision along the lines of public and private would provide more meaningful reporting of the data for these departments .
Brief descriptions of the departmental groupings used for the Annual Surveys from 1996 through 2011 are as follows :
Group I is composed of 48 departments with scores in the 3.00 - 5.00 range .
Group I Public and Group I Private are Group I departments at public institutions and private institutions , respectively .
Group II is composed of 56 departments with scores in the 2.00 - 2.99 range .
Group III contains the remaining US departments reporting a doctoral program , including a number of departments not included in the 1995 ranking of program faculty .
Group IV contains US departments ( or programs ) of statistics , biostatistics , and biometrics reporting a doctoral program .
Group Va contains US departments ( or programs ) in applied mathematics / applied science which report a doctoral program .
Group Vb , which is no longer surveyed as of 1998 - 99 , previously contained operations research and management science .
Group M contains US departments granting a master 's degree as the highest graduate degree .
Group B contains U.S. departments granting at most a baccalaureate degree .

Printer Friendly ... Part 2 : Introduction to Optimization Author : RolfRolles # Views : 10051
Basically , VMProtect bytecode and the IR differ from x86 assembly language in four ways :
1 ) It 's a stack machine ;
2 ) The IR contains " temporary variables " ;
3 ) It contains what I 've called a " scratch " area , upon which computations are performed rather than in the registers ;
4 ) In the case of VMProtect Ultra , it 's obfuscated ( or rather , " de- optimized " ) in certain ways .
It turns out that removing these four aspects from the IR is sufficient preparation for compilation into sensible x86 code .
We accomplish this via standard compiler optimizations applied locally to each basic block .
In general , there are a few main compiler optimizations used in this process .
The first one is " constant propagation " .
Consider the following C code .
int x = 1 ;
function (x ) ;
Clearly x will always be 1 when function is invoked : it is defined on the first line , and is not re-defined before it is used in the following line ( the definition in line one " reaches " the use in line two ; alternatively , the path between the two is " definition - clear " with respect to x ) .
Thus , the code can be safely transformed into " function ( 1 ) " .
If the first line is the only definition of the variable x , then we can replace all uses of x with the integer 1 .
If the second line is the only use of the variable x , then we can eliminate the variable .
The next is " constant folding " .
Consider the following C code .
int x = 1024 ;
function ( x * 1024 ) ;
By the above remarks , we know we can transform the second line into " function ( 1024*1024 ) ; " .
It would be silly to generate code that actually performed this multiplication at run-time : the value is known at compile - time , and should be computed then .
We can replace the second line with " function ( 1048576 ) ; " , and in general we can replace any binary operation performed upon constant values with the computed result of that operation .
Similar to constant propagation is " copy propagation " , as in the below .
void f( int i )
{
int j = i ;
g(j ) ;
}
The variable j is merely a copy of the variable i , and so the variable i can be substituted in for j until the point where either is redefined .
Lacking redefinitions , j can be eliminated entirely .
The next optimization is " dead - store elimination " .
Consider the following C code .
int y = 2 ;
y = 1 ;
The definition of the variable y on line one is immediately un - done by the one on line two .
Therefore , there is no reason to actually assign the value 2 to the variable ; the first store to y is a " dead store " , and can be eliminated by the standard liveness - based compiler optimization known as " dead - store elimination " , or more generally " dead - code elimination " .
Here 's an example from the VMProtect IR .
ecx = DWORD Scratch : [ Dword ( 44 ) ]
ecx = DWORD Scratch : [ Dword ( 20 ) ]
After dead - store - eliminating the first instruction , it turns out no other instructions use Scratch : [ Dword ( 44 ) ] , and so its previous definition can be eliminated as well .
I was listening to the radio the other day , and they were very sternly reporting on drug violations at the Olympics , and how the Russian world - record holder in short - distance running might have to return her medal for using performance enhancing drugs .
My reaction ?
GO TEAM CYBORG !
This is my reaction to a lot of things .
As a child of science fiction , hungrily devouring every story about what humans could be , I do n’t worry too much about a lot of the things that seem to get the world all het up .
I was prepared for the internet long before it showed up in my dad ’s house because I read William Gibson and Vernor Vinge and I knew what to do with a Worldnet when I got one : jump into it with love , devotion , and both feet .
And , you know , use it to watch porn .
SF raised me , and I think it did a damn fine job .
It at least removed a lot of potential sources of anxiety .
I think all athletes should be able to take drugs if they want to , and also have cybernetic enhancements .
They should be able to change and use their body however they like , to whatever extreme–let ’s mod this fucker and see what it can really do !
I do n’t worry too much about bio-proteins grown in vats .
Yes , it will taste like crap .
Everything in the future tastes like crap !
It ’s how you know you ’re in the future !
If it ’s not grey and amporphous and vaguely morally alarming , it does n’t belong in your face .
I do n’t worry about stem - cell research .
Yes , the government will try to stop it .
They will fail .
Yes , we will end up a race of mutants who have forgotten what it ’s like to be human .
It ’s gonna be awesome !
I ’m gonna get a tail , and regenerating limbs , and gills .
And all kinds of vibrating attachments so I can finally obey my spam and GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS .
I ca n’t wait !
I do n’t worry that machines will replace man–they totally will .
I for one …you know the drill .
We are going to be living down and dirty and close with garage - level AI and it is going to be so fabulous I can’t even tell you .
Yes , they will probably imprison us and use us for fuel / fodder / whatever .
They ’ll get over it .
Kids are like that .
What did you do in the backyard when no one was looking when you were a kid ?
You just wait , we ’re gonna be playing doctor with the robots in no time .
I do n’t worry too much about the growing dystopian fascism , either .
Yes , the government does listen to everything .
Of course they do !
I mean , come on .
It ’s kind of funny .
It ’s as if our government read all the dystopian SF ever and said to themselves : “ These are fantastic ideas !
Who can we get to implement these ? ”
But !
I ’ve read the same books .
Therefore , I know that dystopia is survivable and temporary , especially if run by a repressive religious nut , that there is always an underground , that Shakespeare can save me , that the human soul is essentially untouchable , and that if you can say one thing for oppressive dystopias , it ’s that they usually have some pretty bitchin’ drugs .
I do n’t worry about drugs .
Hack your body , kids .
Just learn to recognize malware .
I do n’t worry about global warming .
Yes , we will probably be forced to live underground and slowly forget that there ever was a surface world .
We will be nameless cogs in a post - industrial nightmare .
But the point is I ’m ready for that .
I have an awesome dog , after all .
And free love in the bowels of the earth will probably make up lack of vitamin D , and the architecture down there is worth the trip alone .
We ’ll come out again , we always do .
Because really , what SF taught me was that we will always survive .
There is nothing which is not survivable , nothing to which I , 21st century human female , cannot adapt .
There is nothing in which I cannot find beauty , joy , rapture .
The world will always change .
I will always change .
It ’s ok .
Science fiction will save us .
Whether you 're a beginner or a seasoned pro , there 's always something to learn about adding colour to your mix .
The world of audio effects is one that can be confusing even for experienced engineers .
Especially in modern computer - based recording systems , there 's a bewildering array of options , and to add to the confusion , some effects are widely referred to by more than one name .
In this article , I 'll take you through the most common effects , explaining how they work and where you might want to use them in your music .
Meanwhile , SOS 's team of writers has contributed a wealth of expert tips and tricks , which you can find in the boxes scattered through this article .
Let 's begin by getting clear on what we mean by ' effect ' : an effect is a device that treats the audio in some way , then adds it back to a dry or untreated version of the sound .
Echo and reverb are obvious cases , and you can use pitch - shift and pitch modulation in a similar way .
' Processors ' , by contrast , generally are those devices that change the entire signal and do n't add in any of the dry signal .
Things like compressors and equalisers fall into this category : as you 'll see from the tips and tricks , processors can often be used as effects in their own right , or as part of an effect chain , but until you know exactly what you 're doing and what the consequences are likely to be , it is a good idea to stick to these guideline definitions , as they dictate how you can connect the effects into your system .
If a device has a Mix control on it that goes from 100 percent wet ( effect only ) to 100 percent dry ( clean only ) , then you can be pretty sure it is an effect .
If it does n't have a Mix control , and does n't rely on electronic delays to create its results , then it is probably safe to assume it is a processor .
Effects can be connected via insert points , or the effect send and return loop that is included in most consoles and DAWs ( Digital Audio Workstations ) .
When effects are used in the send / return loop , their Mix control should be set to 100 percent wet , so you add back only effected sound to the dry sound , which comes directly through the mixer channel .
Processors , on the other hand , comprise an entirely different water heating appliance filled with piscean vertebrates , as they tend not to need any of the dry sound , other than in a few specialist applications .
As a rule , processors such as EQ and compression are connected only via track , bus or master insert points — at least until you have the necessary experience to understand why you might want to break the rules once in a while .
Having got that off my chest , let 's look at some specific effects ( we 'll look more closely at processors another time ) .
Tips & Tricks : Filters
You get very different results from your filtering depending on where you put the filter in the signal chain .
To introduce some real movement into delay lines , for example , place sweeping low - pass filters before the delay .
You then get the movement of the dry sound contrasting with the movement in the delay line .
If both the filter sweep and the delay lines are tempo-sync'd , you can create interesting effects where the filter appears to be moving up and down at the same time .
Filters are also great for use on drum loops .
One trick I like is to send the drums to a modulated resonant filter set up as a send effect , with a narrow band - pass EQ beforehand .
This creates a rather bizarre metallic melody that accompanies your drums .
It can get fatiguing if over - used , but brought in at a low level in some sections of a song , it can create plenty of interest , particularly if followed by a modulated delay .
Matt Houghton
Echo and delay are created by copying the original signal in some way , then replaying it a short time later .
There 's no exact natural counterpart , though the strong reflections sometimes heard in valleys or tunnels appear as reasonably distinct echoes .
Early echo units were based on tape loops , before analogue charge - coupled devices eliminated the need for moving parts .
Today , most delay units are digital , but they often include controls to help them emulate the characteristics of the early tape units , including distortion and low - pass filtering in the delay path and pitch modulation to emulate the wow and flutter of a well - used tape transport .
While pure digital delay produces perfect echoes , an analogue emulation can be more musically useful , as each successive echo becomes less distinct , creating a sense of distance and perspective .
Hi - fi echoes tend to confuse the original sound , while the human hearing system seems better able to separate lo-fi echoes from the original clean sound .
The feedback control regulates the number of echoes by feeding some of the output back to the input .
If you apply too much feedback the delay unit will self - oscillate — an effect often used in dub music .
Delay normally relates to a setting with no feedback whereas echo uses feedback to produce a series of diminishing repeats .
You do n't have to use long , distinct delays : short delays up to 120 ms can be used to create vocal doubling effects , normally set with little or no feedback .
Nor do you have to dedicate a delay to a single sound : you can configure it via an aux send so that several tracks can be treated with different amounts of the same delay or echo treatment , which not only saves on processing power ( or buying separate units ! ) , but can help to make elements of your mix work better together .
You can often use a tap - tempo or tempo sync facility to get your echoes exactly in time with the song if that 's the effect you need , but many echo / delay plug-ins can be locked to your sequencer 's master tempo , enabling you to create precise , rhythmic delay effects .
Tips & Tricks : Panning
One special effect I used quite a lot in analogue studios , but which is surprisingly tricky to implement in a lot of software sequencers , is where you feed the left and right outputs of an auto - pan effect to two different effects processors .
With this setup , the outputs of the two effects can then be mixed together to create a variety of different modulation - style treatments .
This patch always worked well in a send - return loop with a pair of phasers , especially if you also EQ'd the two returns wildly differently .
The same setup used as an insert could do great things with distortion and ring - modulation processors , and if you were feeling really adventurous , you could fiddle with the panning rate in real time while mixing down .
Mike Senior
I think it 's fair to say that we all have a pretty good idea of what reverb is , though there are several ways of emulating it in the studio .
Early reverb chambers , plates and springs have now given way to digital solutions , which fall into two main camps : synthetic and convolution .
Synthetic reverbs take an algorithmic approach , setting up multiple delays , filters and feedback paths to create a dense reverberation effect similar to what you might hear in a large room .
Though these often sound a bit ' larger than life ' , they 've been used on so many hit records that we now tend to accept their sound as being the ' correct ' one for pop music production .
Most can approximate the sound of rooms , halls , plates and chambers , but in comparison with a real reverberant environment , the early reflections often seem to be too pronounced .
The advantage of a synthetic reverb is that the designer can give the user plenty of controls for altering the apparent room size , brightness , decay time and so on .
In recent years , convolution reverbs have become both affordable and commonplace .
These differ from synthetic reverbs insomuch as they work from impulse responses ( or IRs ) , recorded in real spaces to faithfully recreate the ambience at the microphone 's position when the IR was made .
Sometimes these are referred to as sampling reverbs but there 's no sampling involved as such , even though the process seems akin to sampling the sonic signature of a room , hall or other space .
Because IRs can be recorded in virtually any space , convolution reverbs generally come with a library of IRs ranging from small live rooms to famous venues , top studio rooms , forests , canyons , railway stations and just about anything else you can think of .
They sound very convincing , and there 's plenty of variety to be had , but once the IR is loaded , there 's only a limited amount of editing you can do without spoiling the natural sound .
Usually you can apply EQ and also change the envelope of the reverb decay to make it shorter , and adding pre-delay is not a problem , but after that you pretty much have to take what you get .
Some companies , such as Waves , have managed to create additional controls but , as a rule , the further you move from the original IR , the less natural the end result .
Ironically , the sound of certain synthetic reverbs is now such an established part of music history that most convolution reverbs come with some IRs taken from existing hardware reverb units or from old mechanical reverb plates .
Also , if you have a convolution reverb , it is worth checking the manufacturer 's site , as additional IRs are frequently available for download .
All serious reverb units have a stereo output to emulate the way sound behaves in a real space and , in the case of convolution models , the IRs are often recorded in stereo , using two microphones .
Some surround reverbs are also available .
Reverb creates a sense of space , but it also increases the perception of distance .
If you need something to appear at the front of a mix , a short , bright reverb may be more appropriate than a long , warm reverb , which will have the effect of pushing the sound into the background .
If you need to make the reverb sound ' bigger ' , a pre-delay ( a gap between the dry and wet signals ) of up to 120 ms can help to do this without pushing the sound too far back , or obscuring it .
Though reverb increases the sense of stereo width , it dilutes the sense of stereo position .
If you want to pinpoint the placement of something in a mix , you should consider using a mono rather than a stereo reverb , and panning this to the same place as the dry sound .
Most synthetic reverbs allow you to balance the level of the early reflections and the later , more dense reverb tail .
If you want to keep the sense of space but without the reverb tail taking up too much space in your mix , you can increase the early reflection level and reduce the tail level .
As a rule , you do n't add much , if any , reverb to low - frequency sounds , such as bass guitar or kick drums .
Where you need to add reverb to these sources , short ambient space emulations usually work better than big washy reverbs , which tend to make things sound muddy .
Taking this a step further , you can also make a mix sound less congested by EQ'ing some low end out of your reverbs .
Tips & Tricks : Amp Modelling
One of the most useful features of guitar - amp simulation plug-ins is that they can help mask some quite serious problems with whatever you 're putting through them , without necessarily changing it beyond all recognition .
I 've found that even relatively clean settings can disguise such horrors as clipping on transients to a surprising extent .
If you 're ever faced with a badly recorded guitar part ( even one that 's played on an acoustic guitar , or through an amp ) , try putting it through an amp modeller .
As described elsewhere in this article , pitch - shifting can work well in conjunction with amp simulation , but other ways of editing and processing the raw guitar file before it goes through the amp modeller also yield interesting results .
Reverse reverb , resonation , vocoding and Auto - Tune can all produce distinctive effects .
Try chopping small sections of guitar out , for an interesting stuttering effect that 's nothing like tremolo .
A piece of guitar that 's been reversed before being fed through an amp modeller sounds quite different to what you get by reversing a guitar part that 's already been through an amp , and this technique can be very effective .
Likewise , recording three or four separate tracks of single guitar notes and routing them simultaneously through the same guitar amp simulator sounds very different from playing chords .
Sam Inglis Re-amping a DI 'd keyboard or bass can really liven up a sound , but if you do n't have access to a nice amp or amp modeller , you can simulate the effect by sending the audio to a bus with a delay plug - in set to a short delay time and with the wet signal set to 100 percent and dry to 0 percent .
Then send the bus 's output to another bus with a distortion ( or better still , a guitar amplifier emulator ) plug - in inserted .
This simulates the delay you get from miking up a speaker , and if you blend this in with the DI 'd sound , it can give the recording a live feel — especially if you use a convolution reverb to add some ' room ' ambience .
You may also want to roll off the very low and high frequencies to help get rid of that DI 'd vibe .
Nicholas Rowland
Effects such as chorus , phasing , flanging and pitch vibrato are created using pitch modulation and , except in the case of vibrato , the modulated sound is added back to the original to create the effect .
The pitch modulation is generated by delaying the signal by just a few milliseconds , and then modulating the delay time , using a low frequency oscillator ( or LFO ) .
For vibrato , this is all that needs to be done and , because the delay time is actually very short , the effect is perceived as happening in real time .
The other effects , however , generally rely on an equal balance of the dry and modulated signals to achieve the strongest effect , so it is easier when working with plug-ins to adjust the wet / dry balance using the plug - in controls , rather than adding the wet only signal via a send / return loop .
As a rule , these effects are n't very processor - intensive so , if you 're working with plug-ins , you can probably afford to insert as many as you need into track or bus insert points as required .
Stereo versions of these plug-ins may generate different modulated delays for the left and right channels to create a more dramatic spatial effect .
Chorus and flanging are created in fairly similar ways , the main difference being that chorus does n't use feedback from the input to the output and generally employs slightly longer delay times .
Phasing is similar to both chorus and flanging , but uses much shorter delay times .
Feedback may be added to strengthen the swept filter effect it creates .
Phasing is far more subtle than flanging and is often used on guitar parts .
With chorus , phasing and flanging , the delay time , modulation speed and modulation depth affect the character of the effect very significantly .
A generic modulated delay plug - in allows you to create all these effects by simply altering the delay time , feedback , modulation rate and modulation depth parameters .
Most of the time , low modulation depths tend to work well for faster LFO speeds ( often also referred to as the rate ) , while deeper modulation works better at slower modulation rates .
Chorus is useful for ' softening ' rhythm guitar or synth pad sounds , but it does tend to push sounds further back into the mix , so it should be used with care .
Adding more brightness to the sound can help compensate for this effect .
Chorus also works well on fretless bass , but tends to sound quite unnatural on vocals .
Phasing can be used in a similar way to chorus but , whereas chorus creates the impression of two slightly detuned instruments playing the same part , phasing sounds more like a single sound source being filtered , where the frequencies being ' notched out ' vary as the LFO sweeps through its cycle .
Flanging is the strongest of the standard modulation effects .
The feedback control increases the depth of the ' comb filtering ' produced when a delayed signal is added back to itself .
Because it is such a distinctive effect , it is best used sparingly , though it can also be used to process a reverb send to add a more subtle complexity to the reverbed sound .
Though modulated delays are essentially effects , the need to balance the dry and delayed sounds as a means of regulating the effect strength means that using these devices via insert points makes them much more controllable than trying to use them in an effects send / return loop .
If you do use them as a send effect , you can achieve this balance by automating the send level .
Tips & Tricks : Dynamic Effect Modulation ( MIDI Control )
One of my favourite hardware effect units is the Electrix Mo-FX ( sadly no longer in production ) .
It is superbly constructed for hands - on performance and it offers full MIDI control over the panel 's knobs and buttons .
I use this in conjunction with the Sequentix P3 ( a hardware step sequencer ) .
Not only can the P3 generate patterns of controllers suitable for varying multiple Mo-FX parameters , but it can generate evolving or shifting patterns , courtesy of its ' accumulators ' .
In a nutshell , accumulators are designed to prevent your sequences becoming annoyingly repetitive : controller values ( actually values directed at any internal sequencer parameter ) can be added or subtracted on each pass of the pattern , with rules and limits directing the behaviour as the accumulation progresses .
Digging through the Mo-FX manual quickly reveals all the MIDI Continuous Controllers you need .
Usefully , you can also trigger the tap - tempo function via MIDI , and this offers a rather wonderful way of generating clock intervals .
As you can decide exactly where to place your tap - tempo trigger events , and the P3 sequencer can shift or vary these events according to rules you devise , you can find clock sync intervals unseen on any other device .
Paul Nagle
Pitch - shifters work by slicing the incoming audio into extremely short sections ( typically a few tens of milliseconds long ) and then lengthening each section where the pitch is to be decreased , or shortening each section where the pitch is to be increased .
Though cross-fading algorithms and other techniques are used to hide the splice points , most pitch - shifters tend to sound grainy or warbly when used to create large amounts of shift ( a couple of semitones or more ) , though they can sound very natural when used to create subtle detuning effects , using shifts of a few cents .
A refinement of the system , designed for use with monophonic sources , attempts to synchronise the splicing process with whole numbers of cycles of the input signal , which makes the whole thing sound a lot smoother but , as soon as you present these devices with chords or other complex sounds , the splices again become audible .
Though some sophisticated processors combine pitch detection with pitch - shifting , to generate musically correct harmonies in user - defined keys , simple pitch - shifters always change the pitch by the same number of cents or semitones .
In musical terms , that means that only the octaves , parallel fourths and fifths are very useful .
Other intervals tend to sound discordant , as they do n't follow the intervals dictated by typical musical scales .
When using subtle detuning to thicken a sound , I suggest trying values of between five and 10 cents and , where possible , adding both positive and negative shifts , to keep the pitch centre correct .
Then combine with the dry sound and adjust the level to control the subjective depth of the effect .
This is very effective for fattening up guitar solos or backing vocals .
By putting a pitch - shifter before a delay , then feeding some of the output of the delay back to the input of the pitch shifter , you can create delays that keep climbing or falling in pitch as they recirculate .
Though not always very useful in a musical context , this effect is often used in TV and film dream sequences .
Because large pitch - shifts can sound grainy , it is common to combine the effect with the dry signal , rather than using only the 100 percent effected signal , though ultimately this is an artistic rather than technical decision .
Though pitch - shifting is an effect , it is easier to control when used via an insert point .
However , if you need to use the effect on several tracks in varying amounts , you can use it via a send / return loop , providing the shifter is set to 100 percent wet .
That way , you can adjust the effects depth for individual mix channels by using the send control feeding the pitch - shifter .
Tips & Tricks : Circuit Bending
There are an awful lot of boutique guitar effects manufacturers out there who make pedals designed to create all kinds of twisted and bizarre sounds .
Sadly , their products are often very expensive , often prohibitively so — so what about the more budget - conscious would - be sonic terrorist ?
Well , one option is to ' circuit bend ' more conventional ( read ' cheaper ' ) guitar effects .
The basic idea behind circuit bending is that you experiment with short - circuiting the pedal until it makes a noise that you like , and then solder in a connection , with a switch or potentiometer in place if you think you may want to turn the noise off again at some point .
Guitar pedals are perfect for this .
Firstly , and perhaps most importantly , because you should never try to circuit bend anything mains - powered , they can run off 9V batteries .
Secondly , their internal circuitry is usually very simple , and they already have audio I/O .
Thirdly , you can get them for almost no money from eBay , and the other tools required — soldering iron , wire , switches , and so on — are also very cheap .
There 's an almost infinite number of sonic possibilities to be explored here , from finding new ways to process a signal ( of course you do n't just have to use them with guitars ) to creating a machine that goes ' Eeeeeeooooowsquelch blipipipip ' in a different way every time you turn it on — and who would say no to that for less than a tenner ?

By contrast , tuning ( or pitch ) correction processors and plug-ins are normally considered processors rather than effects , but they do have creative uses .
The idea behind these devices is to monitor the pitch of the incoming signal , then compare it to a user - defined scale , which can be a simple chromatic scale or any combination of notes .
Pitch - shifting techniques are then used to nudge the audio to the nearest semitone in the user 's scale but , because the amount of pitch - shift required is usually quite small , the result does n't sound grainy or lumpy , as often happens when large amounts of pitch - shift are generated .
Because pitch tracking is used to identify the original pitch , only monophonic signals can be treated .
When used with the human voice , it is important that the pitch correction does n't happen too quickly , otherwise all the natural slurs and vibrato will be stripped out leaving you with a very unnatural and robotic vocal sound .
If only a few notes need fixing , consider automating the pitch - corrector 's correction speed parameter so that it is normally too slow to have any significant effect , then increase the speed just for the problem sections .
This prevents perfectly good audio from being processed unnecessarily .
If you stick to a simple chromatic scale ( all the semitones ) , you also run the risk of the pitch correction moving the audio to the wrong note if the singer is more than half a semitone off pitch .
A user scale , containing only the desired notes , generally works much better .
Some systems also allow you to dictate the correct notes via MIDI .
If the song contains sections in different keys or that use different scales , it is often simplest to split the vocal part across several tracks and then use a different pitch - corrector on every track , each one set to the appropriate scale for the section being processed .
If your audio track suffers from a lot of spill , or includes chords , the pitch correction may not work correctly .
Where spill is loud enough to be audible , you 'll hear this being modulated in pitch alongside the wanted part of the audio as it is corrected .
As a rule , chords are ignored , so guitar solos , bowed stringed instruments and bass parts ( including fretless ) can be processed , and only single notes will be corrected .
The main creative application for pitch correction is the so - called ' Cher effect ' , which is achieved by setting the tracking speed as fast as possible to deliberately generate a robotic - sounding result .
It 's a matter of taste , but for me , this is one effect that has already been done to death !
Tips & Tricks : Delay Tempo Delay :
Most plug - in and hardware delays now allow you to automatically sync delay times to MIDI clock and then specify the interval of the repeats in terms of note values rather than milliseconds .
A trick here is to use two simultaneous tempo- based delays with , say , a triplet delay setting , panned hard left , and a straight - note delay panned hard right .
Things can get more interesting still if you apply this technique using ping - pong delays , so that alternate repeats bounce from one side of the stereo spectrum to the other .
To create a true 3D effect , play around with the amount of original signal left in the middle .
Depending on the intervals between your repeats , you can turn simple guitar and synth lines into complex , arpeggiator - like patterns or totally spaced out ambient pieces .
Stephen Bennett Ostentatious Delays :
If you 're making very rhythmic music of any kind , it makes sense to use tempo-sync 'd delays , to avoid undermining the main pulse .
However , simple tempo-sync'ed delays tend to be masked by the main rhythmic stresses , so they sink into the background of the mix unless mixed very high in level , which makes it difficult to create ostentatious delay effects in rhythmic music without swamping your mix .
One solution to this problem , very common in trance music , is to set a delay to a three - 16th - note duration , which means that although the delay repeats never step outside the 16th - note grid , they 'll often miss the main beats and therefore remain clearly audible .
Mike Senior Keep
It Reel : Perhaps because a humble tape echo was the first effect I ever owned , delay has always been my primary effect .
Whether to liven up repetitive loops or add apparent complexity to simple solos , it 's worth getting to grips with delay the old - fashioned way .
This means daring to switch off MIDI sync and manually setting delay time , driving feedback to the brink of madness , or routing the pure delay output through equalisers , filters and so on .
Many of today 's digital delays allow you to darken the delay iterations , but there 's no reason not to find your own method to achieve this : adding alternative colours and discovering your own favourite processes .
I find precise , perfect digital delays can be rather generic and characterless — so the more I delve into additional treatments , the more interesting and organic the results are .
Paul Nagle Softer Delays : I 'll usually have at least a couple of delays as auxiliary effects in a rock or pop mix , but I often find that bringing the general level of the delay as high as I want it makes any transients stand out too much .
When I 'm sending single notes on a clean electric guitar to a delay line , say , I tend to want to hear a wash of sound , not the rhythmic ' CHA - Cha - cha - cha - cha ' of a repeated note attack .
For this reason , I 'll often put a gate or expander before a delay , with an attack time set to 10 ms or so .
This is enough to ' chop off ' any abrupt transients , and makes the delay sound much smoother .
Sam Inglis Non-sync'd Delay :
We are so used to perfectly sync'd delays that it 's easy to forget that manual sync and a pair of ears has a charm all of its own .
Even delay times that bear no obvious relationship to the tempo can add dynamic movement and feel to a track : check out some early King Tubby if you need reminding of this .
Paul Nagle Subtlety :
You do n't always have to make longer echo or delay effects obvious in the mix for them to be effective .
Once you 've set up the delay times and panned them to suit your song , try dropping the delay levels until you scarcely notice them during most of the mix ( listening on headphones often helps set the most suitable level ) .
This generally results in intriguing little ripples of repeats that you notice at the end of verses or during pauses , that add interest and low - level detail to the mix .
Martin Walker
Technically , distortion is defined as being any change to the original signal other than in level .
However , we tend not to think of processes such as EQ and compression as distortion , and the term is more commonly used to describe processes that change the waveform in some radical and often level - dependent way .
These include guitar overdrive , fuzz , and simply overdriving analogue circuitry or tape to achieve ' warmth ' .
In the analogue domain , heavy overdrive distortion is usually created by adding a lot of gain to the signal to provoke deliberate overloading in a specific part of the circuit .
Such high levels of gain invariably bring up the level of hum and background noise , so it may be helpful to gate the source .
Though overdriving analogue circuitry is the traditional way of creating intentional distortion , we now have many digital simulations , as well as some new and entirely digital sound - mangling algorithms .
The most musically satisfying types of distortion tend to be progressive , where the audio waveform becomes more ' squashed ' as the level increases .
Hard clipping , by contrast , tends to sound harsh .
All these types of distortion introduce additional harmonics into the signal , but it is the level and proportion of the added harmonics that creates the character of the sound .
Harmonically related distortion can be added at much higher levels than non-harmonically related distortion before the human hearing system recognises it as such , so there is no way to define a percentage of distortion below which audio is acceptable or above which it is unacceptable .
The reason that digital distortion has its own character , which most people find less musically pleasant , is because it is not usually harmonically related to the input signal .
For example , quantisation distortion , which results from sampling at too low a bit depth , sounds quite ugly , though many dance and industrial music producers have found a use for it , and some plug-ins deliberately introduce it .
The use of overdrive distortion as a musical effect probably originated with electric guitar amplifiers , where the less pleasant upper harmonics created by overdriving the amp are filtered out by the limited frequency response of the speaker .
If you use a distortion plug - in without following it up with low - pass filtering ( or a speaker simulator ) in this way , you may hear a lot of raspy high - end that is n't musically useful .
This is why electric guitar DI 'd via a fuzz box or distortion pedal sounds thin and buzzy unless further processed to remove these high frequencies .
The warmth associated with tube equipment and analogue tape is quite subtle when compared with deliberate overdrive effects .
As a rule , if you 're trying simply to warm up a sound and you can hear the distortion , you should back off it a little , as there 's probably too much of it .
Adding a little distortion to sounds such as drums , electronic organs , and even vocals , can help them stand out in a mix , and give substance to a sound that 's too thin or uneven .
Software guitar amp models often sound more convincing if you use external guitar pedals to create overdrive prior to the audio interface .
Effects are fun , and can make mixing a more creative process , but it 's worth bearing in mind that they wo n't help in situations where the basic principles of recording have been ignored !
Used with care , effects can help turn a good mix into a great one , but they are seldom successful in covering up other problems .
It is also very easy to over - use them — sometimes their most valuable control is the bypass button , and it is certainly worth learning to use the basic effects well before throwing lots of complicated tricks at your sound .
As long as you let your ears decide what is right , you should be OK , and a little critical listening to your favourite records will give you a feel for what works and what does n't .
Tips & Tricks : Reverb Decay Settings : Choosing the most appropriate reverb treatment for a song can be surprisingly difficult , especially if you have hundreds of presets to choose from .
So , instead of regarding reverb like the glue that holds the mix together , try adjusting its parameters ( and in particular the decay time ) while listening to the reverb return by itself .
If the decay time is too long you 'll hear a continuous mush of sound ; if it 's too short you 'll scarcely hear it unless its level is turned right up .
Somewhere in the middle you should find a setting that adds rhythmic interest to your song , without overpowering it , making the reverb work for its keep .
This is also a useful technique when using several reverbs in a song , to make sure they complement each other .
Martin Walker Pre-delay : No pre-delay ?
No problem !
Some reverb plug-ins , from freeware favourites to tasty convolution types , do n't offer pre-delay — a user - configurable gap before the onset of a reverb 's early reflections and tail .
It 's useful to have , though , as it can contribute to the clarity and separation of individual voices and instruments in a mix when large amounts of reverb are used .
Using most software DAWs it 's straightforward to rig up a pre-delay for a reverb ( or any other effect ) that does n't have one .
All you do is set up your reverb on an aux track or channel , but place a simple delay plug - in in a slot above it .
Set both plug - ins ' wet / dry mix parameters to 100 percent wet , and feed them some audio using an aux send on your normal audio tracks .
Now the delay plug - in operates as a pre-delay for the reverb : easy !
This kind of ' modular ' pre-delay actually opens up some interesting possibilities .
By using a multi-tap delay , or a simple delay with some feedback , your dry signal can be fed to the reverb several times , making for longer , more complex — or plain weird — reverb tails .
Robin Bigwood Wet Set :
If you have a sound that you want to push a long way back in the mix , it can often be better to make your reverb effect pre-fader , and temporarily remove all the dry sound .
Then alter the sound 's EQ and reverb settings while listening only to the wet reverb sound .
Once you 've got that sounding good , gradually fade the dry sound back in until you 're happy with the wet / dry balance .
This approach can often be more effective than simply whacking up the reverb level while you listen to the whole song .
Martin Walker Combining Reverbs :
You do n't have to generate all of the reverb sound from a single plug - in , and using two different reverbs can also help you to save CPU power .
For example , though a nice convolution reverb gives a good , believable sound , long impulse responses tend to eat up CPU .
By using the convolution reverb for the early reflections , and then using something like Logic 's Platinumverb or Waves Trueverb to add the reverb tail — which is less critical to our perception of the sound — you should get a convincing but less processor - intensive result .

Tips & Tricks : MIDI Effects
Do n't forget that you can create audio - style effects purely through MIDI .
For example , using a grid - style sequencer , it 's very easy to program in echo and delay effects , just by drawing in the repeated notes and then putting a velocity curve over the top to simulate the echoes fading away .
By combining this with automated MIDI control of other parameters — reverb send , filter cutoff and resonance , for example — you can alter the timbre of the repeated note and create dubby - sounding , feedback - style delays .
Stephen Bennett
They may not always be the first thing you reach for , but the MIDI effects plug-ins that come with most DAW applications like Logic and Cubase often offer something very different from most audio plug-ins .
For example , arpeggiators and step sequencers can be great for use in the composition process , and you can use MIDI note to controller data ( CC ) plug-ins to generate automation data for the parameters of other plug-ins .
As they process only MIDI data , and not audio , MIDI plug - ins put very little strain on your computer .
Matt Houghton
Tips & Tricks : Explore Your Synths !
You do n't have to create audio effects in your sequencer .
For example , I use the Access Virus synth , which features a simple delay effect , with the added bonus that all its parameters are available in the modulation matrix .
One favourite trick involves routing velocity to the delay colour parameter .
For parts that get brighter with increased velocity , it adds extra animation and bite if the echoes also get brighter .
Unusually , the Virus also features four - way audio panning , so you can position an audio signal anywhere between the main stereo outputs and a second pair .
If the second pair of outputs is routed to an external effects unit , you can play with the concept of moving a note around in a space , where its position also determines the treatment it gets .
More fun can be had by modulating reverb time and colour via an LFO .
The same LFO can then be used to control filter cutoff , EQ frequency and maybe wavetable position too ( if your Virus is a TI ) .
In this way , timbral changes happen at the same time as effect changes .

Tips & Tricks : Pitch - shifting Vocal Widening :
One of the send effects I most frequently use at mixdown has got to be the classic vocal - widening patch that I always associate with the vintage AMS DMX1580 delay unit .
From a mono send a stereo ADT - style effect is created using two pitch - shifting delay lines , panned hard left and right .
Normally , I set the first channel to 9ms delay , with a pitch shift of - 5 cents , and the other channel to an 11 ms delay , with +5 cents of pitch shift .
That said , though , I will often tweak the delay times a few milliseconds either way , as this can dramatically alter the effect 's tonality .
Mike Senior Processed Pitch Shifts :
Few pitch - shifting algorithms are transparent enough to allow you to transpose anything by more than a couple of semitones without obvious side - effects .
If what you 're processing is going through an amp modeller , however , you can get away with much more radical changes .
You can even do effective swoops and dives in pitch by progressively increasing the amount of pitch - shifting you apply to a note , and pitch changes of an octave or more can sound good , although they probably wo n't sound natural at these extremes .
Sam Inglis
Tips & Tricks : Spot Effects
Modern audio sequencers make it very easy to play around with spot effects — that is , effects which are applied to single notes or phrases within a track , rather than to a pattern or track as a whole .
Try using different reverb styles on the snare within drum patterns : a short decay on the ' 2 ' and a long decay on the ' 4 ' for example .
Another idea is to apply spot chorus to individual words within a vocal line , as a way of adding emphasis to the lyrics .
The ' freeze ' or audio bounce - down function of a typical sequencer allows you to get around any problems your computer might have in running lots of instances of a particular effect .
Stephen Bennett
Tips & Tricks : Reverse Reverb
An enduringly popular effect , with all sorts of uses for vocals , drums , guitars and synths , is genuine reverse reverb .
This is where a reverb tail appears to increase in volume ahead of the sound that gives rise to it — a completely unnatural sound and something that 's impossible to create in real time .
It 's easy enough to do in a DAW application though .
First , find the section of audio you want to treat and reverse it .
In the DAW I use , Digital Performer , there 's an offline plug - in for this .
Now apply conventional reverb to this ' backwards ' audio — either by playing it through a reverb plug - in and recording it to another track , or by rendering it using an offline process ( if your DAW offers this ) .
In either case make sure you allow enough additional time at the end of the audio to capture the full , final reverb tail .
In the screen grab I 've done this by allowing 1500 milliseconds of post - roll processing .
Then , reverse the resulting audio .
The original audio plays correctly once more , but the reverb you just applied is reversed .
You may need to manually realign the audio in your track , to accommodate the extra length of the first reversed reverb tail .
Robin Bigwood
Tips & Tricks : Distortion
For me , the hardest part of mixing is getting the vocals to sit properly .
There are a lot of tricks you can apply that can help , but I think one of the most useful is to send the vocal to a bus and insert a compressor there , with a high ratio of around 10:1 or more .
Set a low threshold , and a medium attack and release , then , in the next slot , load a distortion plug - in with a warmish sound .
Use high - and low - pass filters , set to around 100 Hz and 5KHz respectively , and mix a small amount back in alongside the lead vocals .
You do n't need to add much — it should be almost ' subliminal ' — but it can really help to fit the vocal in the track .

Tips & Tricks : Hands - on Control A direct user interface can give far more musically rewarding results than dozens of parameters , menus and alpha dials .
Often , even a panel of knobs is n't anywhere near as natural to play as , say , a Korg Kaoss Pad .
Here 's something Kaoss Pad 3 owners can try at home : choose effect DL2 ( Smooth Delay ) in which the pad controls delay time on the X - axis and depth on the Y - axis .
Next route your favourite solo patch through it and set the FX depth to about 12 o'clock .
Solo wildly whilst simultaneously stroking the top right - hand corner of the Kaoss Pad with short , circular motions .
With practice , you should be able to produce delicate pitch sweeps as the delay shifts in time .
As you control depth by vertical motion , practise diagonal upwards sweeps followed by vertical downward ones to smoothly dampen the effect .
Hey , it takes years to master the violin , so a few evenings spent waggling your finger over flashing LEDs should n't be too arduous .
Next try the same technique with lush solo pads : simple yet devastatingly effective !

Without a way to measure religious beliefs , anthropologists have had difficulty studying religion .
Now , two anthropologists from the University of Missouri and Arizona State University have developed a new approach to study religion by focusing on verbal communication , an identifiable behavior , instead of speculating about alleged beliefs in the supernatural that cannot actually be identified .
" Instead of studying religion by trying to measure unidentifiable beliefs in the supernatural , we looked at identifiable and observable behavior - the behavior of people communicating acceptance of supernatural claims , " said Craig T. Palmer , associate professor of anthropology in the MU College of Arts and Science .
" We noticed that communicating acceptance of a supernatural claim tends to promote cooperative social relationships .
This communication demonstrates a willingness to accept , without skepticism , the influence of the speaker in a way similar to a child 's acceptance of the influence of a parent . "
Palmer and Lyle B. Steadman , emeritus professor of human evolution and social change at Arizona State University , explored the supernatural claims in different forms of religion , including ancestor worship ; totemism , the claim of kinship between people and a species or other object that serves as the emblem of a common ancestor ; and shamanism , the claim that traditional religious leaders in kinship - based societies could communicate with their dead ancestors .
They found that the clearest identifiable effect of religious behavior is the promotion of cooperative family - like social relationships , which include parent / child - like relationships between the individuals making and accepting the supernatural claims and sibling - like relationships among co-acceptors of those claims .
" Almost every religion in the world , including all tribal religions , use family kinship terms such as father , mother , brother , sister and child for fellow members , " Steadman said .
" They do this to encourage the kind of behavior found normally in families - where the most intense social relationships occur .
Once people realize that observing the behavior of people communicating acceptance of supernatural claims is how we actually identify religious behavior and religion , we can then propose explanations and hypotheses to account for why people have engaged in religious behavior in all known cultures .

Editor 's note : Peter Bergen is CNN 's national security analyst and a fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington and at New York University 's Center on Law on Security .
His most recent book is " The Osama bin Laden I Know : An Oral History of al Qaeda 's Leader . "
Peter Bergen says the next president could face a key decision on Israel and Iran .
( CNN ) --
Toward the end of Friday 's presidential debate , the conversation turned to Iran and there was a long back - and - forth between the two candidates about what kind of conditions should be set for any discussions with the Iranian government .
But neither addressed what could be the most important foreign policy issue either might face as president : a unilateral strike by Israel against Iranian nuclear facilities .
Israeli officials are clearly seriously contemplating such a strike , as Iran is believed to be drawing near to having a nuclear capability that those officials believe poses an existential threat to Israel .
Such a strike would probably immensely complicate U.S. efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan as the Iranians would probably retaliate against American targets in both countries after such an attack .
During the next debate , each candidate should be asked , " If you receive intelligence or warning that Israel is about to strike Iran 's nuclear facilities , what would you do ? "
Sorting out the correct American policy in such an eventuality is exactly the tough kind of call that will help define the next president .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan both play to some of the key strengths and weaknesses of Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain .
McCain , of course , was a strong proponent of the Iraq war , and as the country devolved into anarchy , he also became an outspoken supporter of " the surge . "
Obama opposed both the Iraq war and later the surge , and his opposition has , in part , revolved around the fact that the Afghan war is still unfinished business , as is the fight against al Qaeda .
And so , as was to be expected when Iraq took center stage in Friday 's debate , McCain emphasized the success of the surge and the new counterinsurgency strategy overseen by Gen.
David Petraeus , while Obama needled McCain for largely ignoring the failures and costs of the Iraq war between 2003 and 2007 .
Lost in this discussion was the fact that while the surge of some 30,000 American soldiers certainly put more American boots on the ground in neighborhoods from Anbar province to Baghdad to " clear , hold and build " them and was clearly an important element in the sharp decline in violence in the country , there are several other key underlying factors that tamped down the mayhem in Iraq that neither of the candidates addressed :
• First , the appearance in 2006 of the various " Awakening " movements , in which Sunni tribes once allied with al Qaeda turned against it .
• Second , the implementation of the Sons of Iraq program consisting of some 100,000 Sunni militants , many of whom used to be shooting at American soldiers , who are now on the U.S. payroll .
Now that 's a surge !
• Third , the previous ethnic cleansings in Iraq and the millions of Iraqi refugees who have fled their homes , meaning there are fewer potential targets of sectarian violence .
• Fourth , the large size and increasing efficacy of the Iraqi army and police , some 550,000 strong , who are now beginning to operate with some level of professionalism .
• Fifth , the increasingly nonsectarian approach of Nuri al - Maliki , the Shia prime minister , who has taken on Shiite militias in Basra and Sadr City , an important signal that the government will act in something like the national interest .
• Sixth , the cease - fires ordered in the past year or so by the leader of those Shia militants , the cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , whose position in Iraq has weakened significantly since 2007 .
These underlying factors made the surge a force multiplier for the fragile peace we are seeing today in Iraq .
And now that the surge is over , it is those factors that might ensure that the fragile peace holds , yet neither Obama nor McCain discussed how these factors might change their own Iraq policies going forward .
A missed opportunity in the debate was also to hear from each candidate some specifics about his plans for the size of the future U.S. military presence in Iraq .
McCain , who once famously said that the United States could be in Iraq for a century if American troops were n't being injured or killed there , never explained in the debate how he plans to ramp up significantly the number of American soldiers in Afghanistan -- something he has promised to do , at the same time that he continues to favor a continuing substantial U.S. presence in Iraq .
As Obama noted during the debate , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm .
Mike Mullen , has said that given the present commitments in Iraq , it is just not possible to now send thousands more American soldiers to Afghanistan .
For his part , Obama was not asked about the specifics of his plan to withdraw from Iraq in 2010 yet at the same time maintain what he has frequently termed a " residual force " there that would handle key missions such as counterterrorism .
According to military officials I have spoken to , such a residual force tasked with counterterrorism , intelligence gathering on the ground , providing tactical support to Iraqi military operations and protecting U.S. facilities such as the largest American embassy in the world would consist of four to eight brigades .
Depending on the exact size of those brigades , that could mean up to 40,000 American soldiers based in Iraq for many years to come .
For obvious reasons Obama has never spelled out what he estimates his residual force in Iraq would look like , as to do so would alienate the liberal , Moveon.org wing of his party , which is laboring under the delusion that come 2010 , if Obama is in the White House , there will be no U.S. troops in Iraq .
Obama was on firm ground when he attributed the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan to the diversion of American resources to Iraq .
This is uncontroversial .
The initial U.S. deployment to Afghanistan was the smallest peacekeeping force , per capita , that America has sent anywhere since World War II , while a RAND study found that , " Afghanistan has received the least amount of resources out of any major American - led nation - building operation over the last 60 years . "
And today , there are four times more U.S. soldiers in Iraq than in Afghanistan , a country that is significantly larger in terms of both size and population .

All About Israel • Iran • John McCain • Barack Obama
As a legitimate contender for the Presidency of the United States there are really only two things that you need to avoid ; ( a ) do n't do anything stupid ( see Dukakis ) , and ( b ) do n't get worked in the debates .
McCain managed to defy the two cardinal rules of presidential campaigns in a single idiotic swoop .
He suspended his campaign and called for the first debate this Friday to be postponed .
The Commission on Presidential Debates already denied his request .
John McCain 's already failed attempt to transcend politics will ultimately seal his fate as the typical politician which he so greatly seeks to overcome .
John did n't even beat Barack to the " above politics " message .
Obama contacted the McCain campaign earlier in the day regarding the potential of a joint message targeting the need for an economic remedy .
The McCain campaign cooperated , before dropping their bombshell .
This latest gimmick is squarely aimed at perception voters ; those voters who do not think , but rather feel who is the better candidate .
There are plenty of these voters out there , but they are not a pivotal demographic .
Anybody who falls for this ploy clearly would have voted for McCain anyway .
There is no logical way to perceive McCain 's actions today as strength or any other positive attribute .
The McCain campaign mortgaged their future to secure a voting bloc they had already secured .
The Presidential Debates are a sacred endeavor , journeyed upon just once every four years .
The campaign , for many people starts the day of the first debate .
These late bloomers span all demographic sets .
On a good night a candidate will introduce themselves to these voters just tuning in .
Obama already appears to have the upper hand , he will actually prepare for the debates .
The problem for John McCain remains in his expectations .
How will these first time viewers perceive his lack of preparation for the debate ?
Will they even care that he was spending his time on the bailout , will they even know ?
My guess is that many people who are just tuning in will be largely unaware of this current storyline come Friday , but even if they are , I do n't inherently think McCain 's stunt shifts the scales in his direction .
Recent polls have shown between an 8 - 12 % lead for Obama on the issue of handling the economy ; McCain is simply trying to keep pace on the issue , although with great difficulty .
A new SurveyUSA
Poll taken today in response to McCain 's antics show that just 10 % of all respondents think the debate should be postponed .
Either McCain is viciously targeting those 10 % or he made the biggest blunder in presidential election history and has yet to realize it .
While on the polling front I 'll target the " nothing has changed in the past 48 hours but polling " meme .
McCain 's numbers actually increased in our model from two days ago .
On the 22nd McCain was trailing 302 - 236 , today he moved into a 269 - 269 tie .
The polls actually contribute to the " McCain should not have done this " arguement because they actually swung in McCain 's direction .
As of right now there is no substantive argument to support McCain 's decision to suspend his campaign .
For weeks I 've contended that the first debate will polarize support for each candidate ; independents will pick a side and stay there .
Too much is at stake in the first debate to pull such an extraordinary political stunt , it 's unprecedented .
But I guess if you think your back 's to the wall , you change your strategy ; and based on today 's strategy change , they must be right up against the wall .
The United States foreign policy changed in some very noticeable ways after the terrorist attacks on American soil on September 11 , 2001 .
This included increasing the amount of intervention in foreign wars , the amount of defense spending , and the redefinition of terrorism as a new enemy .
Yet , in other ways , foreign policy after 9/11 is a continuation of American policy since its beginnings .
When George W. Bush assumed the presidency in January 2001 , his major foreign policy initiative was the creation of a " missile shield " over parts of Europe .
In theory , the shield would give added protection if North Korea or Iran launched a missile strike .
In fact , Condoleezza Rice , then the head of Bush 's National Security Council , was slated to give a policy speech about the missile shield on September 11 , 2001 .
Focus on Terror
Nine days later , on September 20 , 2001 , in a speech before a joint session of Congress , Bush changed the direction of American foreign policy .
He made terrorism its focus .
We will direct every resource at our command — every means of diplomacy , every tool of intelligence , every instrument of law enforcement , every financial influence , and every necessary weapon of war — to the destruction and to the defeat of the global terror network .
The speech is perhaps best remembered for this remark .
" [ W ]e will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism , " said Bush .
" Every nation in every region now has a decision to make : Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists . "
Preventive Warfare , Not Preemptive
The most noticeable immediate change in the U.S. foreign policy was its focus on preventive action , not just preemptive action .
This is also known as the Bush Doctrine .
Nations often use preemptive strikes in warfare when they know that enemy action is imminent .
During Truman 's administration , for example , North Korea 's attack on South Korea in 1950 stunned then - Secretary of State Dean Acheson and others at the state department .
They urged Truman to retaliate , leading the U.S. into the Korean War and creating a major expansion of U.S. global policy .
When the U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003 , however , it broadened its policy to include preventive warfare .
The Bush Administration told the public ( erroneously ) that Saddam Hussein 's regime had nuclear material and would soon be able to produce atomic weapons .
Bush vaguely tied Hussein to Al Qaeda ( again erroneously ) , and he said the invasion was , in part , to prevent Iraq from supplying terrorists with nuclear weapons .
Thus , the Iraqi invasion was to prevent some perceived — but not clearly evident — event .
Humanitarian Assistance
Since 9/11 , U.S. humanitarian assistance has become more subject to foreign policy demands and in some cases , it has become militarized .
Independent Non-Government Organization ( NGOs ) working through USAID ( a branch of the U.S. State Department ) have typically delivered worldwide humanitarian aid independently of American foreign policy .
However , as Elizabeth Ferris reported in a Brookings Institution article , U.S. military commands have begun their own humanitarian assistance programs in areas where they are conducting military operations .
Therefore , army commanders can leverage humanitarian assistance to gain military advantages .
NGOs have also increasingly fallen under closer federal scrutiny to ensure that they comply with U.S. anti-terrorism policies .
This requirement , says Ferris , " made it difficult , indeed impossible , for U.S. humanitarian NGOs to claim that they were independent of their government 's policy . "
That , in turn , makes it more difficult for humanitarian missions to reach sensitive and dangerous locations .
Questionable Allies
Some things , however , have not changed .
Even after 9/11 , the U.S. continues its tendency to forge questionable alliances .
The U.S. had to secure Pakistan 's support before invading neighboring Afghanistan to fight the Taliban , which intelligence said was an Al Qaeda supporter .
The resulting alliance with Pakistan and its president , Pervez Musharraf , was awkward .
Musharraf 's ties with the Taliban and Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden were questionable , and his commitment to the War on Terror seemed halfhearted .
Indeed , in early 2011 , intelligence revealed that bin Laden was hiding in a compound in Pakistan , and apparently had been for more than five years .
American special operations troops killed bin Laden in May , but his mere presence in Pakistan cast more doubt on that country 's commitment to the war .
Some members of Congress soon began calling for an end to Pakistani foreign aid .
Those situations are reminiscent of American alliances during the Cold War .
The United States supported such unpopular leaders as the Shah of Iran and Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam simply because they were anti-Communist .
War Weariness
George W. Bush warned Americans in 2001 that the War on Terror would be long and its results might be hard to recognize .
Regardless , Bush failed to remember the lessons of the Vietnam War and to understand that Americans are results - driven .
Americans were encouraged to see the Taliban virtually driven from power by 2002 , and could understand a brief period of occupation and state - building in Afghanistan .
But when the invasion of Iraq pulled resources away from Afghanistan , allowing the Taliban to become resurgent , and the Iraqi War itself became one of seemingly unending occupation , Americans became war - weary .
When voters briefly gave control of Congress to Democrats in 2006 , they were in fact rejecting Bush 's foreign policy .
That public war - weariness infected the Obama administration as the president wrestled with withdrawing troops from Iraq and Afghanistan as well as allocating funds for other military ventures , such as America 's limited involvement in the Libyan civil war .
The Iraq war was concluded on December 18 , 2011 , when Obama withdrew the last of the American troops .
After the Bush Administration
The echoes of 9/11 continue into subsequent administrations , as each president grapples with finding a balance between foreign invention and domestic issues .
During the Clinton administration , for example , the United States started spending more money on defense than virtually all other nations combined .
Defense spending has continued to rise .
Conflicts in the Syrian Civil War have led to U.S. intervention several times since 2014 .
Some have argued that the lasting change has been the instinct for American presidents to act unilaterally , as when the Trump Administration conducted unilateral airstrikes against Syrian forces in 2017 in response to chemical attacks at Khan Shaykhun .
But historian Melvyn Leffler points out that that has been part of U.S. diplomacy since George Washington , and certainly throughout the Cold War .
It is perhaps ironic that despite the unity in the country that arose immediately after 9/11 , bitterness about the failure of the costly initiatives started by the Bush and later administrations has poisoned public discourse and helped to create a sharply polarized country .
Perhaps the greatest change since the Bush Administration has been the expansion of the boundaries for a " war on terror " to include everything from trucks to malicious computer code .
Domestic and foreign terrorism , it seems , is everywhere .

Prof Steve Potter , from the Georgia Institute of Technology , who has been involved in similar technology involving animals and robots , said that it was clear that brain cells have " evolved to reconnect under almost any circumstance that does n't kill them . "
WASHINGTON / PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were granted approval on Sunday to become bank holding companies regulated by the U.S. Federal Reserve , effectively killing off the investment banking model that has dominated Wall Street for more than 20 years .
The move enables Goldman GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N to take deposits , gain easier access to financing and gives them more flexibility to buy retail banks .
It was initiated by the only two big and independent U.S. investment banks left after the failure of Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK and the agreed takeover of Merrill Lynch MER .N last week .
The change , part of a wrenching transformation of the Wall Street landscape amid financial markets turmoil in the past two weeks , means that previously freewheeling firms will be subject to much tighter regulation by the Fed , including tough capital requirements .
That could curb their ability to leverage up their proprietary trading and other activity with mountains of borrowed money .
This will reduce their chances of producing the kind of mega profits they had been making until the credit crisis started to hit home this year .
“ The timing of this move , in conjunction with all of the other unprecedented steps taken in the past week , shows the seriousness with which the government and the banks themselves are still taking the short - term risks to systemic stability in the financial markets , ” said Kirby Daley , senior strategist at Newedge Group in Hong Kong .
“ The implications of all these measures taken together are mind - boggling . ”
Under the new set - up , the primary regulator of the parent companies switches to the Federal Reserve from the Securities and Exchange Commission but the SEC continues to regulate their U.S. securities businesses .
In exchange for the increased scrutiny , Goldman and Morgan gain long - term access to the Fed ’s discount window and access to bank deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
MORGAN , WACHOVIA MARRIAGE LESS LIKELY
Morgan Stanley is also now less interested in a merger with the banking group Wachovia Corp WB.N.
That is no longer Morgan 's first priority , though talks with other parties continue , a person familiar with negotiations said .
It held a board meeting over the weekend to discuss Wachovia and the possibility that China ’s sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp could increase its stake in Morgan Stanley , according to sources familiar with the situation .
Morgan Stanley declined comment on the talks but it did say in a statement that the new status would give it “ flexibility and stability to pursue new business opportunities . ”
“ In some ways this makes it easier for them to buy a retail bank , but they may argue that this makes them self - sufficient and they do n’t need to buy a bank now , ” said the head of global mergers at a U.S. investment bank .
“ But they ca n’t raise deposits fast enough organically to stabilize their problems , it has to come through M&A , ” said the banker , who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak with the media .
Goldman intends expanding its deposit base by acquiring deposits wholesale from other banks , particularly those in distress , said the firm ’s spokesman Lucas van Praag .
It began to feel that it needed to consider something like Sunday 's move after the government - financed fire sale of another investment bank , Bear Stearns , to JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N in March , and the events of the past week accelerated this thinking , he said .
“ Last week the markets were looking for a ‘ belt and braces ’ approach to safety and soundness -- now we have the central bank as our regulator and permanent access to the lender of last resort , ” he said .
Goldman saw its shares plunging as much as 45 percent in the first four days of last week as even once seemingly untouchable Wall Street firms appeared vulnerable to the financial crisis .

Its stock partially recovered amid news of a planned $ 700 billion bailout of the U.S. financial system by the government and a ban on short selling of financial stocks .
To provide increased liquidity to the companies while they go through the transition , the Fed agreed to lend to the firms ’ broker - dealer subsidiaries on the same terms as the Fed discount window for banks .
The Fed said it was making the same collateral deals available to the broker - dealer subsidiary of Merrill , which is being acquired by Bank of America BAC.N .
“ It creates a perception of greater safety and supervision .
It really rationalizes the regulatory system .
It should be good for both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , ” said Chip MacDonald , mergers partner at law firm Jones Day .
“ It gives them better sources of funds through a commercial bank subsidiary . ”
The approval by the Fed came at the request of Goldman and Morgan , according to a source familiar with the application .
RETAIL BANK ACQUISITIONS EASIER
Goldman Sachs said it would move assets from a number of businesses into an entity called GS Bank USA that would have more than $ 150 billion in assets , making it one of the ten largest banks in the United States .
Under a commercial banking model Goldman and Morgan will be able to take deposits which during this shaky financial environment are considered a stable source of funding .
Their ability to take risks will not only be more thoroughly questioned but also be more measured because regulators will require stringent capital levels relative to the risks they take .
They will also be required to maintain managerial and operational soundness and be subject to a strict regulatory ratings system .

With fierce storm after storm hitting the Caribbean and threatening our coasts this hurricane season seems to illuminate the ever more apparent effects of climate change .
While we do not have more storms than usual the intensity appears to be on the rise , i.e. more storms are reaching higher categories thus our extremes are getting more extreme [ Science ] .
This alone calls for our attention and efforts to make changes to decrease the greenhouse effect that is warming the Earth and causing greater highs and lows but there is more to this than meets the eye .
It is clearly necessary to work to decrease emissions that are contributing to climate change but what we may unknowingly be doing is exacerbating the problem by not fully understanding the complexity of the system .
Now I am not saying we should allow massive amounts of pollution , I am merely suggesting it is more complicated than the simplified version we get watching TV or the glossy greenwashed sound bytes we are so often exposed to .
Even this write up is overly simplified but such is life .
The main complication I speak of is the phenomena that is termed “ global dimming . ”
Just like it sounds , global dimming describes the decrease in sunlight that is actually reaching Earth ’s surface .
Over the past 4 decades scientists have watched the global incoming solar radiation decrease by 12 % [ American Geophysical Union ] .
TWELVE PERCENT .
That is huge !
Breaking it down for each continent the drops in sunlight recorded between the 1950s and 1990s are staggering .
The level dropped 9 % in Antarctica , 10 % over the U.S. , nearly 30 % 13 % over Russia , and up to 60 % 16 % in parts of England ( thanks for pointing out this misunderstanding ) .
With that you would expect that we should be cooling down , right ?
It is logical to think if less sunlight reaches Earth the temperature would drop , just think of a cloudy day or even just standing in the shade .
It makes a significant difference but we are not cooling down , we continue to get warmer .
With this in mind it may be that global dimming is masking or delaying the potentially far more extreme effects of global warming .
Particle pollution , like ash , soot , and sulfur dioxide , in the atmosphere is believed to be the culprit for global dimming .
Just like sunlight bounces off the top of clouds , so too will it bounce off of polluting particles .
The compounding factor though , is that the polluting particles apparently make the clouds themselves far more reflective .
If we were to eliminate global dimming all together without addressing global warming the increase in temperature and extreme weather might be more significant than previously predicted .
This has been recorded with one full degree temperature change in just a few days of decreased pollution in the days following the 9/11 attacks [ Nature ] .
This reverse effect of dimming has been has been blamed along with global warming for increasing temperatures , appropriately called global brightening [ Geophysical Research Letters ] .
No one wants smoggy skies but it could be smog and particulates that may be shielding us from the full consequences of the greenhouse gases we pump into our air daily .
Clear blue skies are something many folks thinks of when they think of “ going green ” but those clear blue skies may hold more heat than we can handle .

God Did Not Create Hell for Sinners , They Did it Themselves
Interfax
The Russian Orthodox Church�s representative to the European International Institutions Bishop Hilarion of Vienna and Austria , on Interfax - Religion�s request , commented on the recent suggestion of Danish Lutheran theologians to consider the hell and the devil a metaphor and to accept only existence of the paradise .
- This theology should be considered in general context of liberalized Christian dogmatic and moral teaching developed in depth of many Protestant communities in several recent decades .
Everything that makes Christianity is �inconvenient� , �uncomfortable � is being omitted , � the dark Middle Ages� heritage is cleared up .
Christianity in light version is under construction and the hell and devil don�t match it .
A tragedy of Protestantism has originally been the following .
Seeking to get rid of medieval stratification of Catholicism , Protestants didn�t properly study the heritage of the Eastern fathers .
And today when arguing with the Middle Age hell and devil , liberal Protestants don�t trouble themselves with reviewing the Holy Fathers and their conception of afterlife retaliation .
Meanwhile , the Eastern Christian tradition has never considered the hell as created by God to punish sinners .
God didn�t create the hell , free will of people has created it .
It exists not because God wants it , but because people keep it existing .
They first create the hell on Earth and then carry it on to the afterworld .
What do you mean by the hell on Earth ?
When a man using his power over others makes Earth the hell for them .
Didn�t Hitler turn Earth to hell for millions of people tried and tortured in concentration camps , perished in gas cameras and battlefields ?
Didn�t Lenin and Stalin make hell for thousands and millions of people who died in camps or were shot on false denunciations or sentenced by Stalin�s �troika� ?
Don�t today�s terrorists , who kill peaceful citizens , take them hostage and cut off their heads , turn Earth to the hell ?
And is it believable that malefactors and monsters , who kill other people and revolt against God and all - hallows will share the paradise with righteous and saints ?
Is it believable that the paradise will welcome both John the Baptist and Herod , St. Veniamin of Petrograd and Lenin , thousands of the murdered new Russia�s martyrs and confessors and their torturers ?
It removes division between the good and the evil .
Then there�s no difference if you are a saint or a villain , if you do the good or the evil , if you save people from death or kill them .
So sins will be inevitably recompensed ?
Any person bears moral responsibility for his actions .
And he will answer for the sins of his earthly life in the eternity .
St. Isaac the Syrian writes that sinners in the hell are not deprived of God�s love .
On the contrary , love is given equally to everyone : to the righteous in the Heavenly Kingdom and to the sinners in Gehenna .
But for the righteous it becomes the source of joy and bliss while for sinners it is the source of torture .
Thus ,
God didn�t create the hell for sinners , they did it themselves .
God doesn�t send sinners to the hell , but people who oppose God�s will and revolt against God choose the hell themselves .
And this choice is made in their earthly life rather than in some distant eschatological prospect .
It is right here on Earth that infernal tortures and � the Kingdom of God come with power� begin .
However , even the Orthodox divine service says that the hell is �abolished � by Christ after His Resurrection from the dead ?
The reality of the hell , its existence for sinners and even the possibility of its eternal existence don�t contradict the news of its abolition by Christ resurrected .
The hell is really �abolished � in the resurrection of Christ , as it is not inevitable for people anymore and doesn�t have power over them .
But those , who consciously oppose God�s will and commit crime and sin , restore destroyed and abolished hell as they don�t want to reconcile with God�s love .
I�d like to stress it again : God didn�t create the hell , people created it for themselves , God destroyed and abolished the hell , but people restore it again and again .
The hell is re-created every time when the sin is consciously committed and is n�t repented .

President Bush holds a news conference in the briefing room of the White House in Washington July 15 , 2008 .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel accused six Arabs on Friday of trying to set up an al Qaeda cell in Israel and said one of them had proposed attacking helicopters used during a visit by President George W. Bush .
Israel ’s Shin
Bet counter - intelligence agency said one of the suspects had used his mobile phone to film helicopters at a sports stadium in Jerusalem that was used as a landing site for Bush ’s delegation .
The suspect then posted queries on Web sites frequented by al Qaeda operatives , asking for guidance on how to shoot down the helicopters , the agency said in a statement .
Bush visited Israel in January and again in May .
Lawyers for the six suspects could not immediately be reached for comment .
The Shin Bet identified four of the suspects as Palestinian residents of Arab East Jerusalem and two as Israeli Arabs .
The Shin Bet said the men had met several times at Jerusalem ’s al - Aqsa mosque , seeking to organize a local al Qaeda network .
The agency said computers seized from several of the suspects contained bomb - making manuals .
Earlier this month , Israel indicted two of its Bedouin Arab citizens for links to al Qaeda and for planning attacks inside the Jewish state .
WASHINGTON - Republican Ron Paul , the libertarian - leaning Texas congressman who attracted a devoted following in the GOP primaries , said yesterday he rejected an appeal to endorse John McCain and instead urged three other candidates to bring all their supporters together to vote against the " establishment candidates . "
Paul said the request to back McCain came from Phil Gramm , a former senator and McCain adviser whom the campaign jettisoned after he said the country was a " nation of whiners " about the economy .
Paul called the presidential elections a charade and said voters are faced with the " lesser of two evils . "
Although he won no primaries this year , Paul collected more than 1.1 million votes and drew a strong following on the Internet .
He appeared at a news conference with three third - party candidates : independent Ralph Nader , Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney , and Constitution Party candidate Chuck Baldwin .
Libertarian candidate Bob Barr , a former Republican congressman from Georgia , held his own news conference yesterday to announce that he has asked Paul , the party 's nominee in 1988 , to be his running mate .

Wasilla adds
Web page to deal with media crush
The city government of Wasilla , Alaska , inundated by journalists and researchers seeking information about former mayor Sarah Palin , last Friday set up a page on its website titled " Questions & Answers Concerning Mayor Palin " to minimize the amount of time employees have to spend answering questions .
Bogus Internet postings and e-mails have sought to portray Palin as a book burner because she once asked questions about the city 's policy on removing objectionable books from the library .
The website says only five books at the Wasilla Public Library have been challenged in the past 22 years , and none was removed .
One complaint was raised during Palin 's six years as mayor , but the book , " Heather Has Two Mommies , " by Leslea Newman , remained on the shelf , the report states .

NRA says Obama would be the most antigun president
The National Rifle Association said yesterday it will send a mailer to 4 million members warning that Barack Obama would be the most antigun president in American history .
When the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in June upholding an individual right to bear arms and throwing out a handgun ordinance in Washington , D.C. , Obama sought a middle ground .
" I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms , but I also identify with the need for crime - ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through commonsense , effective safety measures , " he said .

A St. Paul police officer who was dragging an alleged protester down the street was jumped from behind by what I 'm assuming is another protester .
The officer quickly sprays the surrounding onlookers who are not involved in the incident and is forced to retreat and loses both men in the process .
The angle of the video does n't show what the alleged protester had done to prompt the officer to drag him down the street .
Note :
In posting this video I am not advocating attacks on police , or violence of any kind .
But as I heard someone say yesterday , the Denver police prepared for protests , the St. Paul police prepared for the Apocalypse .
Glenn Greenwald and Jane Hamsher have been documenting the searches and seizures on peace groups .
And the Minnesota Independent documents a 17 year old peace protester and community organizer who was beaten and pepper sprayed by the St. Paul police .
While it may appear as though Dave has fallen asleep recharging himself , he ’s actually got a sexy new piece of solar equipment in his arms .
The slim metal box is called an Enphase “ micro- inverter ” .
No , a micro- inverter is not akin to a kickflip , ollie , or other skateboard trick .
If you ’re just getting familiar with solar electric technology , you probably know at this point that there are two major components necessary to produce usable electricity from the sun .
Simply slapping panels up on your roof and running wire down to your home wo n’t do a whole lot of good unless you plan on vaporizing your spouse .
To convert that direct current from the panels into usable electricity , what is required is a pretty bulky box called an inverter .
So , you might imagine that a “ micro- inverter ” would simply be a smaller version of this box , right ?
Kinda like a “ micro- chip ” or a “ micro- machine ” or “ micro-economics ” ( ugh ) ?
The short answer is , “ uh - huh ” .
In sum , this micro-technology is a hell of a lot better for many reasons .
To understand why though , let ’s get a little more familiar with “ regular ” inverters and how they work with solar panels .
Pretend for a minute or two that you are newly named foreman of a very unique Peruvian diamond mine .
Diamonds from this mine sparkle with a luminescence unlike any other diamonds .
However , to create these special gems , the raw diamond material must be polished minutes after it is extracted from the earth to attain this luster .
The previous foreman ( let ’s call him Hector ) , only trusted one person ( let ’s call him Jose ) to polish the rough unfinished diamonds into highly desirable , glittery diamonds .
Of note , Jose has recently called off work with illness more than usual , is nearing retirement age , and you sense he ’s becoming a little disgruntled .
The rest of Hector ’s miners ( Juan , Domingo , and Maria ) extract raw diamond material from the mine but are highly interdependent on one another to get their rough diamonds to Jose before they lose their ability to be special and glittery .
Meaning , if Domingo decides to take a break , Juan and Maria have to stop what they are doing to wait for him to get back to work before they can pass more diamond material along the line for Jose to polish .
Consequently , a lot of valuable diamond material gets wasted .
Hector was fired because the daily yields from his mines were , well … lackluster .
To alleviate this problem and get more special sparkly diamonds out of the mine , what do you do ?
Hold that thought .
In a conventional solar power system , interdependent strings of panels are placed on roofs and operate in much the same fashion as Hector ’s miners .
Panel A , Panel B , and Panel C are a lot like Juan , Domingo , and Maria .
If one panel gets obstructed even by just a little bit by a big leaf , bird poop , or lovely tree shade , the entire string of solar panels suffers , sending significantly less or even no raw power down the line .
Each panel needs to work with other panels in the string to get raw power to the inverter .
The regular inverter is a lot like Jose , taking the direct , rough , unfinished current from the combined panels and converting it into sparkly , glittery alternating current you can use in your home .
So , when shading or obstructions impact one of the panels ( a lot like Juan , Domingo , or Maria taking a breather ) , the inverter ( Jose ) has a lot less raw material or current to work with .
Let ’s go back to the mine .
What if you placed small robots alongside Juan , Domingo , and Maria to monitor their performance and carefully polish raw diamond material into finished diamonds ?
Then , even if Domingo is unable to find any raw diamond material to extract , Maria can still be extracting , polishing , and producing .
In addition to teaching your employees new skills ( which by the way has been related to lower turnover ) , you are now a lot less reliant on a disgruntled employee ( Jose ) , you can increase your diamond harvest , and you are able to eliminate a point of failure along your production line .
Your only concern is that your workers get along well with their new micromanaging robot companions .
This is precisely the reasoning which led Enphase Energy engineers to create micro-inverters .
Micro-inverters are attached to every single solar panel in the system and each one is capable of converting direct current from its solar panel into usable electricity – independent of other panels on the string .
This means that even if one panel gets shaded a little bit by dust , bird poop , or a tree , the other panels are still capable of feeding usable electricity into your home or business .
Moreover , you are no longer reliant on the regular inverter , a bulky eyesore of a box that has a lifespan of 10 - 20 years .
Currently , if you have a massive solar installation on your commercial plant , when your inverter fails , you need to purchase all of your electricity from the grid until it gets replaced .
That can represent a sizable chunk of unplanned cash out of pocket .
In addition to more uptime , micro-inverters allow system owners to monitor the energy output of each individual panel , alerting them if one is underperforming ( Each micro- inverter can send a signal through your internet connection so that you can see how well each one is doing ) .
What ’s more , you can now combine different types of panels together and place them at different orientations to the sun and still expect good production out of them – unheard of before .
Finally , micro-inverters allow your solar system to be scalable – meaning you can purchase a few panels to start out with , then add onto your system without additional engineering outlays .
Lab tests indicate these micro-inverters will have a lifespan of about 120 years .
Sometimes it 's best not to keep up with the Joneses .
Take 1978 , for instance .
Your spendthrift neighbors had just taken delivery of a monolithic new General Electric Widescreen 1000 projection TV and were showing it off to everyone who could be tricked into visiting .
GE proudly marketed the set as " a super - size TV with a picture three times as big as a 25 - inch diagonal console and the ' chairside convenience ' of random access remote control . "
Oddly enough , there is nothing widescreen about the set , despite the name .
Luckily , you ( or your parents ) had done a bit of research to uncover the less impressive truth .
According to US Patent 4181918 , the giant wood veneer cabinet housed a much smaller CRT display that employed " a vertical deflection reversing switch to invert and laterally reverse the image , and a three element lens within a light - proof projection chamber to re-invert , magnify and project the image onto a forward projection type reflective screen . "
In other words , the image from a regular old TV tube was flipped and back - projected onto a transparent screen [ I suspect a similar system was used in the RCA rear - projection sets that debuted in 1983 ] .
In addition to the honking huge screen and fancy remote , the set featured GE 's futuristic VIR automatic color control system , which used " computer - like circuitry " to decode hue and tint information encoded in the broadcast signal , preventing little Ricky Jr. from cranking the color controls in an attempt to burn out the cat 's eyeballs during Saturday morning cartoons .

Easter Island has long been looked upon as an historical looking glass , through which we can observe the implications of continued environmental destruction to our planet – the larger island floating in a sea of black .
The cries of a people that could clearly see destruction coming , but did little or nothing about it , come hauntingly down to us here in this new millenium .
With startling clarity they teach us what happens when immediacy takes precedence over future needs .
If you have a moment to take a trip to another time and place , check out some of the material and links here .
No need to dream of going to Easter Island though , as , in many ways , you ’re already there … .
A jewel of an island floating in an endless sea .
A seemingly never - ending supply of raw materials .
Technological advances .
Population growth .
Depletion of resources .
War. Collapse .
Sound familiar ?
The Easter Island story is a story for our times .
We too are on an island floating on an endless sea .
There are differences , of course .
It could be said that Easter Island is tiny and that it was only a matter of time before the resources in such a closed system were used up .
But there are parallels between the islanders ’ attitude towards their environment and our own , and this is the most frightening part of the story .
On an island as small as Easter , it was easy to see the effects of the deforestation as it was taking place .
But the inhabitants continued their destructive actions .
They probably prayed to their gods to replenish the land so they could continue to rape it , but the gods did n’t answer .
And still the trees came down .
Whatever one did to alter that ecosystem , the results were reasonably predictable .
One could stand on the summit and see almost every point on the island .
The person who felled the last tree could see that it was the last tree .
Nonetheless , he ( or she ) still felled it . *
This is the really scary part .
As our own forests fall to the bulldozers , there are many who are valiantly trying to save them .
It is obvious , now that we have satellites showing us the massive deforestation , that there is a serious problem .
And yet our leaders — and even the majority of individuals — look on , unconcerned .
They appear willing to bulldoze the last trees to build the moai of our time — technology & development .
Will we have the sense to reconcile our lifestyles with the well - being of our environment , or is the human personality always the same — as that of the person who felled the last tree ?*
– Easter Island
News reports of today parallel the ‘ news in brief ’ painted on cave walls in dark days at Easter Island in the midst of crisis centuries ago :
Our ‘ Easter Island ’
A report , scheduled to be published on Monday but distributed to some reporters yesterday , said issues usually associated with the environment — like rising ocean levels , droughts and violent weather caused by global warming — were also national security concerns .
“ Unlike the problems that we are used to dealing with , these will come upon us extremely slowly , but come they will , and they will be grinding and inexorable , ” Richard J. Truly , a retired United States Navy vice admiral and former NASA administrator , said in the report .
The effects of global warming , the study said , could lead to large - scale migrations , increased border tensions , the spread of disease and conflicts over food and water .
All could lead to direct involvement by the United States military .

Feds give customs agents free hand to seize travelers ' documents
The Bush administration has overturned a 22 - year - old policy and now allows customs agents to seize , read and copy documents from travelers at airports and borders without suspicion of wrongdoing , civil rights lawyers in San Francisco said Tuesday in releasing records obtained in a lawsuit .
The records also indicate that the government gives customs agents unlimited authority to question travelers about their religious beliefs and political opinions , said lawyers from the Asian Law Caucus and the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
They said they had asked the Department of Homeland Security for details of any policy that would guide or limit such questioning and received no reply .
" We 're concerned that people of South Asian or Muslim - looking background are being targeted inappropriately " for questioning and searches , said Asian Law Caucus attorney Shirin Sinnar .
Amy Kudwa , spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security , said the new policies reflect " the realities of the post - 9/11 environment . "
Kudwa noted that courts have allowed federal agents more leeway in searches at borders and airports than elsewhere .
She also said customs agents are entitled to ask questions that " may be relevant to admissibility determinations that relate to an alien 's purpose for entering the United States " under certain types of visas .
The Bay Area legal groups filed a Freedom of Information Act suit against the government in February , seeking documents on the policies that govern searches and questioning of international travelers .
The organizations said they had received more than 20 complaints in the previous year , mostly from South Asians and Muslims .
The travelers said customs agents regularly singled them out when they returned from abroad , looked at their papers and laptop computers , and asked them such questions as whom they had seen on their trips , whether they attended mosques and whether they hated the U.S. government .
Homeland Security 's customs and border protection division provided 661 pages of documents in response to the suit , but blacked out portions of many records and withheld others , Sinnar said .
She said the legal groups would return to court to seek more documents .
In the meantime , the customs agency publicly released its policies on border searches in July , including a statement that agents are authorized to " read and analyze " any documents in a traveler 's possession and keep them for a reasonable time to make copies .
What the agency did n't announce - but what the documents obtained in the lawsuits reveal - is that the current practices represent a substantial change from earlier government policies , Sinnar said .
She said those policies were first enacted by President Ronald Reagan 's administration in 1986 , in response to lawsuits by U.S. citizens who were questioned and searched after returning from Nicaragua .
President Bill Clinton 's administration refined the policies in 2000 but made no major changes , Sinnar said .
Those policies allowed customs agents to glance at travelers ' documents to see if they contained anything the agents were authorized to intercept - such as smuggled currency or obscene material - but required agents to have grounds for reasonable suspicion before taking and reading any documents , the legal groups said , quoting the newly released records .
The 1986 and 2000 policies required agents to meet a more - demanding standard - showing evidence that contained probable cause of smuggling or other wrongdoing - before copying documents , the lawyers ' groups said .
" For more than 20 years , the government implicitly recognized that reading and copying the letters , diaries , and personal papers of travelers without reason would chill Americans ' right to free speech and free expression , " Sinnar said .
" But now customs officials can probe into the thoughts and lives of ordinary travelers without any suspicion at all . "
By 2004 , all of the elements of the current financial collapse had been in place for several years .
The aggressive approach to enforcing the Community Reinvestment Act ( CRA ) started under Bill Clinton in 1998 , and the seemingly endless appetite for paper by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had turned massive amounts of bad loans into mortgage - backed securities to spread their cancer throughout the system .
In 2004 , a year after the Bush administration tried to tighten regulation and oversight on Fannie and Freddie , Congress was told yet again that disaster loomed .
The Democratic response is instructive to seeing who really sat back and allowed this collapse to occur ( via Power Line ) :
Highlights of this eight - minute video :
Maxine Waters :
Through nearly a dozen hearings , we were frankly trying to fix something that was n’t broke .
Mr. Chairman , we do not have a crisis at Freddie Mac , and particularly at Fannie Mae , under the outstanding leadership of Franklin Raines .
[ Raines would barely avoid prosecution for fraud . ]
Gregory Meeks : … I ’m just pissed off at OFHEO [ the regulators trying to warn Congress of insolvency at the GSEs ] , because if it was n’t for you , I do n’t think we ’d be here in the first place . …
There ’s been nothing that indicated that ’s wrong with Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac has come up on its own …
The question that then comes up is the competence that your agency has with reference to deciding and regulating these GSEs .
Lacy Clay :
This hearing is about the political lynching of Franklin Raines .
Barney Frank : I do n’t see anything in this report that raises safety and soundness problems .
Take a good look through this video in 2004 , and ask yourself who on this panel wanted more regulatory oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and which members spent their time attacking the regulators .
When Barack Obama talks at debates about how the past eight years of regulatory laissez - faire created the problem , he may want to review the transcripts of these hearings and note that Democrats repeatedly undermined regulators and called them everything from incompetent to bigoted in their rush to keep the status quo at Fannie and Freddie .
In 2005 , Fortune published a lengthy anaylsis of the impending crash of Fannie Mae , and included this altercation between OFHEO and Congress :
Two weeks later Falcon and Raines faced off against each other in a hearing before the House subcommittee on capital markets , which was chaired by Baker .
Consider the circumstances .
Falcon was Fannie ’s regulator and had leveled serious charges , amounting to fraud , against Fannie Mae .
Most CEOs would have seen the wisdom of humility at this point , but Raines showed little .
“ These accounting standards are highly complex and require determinations on which experts often disagree , ” he said , adding that “ there were no facts ” that supported OFHEO ’s charge that Fannie executives had deferred an expense in 1998 to earn bonuses .
And most of the Democrats present agreed with him .
“ This hearing is about the political lynching of Franklin Raines , ” said Congressman William Lacy Clay of Missouri .
Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank said , “ I see nothing in here that suggests that safety and soundness are an issue . ”
Other Democrats complained that the mere fact of releasing the report could increase the cost of home - ownership .
“ Is it possible that by casting all of these aspersions … you potentially are weakening this institution in the market , that you are potentially weakening the housing market in this country ? ” Congressman Artur Davis of Alabama demanded .
When Falcon tried to answer , Davis acted like a prosecutor grilling a hostile witness .
He wanted a one - word answer : yes or no .
“ Is that possible ? ” he asked again .
“ I have never seen anyone treated as disrespectfully as Armando Falcon was by the Democrats and by Franklin Raines , ” recalls one congressional aide .
Adds Andrew Cuomo : “ I credit him for not folding and not caving and not running , because he took a tremendous beating . ”
Unfortunately for the Democrats at this hearing , Raines then doubled down and demanded that the SEC give a second opinion on his business practices .
After an investigation , the SEC agreed with Falcon and demanded that Fannie Mae restate its earnings all the way back to 2001 — at which point Raines ’ fraud got uncovered .
OFHEO had been correct , and the Democrats in this committee meeting had done their level best to interfere with the regulator to cover up for Raines ’ fraud .
The Democrats attacking the regulator here did n’t do so out of some deep conviction against government regulation .
They wanted to keep the gravy train rolling on questionable mortgages in order to endear themselves to the working class , and did n’t mind smearing the OFHEO regulator as a racist in order to succeed .
The Republicans who wanted more oversight did n’t demand it as socialists looking for a government takeover of the financial sector , either , but because they saw the impending disaster looming for Fannie Mae .
Democrats distorted the market through the CRA and through Fannie and Freddie ’s massive securitizing of bad debt , and then blocked regulators from doing their jobs .
That ’s the real story of this collapse .
Ann and Nancy Wilson are pissed at the Republican Party and have fired off a cease and desist letter to the McCain / Palin campaign .
Specifically , the Heart women are upset that the GOP has used their classic " Barracuda " as a theme song for Sarah Palin .
TMZ obtained a statement from Heart 's rep , who says " The Republican campaign did not ask for permission to use the song , nor would they have been granted that permission . "
The statement goes on : " We have asked the Republican campaign publicly not to use our music .
We hope our wishes will be honored . "

I did a little research on Bob Caswell who runs that website .
On another website he owns , he links this under the heading " What is your Obama tax cut . "
This guy is clearly working for Obama .
The figures are apparently based on Obama's , for example , that he will give tax cuts to 95 % of the people when only sixty percent actually pay income tax .
This is pure BS .

NEW YORK , Sept , 23 ( Reuters ) - American International Group Inc AIG.N said late on Tuesday it signed a " definitive " agreement for up to $ 85 billion in borrowings from the U.S. Federal Reserve , the main part of a rescue by the central bank that will see it take a 79.9 percent stake in the giant insurer .
AIG Chief Executive Edward Liddy said in a statement the facility was “ the company ’s best alternative ” in the current market environment .
Under the terms of the agreement , AIG has to pay back the loan from , among other things , asset sales and new debt or share issues .
In the statement , AIG made it clear how onerous the terms of the two - year loan will be .
Not only will it pay 8.50 percentage points over 3 - month LIBOR , putting the current rate at well over 11 percent , but it will also pay commitment fees .
There will be an initial gross commitment of 2 percent of the total loan facility , and subsequently a fee on undrawn amounts of 8.5 percent a year .
The interest and the fees will be added to the balance outstanding , the company said .
“ We are pleased to have finalized the terms of the facility , and are already developing a plan to sell assets , repay the facility and emerge as a smaller but profitable company , ” Liddy said in the statement .
It was n’t immediately clear whether the signing of the agreement will derail efforts by a large investor group that is working to thwart a government takeover of the company .
A lawyer for the investors -- which represent more than a third of all AIG stockholders and have the backing of former CEO Maurice “ Hank ” Greenberg -- said representatives of the group were to be briefed by the company on its financial position .

The rescue plan was unveiled Sept. 16 amid the most tumultuous week in financial markets in recent memory .
U.S. vs. Them : How a Half Century of Conservatism Has Undermined America ’s Security
J. Peter Scoblic
Viking , 2008
350 pp .
From what stems the disastrous course of U.S. foreign policy ?
J. Peter Scoblic , an editor at the New Republic , argues that labels are easily applied but explain little : " calling the Iraq war a unilateral , military adventure justified by cherry - picked intelligence may be an accurate assessment , but it does not tell us why the Bush administration pursued such a war .
Why was the administration inclined toward unilateralism , militarism , and deceit ? "
He argues , in a measured and usually persuasive book , that the Bush administration ’s policy results naturally from modern conservative philosophy .
He writes , " Cold War conservatism , initiated as a response to the perceived excesses of liberalism at home and the dangers of communism abroad , combined exceptionalist ideas into a particularly extreme form at a particularly fraught time . "
The result was a good versus evil , us versus them approach that ignored international complexities .
This policy was inadequate even during the Cold War , when the Soviet Union was an evil empire , and is even less effective today .
Indeed , in Scoblic ’s view , the administration " has exacerbated the threat we face from nuclear terrorism , " with its one success , Libya , being " achieved only because it violated the very principles that have guided the rest of its policies . "
There is , of course , an older conservative foreign policy tradition .
The principle of nonintervention in foreign affairs and wars goes back to America ’s founding .
Although the U.S. was aggressively expansionist on the North American continent , it did not engage in overseas conquest until the Spanish - American War of 1898 .
The traditionalist reaction to America ’s foolish entry into World War I generated strong opposition to U.S. involvement in World War II .
However , the election of Dwight Eisenhower as president and death of Senate Majority Leader Robert Taft effectively destroyed what remained of non-interventionism as a political movement .
Eisenhower was a cautious activist , but he was no Taft .
Moreover , Scoblic points to " the rise of the new conservatism , " namely the right shaped by William F. Buckley and others like him .
Reading about the growth of the Cold War Right , and its reaction against Eisenhower ’s more moderate conservatism , reminds one just how radical was this " new conservative " vision .
For instance , Buckley contended that Ike had a " deficient understanding " of communism .
Buckley and his allies wanted liberation , not containment ; they wanted preventive war , not deterrence .
This philosophy mattered , writes Scoblic , because " the conservative movement was about to move from the intellectual fringe to the political mainstream , enabling it to translate theory into action . "
Of course , it took time before this Cold War conservatism dictated policy .
Barry Goldwater was a dynamic standard - bearer of the more aggressive , unilateralist conservatives , but he went down to defeat in 1964 .
Richard Nixon won in 1968 , only to quickly fall out of favor with the Right .
Observes Scoblic : " The hard - line anti-communist they had elected president seemed to have been replaced with a liberal doppelganger . "
Conservatives then had to endure the disappointing presidencies of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter .
Around this time the neoconservatives emerged , many of them behind Sen.
Henry ( Scoop ) Jackson ( D - Wash . ) , the leading welfare - warfare state advocate on Capitol Hill .
They organized against what they saw as the growing Soviet menace , creating the Committee on the President Danger and lining up behind Ronald Reagan .
Despite his public image , Reagan was a complex figure who " epitomized the libertarianism , traditionalism , and anticommunism that had fused in the 1950s to create the modern conservative movement , " writes Scoblic .
" Reagan also capitalized on the Right ’s grassroots nationalism , matching its fear of Soviet evil with an idealized view of American good . "
Reagan seemed like a perfect match for hard - line conservatives , especially neoconservatives , and Scoblic documents how Reagan ’s policies began on the hawkish side .
But Ronald Reagan , despite scathing denunciations by the Left tagging him as a cowboy and warmonger , was horrified by the prospect of war , especially a nuclear exchange that could destroy much of human civilization .
He shifted course , enduring more than his share of epithets from the hard Right .
It is worth remembering what neoconservatives said of the peacenik Reagan when they attempt to appropriate his legacy today .
" Reagan ’s status as a pariah of the conservative movement changed after the Berlin Wall fell , the Cold War ended , and the Soviet Union broke up , " writes Scoblic .
The end of the Cold War created the possibility of a serious conservative crackup .
The neoconservatives naturally saw the collapse of America ’s hegemonic opponent as an opportunity to micro-manage the rest of the world .
Notes Scoblic , they " embraced democratization as the logical ideological successor to anticommunism . "
But not all conservatives were enthused about expanding government and sacrificing liberty at home in order to engage in dubious crusades abroad .
Pat Buchanan represented the small government anti-communists who wanted to turn inward .
And then , writes Scoblic , " somewhere between neoconservative messianism and Buchananite isolationism , nationalist conservatives were fashioning a more restrictive view of U.S. involvement abroad , redefining conservatism as ‘ realistic ’  by which they meant not Kissingerian but antiutopian . "
Vice President Richard Cheney and former UN Ambassador John Bolton well represent this faction .
The neoconservatives and nationalists came together under President George W. Bush and gave America the Iraq war .
But why Iraq , asks Scoblic , when both North Korea and Iran had more advanced nuclear programs ?
He devotes a chapter to the question and offers a plausible answer , though we wo n’t know for certain unless President George W. Bush reveals his thinking .
Writes Scoblic :
" What truly made Iraq unique , then , was not only that it epitomized the failure of containment , but also that it offered the possibility of redemption through military rollback  a morally pure solution to an ugly problem .
It allowed us to go on the offense rather than simply managing a problem .
It eliminated the root evil , rather than demanding some sort of coexistence with it .
In some ways , then , the preferred means of policy dictated the preferred ends of policy .
If Iraq did not fit the precepts of conservatism any more closely , it better fit the ramifications of those precepts .
In short , Iraq was the most invadable member of the axis of evil . "
Of course , the results of administration policy turned out rather different than expected .
Iraq turned into a national charnel house rather than an example of American - style democracy along the Euphrates River .
North Korea reprocessed enough nuclear fuel into plutonium to make an additional ten nuclear weapons .
Iran apparently moved ahead with its nuclear program as its geostrategic position strengthened .
Pakistan proliferated around the globe while growing increasingly unstable politically .
Osama bin Laden remained at large and Afghanistan ’s security deteriorated .
Russia asserted itself in the Caucasus .
The results were bad by any measure .
Scoblic focuses on the question of nuclear proliferation and risk of nuclear terrorism .
On this score , the world situation has significantly worsened under the Bush administration .
Ironically , though Bush has not adjusted his foreign policy as dramatically as did Reagan , the current president has flipped .
Writes Scoblic : " Despite his intransigence on Iraq , Bush ’s foreign policy began perceptibly to change .
The president still saw the war on terrorism as a Manichaean struggle , " but he replaced both advisers and policies .
Pained squeals from neoconservatives grew as loud as they had been under Reagan .
Nevertheless , overall Bush ’s policy remained aggressive if not quite so unilateralist .
Scoblic attempts to explain the political appeal of a good vs. evil , us vs. them approach in psychological terms .
While plausible , it remains a stretch .
It is n’t difficult to understand the results of the 2004 election in terms of an unattractive challenger who on critical issues sounded like a me - too candidate , voting for the war before voting against it , for instance .
Moreover , there is nothing inherent to conservatism that leads to George W. Bush ’s or John McCain ’s foreign policy .
Libertarians , paleos , and traditionalists may constitute a minority in conservative ranks , but they are still active and all lay claim to the conservative tradition .
U.S. vs.
Them closes with Scoblic arguing that proliferation represents America ’s greatest security challenge .
As a result , he contends , there is a " need to reaffirm the nonproliferation regime , strengthen that regime through our own actions , and lead others in forging a new compact that will stymie states like Iran and confound would - be nuclear terrorism . "
Logical and important goals , and well worth pursuing .
But proliferation is not necessarily the gravest threat facing America today .
A renewed rivalry with a nuclear - armed Russia is a potentially significant danger .
The possibility of a future clash with a rising , nuclear - armed China is a threat more in the future .
The potential of being dragged into war by irresponsible alliance members or less formal friends , such as Georgia , seems like an increasingly serious possibility .
There will be tradeoffs , even when it comes to proliferation .
Might a nuclear - armed Ukraine be better for the U.S. than an American defense guarantee for Ukraine ?
Should Washington threaten to use nuclear weapons against China to defend Japan , when the latter could easily create a modest deterrent ?
Both unilateralist neoconservatives and multilateralist liberals embrace near - absolute nonproliferation and place almost all security responsibilities on the U.S. , though perhaps for different reasons .
Neither perspective is satisfactory .
There are better alternatives that conservatives and liberals alike might embrace : cooperative noninterventionism , for instance , in which the U.S. generally avoids military involvement in foreign quarrels but works with other states politically , economically , and culturally .
Or " ethical realism , " as John Hulsman and Anatol Lieven have proposed , leavening a sensible caution of overseas involvement and tough - minded calculation of national interest with moral considerations .
Scoblic closes with an argument over what our foreign policy should be , but the focus of his book remains on why today ’s conservatives have given us today ’s foreign policy .
Well - researched and well - written , it will enlighten anyone seeking to understand today ’s foreign policy mess .
We still might not know why George W. Bush did what he did , but we better understand where his philosophy came from and why others advocated the policies that he adopted .
Are sites such as Google changing the way we think ?
Bill Thompson considers how our multi-media world is impacted the way we see ourselves .
In her recently published book ID : The Quest for Identity in the 21st Century , Professor Susan Greenfield brings her considerable expertise as a neuroscientist to bear on the question of whether and how our current use of computers is changing the way our brains work .
Greenfield argues that the visual stimulus we get from screen - based information and entertainment differs so markedly from that available to previous generations that certain areas of the brain , specifically those areas that are older in evolutionary terms and retain the capacity to alter as a result of experience , may be affected in ways that express themselves a changes to personality and behaviour .
It 's an interesting hypothesis , and one that has the virtue of being experimentally testable , unlike many other claims about the effect of modern living on human psychology .
And it is a model that Nick Carr uses to support his rather broader viewpoint that our intellectual faculties are being damaged by the internet in his latest essay for the US - based Atlantic magazine .
Carr believes that the style of searching and exploration of links encouraged by search engines such as Google is changing the way heavy users think , reflecting that " over the past few years I 've had an uncomfortable sense that someone , or something , has been tinkering with my brain , remapping the neural circuitry , reprogramming the memory .
My mind is n't going - so far as I can tell - but it 's changing .
I 'm not thinking the way I used to think " .
War and Peace Today 's internet presents information in bite - sized chunks , linked together into a rich tapestry where the connections often carry as much meaning as the words themselves .
Bill Thompson
He likens himself to HAL , the computer in Arthur C Clarke 's 2001 : A Space Odyssey , reverting to child - like singing as its memory banks are disconnected by astronaut Dave Bowman .
He regretfully notes that " my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages .
I get fidgety , lose the thread , begin looking for something else to do .
I feel as if I 'm always dragging my wayward brain back to the text .
The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle " .
Although the piece has the attention - grabbing headline ' Is Google Making Us Stupid ? '
Carr 's target is really the whole internet , where Facebook status updates and invitations compete with incoming Twitter posts , Friendfeed alerts and RSS feeds from hundreds of websites to overwhelm any attempt to pay careful attention to a well - ordered argument spread over thousands of words or hundreds of pages in a linear fashion .
Why read War and Peace , he seems to say , when you can get a text message from a friend to tell you what has happened to Pierre in only 160 characters , or cut it down to 140 for Twitter ?
It 's a nice argument , and has succeeded in provoking a wide - ranging debate .
John Battelle , for example , sees himself getting cleverer as he searches , follows links and absorbs information , arguing that when " performing bricolage in real time over the course of hours , I am ' feeling ' my brain light up , I and ' feeling ' like I 'm getting smarter .
A lot smarter , and in a way that only a human can be smarter " .
New literacy Battelle may feel smarter , but he also accepts that the way of working online is different from that which prevailed when we were a print - based culture .
He just thinks it is at least equal , if not superior , to what went before .
There does seem to be a difference between screen - based literacy and page - based literacy , and the reason may be that outlined by another participant in the debate , developmental psychologist Maryanne Wolf .
In her new book , Proust and the Squid : The Story and Science of the Reading Brain , she points out that reading is not an innate ability for humans but something we have to learn how to do , and there is no reason why different forms of literacy should not emerge as new technologies do .
Tech drug
Are web technologies just a form of LSD ?
After all , the ability to read a text is as much a learned behaviour as knowing how to use a mouse to control a cursor on screen , and it is claimed that the Venerable Bede , the monk who lived in Jarrow in the seventh century , was the first person to read without moving his lips .
Whether or not our brains are being fundamentally altered by the products of the Googleplex it is clear that the current generation of search tools are changing the ways we look for information and the navigational strategies we use to find our way from source to source , looking for data and insights .
Today 's internet presents information in bite - sized chunks , linked together into a rich tapestry where the connections often carry as much meaning as the words themselves .
The fact that a blog post recommended by one of the A - list bloggers may matter more than what it says ; and often the accumulation of small references to a topic is vital to build up our understanding .
The impact does not have to reflect a change to neuroanatomy or a fundamental shift in our way of engaging with the world of words .
It could just be that search engines , RSS feeds and Tweets are western culture 's informational drug of choice , the intellectual equivalent of LSD in the 60's , cocaine in the 80's and ecstasy in the 90's , a temporary obsession .
Google and other search engines may satisfy us because they are less likely to take us into areas where our preconceptions are challenged .
One of the reasons I like my Twitter friends is that I 've chosen to follow people I like , whose views and opinions I am more likely to find acceptable .
If I am challenged by them then it is within severely proscribed limits - I 'm not following Fox News , for example , because I 'd just find it annoying .
Children have two ways of learning
The Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget described two processes that he believed lay behind the development of knowledge in children .
The first is assimilation , where new knowledge fits into existing conceptual frameworks .
More challenging is accommodation , where the framework itself is modified to include the new information .
The current generation of ' search engines ' seem to encourage a model of exploration that is disposed towards assimilative learning , finding sources , references and documents which can be slotted into existing frameworks , rather than providing material for deeper contemplation of the sort that could provoke accommodation and the extension , revision or even abandonment of views , opinions or even whole belief systems .
Perhaps the real danger posed by screen - based technologies is not that they are rewiring our brains but that the collection of search engines , news feeds and social tools encourages us to link to , follow and read only that which we can easily assimilate .
Time to start following
Fox , I think , and take myself out of my online comfort zone .

Working on a number of deadlines today , so pardon the light posting for the moment .
In the meantime , the blizzard of anti-democracy GOP voter - caging / suppression reports continue to come in from around the country .
While we will , no doubt , have more on all of the latest soon , I wanted to quickly point out the brand new Voter Suppression Wiki that was set up late last week , by Baratunde Thurston , to track some of the stuff now rolling in at an alarming pace ( with vastly inadequate Obama / Dem response , as far as I can tell . )
Thurston introduced the new participatory Wiki in a HuffPo article late last week .
He included , along with it , a quick introductory video that pulls just together just some of the reports piling in from just the day or two before he finally decided such a site was very much needed .
That short video alone is worth a quick view , as it offers a pretty astounding collection of just a few of the most appalling incidents rolling in the news late last week , courtesy of the well - organized GOP troops marshaling the latest full - frontal assualt ( surge ! ) in the coordinated Republican War on Democracy .
Here the short video ...

Make sure you buy : " The Shock Doctrine "
It 's so chic of conservatives like Sullivan to blame the American people for the economic crisis , because as Sullivan stated on Real Time , millions and millions of people took out loans on homes that they could n't afford .
Yes , the Kudlow Thesis of the market housing crisis .
Do n't blame the lenders and grifters that came upon us like a biblical plague of locusts , blame the people .
Naomi Klein ,
God love her , told him that it was the Wall Street profiteers that preyed upon society .
His ideal conservative world is completely fictional .
And as she says , what comes next is the real disaster .
Today was Christmas morning to the fat cats on The Street , but what happens next to all the debt we the people have just incurred ?
Whoever is elected president will have a major role in deciding our fate .
Sorry , I can't write the whole transcript , so watch the entire clip .
Klein :
The disaster is far from over .
They 've actually just relocated .
The disaster was on Wall Street and they have moved the disaster to Main Street by accepting those debts and you said they did n't have to bomb , the bomb has yet to detonate .
The bomb is the debt that has now been transferred to the taxpayers so it detonates when , if John McCain becomes president in the midst of an economic crisis and says look we 're in trouble , we have a disaster on our hands , we have to privatize social security , we can't afford health care , we can't afford food stamps , we need more deregulation , more privatization .
The thesis of the Shock Doctrine is you need a disaster to rationalize these very unpopular policies so the real disaster has yet to come .
The real disaster is the debt that is going to explode on the American taxpayers .
And then they do economic shock therapy .
They had to step in , but I do n't think they had to step in in the way they did .
The reason why the stock market went up on Wall Street today is because it 's Christmas morning .
Imagine waking up and being told your credit card debits have been wiped out , your mortgage has been erased .
There 's a fairy godmother that has taken care of you .
A guardian angel .
But actually that 's the tax payers .
With a smirk , Andrew gets pissed and chimes in
Sullivan :
You 're favoring nationalizing the other companies .
and most industries ?
Klein :
No , I 'm just saying .
This is socialism for the rich .
Maher :
Why are you so hostile towards this ?
Sullivan : Because I think the fundamental thesis that she is proposing is wrong .
I think the reason why we 're in this situation is not demonizing a few individual companies , it 's systemic .
And part of the reason we have this is the American People .
The American people since the 70's have had stagnating income , so they decided to get something for nothing .
And the government never told them they could n't .
So we have the stock bubble of the 90's and now we have the real estate bubble in the 2000's .
Klein :
That 's not why we have this .
Sullivan :
And the government never told them they could n't .
Wall Street is to blame for giving these people these loans , but no one is ever forced to take out a bad load they cannot pay .
Klein :
The reason why this bubble was allowed to inflate was not that the American people demanded it , it was spectacularly profitable for Wall Street .
Just in bonuses last year , they handed out 33 billion dollars in bonuses ...
The problem is we have crybaby capitalism where when the times are good they are preaching deregulation and when the times are bad they want the bail - outs .
The problem I have with your argument is where is this ideal capitalism of which you speak ?
Andrew , the lenders told them they could get the houses for nothing and then lied about how they would pay for it and what they would pay , then bundled the cash and passed it on ...
And it 's not the government 's role to tell people what they cannot do .
That 's why we used to have regulations and background checks and down payments and mortgage lenders to oversee the system .
It weeds out the people that can and cannot afford a home .
He tried to deconstruct her argument because apparently he was n't getting enough air time at that point ( he filibustered the entire show after that ) with nonsensical rationalizations on the current state of affairs .
I lived through it and saw it up close and personal .
Yea , he supports Obama , great , but his conservative ideology is a sham .
Andrew Sullivan has been conned by a fictitious notion of what conservatism really is .
He states his Utopian vision of conservatism , but leaves out the part where conservatives want to deregulate everything and get rid of oversight and government so they can reap a magical harvest of cash like they have been doing during the entire Bush administration .
Now we are seeing the results of conservatism .
It 's a failure .
Does Sully really believe that conservatism exists without the fat cats expanding their pie of wealth in America to 1920's or pre-New Deal proportions ?
They 've been trying to undo the New Deal ever since it was instituted and by the way which brought the country back from the brink of destruction .
Do you want Barack Obama or John McCain to make these decisions ?
I think the choice is easy .
Conservative rule rains Armageddon down upon our heads --- whether it happens in two years or twenty .
It 's inevitable .
It was n't a $ 1.2 billion budget or higher utility fees that conjured up the most angst Monday night for the Mesa City Council .
It was fortune - telling .
After two people urged the council to protect public transportation , the budget for 2008 - 09 sailed through without a dissenting vote .
So did a potential $ 1 billion in capital spending over the next five years .
And so did rate hikes for water , sewer , natural gas and garbage pickup .
Eventually , the council worked its way down to an agenda item that called for the city to repeal its licensing provisions for fortune - tellers .
A subcommittee of the previous council had recommended the step in May , asserting the licenses and background checks served no purpose .
Last year the city counted 14 licensed operators .
The item had been on the consent agenda , meaning it was slated for automatic approval with no discussion .
But two people who identified themselves as psychics asked to speak on the issue and pleaded to keep the licenses and the $ 300 annual fee .
" We really , really , really need to keep our fortune - tellers license in place , " said Jennifer Adams , coming close to tears as she addressed the council .
" We get a very bad reputation .
Other people come to see me that tell me they got ripped off " by other psychics .
The licenses , she said , help the industry " get the riff - raff out . "
Councilman Scott Somers said the licenses really do n't speak to fortune - tellers ' qualifications .
" It 's not certification , " he said , as is the case with other professions .
" We 're just taxing you . "
But Councilwoman Dina Higgins said , " The system . . . has protected our community from crooks , " and the $ 300 fee only covers the city 's costs of administering the program .
After others echoed Higgins , Mayor Scott Smith said he favored repeal because he would rather see the free market determine which businesses succeed or fail .
" It does a pretty good job in most instances , " Smith said .
The final vote was 4 - 3 in favor of keeping the licenses .
Smith , Somers and Alex Finter voted for repeal ; Higgins , Dave Richins , Dennis Kavanaugh and Vice Mayor Kyle Jones voted to keep them .
Factchecking Palin
I thought Palin ’s speech was quite good : well - written , well delivered .
And , as I said earlier , I think she ’s a genuinely engaging person , and comes across very well .
There were just a couple of problems .
One , which I have seen people notice , but which I suspect wo n’t be a big deal for a lot of voters , is that it had very little substance .
The other , which the commenters I saw on TV for some reason neglected to mention , was that she told a lot of lies .
A few that stood out for me , or that I spotted in my quick run-through of some blogs :
Palin :
“ To the families of special - needs children all across this country , I have a message : For years , you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters .
I pledge to you that if we are elected , you will have a friend and advocate in the White House . ”
Sarah Palin might have changed her mind on this one recently .
However , a comment here notes that Palin actually slashed funding for schools for special needs kids by 62 % .
Budgets : FY 2007 ( pre-Palin ) , 2008 , 2009 ( all pdfs ) .
UPDATE : This is wrong .
As you can see if you look at the list of component budgets here ( 2007 ) and here ( 2009 ) , funding for the Alaska Challenge Youth Academy was broken out into its own budget category , which accounts for the drop in funding for the original item .
I regret the error .
Thanks to rory in comments .
END UPDATE .
Palin : “ As for my running mate , you can be certain that wherever he goes , and whoever is listening , John McCain is the same man . ”
Steve ’s list of McCain flip - flops is here .
See for yourself whether constancy is , in fact , John McCain ’s middle name .
Palin : “ I told the Congress “ thanks , but no thanks , ” for that Bridge to Nowhere .
If our state wanted a bridge , we ’d build it ourselves . ”
Just to reiterate what others have said : Congress ’ requirement that funds be spent on that bridge ( aka the ‘ earmark ’ ) were removed before Sarah Palin became governor .
She was therefore in no position to tell Congress anything about the bridge , one way or the other .
During her campaign , she said she supported funding for the bridge .
Brad Plumer , citing the Anchorage Dialy News via Nexis :
“ 5 . Would you continue state funding for the proposed Knik Arm and Gravina Island bridges ?
Yes .
I would like to see Alaska ’s infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later .
The window is now –while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist . ”
Later , she accepted the money — now not restricted by an earmark — and used it for other infrastructure projects .
Here ’s her statement about why she was n’t building the bridge ( also via Plumer . )
Decide for yourselves what role a principled opposition to earmark funding plays in it .
Hint : here ’s what residents of Ketchikan AK said when they heard her recent remarks :
“ In the city Ketchikan , the planned site of the so - called “ Bridge to Nowhere , ” political leaders of both parties said the claim was false and a betrayal of their community , because she had supported the bridge and the earmark for it secured by Alaska ’s Congressional delegation during her run for governor . ( …)
“ People are learning that she pandered to us by saying , I ’m for this ’ … and then when she found it was politically advantageous for her nationally , abruptly she starts using the very term that she said was insulting , ” Weinstein said . ”
Palin : “ But listening to him speak , it ’s easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform – not even in the state senate . ”
Ha , ha , ha .
I gave a rundown of Obama ’s accomplishments in the Senate here .
They include the Lugar - Obama bill on nonproliferation , and an ethics reform package that the Washington Post called “ the strongest ethics legislation to emerge from Congress yet . ”
Ruth Marcus summarizes his record on reform :
“ He helped pass a far - reaching ethics and campaign finance bill in the Illinois state Senate and made the issue a priority on arriving in Washington .
Much to the displeasure of his colleagues , Obama promoted an outside commission to handle Senate ethics complaints .
He co-authored the lobbying reform bill awaiting President Bush ’s signature and pushed — again to the dismay of some colleagues — to include a provision requiring lawmakers to report the names of their lobbyist - bundlers .
He has co-sponsored bills to overhaul the presidential public financing system and public financing of Senate campaigns . ”
Not a single major law or reform , indeed .
And I was n’t aware that writing memoirs was something to be ashamed of .
Obama has , in fact , written only one .
McCain ( with Mark Salter ) has written at least two .
Palin : “ America needs more energy … our opponent is against producing it . ”
No — he plans to develop a lot more energy than John McCain does .
It ’s just that a lot of it is renewable , not carbon - based .
Moreover , Obama has n’t skipped the last eight votes on renewable energy .
Palin : “ The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes … raise payroll taxes … raise investment income taxes … raise the death tax … raise business taxes … and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars .
My sister Heather and her husband have just built a service station that ’s now opened for business – like millions of others who run small businesses .
How are they going to be any better off if taxes go up ? ”
Well , it all depends whose taxes go up , does n’t it ?
If Heather and her husband make less than $ 250,000 , their taxes will not go up .
Most Americans will pay less in taxes under Obama ’s plan than under McCain’s .
So they might well be better off .
Those are just the falsehoods that leapt to mind .
I ’m sure there are others .
Whether or not Sarah Palin ’s engaging personality matters more than the fact that she tells lies depends a lot on the media , and whether they allow her to say that she opposed the Bridge to Nowhere , or that Obama has never authored a major law or reform , without calling her on it .
I hope they do .
But I ’m not holding my breath .
***
UPDATE : Mark Kleiman posts an Obama campaign rebuttal , which is more thorough than I was .
Creepily , McCain ’s running mate , Sarah Palin , has an increasingly bad record when it comes to being on the side of those who have been raped and sexually abused .
First , we learned that while mayor , she charged rape victims for their rape kits ( she was the only mayor in the state to do so , and the state had to pass a law to get her to stop it ) .
And now we learn that Palin says the reason she fired the trooper in her Troopergate scandal is because he was too aggressively trying to stop child predators .
So twice now we have Palin siding with rapists and child molesters .
Anybody else smelling an ad campaign ?
Chronicles of Middle Age , Chapter II ( At Least ) : In Which I Attend a Wedding
Do you know what the youth of today are doing ?
They ’re listening to ’ 80s music .
R.E.O. Speedwagon , and Madonna , and Michael Jackson and Journey .
“ Living on a Prayer ” sounds just great to them , and “ Do n’t Stop Believin ’ ” is a fist - flying , foot - stomping generational anthem .
( Though you might be interested to know , in this age of idiocracy , that the original title on the 1981 album “ Escape , ” included the “ g ” at the end . )
I know all this ; indeed , I am an expert in the Youth of Today , because I ’ve attended two weddings of twentysomethings in the past year .
They were the first weddings of twentysomethings that I ’d attended since the early 1990s , when the twentysomethings in question were my cousins and friends .
The wedding I went to this past weekend was a first in a more remarkable way as well : it was the very first time I was invited as a friend of the parents .
Yes – a friend of the parents .
One of those staid , faded people you remember from your own wedding , the vaguely known or ( in our case this weekend ) almost never - before - seen interlopers toward whom you tried not to show your utter lack of interest before slinking off to enjoy yourself with your friends .
“ You do n’t know who we are , ” my husband , Max , said to the bride on Saturday night , “ but thank you for inviting us . ”
“ Thank you for coming , ” she answered , with a smile .
This was an impressive exchange .
But then , I am generally much impressed with the youth of today .
They strike me as earnest .
Forward - looking .
And sincerely , almost unbelievably nice .
According to surveys , they drink less , do fewer drugs and experience less anomie than today ’s fortysomethings did at their age .
And , most shocking of all , they appear to like their parents .
They seem not to have the general disgust for older people and the distrust of their institutions — like marriage — that people of my generation did in the 1980s .
In fact , as Max and I lounged on a loveseat , watching the young people dance and whispering sweet nothings ( “ What ? ” I would honk .
“ Shout directly into the ear horn ! ” ) , a few of them cocked their heads sideways at us , and found us adorable .
“ Awww , ” they cooed .
It was nice to get this validation from the youth .
Part of me thought , though , that we should do something along the lines of showing them How It Was Done , and get up to dance to “ Billie Jean , ” “ The Breaks ” or “ Like a Prayer , ” which were , after all , our songs .
But another part of me was tired , having had a whole half glass of champagne over the course of the evening , and many other parts felt like they were being gouged by plastic flexicuffs , so tight and complicated were the supports holding my cantilevered body in place in my ambitious party attire .
Besides that , I remembered all too well the abject horror I used to feel , in my twenties , when people in their forties tried to dance .
I did n’t want to embarrass anyone .
Least of all , me .
For some clever part of me knew that the twentysomethings ’ embrace of all the worst music from my past was , in fact , ironic .
I also knew that my reclaiming of it would not be .
Not any longer .
It ’s a funny thing I ’ve noticed lately , listening to the “ classic rock ” stations that are now — unbelievably — broadcasting the soundtrack of my life : bad music sounds so good once it becomes the music of your youth .
All the songs you hated , all the bands you mocked , all the pop clichés you spurned because you were so much cooler than all that now sound so soulful , so very real .
This nostalgia for self is quite a shocker , particularly for someone who — like most people , I imagine — spent much of her youth striving to escape from herself .
How silly it is to cling to non-existent memories .
To smile dodderingly at “ Sweet Caroline ” when I ’m not really old enough to remember it from the first time around .
To wax sentimental for “ Hotel California ” when I found it sinister in the seventies .
To grin with recognition at “ Maneater , ” when in fact it has always made me grimace with pain .
How weird it is to suddenly morph from a person who looks out at life through the jaundiced eye of studied irony to one who – children growing older , parents older still – grasps at life , buying Hallmark greeting cards with great care and attention and crying at weddings of people I ’d never met before .
Last month , when Max was away for two weeks at the Democratic and Republican conventions , I discovered E - cards .
I was missing him , so I sent him cards with setting suns and flying birds and blooming flowers and equally flowery words of love .
I sort of sent them as a joke .
“ Sobbing now , ” he sort of joked back , in an E - card thank you .
What has happened to us ?
Middle age , that ’s what .
On Sunday , I had a phrase lodged in my mind , as Max and I drove home to D.C. from the Connecticut wedding , listening to the classic rock stations in state after state .
“ I am the dog , ” I said it was .
“ You are the dog , ” Max insisted .
It was a phrase we both thought we remembered from an article we ’d read , early in our marriage , in Rolling Stone magazine .
Max said it had to do with smoking pot : the author had described how , when she was young and stoned with friends , a dog ’s entering the room could seem improbably hilarious ( a “ whoa … fur ” kind of a thing ) , whereas , once she reached her thirties , pot-smoking had led to the quickly sobering thought that “ You are the dog . ”
I said that it really was about age : “ I am the dog ” when I realize I am all that I once found ridiculous .
I hunted the story down this week , thanks to a kind Rolling Stone researcher , and found that , in fact , we both had been right .
“ The Dog Is Us ” had been written in 1992 by Marcelle Clements , who was revisiting an earlier essay she ’d written in 1982 , charting the end of her sixties cohort ’s romance with smoking pot .
( “ Now the dog is us .
And it ’s not funny . ” )
And she had concluded that her dog semi-metaphor had n’t been about pot-smoking at all .
The dog , she ’d realized in her forties , was “ indeed , me . ”
There is much that is good about being the dog .
It is to be connected , engaged , centered , happy .
But there is a worrisome aspect to it as well .
Professionally , I find being the dog to be a terrifying prospect .
Being at peace with the world does n’t lend itself well to polemics .
What if contentment heralds the death of having anything interesting to say ?
I obsessed about this all the way through New Jersey .
Thank god for anxiety , is all I can conclude .
And thank god for the dog .
Booman Tribune
August 11 , 2008
Everyone should read this opinion piece in today ’s Washington Post .
It ’s written by Ronald D. Asmus , a deputy assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration and Richard Holbrooke , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the Clinton administration .
If you want to have some sense about the bi-partisan commitment to U.S. policy in the Caucuses , you need to read this opinion piece very carefully .
If you fail to come to terms with both the meaning and the implications of this piece , then you simply will not be able to understand or anticipate the U.S. reaction to Russia ’s invasion of Georgia .
While the Left seems paralyzed with debate over who started this fight or how worthy Georgia is as a democracy and an ally , the rest of the foreign policy Establishment could not be less interested .
For example , here is Asmus and Holbrooke ’s treatment of the culpability issue :
Exactly what happened in South Ossetia last week is unclear .
Each side will argue its own version .
But we know , without doubt , that Georgia was responding to repeated provocative attacks by South Ossetian separatists controlled and funded by Moscow .
This is a not a war Georgia wanted ; it believed that it was slowly gaining ground in South Ossetia through a strategy of soft power .
Whatever mistakes Tbilisi has made , they cannot justify Russia ’s actions .
Moscow has invaded a neighbor , an illegal act of aggression that violates the U.N. Charter and fundamental principles of cooperation and security in Europe .
Beginning a well - planned war ( including cyber - warfare ) as the Olympics were opening violates the ancient tradition of a truce to conflict during the Games .
And Russia ’s willingness to create a war zone 25 miles from the Black Sea city of Sochi , where it is to host the Winter Games in 2014 , hardly demonstrates its commitment to Olympic ideals .
In contrast , Moscow ’s timing suggests that Putin seeks to overthrow Saakashvili well ahead of our elections , and thus avoid beginning relations with the next president on an overtly confrontational note .
Russia ’s goal is not simply , as it claims , restoring the status quo in South Ossetia .
It wants regime change in Georgia .
The West sees this move as a sign of a newly aggressive Russia , and a precursor to larger ambitions .
As Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt pointed out Saturday , Moscow ’s rationale for invading has parallels to the darkest chapters of Europe ’s history .
Having issued passports to tens of thousands of Abkhazians and South Ossetians , Moscow now claims it must intervene to protect them — a tactic reminiscent of one used by Nazi Germany at the start of World War II .
Moscow seeks to roll back democratic breakthroughs on its borders , to destroy any chance of further NATO or E.U. enlargement and to reestablish a sphere of hegemony over its neighbors .
By trying to destroy a democratic , pro-Western Georgia , Moscow is sending a message that , in its part of the world , being close to Washington and the West does not pay .
I hope you know your history because the United States will go to war to maintain its prestige and its credibility as an ally .
Even more so , the West will go to war to protect our investments in the Caspian Basin , including the hard fought Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan pipeline , which was a decade in the making and was organized through groups like the United States - Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce , headed by James Baker , Zbigniew Brzezinski , Brent Scowcroft , Henry Kissinger , and John Sununu .
None of these people are remotely interested in whether Russian - backed Ossetians provoked the Georgians or the Georgians provoked the Russians .
All that matters is what the Russians do now .
And there is an information war going on right now between Russia and Georgia .
In a scenario such as this , there are not many reliable sources .
Any Russian annexation of Georgia would threaten British Petroleum ’s assets to such a degree that British sources are not reliable .
American sources are suspect for the same reason .
I would not trust Russian sources , either .
Perhaps the East Asian press can be seen as an honest broker .
In any case , the Associated Press is reporting that Russia has advanced south from the " province of Abkhazia while most Georgian forces are locked up in fighting around another breakaway region of South Ossetia " and seized a Georgian military base and police stations a full thirty miles inside Georgia proper .
This is their weak confirmation :
In Moscow , a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give his name , confirmed the move into Senaki and said it was intended to prevent Georgian troops from concentrating .
While many on the Left are twiddling their thumbs wondering why the United States decided to involve themselves in the Caucuses in the first place ( a decision initiated by Bush and Baker in the early 1990 ’s and enthusiastically endorsed by Clinton ’s powerful Commerce Department ) , the National Security Council ( including Democratic members ) and the NSC - in - exile ( people like ZBig and Holbrooke ) are having none of it .
This moment could well mark the end of an era in Europe during which realpolitik and spheres of influence were supposed to be replaced by new cooperative norms and a country ’s right to choose its own path .
Hopes for a more liberal Russia under President Dmitry Medvedev will need to be reexamined .
His justification for this invasion reads more like Brezhnev than Gorbachev .
While no one wants a return to Cold War - style confrontation , Moscow ’s behavior poses a direct challenge to European and international order .
When Big Boys like this get their knickers in a twist , things can come to a head very quickly .
Remember Cuba , the Bay of Pigs , and the Missile Crisis ?
Remember the Domino Theory and the Korean and Vietnam Wars ?
Only this time we ’re talking about former Soviet territory and major oil and gas revenues .
This is not some faux - conflict that was ginned up by John McCain and the neoconservatives as some kind of electoral season strategy .
And , even if it was ( and it ’s not ) it ’s gone far beyond that now .
What does the Democratic Foreign Policy Establishment recommend that we do ?
In addition to threatening to take the 2014 Winter Olympics away from Russia , they give the following three - point strategy :
What can we do ?
First , Georgia deserves our solidarity and support .
( Georgia has supported us ; its more than 2,000 troops are the third - largest contingent in Iraq — understandably those troops are being recalled . )
We must get the fighting stopped and preserve Georgia ’s territorial integrity within its current international border .
As soon as hostilities cease , there should be a major , coordinated transatlantic effort to help Tbilisi rebuild and recover .
Second , we should not pretend that Russia is a neutral peacekeeper in conflicts on its borders .
Russia is part of the problem , not the solution .
For too long , Moscow has used existing international mandates to pursue neo-imperial policies .
We must disavow these mandates and insist on truly neutral international forces , under the United Nations , to monitor a future cease - fire and to mediate .
Third , we need to counter Russian pressure on its neighbors , especially Ukraine — most likely the next target in Moscow ’s efforts to create a new sphere of hegemony .
The United States and the European Union must be clear that Ukraine and Georgia will not be condemned to some kind of gray zone .
I can hear the Left now laughing at Asmus and Holbrooke ’s audacity in accusing Russia of neo-imperial policies .
Is n’t this conflict taking place in Russia ’s sphere of influence ?
Has n’t the West been relentlessly provocative ?
Did n’t Russia warn us about the eastward expansion of NATO , anti-missile defenses in the Czech Republic , and the independence of Kosovo ?
Yes , yes they did .
And it does n’t matter an iota to our bi-partisan foreign policy Establishment .
This is power geopolitics at its rawest and it has major consequences for our strategic position in Central Asia and the Middle East .
Did Dick Cheney say something alarmingly bellicose ?
Sure .
But Cheney differs from Holbrooke only in tone .
Russia is threatening more than the Bush / Cheney policy vis-a - vis Georgia .
They are threatening eight years of Clinton foreign policy .
In the many years I have been writing this blog I have been a consistent critic of Clinton ’s foreign policy , especially in the Caucuses and as relates to NATO expansion .
I made these points many times during the primaries .
But there are two things you need to keep in mind .
Just because there are legitimate criticisms of U.S. foreign policy does not mean that Russia is on the right side of history .
But , more importantly , the foreign policy Establishment is united behind these policies and has invested in them over the course now of almost 20 years .
There is n’t a whole lot of room for debate over what should have been .
We ’re here now .
Like an aircraft carrier , you cannot turn around bipartisan U.S. foreign policy on a dime .
This is not some uniquely neoconservative policy .
This is U.S. policy .
Working to change that policy demands that we understand the policy as it is and as it has been .
We need to understand the military justification of that policy ( access to energy supplies to fuel our Naval Fleets and Air Force ) as well as the economic justifications .
And we should not kid ourselves that we will find Democratic allies in Congress or the Obama campaign that are going to argue that our policy has been all wrong all along .
That will never happen .
If this conflict becomes a matter of debate in the presidential campaign , it will not be over the wisdom of the overall policy .
Obama would be abandoned by the foreign policy Establishment in a New York Minute .
That ’s the sad fact .
So , the U.S. is not going to back down willingly .
If it backs down it will be for the same reason that the USSR ultimately backed down during the Cuban Missile Crisis .
If we back down it will be because this is ultimately in the Russian sphere of influence and we have no better options given the risk of nuclear conflict .

The land that time forgot
For years they lived in seclusion , until one day the authorities stumbled over Wales 's " lost tribe " .
They fought for their alternative lifestyle , and won .
But now they face a new battle , writes Jonathan Duffy .
It 's hard to imagine anyone - let alone a whole community - could disappear for long in modern - day Britain .
But obscurity was what the people of Brithdir Mawr wished for and obscurity was what they got , for almost five peaceful years .
In that time the community , which is tucked away in a corner of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park , toiled hard towards its aim of becoming self - sufficient .
It 's a bitter irony that this drive for autonomy eventually helped betray them to the outside world .
Photographs taken by a survey plane revealed a solar panel glinting in the sun .
The game was up .
When the park 's authorities went to investigate , they were stunned to find a community of about a dozen adults , some with children , living contentedly and quite comfortably off the land .
The story went out of a " lost tribe " , journalists and TV crews showed up , followed by curious members of the public , and district planners pondered whether to pull down much of the development , which had no planning consent .
Three years on , and the community is prospering , if such a word can be applied to people who shun all common notions of wealth and success .
But the battle with the authorities is not over .
While initial orders to demolish several buildings dotted over the 165 - acre site were dropped , planners have not relented totally .
Brithdir Mawr ... ... means large speckled lands
The national park is insisting on the demolition of a turf - roofed roundhouse that is a home to two community members .
Last month , the Welsh assembly 's planning inspector upheld the decision , although it gave the occupants , Tony Wrench and his partner Jane Faith , 18 months grace .
The order came as a serious blow to the pair , not just because they would be losing their home but also because they had gone to extraordinary lengths in planning and building it .
From the off , Tony Wrench wanted a home that would stand in harmony with the local landscape .
He set out some basic ground rules : the house should generate all its own power and all materials should be natural and biodegradable .
Cement was a strict no - no because of pollution during its manufacture .
Instead it was built around larch timbers cut from a sustainable wood inside Brithdir Mawr .
The walls are a combination of logs , straw and mud ; the turf roof was laid on a rubber pond liner that rests on larch timbers .
In the centre is a skylight .
The roundhouse , which is 34ft across , is sited several hundred yards from the main cluster of old farm buildings that are home to most of the community , next to a low grass bank , which provides shelter from the elements .
Even its circular shape draws on ancient Celtic influences , a fact endorsed by Malcolm Parry , professor of architecture at Cardiff University , who has visited the house and given it his seal of approval .
On a chilly winter 's day it is warm , bright and cosy inside .
Shards of green and blue sunlight stream in through the coloured bottles that are set into one of the walls .
It may only have cost £ 3,000 to build , but the roundhouse is a welcoming retreat .
While the outside world ravenously chews up the Earth 's finite resources in the name of comfort and convenience , inside the gates of Brithdir Mawr nothing is wasted .
Their mantra is sustainability , or , to be more precise , permaculture - the means by which man can live harmoniously with nature .
Living in the community
The settlement covers 165 acres Meals are shared four times a week Children are taught on site Members do n't claim benefits
Some do part - time work outside the community
As one resident put it : " Our aim is to live on this Earth and touch it as lightly as possible . "
Despite these passionately held views , members have not banished the " real world " , as might a religious cult or a commune of Luddites .
They have a television , video , computer ( and a website ) and mobile phones , all powered by electricity generated on site , through a combination of wind , solar and hydro power .
Inquisitive passers - by drop in about once a week , and there is a hostel in the grounds for backpackers .
It 's hard to imagine how the inhabitants of Brithdir Mawr lived unnoticed for so long .
The truth , says Jane Faith , is that this " lost tribe " were never really lost .
" We were never hiding from anyone .
We just got on with life , which sometimes meant going to the town for shopping .
Local people knew we were here , we just did n't shout about it . "
Emma Orbach , who set up the community with her husband Julian , bluntly analyses the philosophical gap between Brithdir Mawr and the outside world : " What we 're doing is directly opposite to the goals of this society , which is to consume more and to make more money . "
The couple bought the land in 1993 , set about restoring the neglected old farm buildings - Julian Orbach is an architectural historian - and invited similarly minded friends to live there and share what they had .
( They are in the process of transferring the estate into a trust that will be jointly owned by members . )
" I just think it 's a matter of attitude really .
I do n't find it difficult at all , " says Emma .
" I have n't had a fridge for over 20 years , I have n't used a washing machine for perhaps 25 years and I 've had three children in that time . "
Members must give three days a week to the community - work varies from laying hedges and tending the livestock to looking after the fruit and vegetable gardens and building fences .
They can earn their own money on the other two working days but claiming benefits is not allowed .
There are four communal meals a week and , each Wednesday , the collective gathers for a meeting to vote on key issues .
Children are educated on site and encouraged to learn at their own pace .
Some have gone on to take exams at a local college .
Nothing is wasted , not even human waste .
The toilet huts are separate from living quarters but inside they look much the same as a normal loo - right down to the stack of reading material next to the pedestal .
Instead of flushing , you throw a handful of sawdust down the pan .
After several months of aerobic composting , the result is " top quality " manure , says Tony Wrench .
Compost loos , like so much else at Brithdir Mawr , characterise a highly unorthodox way of life .
But while wood - burning stoves , rickety electrics and subsistence farming may look more 19th Century than 21st , some believe the community may be living more in the future than most of us .
For all its renegade appeal , the collective has earned some highly orthodox support .
Some of its work is sponsored by the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme and the community has been visited in connection with a Welsh assembly report into sustainable living .
But the official backing clearly does not extend to Tony Wrench 's eco-house , which will have to be demolished next year unless planners can be convinced to overturn the order .
Despite the approval of respected architecture critic Malcolm Parry , who gave evidence at a Welsh Office hearing into the future of the house , the authorities want it gone .
The national park objects to it being built in open countryside while the Welsh Office inspector called it " seriously out of keeping " .
Tony Wrench , whose bulky frame and Grizzly Adams beard belie his placid nature and almost whispered tones , gets letters of support from the public every day .
The 55 - year - old who once had a career on the other side of the fence , as a local government employee , believes his house is not a blot on the landscape , but a beautiful vision of how man can live happily with Mother Nature .
" You could say that it 's our fault for building such an unusual house somewhere that is n't within a settlement , " says Tony , who earns an income as a part - time woodturner .
" But I do n't want to live in a stone , square house anymore .
I do n't actually find them particularly dry or warm and they 're very expensive . "
Despite the letters of goodwill and great public sympathy for his plight , this is a man who clearly longs for nothing more than a quiet life .
For almost 50 years , no train has stopped at the station of Bazancourt .
A village in the Champagne region of France with just under 2,000 inhabitants , it was cut off from the railway network after the second world war and lay forgotten .
As France roared into a new era of high - speed train travel - or train à grande vitesse ( TGV ) as it is known in France - that linked up big cities , the provinces were left out in the cold .
Now , however , Bazancourt is back on track .
Its dilapidated station has been given a lick of paint and restored to its former glory .
The missing letters from its name have been fixed back on the freshly white - washed walls .
As of 1 September , twelve trains from the regional network will stop at its modernised platforms every day and the locals are claiming victory in what they have called the " battle of Bazancourt " .
" We have been fighting for years for this and now at last it 's happened , " said Michel Jahyer , president of an association pushing for the reopening of smaller stations in the region around the city of Reims .
" For 40 years the policy of the SNCF [ public rail network ] has been to focus almost entirely on the TGV .
It was always the TGV .
They have been totally uninterested in the rest of us . "
Jahyer , for one , is delighted with what many are hailing as the revival of France 's regional railways .
He will now be able to travel to Reims in just 11 minutes , a distinct improvement on a half - hour car journey or winding bus tour which takes an hour to do the journey of 16 miles .
The village 's teenagers will be able to come home from school on their own , the car - less elderly will be relieved of their isolation and commuters will be freed of the costs of parking and petrol .
But it is not just in Bazancourt that this is happening .
All over France authorities are showing signs of waking up to the needs of the provinces after years in which high - speed , inter-city links have been the unquestioned priority .
From Provence to the outskirts of Paris , disused lines are being reactivated , small town stations reopened and new networks built .
At the same time , in a summer of soaring petrol prices and plummeting spending power , many French people are starting to make changes to the way they move around .
Fuel consumption is down .
For the first time in 30 years , car use is down as well .
Public transport is facing its highest demand in years - and one French news magazine asked this month whether these trends indicated a new era and " the end of the reign of the car " .
Régis van Herreweghe , a spokesman for the Mayor of Bazancourt , said the changes in his village had clear implications for the wider world .
" This mode of transport has obvious significance in terms of sustainable development in a global context of rising prices and fuel shortages , " he said .
" Travelling by rail helps people save money and protect the environment . "
Speaking of the need to face up to the demands of a new , energy - efficient era , Guillaume Pépy , the president of the SNCF , said the main challenge of the coming years would be to provide a real alternative to the car .
" This is an incredible chance for the railway , which many people 30 years ago thought had no future , " he said .
" Today , with the energy crisis , we 're moving into a different period .
Everyone realises that the car can not be the only answer . "
Michel Jahyer , meanwhile , is now lobbying the local Champagne - Ardenne authorities for a new railway station at the village of Chatelet - sur - Retourne , just eight miles down the road .
" There are still places without any public transport at all , " he said .
" No station , no bus , no nothing . "
The battle of Bazancourt may have been won but the war , it seems , will roll on .

This is the sixth post in an article series about MIT 's lecture course " Introduction to Algorithms . "
In this post I will review lectures nine and ten , which are on the topic of Search Trees .
Search tree data structures provide many dynamic - set operations such as search , insert , delete , minimum element , maximum element and others .
The complexity of these operations is proportional to the height of the tree .
The better we can balance the tree , the faster they will be .
Lectures nine and ten discuss two such structures .
Lecture nine discusses randomly built binary search trees .
A randomly built binary search tree is a binary tree that arises from inserting the keys in random order into an initially empty tree .
The key result shown in this lecture is that the height of this tree is O ( lg ( n ) ) .
Lecture ten discusses red - black trees .
A red - black tree is a binary search tree with extra bit of information at each node -- it 's color , which can be either red or black .
By contrasting the way nodes are colored on any path from the root to a leaf , red - black trees ensure that the tree is balanced , giving us guarantees that the operations on this tree will run on O ( lg ( n ) ) time !
PS .
Sorry for being silent for the past two weeks .
I am preparing for job interviews at a company starting with ' G ' and it is taking all my time . ;)
Lecture 9 : Randomly Built Binary Search Trees
Lecture nine starts with an example of good and bad binary search tree .
Given a binary tree with n nodes , a good trees has height log(n ) but the bad one has height close to n .
As the basic operations on trees run in time proportional to the height of the tree , it 's recommended that we build the good trees and not the bad ones .
Before discussing randomly built binary search trees , professor Erik Demaine shows another sorting algorithm .
It 's called binary search tree sort ( BST - sort ) .
It 's amazingly simple -- given an array of n items to sort , build a BST out of it and do an in - order tree walk on it .
In - order tree walk walks the left branch first , then prints the values , and then walks the right branch .
Can you see why the printed list of values is sorted ?
( If not see the lecture ;) ) [ part three of the article series covers sorting algorithms ]
Turns out that there is a relation between BST - sort and quicksort algorithm .
BST - sort and quicksort make the same comparisons but in different order .
[ more info on quicksort in part two of article series and in " three beautiful quicksorts " post ]
After this discussion , the lecture finally continues with randomized BST - sort which leads to idea of randomly built BSTs .
The other half of the lecture is devoted to a complicated proof of the expected height of a randomly built binary search tree .
The result of this proof is that the expected height is order log (n ) .

Lecture 10 : Red-Black Trees
Lecture ten begins with a discussion of balanced search trees .
Balanced search tree is search tree data structure maintain a dynamic set of n elements using tree of height log (n ) .
There are many balanced search tree data structures .
For example : AVL trees ( invented in 1964 ) , 2 - 3 trees ( invented in 1970 ) , 2 - 3 - 4 trees , B - trees , red - black trees , skiplists , treaps .
This lecture focuses exclusively on red - black trees .
Red - black trees are binary search trees with extra color field for each node .
They satisfy red - black properties :
Every node is either red or black .
The root and leaves are black .
Every red node has a black parent .
All simple paths from a node to x to a descendant leaf of x have same number of black nodes = black - height ( x ) .
The lecture gives a proof sketch of the height of an RB - tree and discusses running time of queries ( search , min , max , successor , predecessor operations ) and then goes into details of update operations ( insert , delete ) .
Along the way rotations on a tree are defined , the right - rotate and left - rotate ops .
The other half of the lecture looks at Red-Black - Insert operation that inserts an element in the tree while maintaining the red - black properties .

Pop punk trio Blink - 182 announced an " indefinite hiatus " in 2005
Former Blink - 182 drummer Travis Barker has been seriously injured in a Learjet plane crash in South Carolina , in the US , that has killed four people .
A Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said the plane , which was trying to take off , went off the runway and crashed on a nearby road .
She said air traffic controllers had reported seeing sparks coming from the plane , which was carrying six people .
Barker and US club DJ Adam Goldstein are being treated for burns .
A spokeswoman for the hospital in Augusta , Georgia , where they are being treated said Barker and Adam Goldstein - also known as DJ AM - were both in a critical condition .
The pair , who perform together under the name TRVSDJ - AM , had been playing in Columbia , South Carolina .
The plane crashed before midnight local time on Friday night .
In February 2005 , pop punk trio Blink - 182 announced they were going on an " indefinite hiatus " with no plans to work together in the future .
The band 's record label Geffen said that Barker and bandmates Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus aimed to " spend some time enjoying the fruits of their labours with loved ones " .
Blink - 182 had nine UK hits including All the Small Things in 2000 .

I found this blog entry to be very interesting .
It ’s about a paper that has been written on distinguishing those who can program from those who can’t .
( The blog entry contains a link to the paper itself , too , which is here . )
I should say that the intent of the paper is not elitist .
“ We can program , and you can ’t , so do n’t even bother to try . ”
But programming is something that people seem to have either a natural ability for , or… well … do n’t .
As the authors of the paper say :
Learning to program is notoriously difficult .
A substantial minority of students fails in every introductory programming course in every UK university .
Despite heroic academic effort , the proportion has increased rather than decreased over the years .
Despite a great deal of research into teaching methods and student responses , we have no idea of the cause .
It has long been suspected that some people have a natural aptitude for programming , but until now there has been no psychological test which could detect it .
Programming ability is not known to be correlated with age , with sex , or with educational attainment ; nor has it been found to be correlated with any of the aptitudes measured in conventional ‘ intelligence ’ or ‘ problem - solving - ability ’ tests .
We point out that programming teaching is useless for those who are bound to fail and pointless for those who are certain to succeed .
…. Assignment and sequence … hardly look as if they should be hurdles at all : storage of / remembering information and doing one thing after another are part of everyday patterns of life and thought , and you might have expected ( as at first do most teachers ) that students ’ experience could be analogised into some kind of programming expertise .
Not so : it is a real hurdle , and it comes at the very beginning of most programming courses .
We could hardly expect that students would choose the Java model of assignment … but it rapidly became clear that despite their various choices of model , in the first administration they divided into three distinct groups with no overlap at all : 44 % used the same model for all , or almost all , of the questions .
We call this the consistent group .
39 % used different models for different questions .
We call this the the inconsistent group .
The remaining 8 % refused to answer all or almost all of the questions .
We call this the blank group .
We did not interview our subjects to determine anything about their group membership , so we do not know whether students chose consciously or unconsciously to follow one strategy or another , nor how conscious choices ( if any ) were motivated , nor what any particular choice meant to a subject who made it .
We have no information about how group membership correlates with earlier education , employment experience , age , sex , marital status or indeed anything else .
People who fell into one of the three groups before taking the course tended to fall into the same group after taking the course .
Speculation is part of science , though , and those to whom we have recounted this tale have usually been ready to try it .
Told that there were three groups and how they were distinguished , but not told their relative sizes , we have found that computer scientists and other programmers have almost all predicted that the blank group would be more successful in the course exam than the others : “ they had the sense to refuse to answer questions which they could n’t understand ” is a typical explanation .
Non-programming social scientists , mathematicians and historians , given the same information , almost all pick the inconsistent group : “ they show intelligence by picking methods to suit the problem ” is the sort of thing they say .
Very few , so far , have predicted that the consistent group would be the most successful .
Remarkably , it is the consistent group , and almost exclusively the consistent group , that is successful .
We speculate on the reasons in section 7 .
[ One of their graphs ] suggests that it is extremely difficult to teach programming to the inconsistent and blank groups .
It might be possible to teach them , if we concentrated on trying to persuade them to see a programming language as a system of rules ( though the evidence in section 6 below seems to suggest otherwise ) .
The consistent group seem to be much easier to teach .
We speculate that they divide into two groups : the very successful ones find programming easy and may perhaps be those who ought to follow a conventional computer - science education , with lots of formal content ; the moderately successful perhaps are the software engineers , those who can program but ca n’t imagine that they will ever enjoy it , and are content to submit to management discipline and to be drowned in UML ( ugh ! ) .
That quote is followed closely by this sentence , which I rather enjoyed :
The authors talk about three significant hurdles that students encounter , when learning to program : assignment and sequence ; recursion / iteration ; concurrency .
They then go on to say this , which I found very interesting : I ’m sure , when I was first learning to program , that I became frustrated with fellow students , when they could n’t figure out how assignment works .
I guess this paper explains both sides of the coin : why my fellow students could n’t get it , and why it seemed so obvious to me .
But enough preamble .
Let ’s talk about the test itself .
It consisted of questions such as the following ( click to see a bigger version ) :
And the authors found these results :
The great thing about the study is that the test was administered twice :
Once before the students had had any computer programming studies , and once after they had completed their first course .
( The authors are n’t really sure whether it was planned to give the test prior to instruction , or if it was a happy accident . )
They found that the results were fairly consistent :
Interestingly , the authors then talked about using these groups to predict who would be good programmers , and who would n’t .
I would have expected that the “ consistent ” group would be the most successful programmers , but I would have been in the minority :
And what do they feel are the results of this study ?
First of all , they feel that they have a predictive test , as to who will be a good programmer , and who will not .
As a side - note , why does everyone hate UML ?
I do n’t know how scientifically accurate this study will turn out to be , or if the authors will attempt to try it in a larger experiment with more subjects , but I found it interesting nonetheless .
July 29 , 2008 -- Nonsmokers who are married to someone who smokes have a greatly increased risk for stroke , a finding that further underscores the dangers of secondhand smoke .
Researchers reporting in the September issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine say the risk varies depending on whether the nonsmoking spouse has smoked in the past .
Secondhand smoke makes a person more likely to develop heart disease , but until now , few studies have linked such exposure to stroke risk .
One trial suggested that a husband 's smoking increased a wife 's chances for a stroke , but only if the woman also smoked .
For the current study , M. Maria Glymour , ScD , of the Harvard School of Public Health , and colleagues looked at the smoking habits of the spouses of more than 16,000 stroke - free married adults aged 50 and older who were enrolled in the Health and Retirement Study ( HRS ) .
The study only evaluated cigarette use , not cigars or pipe tobacco .
Researchers followed the participants for about nine years to document the occurrence of first stroke .
During the study period , there were 1,130 first strokes reported .
Being married to a current smoker increased the risk of a first stroke by 42 % among those who never smoked .
The risk of stroke was higher for former smokers who were married to current smokers .
Former smokers who had a smoking spouse had a 72 % increased risk for stroke compared with those who were married to a never - smoker .
The good news , researchers say , is the risk can be cut if the spouse kicks the habit .
Participants who had never smoked and who were married to a former smoker had nearly the same stroke risk as never - smokers married to never - smokers .
" These findings indicate that spousal smoking increases stroke risk among nonsmokers and former smokers .
The health benefits of quitting smoking likely extend beyond individual smokers to affect their spouses , potentially multiplying the benefits of smoking cessation , " Glymour writes in the journal article .
The most detailed study of an asteroid shows that it contains precious metals worth at least $ 20,000bn .
The data were collected last December by the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous ( Near ) spacecraft which passed close to the asteroid Eros .
It provided an unprecedented look at one of the mountains of rock that fly around the solar system .
The first conclusions from that encounter are now published the journal Science .
Eros : A " banana " in space
Over a thousand images of Eros were transmitted back to Earth that allowed scientists to estimate its size and mass .
The results are startling .
Gold mine in space
Eros is believed to have been formed from the wreckage of a collision with a larger body .
Its composition appears to be similar to the stony meteorites that frequently fall to Earth .
If Eros is typical of stony meteorites , then it contains about 3 % metal .
With the known abundance 's of metals in meteorites , even a very cautious estimate suggests 20,000 million tonnes of aluminium along with similar amounts of gold , platinum and other rarer metals .
Controllers briefly lost contact with the Near craft
That is just in one asteroid and not a very large one at that .
There are thousands of asteroids out there .
Astronomic value
How much is Eros worth ?
Today 's trading price for gold is about $ 250 per ounce or about $ 9 m per tonne .
It means the value of the gold in asteroid Eros is about $ 1,000bn .
That is just the gold .
Platinum is even more expensive , $ 350 per oz .
Work it out yourself .
Since it contains a lot of rare elements and metals that are of use in the semiconductor industry for example , at today 's prices Eros is worth more than $ 20,000bn .
Market busting
But there are two problems with this analysis .
Eros partially illuminated by the Sun
But in the week we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the first footprint on the Moon can we not contemplate mining what is just another big chunk of rock in space ?
One way to get the metals back would be to mine them on Eros and send the refined iron back to Earth .
Solar powered
It takes about 2,000 calories to boil a gram of iron so the equivalent of between 20 to 200 thousand megatons of TNT would be needed to start liberating substantial quantities of iron from the asteroid .
But this energy could be obtained from the Sun .
If you wanted to mine only a section of Eros at a time then a huge solar energy collector - a sheet only a few kilometres in size - could collect enough energy from sunlight to power a smelting plant on the surface of Eros .
These are all " guesstimate " figures .
But they serve to demonstrate just how plentiful are the resources of the Solar System , in terms of minerals , metals and energy , once we decide to go out and get them .
It shows how mining one fairly small asteroid like Eros would revolutionise the availability of many raw materials on Earth .
No one knows how much a robot mission to mine an asteroid would cost but I am willing to bet it would be the best return on an investment since Leonardo da Vinci bought a sketch pad or Paul McCartney a guitar .
While clashes in remote Helmand dominate the headlines , another battle is being waged by the insurgents on Kabul 's doorstep .
There , the Taliban are winning support by building a parallel administration , which is more effective , more popular and more brutal than the government 's
Ismatullah stood at the crossroads in the dusty Afghan town of Maidan Shah , squinted in the blinding noon sun and stroked his long , grey beard .
' What the governor said in our meeting was very good , ' he said diplomatically .
' He quoted the Koran very correctly .
But I am not sure how much power he has .
Now I am going home - and the Taliban control my district , not him . '
The tribal elder lives only a few miles from Maidan Shah , in a part of Afghanistan which , until a few months ago , was considered under the authority of President Hamid Karzai 's central government .
Maidan Shah is a typical Afghan town - a scruffy huddle of mechanics ' workshops , stalls selling out - of - date Iranian jam , the charred frames of two fuel trucks burnt out in a recent insurgent attack , and a clutch of battered barrows from which destitute farmers in rags sell bruised apples and tiny brown pomegranates .
A dozen men lie on the flat floor of the single restaurant amid clouds of flies , sip smeared glasses of tea and stare hard at strangers .
Follow the main road back towards the Afghan capital and in 15 minutes you will be at the narrow pass in the ring of craggy , dusty hills around the city known for centuries as ' the Gates of Kabul ' .
If there is a front line between the insurgents and the government , it is here , just a dozen miles south of the capital .
There is no clear front line , of course - which is part of the problem .
In the UK , it is the south of Afghanistan , where British troops are fighting , that has received most attention .
Yet last week 's battle in which 10 French soldiers died took place only an hour 's drive from Kabul .
It is in places like Maidan Shah , not remote provincial Helmand , that the struggle for Afghanistan will be won or lost .
' The war in the south is basically a tough , bitterly fought stalemate , ' admitted one senior Nato officer last week .
' It is around Kabul that the Taliban must now be stopped . '
Reporting from these contested zones is difficult .
Even on the outskirts of Kabul , Westerners and government officials risk attack or kidnap .
However , scores of interviews and two journeys through the embattled areas south of the capital help to establish at least a partial picture of what is happening on the ground .
Although news bulletins inside and outside Afghanistan are dominated by bomb blasts or clashes , the real strength of the insurgents lies not in their ability to ambush convoys or plant roadside bombs but in the parallel administration they have managed to establish in huge areas across the south and east of Afghanistan .
There they make the law , enforcing a harsh , but sometimes welcome , order while intimidating any dissenters .
Their strategy is deliberate and long - term .
From this new position of strength , they are building durable networks of support .
What has happened in Wardak province shows how they have done it .
The only cases that come before Amanullah Ishaqzai , a government judge in Wardak , are those which require an official stamp or disputes among the province 's mainly Shia Muslim Hazara ethnic minority , who have historically suffered at the hands of the Sunni Pashtun tribes who make up the bulk of the Taliban .
Most of the province 's 800,000 inhabitants , mainly peasants , go to the insurgents for rough but often effective justice .
' I can't blame them , ' Ishaqzai said .
' A court case in the government system takes five years and many bribes .
The Taliban will settle it in an afternoon . '
Every villager has stories of how the Taliban settle the myriad property disputes which mark Afghan society .
In scores of cases , Ishaqzai said , he had convened a traditional tribal council with an Islamic scholar as a judge rather than send cases to higher courts .
' That way at least they get a decision , ' he said .
The clerics involved are often senior Taliban commanders .
It is not just civil cases .
According to Mohammed Musa Hotak , an MP from Wardak , the Taliban arrived in a village in the southern district of Jalreez last week , arrested three well - known thieves , tarred their faces and paraded them as ' an example ' .
The men would probably be hanged , Hotak said .
Last year human rights groups in Afghanistan estimated that the Taliban had executed between 70 and 90 people in the villages they control and punished thousands more for criminal acts .
Often such acts are popular .
According to Hotak , the first act of the Taliban in the villages near his home had been to announce that they would take
responsibility for law enforcement .
' They said they were responsible for every chicken , ' Hotak said .
' People believe them .
When they kill a robber , everyone is happy . '
A government minister talked of how in his own village earlier this month a shopowner had complained to the Taliban after being robbed and had got his goods back after the insurgents simply circulated a ' night letter ' , one of the pamphlets that have been the Afghan insurgents ' favoured means of communication for decades , saying that they knew the thief and would hang him publicly .
A second shopkeeper who went to the local authorities obtained nothing but a beating when he belatedly asked the insurgents ' help .
Death threats are common , officials said , sometimes delivered by text message .
Ismatullah the elder was clear .
' When the Taliban were in power , you could drive all the way to Kandahar [ Afghanistan 's second city , 250 miles away ] with a bag of money and no one would touch you , ' he said .
' Now the government are thieves .
Since 2001 nothing has changed , except security is worse . '
The road to Kandahar has certainly seen better days .
Ruined by the fighting that racked Afghanistan in the 1990s , rebuilt at a cost of £ 200 m since , it is now pocked with the scars of bomb blasts and many of the new bridges have been destroyed in recent months .
Each week government and coalition convoys are attacked - 50 trucks were burnt in one go last month , another dozen last week .
Minutes after the governor of Wardak , interviewed in his heavily protected office - cum - residence in Maidan Shah , assured The Observer that the road was safe to travel , a convoy carrying a high - ranking government official was shot up 10 minutes ' drive away .
The Taliban patrol openly a few hundred metres from the highway .
In the more remote districts , villagers said , the local police often conclude deals with the underpaid , demoralised , poorly equipped Afghan National Police .
' The police know that , if they stay in their station and do nothing , the Taliban leave them alone and only launch attacks in the next district , ' said one elder from the small town of Chak .
The Wardak police chief , Abdul Yamil Muzzafaruddin , denied the claim .
In some areas they control , the Taliban enforce their strict interpretation of Islamic law , banning music and television .
Men who do not wear long beards are roughed up or threatened .
Wedding parties find unwelcome guests arriving to check for ' immoral behaviour ' and to help themselves to the food .
Schools , especially those for girls , are regularly burnt .
In other areas , the local commanders are more lenient , restricting themselves to punishing ' criminals ' and ' spies ' .
One commander contacted by The Observer through an intermediary complained of insufficient funds for ' investment ' ( and ammunition ) .
In one village in the Chak district , locals protested to the Taliban earlier this year that if their school was destroyed their children would never escape the crushing poverty of rural Afghanistan .
' The villagers said , " We want our children to be engineers and doctors " , ' said Roshanak Wardak , an MP and doctor who lives in Sayyatabad on the southern limits of the province .
' The Taliban told them that they had no need of such people , just religious scholars . '
However , refugees who have fled from the province to Kabul said that exploitation of local communities by the Taliban was rare .
' They ask the landowners for food , but not us , ' said Roz Ali , 42 .
' Anyway we have nothing to give . '
However , taxes are sometimes levied on farm production - including opium .
This parallel government has not come about by chance .
It is the result of a careful , four - phase strategy that the Taliban put into practice across much of Afghanistan , first in their southern heartland and later further north .
First came consolidation .
' Back in 2002 everyone was scared of the coalition forces and hopeful for change , ' said Abdul Hadi , an elder from Chak district .
' The Taliban kept a low profile .
Many fled to Pakistan .'
By 2005 , senior figures began returning to Wardak , reactivating old networks and preaching that a new jihad was necessary to fight the ' Christian invaders ' .
Exploiting local power struggles , anger at corrupt local authorities and their own authority as educated clerics among an illiterate population , Taliban leaders were able to extend their influence .
By the end of last year they moved to the next phase : recruitment .
Though fiercely loyal to the government , Roshanak , the MP , needs close contacts with the Taliban to survive .
' I know a lot of them , ' she said .
' There are the old Taliban and the clerics , and then there are now the young guys .
They are angry , poor , violent teenagers .
They are easy to recruit . '
In some instances , young men are pressured to join the ranks of the insurgents , sometimes for a single operation .
Others are attracted by cash offered by the Taliban high command in Pakistan .
The younger men provide the foot soldiers and mid-level command that the leadership needs to develop a real presence on the ground .
Overlaid on the network of local Taliban are other groups , too - from neighbouring provinces , the south , even from overseas .
These latter are often the most extreme .
Some units include Pakistanis , others ' freelance jihadi militants ' from the Middle East , some connected to al - Qaeda .
Then there are also pure criminals , borrowing the label of Taliban .
Intelligence estimates obtained by The Observer conservatively place the strength of the Wardak Taliban at about 800 lightly armed men , split into dozens of different factions .
Though significant , such a force should be easy for the 70,000 heavily armed soldiers of the coalition to destroy .
But it is n't .
From the offices of Halim Fedayi , the new governor of Wardak province , the sound of heavy machine guns can often be heard .
Nato troops from Turkey use the hills behind as a firing range .
' Wardak has an undeservedly bad reputation due to media exaggeration , ' Fedayi , a former aid worker who took up his post a month ago , said in fluent English .
' I have hundreds of development projects , banking investment , parks and clinics being built .
Wardak is a good news story .
But resources are scarce and demands are enormous . '
Sitting on a metal bed on a small hill a few miles south of the governor 's office , Salim Ali , a 20 - year - old policeman , forced a slim smile .
With three colleagues , for a pound a day , he guards the road passing through the ' gates of Kabul ' .
' There 's less traffic these days , ' he says .
' People are frightened . '
Indeed , Salim Ali 's vigil may already be redundant .
There are signs that the insurgents are penetrating the capital itself .
Ten days ago authorities reported a ' rocket strike ' on the newly refurbished airport .
Only it was not rockets , which have a range of many miles , that were fired at the terminal but rocket - propelled grenades , launched from 200 metres away .
General Mohammed Shah Paktiwal , head of Kabul 's CID , said ' terrorists ' were responsible .
The incident may have been a one - off - the suicide bombs that hit Kabul last year are less frequent - but the insecurity in the Afghan capital is palpable .
Though few genuinely think the Taliban could once again capture the city as long as foreign troops remain in the city , the cries of ' Allahu Akbar ' or ' God is great ' from pious locals during a nocturnal lunar eclipse last week prompted a major security alert .
The authorities were scared that the Taliban had penetrated Kabul in force .
The alarm bells ringing are being heard .
The United States has announced a £ 5 m quick - impact reconstruction plan for Wardak .
The province is also the target of a new Afghan local governance initiative .
Last week Gordon Brown , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reaffirmed their nations ' commitment to Afghanistan .
But a series of very senior figures in the international military , aid and diplomatic community in Kabul said they feared that the radical change in strategy now necessary to secure success in Afghanistan was unlikely to happen .
' There are simply too many structural and ideological blockages , ' said one .
And the fear and the insurgents remain .
' We sent a deputation to the Taliban leadership in Pakistan asking them why they were so focused on Wardak ' , Hotak , the MP , said .
' We told them that capturing Maidan Shah would just cause them problems .
They did not respond .'
Sure , you know walking is good exercise .
But here 's some­thing you might not realize :
You can give your waistline ( and other body parts ) a serious trimming by tweaking that walk around the block .
Walking up an incline can help you lose pounds faster than on flat terrain .
The three women below each walked off at least 35 pounds , much of it around the middle , using one of these secret weapons : plyometrics , hills , or intervals .
The strategies also strengthened their legs more quickly than plain old walking sessions , so they could walk longer and faster to burn more calories .
After six weeks of walking four to six times a week , you will feel stronger and look slimmer where it counts .
Health.com : Walk a little , live a lot ( longer )
Secret weapon : Plyometrics
Adding bounding , jumping , and skipping moves ( called plyometrics ) to your walk is a fun way to spike the intensity .
You 'll burn up to twice as many calories -- and significantly more belly fat -- per minute than you would just walking at a moderate pace .
" These moves vary the walking pattern your body has grown accustomed to , so you engage different muscle fibers , " says Joy Prouty , veteran Florida - based trainer and American College of Sports Medicine - certified health - fitness director .
" And that helps shape and define your body . "
Health.com : Walk this way
It worked for Claire Jefferson - Glipa , 31 , of Riverside , California .
Adding one - minute bursts of plyo­metrics to the Stroller Strides classes she leads each week -- along with making healthy changes in her eating habits -- helped Jefferson - Glipa drop 36 pounds in just nine months .
" It 's so exciting that my clothes are looser , " she says .
Make it work for you
Try this workout from Prouty , gradually adding more plyo­metrics as your fitness level improves .
It can be done either outside or on the treadmill ( just be sure to step off the machine to do the plyometrics moves ) .
• 1 . Walk 15 minutes , building to a moderate pace .
• 2 . Do 30 High - Knee Steps forward ( alternating legs ) ; skip for 30 seconds , then walk at a moderate pace for one minute .
• 3 . Do 15 Traveling Lateral Squats ( turn and move sideways as you squat ) in slow motion , followed by five Squat Jumps ( squat slightly , then swing arms up as you jump ) .
Knee problems ?
Rise up on your toes instead of jumping .
• 4 . Walk at a moderate pace for 10 minutes .
• 5 . Repeat step 2 .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Fitness and nutrition
• 6 . Walk for five minutes at a moderate pace , then five minutes at a slow pace to cool down .
Secret weapon : Hills
To triple the number of calories you burn , go to where it 's hilly , Prouty says .
Walking on hills can burn tons of calories and fat , so you 'll work that stomach pooch off faster than you would on flat terrain .
Uphill walks are great for strengthening and shaping your lower half -- plus , you 'll feel stronger and go faster on level ground .

Tips if you do n't have time to walk
It worked for Robyn Kammerer , 33 , of Rowayton , Connecticut .
Kammerer dropped 50 postpregnancy pounds in four months by eating healthier and walking every day on the hills near her home .
" If I 'm out of breath at the top of one of these killer hills , " she says , " I remind myself that I can now wear skirts that have n't fit in years . "
Make it work for you
Start by changing your walking routine :
Twice a week , replace 25 percent of your flat route with short or gradual hills .
( New to walking ?
Start with 20 - minute walks that include five minutes of hills . )
After two weeks , seek out longer or steeper hills , and add 10 percent more climbing each week .
Your goal is to do between one - half and two - thirds of your workout on hills .
Live in a flat area ?
Substitute this treadmill climb :
After a 10 - minute warm - up , gradually increase the incline from 0 to 2 percent for 5 to 10 minutes .
Then , gradually decrease the incline in the same amount of time , finishing with 5 to 10 minutes of flat walking .
Each week or two , increase the incline by 1 percent .
Secret weapon : Intervals
Alternating moderately paced walking with short , faster - paced intervals lets you amp up your walk without tiring yourself out .
You 'll also dump stomach weight more quickly and torch more calories than you would on a steady - paced walk .
By peppering in a 30 - minute walk with 10 one - minute speed bursts , for example , you can nearly double your calorie burn .
Health.com :
The ultimate walk - it - off plan
It worked for Virginia Cox , 42 , of Belmont , Massachusetts .
Doing 15 miles ' worth of interval walking a week ( plus cutting down on starchy foods and sweet treats ) helped Cox shed 45 pounds of baby weight in just six months .
" I look and feel great because of walking , " Cox says .
" Plus , I now fit into the jeans that I wore when I was in my 20s . "
An unexpected bonus :
She 's sleeping much better , too .
Make it work for you
Warm up at an easy pace , then walk at a moderate pace for 10 minutes ; increase speed for one minute , Prouty says .
Do another 3 minutes at a moderate pace ; repeat one or two times , then do 10 moderately - paced minutes .
As you get stronger , add more intervals , aiming to alternate 1 - minute speed bursts with one minute of moderate walking .

All About Weight Loss
The President of the United States of America is likely the last person you expect to pull a fast one on you .
Ladies and gentlemen , I think that may have just happened .
While I do believe more focus needs to be placed on our troops in Afghanistan , I think our pres just played a cruel joke on us .
Two days ago the news was all about how Bush wanted to lower the troop count in Iraq .
This was met with great praise , " Finally , the President gets it ! " you may be thinking .
Not so fast , we 're only taking out 8,000 , which is great on paper until you realize that we have over 140,000 troops on the ground in Iraq and only 20,000 in Afghanistan .
5 % , good job Bushie , I think you may have convinced .. well , no one .

Steve Wozniak is regarded as an engineer 's engineer
The co-founder of one of the world 's iconic companies is a reluctant billionaire who wanted to be an engineer first and a boss last .
The man in question is Steve Wozniak , the designer of the first Apple computer and its successor in his spare time .
He learned basic electronics from his father and knew by the time he was at high school that he wanted to be an engineer for life .
" I read books about a young engineer who owned a company with his father .
Whenever there was a catastrophe in the world , he went into the lab and worked sometimes for two weeks silently .
When he would come out of the door he had a device that solved the problem .
" That 's when I said : ' Wow , engineering lets you build things that solve problems ' . "
' Original thinking '
Those early experiences inflamed a passion and led the young Woz , as he prefers to be known , to read as much as he could about engineering .
" You become what you want to be in life .
I wanted to be an engineer .
I did n't want to run a company . "
Woz had little money so to keep up he crept into buildings housing the Stanford Linear Accelerator to rifle through computers books and magazines in the library .
The Apple 1 , a single board computer , sold for $ 666.66
That lack of money , he told BBC News , was a spur to innovate - it should never be used as an excuse to not give things a go .
" What 's important is not having very much money , " he said , convinced that it was a good discipline to have to think within restraints .
" Lack of resources forces you to do a lot more original thinking . "
From early on , Woz had one aim ; to understand the design of computers so he could build his own .
" We had a club ( Homebrew ) that spoke of how someday everybody was going to have their own personal computer and have control over their own lives , " he said .
" We 'd make the guy that could program more important than the CEO of a company and that inspired me .
" It made me feel like we little guys are coming up against the big owners of the world and we have a position in the world .
I said I want to take my technical talents and design a computer and help other people build them .
" It was about wanting to change the world and make it a better world and we were the first people , " he said .
" We were the revolution . " ' Engineer for life '
Woz 's creations helped to spawn a billion - dollar company that has influenced the computer industry beyond his wildest dreams .
A lot of that he puts down to the talents of his then best friend Steve Jobs .
To the outside world , they may have seemed a mismatched pair : the shy engineer and the worldly - wise salesman .
A young Steve Jobs ( left ) and Woz ( right ) help show off the Apple IIc " We were n't that dissimilar when we first met .
He was more future thinking and thinking at a higher level of being one of those important people in the world .
He even thought about starting a company that could become some real ongoing company . "
" Me , I had philosophies against it .
I did n't want to have big money ever in my life .
I wanted to do a great engineering job and every time I designed something great , several times in our life , Steve would come and say : ' Lets sell it ! '
" We would make some money and the next thing I designed , he would say : ' Lets sell it ! ' and so it went on . "
Woz was reluctant to go into business with Steve , or anyone else , because he had a " dream job " working as a designer for Hewlett Packard .
" I was never going to leave HP .
That 's where I wanted to be forever , " he said .
" Steve Jobs got all my friends and relatives to call me .
One friend convinced me you can be an engineer for life and take the money . "
Woz became Apple 's employee number one and admitted that he sometimes used that rank to get discounts at Apple stores .
He has never asked for free products and even stands in line like everyone else when new products such as the iPhone 3G appear .
Giving back
Woz 's second passion is for education .
Years after leaving college , a life - altering event persuaded him to return to the classroom .
" I had a plane crash and I had amnesia and I called Steve Jobs and said : ' I am going back to do my degree ' .
Why put it off ?
" You do n't get two chances to do things in life and I wanted my kids to see I had a degree and encourage them .
For years Woz 's Apple II was the main source of profit at Apple " I got my degree under a fake name , Rocky Raccoon Clark . "
As well as teaching his children the importance of education , Woz also decided it was time to stand up and be counted .
" I grew up with a passion .
I loved my teachers and I wanted to give back by being a teacher and helping others .
" There is something in me that wants to be perceived as a person who cares about youngsters .
As a person who wants them to learn .
I really think their brains are the future that is going to get us out of the troubles we have today . "
Following that urge led him to become a volunteer teacher helping kids to become familiar with computers .
Woz said his own single - mindedness had been key to his happiness and he said he would encourage others to stay true to their passion .
" Do n't let people side - track you .
If it 's in your heart , follow it .
Whatever your passion in life stay true to it . "
' Tough choices '
As a true engineer , Woz said he was a " gadget guy " and that there were several pieces of technology without which he simply would not be able to live .
Telling time the Woz way " There are some tough choices which we do n't ever want to make but it 's between my personal computer and my hybrid car .
Oh , but I also love my cellphones .
All of them . "
Woz owns 10 .
He said he also loved his Segway on which he zipped around Silicon Valley and played polo .
Despite his success
Woz said the one gadget he wished he had invented was his watch , which is made of old parts and lights up when he tilts his wrist .
" It 's a geeky watch and I would have loved to have invented that .
I would feel real good about it . "

Glenn Greenwald at Salon.com reports that protesters in Minneapolis , where the Republican National Convention will soon begin , have been subjected to massive , pre-emptive police raids .
Those arrested include members of Food not Bombs , and a group calling itself the " RNC Welcoming Committee , " and a group that uses video to protect civil liberties by documenting police activity at first amendment events .
Snip :
[ They have been targeted by a series of highly intimidating , sweeping police raids across the city , involving teams of 25 - 30 officers in riot gear , with semi-automatic weapons drawn , entering homes of those suspected of planning protests , handcuffing and forcing them to lay on the floor , while law enforcement officers searched the homes , seizing computers , journals , and political pamphlets .
Last night , members of the St. Paul police department and the Ramsey County sheriff 's department handcuffed , photographed and detained dozens of people meeting at a public venue to plan a demonstration , charging them with no crime other than " fire code violations , " and early this morning , the Sheriff 's department sent teams of officers into at least four Minneapolis area homes where suspected protesters were staying .
Jane Hamsher and I were at two of those homes this morning — one which had just been raided and one which was in the process of being raided .
Each of the raided houses is known by neighbors as a " hippie house , " where 5 - 10 college - aged individuals live in a communal setting , and everyone we spoke with said that there had never been any problems of any kind in those houses , that they were filled with " peaceful kids " who are politically active but entirely unthreatening and friendly .
Posted below is the video of the scene , including various interviews , which convey a very clear sense of what is actually going on here .
In the house that had just been raided , those inside described how a team of roughly 25 officers had barged into their homes with masks and black swat gear , holding large semi-automatic rifles , and ordered them to lie on the floor , where they were handcuffed and ordered not to move .
The officers refused to state why they were there and , until the very end , refused to show whether they had a search warrant .
They were forced to remain on the floor for 45 minutes while the officers took away the laptops , computers , individual journals , and political materials kept in the house .
One of the individuals renting the house , an 18 - year - old woman , was extremely shaken as she and others described how the officers were deliberately making intimidating statements such as " Do you have Terminator ready ? " as they lay on the floor in handcuffs .
The 10 or so individuals in the house all said that though they found the experience very jarring , they still intended to protest against the GOP Convention , and several said that being subjected to raids of that sort made them more emboldened than ever to do so .
Do 68 Molecules Hold
the Key to Understanding Disease ?
UC San Diego Scientist Presents First Unified Vision of ‘ The Building Blocks of Life ’
By Debra Kain
Why is it that the origins of many serious diseases remain a mystery ?
In considering that question , a scientist at the University of California , San Diego School of Medicine has come up with a unified molecular view of the indivisible unit of life , the cell , which may provide an answer .
Illustration of “ molecular building blocks . ”
Click to view enlarged graphic .
Reviewing findings from multiple disciplines , Jamey Marth , Ph.D. , UC San Diego Professor of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute , realized that only 68 molecular building blocks are used to construct these four fundamental components of cells : the nucleic acids ( DNA and RNA ) , proteins , glycans and lipids .
His work , which illustrates the primary composition of all cells , is published in the September issue of Nature Cell Biology .
Like the periodic table of elements , first published in 1869 by Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev , is to chemistry , Marth ’s visual metaphor offers a new framework for biologists .
This new illustration defines the basic molecular building blocks of life and currently includes 32 glycans ( sugar linkages found throughout the cell ) and eight kinds of lipids ( which compose cell membranes ) along with the more well - known 20 amino acids that are used to make proteins and the eight nucleosides that compose the nucleic acids , DNA and RNA .
“ These 68 building blocks provide the structural basis for the molecular choreography that constitutes the entire life of a cell , ” said Marth .
“ And two of the four cellular components are produced by these molecular building blocks in processes that cannot be encoded by the genes .
These cellular components – the glycans and lipids – may now hold the keys to uncovering the origins of many grievous diseases that continue to evade understanding . ”
Currently , the vast majority of medical research looks to the human genome and proteome for answers , but those answers remain elusive , and perhaps for good reason .
“ We have now found instances where the pathogenesis of widespread and chronic diseases can be attributed to a change in the glycome , for example , in the absence of definable changes in the genome or proteome , ” Marth said , adding that , as biomedical researchers , “ we need to begin to cultivate the integration of disciplines in a holistic and rigorous way in order to perceive and most effectively manipulate the biological mechanisms of health and disease . ”
“ What is important is that no one has composed it and laid it out so clearly before , ” said Ajit Varki , M.D. , Distinguished Professor of Medicine and Cellular and Molecular Medicine and founder and co-director of the Glycobiology Research and Training Center at UC San Diego School of Medicine , and chief editor of the major textbook in the field , The Essentials of Glycobiology .
“ Glycobiology , for example , is a relatively new field of study in which researchers at UC San Diego have much expertise , and Dr. Marth ’s work further illustrates the importance of these glycan molecules . ”
Marth believes that biology should become more integrative both in academic and research settings .
“ I ’m one who believes that we do n’t need to sacrifice breadth of knowledge in order to acquire depth of understanding . ”

The first European airport to provide passenger processing with SITA ’s AirportConnect Open platform was Schiphol airport in Amsterdam , which has recently renewed their contract for another five years .
The future - proof SITA technology includes SIM - based NFC , which allows efficiency in moving through airport checkpoints via a reliable and secure link to passengers ’ smartphones .
With a simple tap of the smartphone , the passenger information of a standard boarding pass is read via “ Tap n’ Fly ” TM , a commonly - used applet , and the industry standard for NFC .
Americans are losing jobs , losing the equity in their homes , losing their retirement nest eggs , and tragically , in increasing numbers , actually losing the family home itself .
This is the issue on which the Obama people should long since have pounced .
A recent survey found that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe that the social contract of the 20th century  in which the government , employers and the society as a whole pulled together to see that those who worked hard and played by the rules were afforded the basic necessities of daily life and a shot at the American dream  “ appears to be unraveling . ”
Nearly 80 percent of those who responded to the survey , conducted for the Rockefeller Foundation and Time magazine , said they are facing greater financial risks now than in the past .
This anxiety is pervasive , and it was clearly evident a little more than two weeks ago when Phil Gramm , then John McCain ’s key economic adviser , callously remarked that we were suffering from a “ mental recession ” and that the U.S. had become “ a nation of whiners . ”
The Obama crowd should have instantly seen the Gramm gaffe for what it was , a gift from the political gods .
They should have run with it .
I would have dragged out that old Maxine Brown song with the lyric : “ Maybe it ’s all in my mind . ”
The Democrats could have had some fun and made political hay , using the Gramm comments to highlight what has happened to working people under Republican rule .
But the Obama folks let the matter drop , and instead of an endless loop of “ mental recession , ” what we ’ve heard incessantly over the past couple of weeks has been Mr. McCain pounding on Mr. Obama about the surge .
The word is that an economic offensive may finally be coming from the Obama campaign .
Anna Burger , the secretary - treasurer of the Service Employees International Union , was part of a wide - ranging group of advisers on economic issues who met with Mr. Obama in Washington on Monday .
“ He has very serious policies , not sound bites , for addressing the long - term and short - term issues that are having such a dramatic effect on people who are working and trying to make ends meet , ” she said .
Translating those ideas into a compelling economic narrative for his campaign  something Mr. Obama has not yet done  is the key to defeating John McCain .
