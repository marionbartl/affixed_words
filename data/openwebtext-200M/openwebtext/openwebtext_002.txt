wankr hits zeta !
Yep , it 's true .
After months of extremely intensive effort , wankr has jumped straight past the gamma , delta and epsilon stages of development and has entered its official public Zeta !
We 're hoping that if development continues at this pace we can hit a Kappa release by the end of the summer and Omicron by late autumn .
You might not notice any real changes - other than the stylish new look - with this latest release and in fact may be convinced that this is just a way to stir up interest in our website - after all , whoever heard of even a gamma release , let alone delta , epsilon or zeta ?
- but we assure you that there 's been some really cool stuff happened underneath .
Yes .
Oh , and we added a tag cloud .

Risk taking is an integral part of business and life , but so few people know how to manage it properly .
The word risk has a slightly negative connotation to it — it implies danger , tension , and possible loss .
But risk also has a positive side , the chance of hitting a big win , of getting more on the back side than you invest on the front side .
All risks are not equal , however .
Some risks are just plain dumb , and you should never take them .
But even in those cases , there ’s usually some emotional benefit .
My city of Las Vegas thrives on such benefits .
I do n’t even have to pay state taxes because the 30 + million tourists who come here each year pay them for me ( Nevada has no state tax ) .
In fact , I got a $ 75 refund last year for taxes I never paid because the state had a $ 300 million surplus .
I actually got paid by the state just for living here .
Gamblers provide about half the state ’s revenue .
All those risk takers help pay our bills .
I rather like that .
But what about intelligent risks ?
Those are obviously the ones where the upside outweighs the downside , at least probability - wise .
You wo n’t find too many of those risks in casinos .
Now we all know it ’s generally a bad idea to take dumb risks , where your expected outcome is negative and the potential upside is very limited .
But guess what …
It ’s equally stupid to pass up an intelligent risk , where your expected outcome is positive and the potential downside is very limited .
This is a concept I learned from Jay Abraham .
I had to hear it many times before it really sunk in , but when it finally did sink in , it completely transformed my thinking about risk taking .
The most intelligent risks are those where the potential downside is limited , but the potential upside is virtually unlimited .
Those are the risks you should jump to take .
For example , consider the optimization work I do on this web site .
Suppose I take an hour to review my stats and make some tweaks to the ad layout .
There ’s a risk that my income could go down because I ’ve made a mistake .
But if it ’s a big mistake , I ’ll catch it within a matter of days ( perhaps hours ) and correct it .
I can always restore the layout to its previous “ good ” state , so any decline is temporary .
If it ’s a small mistake , I may not catch it until I review the stats again a month later .
But I ’ll still detect and correct the problem , and if the problem is too small to detect , its effect on the results is negligible anyway .
My worst - case downside risk for optimization work is that I ’ll waste about an hour of my time , I ’ll lose a little bit of money , and I ’ll learn something new .
But what ’s the best case outcome ?
The best case is huge .
I might stumble upon a new layout that permanently boosts income .
And in that case my only investment was an hour of my time .
And the actual result of doing optimization work over the past year is that this year , it ’s going to amount to tens of thousands of extra dollars vs. if I ’d never done any testing and tweaking at all .
In the long run , what I ’ve done already will produce enough gain to pay for my house .
And in total it was maybe 20 hours of work over the course of a year .
But what if I ’d never risked those 20 hours and the possibility that I might temporarily mess up my income ?
Methinks 20 hours for a house is a pretty good deal .
The house is probably worth about $ 350 K today .
This is the kind of risk I ’d be a fool not to take .
The downside is limited and fixed , but the potential upside is wide open .
What kind of total and complete idiot would I have to be not to be willing to trade 20 hours of my time for a house ?
This planet has enough total and complete idiots .
Please do n’t be one of them .
You will lose a lot more by missing big opportunities like this than you ever will from making mistakes .
Here are some other examples of intelligent risk taking :
Ask someone out on a date ( worst case downside = one - time embarrassing rejection , best case upside = lifelong relationship with your soulmate )
Ask for a raise or promotion ( worst case downside = boss says no , best case upside = permanent raise or promotion )
Start a blog ( worst case downside = waste some of your time , best case upside = change your life and the world for the better )
Join a new club ( worst case downside = waste some of your time and quit , best case upside = lifelong friendships plus a lot of other benefits )
Take a cooking class ( worst case downside = waste a little time and money , best case upside = become a permanently better chef )
Are you one of those people that mentally catastrophized my worst case downsides ?
Like instead of a “ one - time embarrassing rejection ” for a date request , you thought about a stalker or a painful divorce ?
If so , maybe it ’s time to turn off the TV and hang out with more positive people .
Most of us are pretty good at avoiding dumb risks , unless you happen to be reading this from a jail cell .
But we ’re exceptionally lousy at taking intelligent risks .
The stupidest mistakes we make are errors of omission .
One of the reasons I ’m so gung ho about personal development is that I see such pursuits as a very intelligent risk - taking .
I might waste a lot of time reading bad books , listening to lousy audio programs , and going to lame seminars , but every once in a while , I hit a huge breakthrough that leaves me permanently changed .
Most of the books , audio programs , and seminars I devour are indeed a waste of time .
Maybe I get a temporary rah rah boost from them , but usually they ’re forgotten soon afterwards .
However , those few gems that help me create permanent change make the entire pursuit worthwhile .
These gems , however , are different for everyone .
One person ’s lump of coal is another person ’s diamond .
So even personal recommendations do n’t help that much .
It ’s like a game of chance , but in the long run , the odds of success are in your favor .
This machine has a long - term payout greater than 100 % .
The key to intelligent risk - taking is to look far enough ahead .
When thinking about personal growth , I do n’t just think a year ahead or five years ahead .
I think across the span of my whole lifetime ( sometimes even thinking beyond the grave … seriously ) .
I ask myself , “ What difference might this make over the span of the next several decades ? ”
Over that timespan even small changes you might make today can create huge long - term payoffs .
And the decision to do nothing today means you ’re automatically denying yourself any long - term benefits .
Doing nothing is n’t neutral .
Doing nothing is way , way negative .
This is one of the reasons it ’s so important to install good habits .
In the short - term , it ’s a struggle , often a painful one .
We have to deal with disappointment again and again .
We fall flat on our faces , dust ourselves off , and throw ourselves into the ring anew , only to be pummeled once again .
And we use that same tired mantra , “ This time it will be different ! ” — a mantra that fails 19 times out of 20 .
What keeps me from getting discouraged when my failures outnumber my successes is to keep thinking long - term .
I often must endure a lot of failures to hit the next big breakthrough .
So I just plow through those failures as fast as possible .
It ’s like a conveyor belt — there ’s a new success on that belt somewhere ahead , and the faster the belt moves , the sooner it will arrive .
It ’s amazing how much long - term difference just a small change you make today can make .
Just a little more self - discipline , a little more courage , a little more persistence , a little more enthusiasm — these can produce huge gains in the long run .
Take a look at the second graph from yesterday ’s blog post on my 2005 traffic and Adsense revenue growth .
That was my income from this web site .
Notice how flat it is during the first four months .
This is the point where most people give up .
Personal growth is often flat in the beginning .
The gains are there , but they ’re just too small to see .
Do NOT give up during the flat period !
The flat period is the hardest because you ’re working hard and getting very little to show for it .
Maybe you keep working on your social skills but ca n’t seem to get a date to save your life .
Maybe you keep working on your internet skills but still can’t figure out how to make your own web site .
Maybe you start a new business and just ca n’t seem to get anything going .
That ’s life .
Give yourself permission to work hard and have little to show for it , as long as you intelligently hold a positive long - term outlook .
I ’ve been working hard on this business for 15 – 1 / 2 months now , but it still generates less income for me than what I could get if I went out and got a job working as a computer programmer .
There ’ve been a lot of people in my life who did n’t understand my long - term thinking .
I ’m sure many of my decisions look really dumb if you only project a month or a year ahead .
I ’ve seen more than one person write about me , “ Steve is either really smart or really dumb . ”
The reality is simply that I have a very long time perspective .
Later this year I ’ll be doing some things that I guarantee will look incredibly stupid from a traditional business perspective , but when I consider what those seeds will likely produce over the next several decades , the outlook is simply amazing .
I have to deal with the same negative criticism and lack of support that everyone else does .
It amuses me that one of my extended family members still wanted me to go out and get a job last year , since she felt it would make me more money in the short term .
I basically write her off as clueless — it ’s not hard to do this when I look at her lifelong results from pursuing the strategy of short - term thinking and fear of risk taking .
Short - term thinking and risk aversion dominate this planet .
A person like me who embraces intelligent risk and thinks decades ahead does n’t fit in very well here .
That was a bit of a problem for me when I was younger , but now I just embrace it .
It ’s simply who I am .
I get all the support I need from my connection to my purpose and from feeling a sense that I ’m working to serve the highest good of all .
The whole world could turn against me , and it would n’t make me want to give up .
It would probably just inflame me more .
I never get discouraged because I believe my approach to life will produce some amazing results in the long run .
It ’s only a matter of time .
Love is more powerful than fear .
I overcome fear of risk by tapping ever more deeply into what I love most .
The thought of taking a risk produces excitement instead of anxiety .
Find an intelligent risk you can take today .
Most likely it wo n’t pan out .
But what if it does ?
Celebrate either way because no matter what the outcome , you ’ll gain courage just by making the attempt .
You would expect an announcement that would forever change the face of the internet to be a grand affair - a big stage , spotlights , media scrums and a charismatic frontman working the crowd .
But unless you knew where he was sitting , all you got was David Hendon 's slightly apprehensive voice through a beige plastic earbox .
The words were calm , measured and unexciting , but their implications will be felt for generations to come .
Hendon is the Department for Trade and Industry 's director of business relations and was in Geneva representing the UK government and European Union at the third and final preparatory meeting for next month 's World Summit on the Information Society .
He had just announced a political coup over the running of the internet .
Old allies in world politics , representatives from the UK and US sat just feet away from each other , but all looked straight ahead as Hendon explained the EU had decided to end the US government 's unilateral control of the internet and put in place a new body that would now run this revolutionary communications medium .
The issue of who should control the net had proved an extremely divisive issue , and for 11 days the world 's governments traded blows .
For the vast majority of people who use the internet , the only real concern is getting on it .
But with the internet now essential to countries ' basic infrastructure - Brazil relies on it for 90 % of its tax collection - the question of who has control has become critical .
And the unwelcome answer for many is that it is the US government .
In the early days , an enlightened Department of Commerce ( DoC ) pushed and funded expansion of the internet .
And when it became global , it created a private company , the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( Icann ) to run it .
But the DoC retained overall control , and in June stated what many had always feared : that it would retain indefinite control of the internet 's foundation - its " root servers " , which act as the basic directory for the whole internet .
A number of countries represented in Geneva , including Brazil , China , Cuba , Iran and several African states , insisted the US give up control , but it refused .
The meeting " was going nowhere " , Hendon says , and so the EU took a bold step and proposed two stark changes : a new forum that would decide public policy , and a " cooperation model " comprising governments that would be in overall charge .
Much to the distress of the US , the idea proved popular .
Its representative hit back , stating that it " ca n't in any way allow any changes " that went against the " historic role " of the US in controlling the top level of the internet .
But the refusal to budge only strengthened opposition , and now the world 's governments are expected to agree a deal to award themselves ultimate control .
It will be officially raised at a UN summit of world leaders next month and , faced with international consensus , there is little the US government can do but acquiesce .
But will this move mean , as the US ambassador David Gross argued , that " even on technical details , the industry will have to follow government - set policies , UN - set policies " ?
No , according to Nitin Desai , the UN 's special adviser on internet governance .
" There is clearly an acceptance here that governments are not concerned with the technical and operational management of the internet .
Standards are set by the users . "
Hendon is also adamant : " The really important point is that the EU does n't want to see this change as bringing new government control over the internet .
Governments will only be involved where they need to be and only on issues setting the top - level framework . "
Human rights
But expert and author of Ruling the Root , Milton Mueller , is not so sure .
An overseeing council " could interfere with standards .
What would stop it saying ' when you 're making this standard for data transfer you have to include some kind of surveillance for law enforcement ' ? "
Then there is human rights .
China has attracted criticism for filtering content from the net within its borders .
Tunisia - host of the World Summit - has also come under attack for silencing online voices .
Mueller does n't see a governmental overseeing council having any impact : " What human rights groups want is for someone to be able to bring some kind of enforceable claim to stop them violating people 's rights .
But how 's that going to happen ?
I can't see that a council is going to be able to improve the human rights situation . "
And what about business ?
Will a governmental body running the internet add unnecessary bureaucracy or will it bring clarity and a coherent system ?
Mueller is unsure : " The idea of the council is so vague .
It 's not clear to me that governments know what to do about anything at this stage apart from get in the way of things that other people do . "
There are still dozens of unanswered questions but all the answers are pointing the same way : international governments deciding the internet 's future .
The internet will never be the same again .
The browser that set off the latest dispute has been in development for some time , but Microsoft first made it available to the public for downloading last week in a test version .
It is the first new release of Microsoft 's browser in five years .
A final version is expected to be released this summer and will be included in Microsoft 's new operating system , Windows Vista , which is scheduled for release next January .
The focus of Google 's concern is a slender box in the corner of the browser window that allows users to start a search directly instead of first going to the Web site of a search engine like Google , Yahoo or MSN .
Typing a query and hitting " Enter " immediately brings up a page of results from a designated search engine .
That slice of on - screen real estate has the potential to be enormously valuable , and Microsoft is the landlord .
Internet Explorer 7 is the first Microsoft browser to have a built - in search box , while other browsers like Firefox , Opera and Safari have had them for some time .
Google estimates that the boxes , when available , are the starting point for 30 to 50 percent of a user 's searches , making them a crucial gateway to the lucrative and fast - growing market for advertisements that appear next to search results .
Microsoft has lost some ground in the browser market in the last year , mainly to Firefox , which is a Google ally .
But Microsoft still holds more than 80 percent of the market .
And Internet Explorer 7 is expected to be extremely popular because it is an improvement over Microsoft 's previous browser , and because Microsoft will promote downloads of it and include it in Windows Vista .
That gives Microsoft the potential to use the browser to steer substantial traffic , and business , to MSN and away from rivals .
MSN handled 11 percent of searches in the United States in March , down slightly from a year earlier , according to Nielsen / Net Ratings , a market research firm .
That put it well behind Google , which had a 49 percent share , and Yahoo , with 22 percent .
Microsoft insists it has no intention of deploying its browser as a weapon in the search wars .
But Google suspects otherwise .
In meetings beginning last year , Google told Microsoft of its objections to the company 's plans to set MSN as the default search engine in Internet Explorer 7 , according to Ms. Mayer of Google .
Yahoo raised similar objections in a meeting with Microsoft last year , according to a Yahoo employee who was briefed on the conversation .
Yahoo declined to comment last week beyond a statement : " We would be concerned about any company 's attempts to limit user choice or change user preferences without their knowledge , and believe others would share that concern . "
As part of a recent development project , we ’ve assembled pieces from SISCweb , SSAX and SXPath , and some of our own code to build a simple web - development framework we ’ve tentatively named Icing .
Icing , so far , consists of :
* a simple bean - like layer atop raw SQL , with an S - expression based SQL syntax and objects representing table rows ;
* a small library ( not quite the same as SISCweb ’s approach ) to allow pattern - matching on the URLs of incoming requests , and to allow attaching handlers to matched URLs ;
* libraries for using JavaMail to construct and send arbitrary MIME multipart message parts and for using BouncyCastle ‘s PGP implementation with JavaMail to build PGP MIME email bodies and attachments ; and
* a XSLT - template - based Model - View - Controller - plus - Workflow framework for structuring applications .
HTML templates ( with special attributes and with optional embedded XSLT instructions ) form the View ; Scheme code forms the Controller ; the DB layer referred to above forms the core of the Model ; and SISCweb ’s support for continuation - based web programming forms the Workflow .
The software is still being hammered into shape ; we ’re currently in the process of documenting it , packaging it conveniently for use in other applications , and deciding how we want to release it — it could be released as a thing - in - itself , bundling together a collection of third - party libraries , or we could instead take Icing to pieces , and fold some of the parts back into SISCweb ( if SISCweb ’s author , Alessandro Colomba , approves , of course ) .
I ’ve made the slides from the presentation on Icing I gave last week available .
They ’re the only real documentation the code has at present , but ought to give a feel for the kind of approach we ’re taking with it .
" In this presumption of guilt culture , which is what has come about in Washington in the last 10 or 15 years , there must be a sense of anger there and an inability to manage the facts , " said Lanny J. Davis , a lawyer in Washington who was brought into the Clinton White House to help deal with the multiple investigations of that administration .
" It 's hard to imagine how bad it is .
You sit at your desk and you know what the facts are , but you can't get them out to the public because the lawyers tell you you can't -- or if you can , the noise from the presumption of guilt culture overwhelms the facts . "
Mr. Bush joked late last year with Matthew Cooper , a reporter for Time magazine , about why Mr. Cooper was not yet in jail for fighting a subpoena demanding that he testify about a conversation with a source who later turned out to be Mr. Rove .
These days , though , the leak investigation is almost never spoken of openly within the West Wing , and certainly not made light of , administration officials say .
Lawyers for most of the officials who have testified before the grand jury have by and large chosen not to share information with one another , leaving colleagues largely in the dark about what others are telling Mr. Fitzgerald .
There is a presumption inside the White House that anyone who was indicted would resign or go on leave to fight the charges , though it is unclear what planning has taken place for that possibility .
The prospect of a White House without Mr. Rove , Mr. Bush 's longtime strategist , has some allies of the president in a near panic , fearful that without him the administration would lose the one person capable of enforcing discipline across a party that has become increasingly fractious and that is almost at war with itself over the president 's nomination of Harriet E. Miers to the Supreme Court .
With the White House stumbling and preoccupied , some allies of the president already see a policy void that is being filled by other prominent Republicans , like Senator John McCain of Arizona , who recently outmaneuvered the administration to win passage of an amendment that would set new standards to guard against the use of torture in the interrogation of detainees in the fight against terrorism .
Asked about the case in his daily on - camera news briefing on Thursday , Scott McClellan , the White House press secretary , portrayed Mr. Bush as eagerly awaiting the results of the investigation .
The case centers on whether administration officials illegally disclosed the identity of the C.I.A. officer , Valerie Wilson , as part of an effort to distance the White House from criticism by her husband , Joseph C. Wilson IV .
In mid-2003 , Mr. Wilson , a former diplomat , became an outspoken critic of how the administration had used prewar intelligence about Iraq 's weapons programs to justify the invasion .
There ’s a common and weird conception in this country of The Great Idea .
This is the idea of PageRank , a graphical user interface , or sticky notes .
Huge successes , right ?
Sure .
But for 99 % of people , The Great Idea is a big fat myth .
At the beginning of 2004 , a few friends came over to get some advice .
They wanted An Idea to start a company around .
Cool , I thought , and we started brainstorming .
But I soon realized that while they said they were looking for An Idea , they were really looking for an excuse not to do anything , to remain where they were and grind their wheels .
I ’m not into BS so I told them as much .
This is what I told them ( fade to black with a pipe in my mouth ) …
* * *
The myth of The Great Idea is a dangerous one .
It makes you constantly search and search for something that you ’ll probably never find .
My friends , for example , are still searching , and it ’s two years later .
How many of you know an older person ( maybe a parent ? ) who is always tinkering and muttering about the Great Idea he wants to find ?
Success almost never comes from a mind - blowing idea , so sitting around trying to find one is a waste of time .
Success comes from a basic idea executed amazingly well .
Ideas are rarely found by thinking .
They ’re found by doing .
I did n’t come up with the idea of IWillTeachYouToBeRich one night , staring out at the beach through a rain - drenched window .
I thought of it after getting a $ 2,000 scholarship check , investing it in the stock market , and losing half of it immediately .
( And really , is the idea of a personal - finance site really that compelling of an idea ? )
I ’ll answer my own question : No !
It ’s all in the execution .
So The Great Idea is a myth .
Now what ?
Ok , you know you want to do something entrepreneurial .
Maybe you want to write a book .
Maybe you ’re good at helping underprivileged children , and really enjoy it , but are n’t sure what to do with that .
Or maybe you are amazing at Etch - A - Sketch drawing .
Sounds good , but you do n’t have the Big Idea yet .
So what !
Most people do n’t .
But you can do better than most people because you ’ll stop searching and start doing .
These are the few steps that have worked for me and some of my entrepreneur friends .
Identify a broad , high - level goal .
It might be an industry ( “ I want to do something in fashion ” ) , it might be a lifestyle ( “ I want to have a flexible schedule ” ) , it might be some kind of financial outcome , etc .
Now you have the top of the funnel .
Now , write down the things you like and the things you do n’t like .
Be brutally honest .
I ’ve been surprised how few people do this .
I wrote down things like “ I like talking to people ” and “ I hate Excel . ”
Next , narrow the funnel down by identifying opportunities that will open up more doors in the right area .
For example , if you want to get involved in fashion , you probably do n’t want to work as an administrative assistant .
Two years after doing that , what will you have to show for it ?
Will you be any closer to your broad goal ?
On the other hand , if you intern at a fashion company , or even start a simple blog about fashion , in a few months , you will have created more opportunities for you in the right area .
In other words , if you want to be in the music business , you do n’t start working at a music store .
That wo n’t give you a leg up on any jackass who can walk in off the street and do it .
Avoid jobs / projects / opportunities that lead to dead ends .
Instead , find opportunities that open more doors in the right direction .
A couple more things :
It takes multiple steps to reach a goal .
It sounds obvious , but I know so many people who are frustrated that they can’t send one email and become a sports agent .
Being entrepreneurial , having a disproportionate impact , takes a lot of steps that do n’t necessarily have a clear payoff .
I do n’t want to belabor the point .
Just think about how this relates to you .
Also , eliminating choices is as important as finding ones that are interesting .
I have a friend who wanted to be an investment banker because , in her words , it ’s glamorous , prestigious , and there are lots of smart people .
She did an internship and realized she hated it .
Great !
Internships are your friend ; they ’re like free trials at a company .
Chalk that one up to the now - I - know - I - do n ’t - like - that category .
And now it ’s time to start doing .
Even though you may not have a sense of exactly what you want to do , you ’ve found some of the right people you want to talk to .
If you want to start a dog - food company ( or whatever ) , you do n’t have to have contacts at Kibbles .
Think laterally –do you know anyone who runs a retail business ?
Email them and take them out to lunch .
Know pet owners ?
Go over and find out what their problems are and what they ’d want from a new product .
You ’ll be surprised after talking to 10 people –I guarantee this .
People love others who are eager to learn and full of energy .
They ’ll offer you help with connections , ideas , and maybe even resources .
The idea will come .
It may be something as prosaic as “ let ’s do photos online ! ” ( Flickr , acquired by Yahoo ) or “ let ’s build a social network –for college kids ! ! ”
( The Facebook , multi- million - dollar VC - funded startup ) .
It ’s not about The Idea .
It ’s about the process that gets you there and the people around you .
And once you start doing all these things , you ’ll get closer and closer to your end game–even if you did n’t know what it was when you started .

Back to The Great Idea .
The whole reason it ’s such a terrible way to think about personal entrepreneurship is that it ’s a veiled excuse to get not get anything done : “ Oh , I ’m waiting around for an idea ” is the most foolish thing anyone can say .
The myth of the Great Idea is a great way to think yourself into oblivion and failure .
Look , at our age , there ’s nothing wrong with not knowing what we want to ultimately end up doing .
Let me say that again : Stop feeling guilty that you do n’t know exactly what you want to do !
But I think there ’s something entirely wrong with not actively trying to find out exactly what we do want .
Trying , not waiting .
Experimenting , not “ thinking about it . ”
Give it a shot .
I ca n’t wait to hear how it goes .
( See my other articles on personal entrepreneurship . )
Microsoft has been granted an interactive TV patent that pauses the show while the viewer follows an embedded hyperlink , such as a URL .
And so ends a 12 - year battle .
Incredibly , Microsoft originally filed for the patent in March 1993 , and the language reflects its age : " The Internet has recently exploded in popularity , " we learn , and that , " a computer user with a modem can get on - line . "
In its current form , this archaic patent appears not be of immediate use to Microsoft .
Patent # 6,973,669 describes an invention which uses the vertical blanking interval ( VBI ) of analog broadcasts , a technology for which Intel once had high hopes .
Intercasting delivered data at around 10 k bit /s . As modern digital TV streams at 19 M bit /s per channel , there 's little shortage of bandwidth .
But read on , and it's apparent that it's the " pause " that Microsoft seeks to exploit .
Describing how a broadcast could add features to a sports game broadcast , the applicant writes :
" Hyper- links to Internet sport pages or chat rooms can be included and the information displayed in a split screen along with the game , or the viewing of the game can be paused at the viewer 's discretion for any length of time .
Even with these arbitrary pauses the present invention (s ) permits the viewer to watch the entire game , no matter when and how many viewing pauses are taken . "
In another possible embodiment , Microsoft suggests learning videos with embedded URLs .
The patent covers 35 claims in all .
Last year Bill Gates predicted that the revenue model for traditional broadcast TV would wither , and offered broadcasters his own , predictably attention - deficient vision of the future : a split screen with one side containing nothing but Google - style text advertisements .
Despite scepticism over its response times , and suggestions that its offering is six times more expensive than its rivals , Microsoft has snagged BT , SBC and Swisscom as customers for its interactive TV offering .

Americans , like most people around the world , have become so accustomed to the role that government plays in educating children that the idea of separating education from the state usually comes as a complete shock to them .
While everyone is aware of the ever - growing problems associated with public schooling , the answer for most people is the standard one :  The system needs reform . 
Yet decade after decade , as reforms are implemented , new bond issues passed , new schools built , and new schoolteachers hired , the problems remain , only to be addressed with the same answer :  The system needs reform . 
And since most people attended public schools , the thought of bringing an end to the very system to which they attribute their own success is , well , shocking .
But why not reject all the reforms and instead raise our vision to a higher level ?
Why not end all government involvement in education , just as our American ancestors ended all government involvement in religion ?
Are n’t the arguments for separating church and state the same , in principle , for separating education and state ?
What I am suggesting is amendments to the 50 state constitutions that would read ,  No law shall be passed respecting the establishment of education or abridging the free exercise there - of . 
( The same type of amendment could be added to the federal constitution , but this discussion will be limited to ending state government involvement in education . )
What would be the practical consequences of such an amendment ?
The same consequences that accompanied freedom of religion .
Just as we do n’t have federal subsidies of religion , or public ( i.e. , government ) churching , or state - licensed private churches , or state - approved home - religious education , there would be no more public schooling , no more state - licensed private schools , and no more state - approved home education .
Education , like religion , would be left entirely to the free market , where families would have the same sovereignty and independence with respect to the education of their children as they have with respect to religion .
Socialism and its consequences
Why has public schooling been riddled with so many problems ?
The answer is that public schooling is an absolutely perfect model of socialism and central planning .
The entire system is based on the same top - down , command - and - control system on which the military is based , with political and bureaucratic committees planning the educational decisions of multitudes of children under their jurisdiction .
Participation is mandated , with criminal penalties imposed on recalcitrant parents .
Funding is also based on coercion , with taxes taken from everyone — even those who do n’t have children — to fund the schooling of those who are sent into the system .
Nearly everyone knows that socialism produces shoddy products and services .
So why should anyone be surprised that public schooling does so as well ?
Is the situation any different in private schools or home - schooling ?
It has to be , if for no other reason than that the child is not under the direct supervision and control of a government employee who is filling his mind with government - approved doctrines .
But the situation is still far from ideal , given that the state , through licensing of schools and certification of home - schooling curricula and results , still wields ultimate control over the education of everyone ’s children .
What is amazing is that after so many years of government involvement in education , with all its dismal results , so few people ask basic and fundamental questions about the education of their children , such as :
Why should n’t families have the same sovereign and independent control over the education of their children as they have over religious matters ?
Given that the free market produces the best of everything and socialism produces the worst of everything , why are people willing to submit their children to a second - rate product in an area as important as education ?
Why should providing education to people be considered a legitimate function of government ?
What is also fascinating is that most parents hardly pay any mind to the potential damage that educational socialism wreaks on the mind and life of a child , especially after 12 continuous years of mandatory participation in such a system .
All that seems to matter is that parents have a safe state - run place to park their children every day for 12 years , a place in which they will supposedly be taught the basics of a good education .
Some parents have even embraced the state ’s suggestion that resistance to such a system by their children reflects dysfunctional conduct that can be remedied only by state - administered drugs ( e.g. , Ritalin ) , ignoring the distinct possibility that such resistance is instead a very healthy and normal reaction to a dysfunctional socialist educational system .
Why are people so unwilling to look at such potential damage to the mental well - being of their children ?
Because they operate under the assumption that , despite its many problems , public schooling can be relied on to educate their children .
After all , the argument goes , if it was good enough for parents , it ’s good enough for their children .
This ignores the state ’s position that generation after generation of public - school graduates cannot be trusted with making educational decisions for their family because they lack the competence to do so .
The methodology of education
The teaching methodology that characterizes public schools ( as well as many licensed private schools ) is one that is based on cramming and memorizing .
Education is viewed as a process by which information is fed into the minds of the students , who are then expected to memorize and regurgitate the information on tests that are given to judge whether the student has become educated .
Students are then judged by a grading system that informs them whether they are  A - ,  B- ,  C - , or  D - level students .
Permit me to share with you a bit of my personal life to show how different education and education methodology are in a free market .
Like most adults , I have had occasion to take educational courses simply  for the fun of it .
For example , I have taken ballroom dance classes as well as foreign - language classes here in the D.C. area .
The difference between those classes and public schooling is night and day .
My dance and language classes have been composed of people of all ages , including high - school students .
In a beginner class , everyone pretty much starts out as a complete novice .
Over an 8 - week course , however , everything starts to change .
Some people study harder than others .
Some practice what they ’re learning while others just show up to class every week .
Some people excel much more quickly than the others .
Sometimes people skip class , returning the following week .
No one is given mandatory homework but everyone seems to know that practice is key to getting better .
Everyone has a very enjoyable time even though the sessions can be tiring .
Whenever a teacher asks whether people mind if he goes over the allotted time , no one objects and most stay to take advantage of the free teaching .
At the end of the course , everyone is at a different skill level , but such a determination is entirely subjective because no test or final exam is given .
The decision to move to the next level is entirely up to the student .
Many decide to repeat the beginner level and others immediately move up to the next level of difficulty .
No student is ever criticized or demeaned for having an insufficient skill level but usually figures out for himself that he might be in over his head at a higher level and voluntarily decides to stay at a lower level .
No one is graded . 
The teachers treat everyone — even the worst dancers and linguists — courteously and considerately .
In all the private classes I have taken , I have never heard an instructor insult or abuse a student for having poor dance skills or not speaking the foreign language well .
In this type of educational system , one of the big differences is that the customer is paying the school directly for his education , unlike the public - school system which relies on taxes from everyone , including people who do n’t even have children .
Thus , like any business that strives to survive and prosper , the private education company must be nice to its customers , especially because satisfied customers can bring in other customers .
I should also mention , however , that not all the dance and language courses are provided by for - profit companies .
Some are provided by nonprofit educational foundations .
In fact , one nonprofit dance studio offers students free lessons in return for helping with dance classes .
One of the crucial differences concerns the mindsets and attitudes among the students .
In the private classes , students are engaged in a seeking process rather than being subjected to a cramming process .
That is , they are there because they want to be , because they are interested in the subject , and because they want to learn that subject .
They ( or their parents ) are paying for it directly .
Therefore , they listen intently , soaking up every word the instructor speaks .
Most important , the course is fun for everyone , even those who clearly lack the skills of other students .
Everyone enjoys himself primarily because he has chosen to be there to learn something that he wants to learn .
Did I mention that no one cares that everyone is of a different age in such classes , even though the ages range from the teens to the 70s ?
That ’s how a free - market educational system works .
The sovereignty is with the consumer , and businesses pop up in response to their wants and interests , serving them and , in the process , bettering their own economic lot in life .
While it is impossible to predict the marvels of a free - market educational system that would arise from the separation of education and state , these types of adult - education classes give us a hint of how a free market in education would work for children .
No longer would children lose their natural sense of awe and wonder that the regimentation of state schooling slowly but inevitably grinds out of them .
Instead , that sense of awe and wonder and love of learning that they have to age 6 , when they enter the public - school system , would continue to be nurtured and cultivated as parents and children worked together to figure out which educational vehicles would be best suited for them at their different stages of growth .
My hunch is that in a free - market educational system , children would continue to badger their parents with  Why ?
Why ?
Why ? throughout their entire pre-teen and teenage years .
Finally , let ’s examine the funding mechanism for public schooling — the taxation imposed on everyone to fund the schooling of those who have children .
Where is the morality of such a system ?
That is , under what moral authority does the state take one person ’s money and give it to another person , even to fund the education of his children ?
We would n’t do that to help a person attend a church , would we ?
To put it another way , why should n’t people be free to keep their own income and decide what to do with it ?
 But people would n’t educate their children if they were n’t forced to .
Balderdash !
But if that ’s true then what better argument to rid ourselves immediately of public schools , given that that ’s the type of parent that public schooling has produced ?
The fact is that the parent who does n’t care about the education of his children is a rarity .
The problem is that everyone has become so accustomed to the one size fits all  public - schooling system , they have a difficult time accepting the idea that families should be free to fashion their own particular educational plans for each of their children .
In other words , we need to develop the same degree of tolerance toward education that we have developed toward how people raise their families generally , including religious matters .

Age of Reason by Thomas Paine
Age of Reason , Part First , Section 1
IT has been my intention , for several years past , to publish my thoughts upon religion .
I am well aware of the difficulties that attend the subject , and from that consideration , had reserved it to a more advanced period of life .
I intended it to be the last offering I should make to my fellow - citizens of all nations , and that at a time when the purity of the motive that induced me to it , could not admit of a question , even by those who might disapprove the work .
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood , and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion , and compulsive articles of faith , has not only precipitated my intention , but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary , lest in the general wreck of superstition , of false systems of government , and false theology , we lose sight of morality , of humanity , and of the theology that is true .
As several of my colleagues and others of my fellow - citizens of France have given me the example of making their voluntary and individual profession of faith , I also will make mine ; and I do this with all that sincerity and frankness with which the mind of man communicates with itself .
I believe in one God , and no more ; and I hope for happiness beyond this life .
I believe in the equality of man ; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice , loving mercy , and endeavoring to make our fellow - creatures happy .
But , lest it should be supposed that I believe in many other things in addition to these , I shall , in the progress of this work , declare the things I do not believe , and my reasons for not believing them .
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church , by the Roman church , by the Greek church , by the Turkish church , by the Protestant church , nor by any church that I know of .
My own mind is my own church .
All national institutions of churches , whether Jewish , Christian or Turkish , appear to me no other than human inventions , set up to terrify and enslave mankind , and monopolize power and profit .
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise ; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine .
But it is necessary to the happiness of man , that he be mentally faithful to himself .
Infidelity does not consist in believing , or in disbelieving ; it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe .
It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief , if I may so express it , that mental lying has produced in society .
When a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind , as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe , he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime .
He takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain , and in order to qualify himself for that trade , he begins with a perjury .
Can we conceive any thing more destructive to morality than this ?
Soon after I had published the pamphlet Common Sense , in America , I saw the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion .
The adulterous connection of church and state , wherever it had taken place , whether Jewish , Christian , or Turkish , had so effectually prohibited by pains and penalties , every discussion upon established creeds , and upon first principles of religion , that until the system of government should be changed , those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world ; but that whenever this should be done , a revolution in the system of religion would follow .
Human inventions and priestcraft would be detected ; and man would return to the pure , unmixed and unadulterated belief of one God , and no more .
Every national church or religion has established itself by pretending some special mission from God , communicated to certain individuals .
The Jews have their Moses ; the Christians their Jesus Christ , their apostles and saints ; and the Turks their Mahomet , as if the way to God was not open to every man alike .
Each of those churches show certain books , which they call revelation , or the word of God .
The Jews say , that their word of God was given by God to Moses , face to face ; the Christians say , that their word of God came by divine inspiration : and the Turks say , that their word of God ( the Koran ) was brought by an angel from Heaven .
Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief ; and for my own part , I disbelieve them all .
As it is necessary to affix right ideas to words , I will , before I proceed further into the subject , offer some other observations on the word revelation .
Revelation , when applied to religion , means something communicated immediately from God to man .
No one will deny or dispute the power of the Almighty to make such a communication , if he pleases .
But admitting , for the sake of a case , that something has been revealed to a certain person , and not revealed to any other person , it is revelation to that person only .
When he tells it to a second person , a second to a third , a third to a fourth , and so on , it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons .
It is revelation to the first person only , and hearsay to every other , and consequently they are not obliged to believe it .
It is a contradiction in terms and ideas , to call anything a revelation that comes to us at second - hand , either verbally or in writing .
Revelation is necessarily limited to the first communication  after this , it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to him ; and though he may find himself obliged to believe it , it can not be incumbent on me to believe it in the same manner ; for it was not a revelation made to me , and I have only his word for it that it was made to him .
When Moses told the children of Israel that he received the two tables of the commandments from the hands of God , they were not obliged to believe him , because they had no other authority for it than his telling them so ; and I have no other authority for it than some historian telling me so .
The commandments carry no internal evidence of divinity with them ; they contain some good moral precepts , such as any man qualified to be a lawgiver , or a legislator , could produce himself , without having recourse to supernatural intervention .

One common misconception about GMOs is that their impact on human health is not considered .
20 GMO crops do n’t damage the environment .
Golden Rice is a GMO .
The name comes from the rice ’s golden color , a side - effect of the genetic engineering done on the crop .
Golden rice has modifications to produce beta - carotene during growth , which turns into Vitamin A once digested and metabolized .
Research and development of Golden Rice aimed to solve Vitamin A Deficiency ( VAD ) , a disease that kills over 600,000 children worldwide every year .
Another 500,000 children also go blind from the disease every year .
With rice a staple for between 30 to 70 % of people in Asia alone , scientists hoped to increase Vitamin A in people ’s nutrition through an easy and effective manner with Golden Rice .
What a resourceful example of GMO facts .
The first GMO food to reach the market was a tomato .
Called Flavr Savr , Calgene developed and sent the tomatoes to the FDA for approval in 1992 .
The FDA granted approval in 1994 , and Flavr Savr appeared on the market until 1997 when Calgene stopped producing the tomato .
Flavr Savr ’s modifications gave it longer shelf life , meaning it lasted longer after getting harvested .
According to the FDA , Flavr Savr had no difference in nutrition and posed no health risks compared to non-GMO tomatoes .
Genentech used GMO bacteria to produce insulin for use by diabetes patients .
Diabetes is a disease of the pancreas that makes it unable to produce the hormone insulin .
This causes sugar to build up in the body , causing a series of complications that can lead to death .
Doctors give insulin injections to manage the disease , with the hormone previously - taken from human donors .
But in 1978 Genentech developed GMO bacteria with human genes to produce insulin with .
The FDA approved GMO bacteria - produced insulin , called humulin , to enter the market .
This made it cheaper and more available to diabetes patients .
A milestone of achievement , no matter how we look at it , here at GMO facts .

The first GMO animal approved as food did so in 2015 .
Called AquAdvantage salmon , AquaBounty Technologies began development as far back as 1989 .
Scientists mixed genes between Atlantic salmon and Pacific Chinook salmon to produce the GMO .
Their goal was a fish breed that bred and grew faster than other breeds .
To keep AquAdvantage salmon from damaging the environment , all examples of the breed are born female and sterile .
This is because if they escape into the wild , they ’ll outbreed other salmon breeds .
AquAdvantage salmon received FDA approval in 2015 , the first time a GM animal received approval as a food source .
Gene guns were the first tool to carry out genetic modifications .
These tools fired microscopic bullets of either gold or tungsten .
Scientists attached DNA fragments to the bullets and then fired them at a target cell sample .
The bullets passed through the cells , leaving their DNA fragments behind them in the cells .
Once inside , the cells incorporated the fragments into their DNA .
Scientists developed many GMOs such as those for wheat using this method .
The main disadvantage of this method is that it damages cells in the process .
The method is also inaccurate , as scientists have only limited control over the genes getting combined .
Bacteria are also used to perform genetic modifications .
This one surprised us here at GMO facts .
These bacteria are agrobacterium .
It ’s a special kind of bacteria , as they modify their target ’s genes to make it more suitable for them .
Scientists used specially - bred agrobacterium to insert desired genes into their specimens .
This method has mixed success , though .
While successful with crops like tomatoes and potatoes , this method is unsuccessful when it came to modifying other crops like wheat .
Other methods for genetic modification include electroporation and microinjection .
Scientists discovered that electrical pulses cause cells to open pores in their membranes .
They then use those pores to introduce new genes into the target cells .
Microinjection is the simplest method of genetic engineering , by injecting new genes directly inside a target cell .
One of the most advanced methods of genetic engineering is CRISPR gene editing .
CRISPR is actually a means with which certain bacteria protect themselves from viral infections .
It works by producing certain biochemicals that cut the bacteria ’s own DNA .
In this way , they remove those parts of their DNA compromised by a virus .
Scientists studied this process , and in 2000 , used it to perform genetic engineering .
Dubbed in science as CRISPR gene editing , scientists used similar biochemicals to cut out unwanted sections from target DNA .
These sections could be the ones causing a disease or make a subject vulnerable to certain infections .
Scientists can also replace removed sections of DNA with news ones to give desirable traits and characteristics .
GMOs are n’t limited to food .
GMOs are also made for purely - physical appeal .
Flowers with colors that do n’t appear in nature were even among the first GMOs ever made .
GMO roses with lavender or mauve petals are popular in countries such as Japan , the USA , and Canada among others .
Other examples of flowers modified to answer demand include chrysanthemums and primroses .
Now that was a surprisingly - colorful example of GMO facts .

GMO animals are also used for research .
GMO mice are the most common of them all , their genes modified to study the effects as part of research into various subjects .
These include the causes of diseases like cancer , as well as possible cures .
Other animals include pigs due to their larger size and closer relationship with humans , and non-human primates .
It was only in 2009 that a marmoset became a test subject for studies on Parkinson ’s Disease .
A goat began producing a drug for use by humans in 2009 .
We ’ve mentioned before how GMO bacteria produce insulin for use by humans .
This time it ’s different .
Insulin is still a natural substance , produced in this case by GMOs as a supplement for people whose bodies ca n’t make enough insulin on their own .
In contrast , ATryn is n’t a natural substance , but a drug used to prevent unwanted clots during operations like surgery or childbirth .
And in 2009 , the FDA approved the use of GMO goats which produced the drug in their milk .
GMO livestock are under study to provide food in more ways than one .
That is , these breeds of animals are n’t meant for eating .
One example is a breed of cow under study to produce milk identical to human breast milk .
Scientists expect this to benefit mothers who are unable to produce breast milk on their own .
Another example is a cow that produces hypoallergenic milk , something they are n’t normally able to produce .
GMOs are a possible means to bring back extinct species .
The current idea is to change the DNA of an existing cousin of the extinct species so that it resembles the latter .
Scientists are also studying the possibility of adding the genes of extinct animals taken from existing samples to the DNA of existing animals .
For example , adding genes from the extinct mammoth to those of African Elephants .
Scientists say though that replacing the whole DNA and even reversing evolution is still a very long - distance goal .
So no matter how much we here at GMO facts wish it were so , a real - life Jurassic Park is n’t likely to happen soon .
Humans as GMOs is a very controversial concept .
Although gene therapy is already used to treat diseases like cystic fibrosis , sickle cell anemia , and heart disease , scientists are skeptic of modifying traits that can be passed down to a person ’s children .
Ethical concerns and incomplete understanding of human DNA as a whole make the idea of GMO humans a premature one at this time .
GMO insects are under study .
A common trait among GMO crops is their ability to resist insects and parasites .
But scientists are also studying if they can solve the problem directly .
Instead of making crops resistant to diseases , or making more and better drugs against diseases carried by insects , why not remove the insects in the first place ?
One species under study is the Aedes aegypti mosquito , infamous for carrying germs that cause dengue and malaria among other diseases .
Scientists produced a male breed of the mosquito carrying a gene that causes death at a certain point .
While not yet available to widespread use , use against test populations saw 80 to 90 % of the mosquitoes wiped out .
Scientists believe this method is usable against other pests like moths .

Whether GMO foods get labeled as such depends on the country .
For example , the European Union requires all GMO foods to have a label informing consumers that they are .
Processed food or drink which has more than 0.9 % of its ingredients as GMOs must also have a label .
In Canada and the USA , producers are not required at the federal level to label their goods as GMO or not .
There ’s no such thing as non-GMO Water or non-GMO Salt .
Some water or salt brands label themselves as non-GMO .
This is meaningless advertising , as neither water nor salt are alive in the first place .
They have no DNA to modify , so they cannot be GMOs .
Talk about strange examples of GMO facts .
GMO crops actually reduce the price of food .
This is because GMO crops have higher yields compared to non-GMO crops .
This allows supply to more easily keep up with demand , dropping prices as a result .
Studies actually show that without GMO crops , food prices would be 5 to 10 % higher than they are today .
One common misconception about GMOs is that their impact on human health is not considered .
This is actually one of the biggest misconceptions about GMOs .
All GMOs undergo case by case testing and certification before getting placed on the market .
In the USA alone , FDA approval for GMO crops and medicines takes years or even decades of study to get .
Even then , they ’re still subject to review and appeal afterward .
Scientists are even frustrated at delays caused by continued testing on the distribution of Golden Rice in places like the Philippines .
Startup Primed To Challenge Google CPC Ad Model
Jellyfish.com will offer an alternative to cost - per - click advertising by opening an online marketplace where advertisers can bid directly to customers for their attention and patronage .
Google 's bubble may be about to burst .
Though search engines continue to make a tidy sum selling clicks , the advertisers buying those clicks have no choice but to gamble :
Only a small portion of online ad click - throughs result in sales and about 14 % of clicks on average aim to defraud the advertiser .
On Monday , shopping search engine Jellyfish.com will begin to woo advertisers with what it claims is a better mousetrap :
It will offer an alternative to cost - per - click ( CPC ) advertising by opening an online marketplace for advertisers to bid directly to customers for their attention and patronage .
The company , which closed initial seed funding from undisclosed investors earlier this year , plans to give the customer half the ad revenue it collects from the advertiser upon making a sale .
The result is that Jellyfish users can get products for less because half the marketing dollars spent by advertisers go directly their customers instead of to a third party .
At the time of this article , the cash returned can result in discounts of up to 24 % , according to the company .
This number will rise and fall daily as merchants bid for consumers ' business .
Users can collect their cash once products can no longer be returned , in order to prevent abuse of the system .
The name " Jellyfish , " says president Mark McGuire , reflects the company 's intent to bring transparency to the ad market .
Google 's recent actions suggest that it's aware of the problems posed by the CPC model : Google recently acknowledged that it 's testing cost - per-action ads ( CPA ) .
CPA advertising pioneers like Snap.com have long touted the advantages of the CPA model , such as the elimination of click fraud .
But adoption has been slow .
EBay 's recent move into CPA advertising with its AdContext system should make CPA ads more popular , luring publishers with the prospect of collecting a cut from auction sales made as a result of an ad .
But Jellyfish 's patent - pending plan to kick CPA fees back to consumers seems certain to pique user interest .
The company calls its approach value - per-action advertising .
Merchants are already lining up to bid for shoppers ' attention with low prices and high cash - back payments .
Jellyfish has more than 1,000 advertisers signed up so far , with more than 5 million listed products .
" ShoeMall.com is all about making shoe shopping fun and fast , and using a partner like Jellyfish helps us give back to the customers , " says Adrienne Hartman , Internet and new business manager at Internet retailer ShoeMall .
Hartman notes that Jellyfish 's model lets her company offer a lower price than would be possible with CPC advertising .
" Since Jellyfish only gets paid when I make a sale , I get a better return on my marketing dollars , " she says .

Drivers have been warned about drinking too much caffeine
Peter Edwards , 48 , from King 's Lynn , was jailed for four months on Friday after Norwich Crown Court heard he was pursued across Cambs and Norfolk .
His car was seen " swerving from side to side " across the A10 , the court heard .
The AA motoring group said too much caffeine can affect the way you drive .
' Stay awake '
Andrew Howard , head of road safety for the AA Motoring Trust , said : " The message is that if you take anything as a stimulant , whether it be caffeine or herbal medicines , then you have got to be aware that they ultimately have an effect on you and the way you drive .
" Caffeine in sensible quantities can help drivers stay alert , but if taken to excess , like many other drugs , it can have strange effects on people . "
An RAC spokesman said : " Caffeine is something that we recommend drinking in small quantities . "
At one stage police drove in front of Edwards to slow him down but he simply veered out to overtake in front of a lorry .
Police eventually stopped his car at Swaffham by using a stinger device to puncture his tyres .
Edwards , who was later tested and found to be free of any alcohol or drugs , admitted dangerous driving on 13 March last year .
David Bird , in defence , said Edward 's mother had died of cancer two weeks before the chase and Edwards had been suffering from severe depression .
He was also said to have had a history of mental illness .
" He had been drinking cans of Red Bull as he was ferrying members of his family to various parties during the night and had consumed the drink to stay awake , " he added .
A spokeswoman for Red Bull said : " Research has proven that just one or two cans of Red Bull can help alleviate the effects of tiredness - there is no added benefit in consuming the product in excessive amounts .
" One can of Red Bull contains the same amount of caffeine as a cup of filter coffee . "
The predators died in the clash
Enlarge Image
An unusual clash between a 6 - foot ( 1.8 m ) alligator and a 13 - foot ( 3.9 m ) python has left two of the deadliest predators dead in Florida 's swamps .
The Burmese python tried to swallow its fearsome rival whole but then exploded .
The remains of the two giant reptiles were found by astonished rangers in the Everglades National Park .
The rangers say the find suggests that non-native Burmese pythons might even challenge alligators ' leading position in the food chain in the swamps .
Clearly , if they can kill an alligator they can kill other species
Prof Frank Mazzotti
The python 's remains were found with the victim 's tail protruding from its burst midsection .
The head of the python was missing .
" Encounters like that are almost never seen in the wild ...
And here we are , " Frank Mazzotti , a University of Florida wildlife professor , was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency .
" They were probably evenly matched in size .
If the python got a good grip on the alligator before the alligator got a good grip on him , he could win , " Professor Mazzotti said .
He said the alligator may have clawed at the python 's stomach , leading it to burst .
" Clearly , if they can kill an alligator they can kill other species , " Prof Mazzotti said .
He said that there had been four known encounters between the two species in the past .
In the other cases , the alligator won or the battle was an apparent draw .
Burmese pythons - many of whom have been dumped by their owners - have thrived in the wet and hot climate of Florida 's swamps over the past 20 years .

Why is it Important ?
We launched DropSend ( a service for sending large files you ca n’t email ) last November and it ’s been ticking along nicely , picking up about 3,500 users per month .
We always planned on offering a premium version for businesses that was brandable and multi-user , but we could n’t get it done in time for launch , so we decided to launch that feature later .
Well , two weeks ago , we finally finished the new DropSend Business Plan .
It ’s $ 80 more than the Pro plan ( $ 19 vs. $ 99 ) , and we were worried that it might be a bit too expensive .
Holy crap , were we wrong .
30 % Increase in Revenue
In two weeks , we ’ve increased our total revenue by 30 % !
Two weeks .
As I write this , I ’m still finding it hard to believe .
The Business Plan is now responsible for the lion ’s share of our revenue from DropSend .
So What ’s the Lesson ?
What we learned from this is that people will pay for quality .
Offer them something really good , and they will go for it .
Our premium plan is aimed at businesses who have the need for a high - end solution , and of course , they are the ones who can afford it .
So that ’s pretty much it - a short and sweet lesson that I thought I should share .
As always , feel free to agree or disagree below .
I ’ve also written another feature about web apps , on our new site Vitamin .
It ’s called Will Your Web App Make Money - hope you find it valuable .
When the war in Lebanon ends , the US will have to piece together a whole new strategy for dealing with Iran – especially its nuclear program .
The Israeli- Hizbullah war has boldly ratcheted up Iran 's regional stature at the same time it has depleted US influence and prestige .
From the outset , the Lebanese conflict was about more than just Hizbullah .
Jerusalem and Washington were quick to point the finger of blame for the conflict at Iran , and it was with Iran in mind that Israel unleashed the full force of its air power in Lebanon .
The US , too , saw shock and awe in Beirut as an opportunity to convince Tehran of the West 's determination to bring it into compliance on the nuclear issue .
Tehran cleary received the message and viewed the US - backed Israeli war on Hizbullah as the first stage of a war on Iran .
But Tehran also used the occasion to send a message of its own to Washington .
While dutifully denying a direct role in the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers , Tehran nevertheless heaped praise on Hizbullah , hoping that its engagement with Israel might dampen enthusiasm for a military attack on Iran .
To further drive this point home , Hizbullah surprised Israel and the US by successfully testing a number of Iranian - made advanced weapons systems .
Iran 's ties to Hizbullah run deep .
It was Iranian clerics and Revolutionary Guards commanders who first organized Hizbullah in the 1980s .
Since then , Tehran has bankrolled and armed Hizbullah 's war machine .
Many among the current leadership of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards have served tours of duty at Hizbullah 's headquarters in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon .
Over the past two decades , Hizbullah has evolved into a Lebanese political force , but it continues to rely on Iranian support to sustain its military capabilities .
Average Iranians resent their government 's generous support for Hizbullah when unemployment and poverty plague the Iranian economy , and many bristle at the risk that support for Hizbullah carries for Iran .
But Iran 's leaders see Hizbullah as an ally and an asset .
Hizbullah is a fruit of the Iranian revolution – the only time its seed found fertile soil outside Iran .
Tehran cannot back away from Hizbullah without acknowledging that the revolution is over .
Iran 's hard - line leaders , looking to rekindle revolutionary fervor at home , see their own values reflected in Hizbullah .
Nor will Tehran easily give up on a pro- Iranian force in the heart of the Arab world and an important instrument in confronting Israel and the US .
Tehran has basked in Hizbullah 's new - found glory , taking credit for a popular military adventure that has greatly weakened Iran 's traditional regional rivals – Jordan , Egypt , and Saudi Arabia .
Iran had hoped that its cooperation with the US in rebuilding a post - Taliban Afghanistan would lead to an opening in the relations between the two countries .
But Washington was not keen to build on that initiative .
It refused to engage Iran over the future of Iraq and instead focused its energies on containing Iranian influence in the Persian Gulf and rolling back Iran 's nuclear program .
In the Lebanese conflict , Iran has found an opportunity to underscore its regional importance .
The Iran - Hizbullah axis has hijacked the Palestinian cause and redefined the Arab - Israeli conflict .
Neither criticism by Arab governments nor fatwas ( religious edicts ) by radical Sunni clerics have slowed down Hizbullah 's and Iran 's rising stock .
As the US looks for a way out of the crisis , it is increasingly evident that it is Iran 's and not Washington 's traditional allies in the region that hold the key to solving the crisis , and Tehran hopes that Washington will come to realize that without Iranian cooperation it cannot ensure regional stability .
With a population of close to 70 million , more than 70 percent of which is literate , a vibrant culture , and a geographic spread from Central Asia and the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf , Iran is today a rising power in the Middle East .
Its large market , economic output , industrial potential , and vast oil and natural gas reserves make it central to American geostrategic and energy interests .
Over the past two decades , Tehran has nurtured cultural , economic , and political ties with various regional forces , most notably the Shiites of Iraq .
These ties confirm Iran 's regional status , just as they make it more difficult for the US to bring stability to the arc stretching from Afghanistan to Lebanon without Iran .
In the coming months , Washington will have to look for ways to deal with a bullish Iran .
A policy of isolation and intimidation will no longer yield results and will serve to further destabilize the Middle East .
Hizbullah 's tenacious resistance has moreover devalued military power as a deterrent .
The war has not only failed to subdue Hizbullah militarily , but has made it politically stronger .
US objectives and interests would be better served by giving Iran a vested interest in stability .
That means including Iran in a new regional security framework .
The US should continue to demand that Iran curb its nuclear activities , abandon support of terrorism , and respect the democratic aspirations of Iranians .
The difference would be that with regime change no longer a threat , Iran will be more likely to find reasons to change its course .

FAQs
If one aspect of design has suffered most in its transition to the Web , it is the art of typography .
For years ,
Web typography involved little more than choosing a typeface and font size .
Unstyled Times New Roman was the norm , and the integration of established typographical techniques and rules was unimagined .
But times change .
Since the adoption of CSS into mainstream Web design , we have entered a new age of Web typography .
This facet of design has been opened up to the Web designer in a way that was n’t possible in the past .
We now have the tools to return typography to its true role within the sphere of design .
However , if we ’ve learnt anything over the last ten years , it ’s that the Web is not print .
The basic principles of typography will cross over to any format , but it ’s vital that we allow the features of the medium — in this case , the computer screen or monitor on which our type is displayed — to define the rules and techniques that we practice .
So , how can we transfer the established and time - tested principles of typography to the online environment ?
The best place to start is to look at the differences between print and screen , and to understand how those differences will affect our use of typography in Web design .
The Technology
The most obvious difference between the Web and its print ancestor — a most important point for those wanting to grasp the art of Web typography — is that your type is displayed on a computer screen or monitor .
If you ’re reading this tutorial on your computer screen , you ’re having a very different experience than if you ’d printed this text with a modern laser printer .
Additive and Subtractive Color Systems
When you look at a computer screen , you see colors and shapes that are made up of light .
Colors are built up by combining red , green , and blue light together in different mixtures and intensities .
This is the additive color system .
On the other hand , if you printed this page out , and are reading it on paper , the colors and shapes you ’re looking at are comprised of pigments in the ink .
These colors are perceived by the absorption and reflection of light from their surfaces .
This is known as the subtractive color system .
Why is this important ?
Well , let ’s consider the most common color combination for text and its background : black on white .
In a subtractive color system ( i.e. print ) , this is a perfectly suitable practice .
The contrast of black on white is as stark and clear as possible , making for good legibility and comfortable reading .
However , with an additive color system ( i.e. on screen ) , the color white is produced by mixing red , green , and blue at full intensity .
This is why the black on white combination can be overly luminous and too harsh on the eyes to allow extended reading on screen .
There is never more light radiating from a screen than when it displays pure white , and this intensity can affect the clarity of fine detail in typefaces and other intricate patterns .
Wikipedia gives more details on the additive and subtractive color systems .
Screen Resolution
If you have printed this text with a modern laser printer , you may be enjoying a print resolution of up to 2400 dpi ( dots per inch ) .
On screen , you ’ll be lucky to have a resolution of 96 dpi .
The conclusion to this point should be fairly obvious : there ’s no way you ’re going to get the same clarity and detail when displaying text on screen as you can with print .
It is this factor , more than any other , that defines the recommendations and principles behind good Web typography .
The Unknowns
The other key issue we should think about is what I like to call the unknowns .
One of the biggest hurdles designers have to overcome as they move from print to Web is the idea that they do n’t have real control over their finished product .
No matter how much we try to second - guess users ’ browsing habits , hardware configuration , and software choices , we must live with the fact that we cannot control 100 % how people experience our Web pages .
In terms of Web typography , this has some pretty sobering consequences .
We can spend hours choosing the perfect combination of typefaces to complement our design or meet corporate requirements , but if the user has stipulated that she wants all text to be displayed in 18px Comic Sans , there is absolutely nothing we can do about it .
The key is to think of this not as a limitation of the Web , but as a strength .
Which other medium gives so much freedom to the end user ?
As designers , we merely suggest a design or layout ; the final say is in the hands of the individual , and their requirements and choices trump ours every time .
Do n’t inhibit this freedom by assuming users ’ requirements or by attempting to force too many of your own preferences onto users .
Another unknown that applies particularly to Web typography is anti-aliasing .
Modern operating systems such as Windows XP and Mac OS 10 give users the option to display anti-aliased text as standard .
This is a good thing , and it makes reading and working on your machine much more comfortable and pleasing to the eye .
However , there is a danger when experimenting with typefaces and sizes that we forget that users may not have anti-aliasing available or switched on .
Comparing anti-aliased and aliased text .
Again , do n’t assume anything about the people who use your site .
I would encourage any designer to at least check a site ’s pages with anti-aliasing switched off .
The discovery you make may come as a shock , and in the worst case , you may even be moved to rethink your typographic choices .
Basic Principles of Web Typography
Having seen the technological issues that are going to inform our typographical choices , it ’s time for a more detailed look at the principles of typography as they apply to the Web .
Typefaces
Choosing a typeface is the starting point of typographic design , and may even go on to inform the overall design or feel of a page .
Traditionally ,
Web typography suffers from a lack of options when it comes to typeface choice simply because fonts can be displayed only if they ’re available on users ’ computers .
The first job of the Web typographer , then , is to distinguish the fonts that are readily available , and to understand which are best suited to his or her particular tasks .
Very generally speaking , there are two main groups of typefaces that are used on the Web : serif and sans - serif .
The difference is easily demonstrated in this image :
Serif and sans - serif type
Serifs are the extra lines or small decorations added to the ends of the main strokes of the Georgia typeface above .
The theory behind these serifs is that they help the letters flow , and lead the eye across the text during reading .
Serif fonts are very popular in print , and although there is a certain amount of debate regarding which family of typeface is most legible on the screen , I fall firmly in to the camp that believes that sans - serif faces are a more suitable option .
The variable boldness and fine extra strokes of the serif fonts , particularly at smaller sizes of body text , often appear pixilated and untidy .
This is still the case even with the most modern anti-aliasing techniques .
With anti-aliasing enabled , the serif fonts look blurred ( which is exactly what they are ) around their curves and terminals .
On the other hand , the straight , low contrast , open strokes of a sans - serif font , such as Verdana , will always leave a good impression on - screen .
The Common Web Fonts
Most designers are probably familiar with what could be considered the common Web fonts .
The following CSS rule probably wo n’t raise too many eyebrows .
body {
font - family : verdana , " trebuchet MS " , helvetica , sans - serif ;
}
Here , we have three classic fonts that are used all over the Web .
However , instead of just copying and pasting this rule , let ’s look at why we have made the decision to use those three fonts , and what characterizes them as suitable for our purposes .
Verdana is our first choice font here .
This font was designed for the screen and is the most common sans - serif typeface used on the Web today .
The Verdana face in detail
Note the generous amount of space between each character , as well as the amount of whitespace within the characters ( glyphs ) themselves .
This is what makes Verdana so legible on screen , and an excellent choice for a sans - serif on the Web .
Trebuchet is another face created for the screen .
Designed in 1996 by Vincent Connare , it is probably the most distinctive of the common Web fonts , and can convey a great deal of energy and personality .
Certain features of this typeface depart significantly from what we would expect from a classic grotesk font , for example , the uppercase M seen below .
The Trebuchet face in detail
Despite its distinct personality , Trebuchet ’s strokes are blocky and clear .
It has a large x-height , helping to increase legibility at smaller sizes .
Finally , we ’ve gone for Helvetica .
Helvetica , designed in the 1950s and hugely popular throughout the second half of the 20th Century , is a classic in its own right .
That it transfers so well to screen is both a testament to its legibility and a blessing for Web typographers .
The Helvetica face in detail
Despite its compact width , Helvetica reads well on screen due to its large x -height .
It has a consistent and uniform feel to it , which not only makes it economical with space , but also means it ’s easy on the eye .
Finally our CSS rule declares sans - serif as a generic font family .
This ensures that users ’ systems will at least default to a sans - serif font if they do not have any of the others we have specified .
If you use the rule above , you ’ll be certain to provide good , legible text to the vast majority of your users .
However , why not experiment a bit more ?
What are some of the other good screen fonts out there that we can provide to users who have them available ?
What Characterizes Good Screen Fonts ?
Having looked at the properties of the above fonts in a bit more detail , you should have a clear idea of the features that define a good screen font :
Low contrast and simple strokes with a consistent weight and thickness
Generous x -height
Generous width and letter spacing
Generous punch width ( space within letters )
With those points in mind , you should be in a position to begin looking beyond the common Web fonts .
So , what are the design principles you should bear in mind when thinking about typeface choice ?
Choose a typeface or a group of faces that will honor and elucidate the character of the text .
– R. Bringhurst
Your typeface sets the tone or personality of your text .
Type is a part of your design that the user has no choice but to interact with directly , so its power should be taken seriously .
If you were designing a site for a large bank or mortgage company , it ’s unlikely that you would choose to set the body text in Comic Sans .
Comic
Sans is a fun , cartoony , frivolous typeface that would not at all be appropriate for the corporate image required .
This is a rather over - the - top example , but the principle is clear : let the nature of your content and the goals of your design lead you in your choice of typeface .
This means reading the text and having an understanding of what it conveys , then choosing a typeface that best illustrates and clarifies the key concepts .
The best way to ‘ get into type ’ is to immerse yourself in what ’s available and understand how people are using those fonts .
Visit some of the good type foundries , in particular Linotype and , for the more adventurous , Letterhead Fonts .
Another resource I find invaluable in the early stages of typographic work is the fantastic tool , Typetester .
Typetester allows you to easily style text with any number of CSS properties and compare them to one another on - screen .
It even builds the CSS rule for you when you find a combination of styles that you like !
This tool is well worth spending some time with , particularly if you ’re new to many of the detailed text properties in CSS .
This brings us to look a little more closely at those detailed CSS properties .
With so many capabilities now available to the Web designer through CSS , how should we be using these properties to deliver the best possible experience to our users ?
Size
Type size is one of the easiest factors to control on - screen , and as such it is often not given the importance that it deserves in the field of Web typography .
Size is an important device for giving your content a hierarchy , and the relative sizes of your headings , body text , and footers can have a big influence on the overall feel of a page .
Type size is also very closely linked to other characteristics of your page , such as column width , line - height , and so on .
As early as the sixteenth century , typographers had begun to use a common scale for type size , and there is no reason not to replicate this approach on the Web , particularly if you ’re looking for a traditional and highly legible result .
Like a musical scale , the series below has a natural elegance to it , and is considered by typographers to be a standard for relative type sizes .
The traditional type size series developed in the sixteenth century
A great example of a site that uses this type size scale on the Web is Jaredigital.com [ http://www.jaredigital.com]
It ’s clear that traditional and stylish typography was required for this site , and a little discreet poking around in the CSS finds the rules that make it all possible :
h3 {
font - size : 16 px ;
}
h4 {
font - size : 12px ;
}
p {
font - size : 11 px ;
}
A good rule of thumb is that the closer to one another are the font sizes of the various levels , the more elegant the overall impression will be .
If you ’re after a disjointed or modern feel , try using font sizes that are further apart on the scale .
A good example of this can be seen at Coudal.com .
The large headers used here are fairly unusual , and in my opinion , give a much more modern , less traditional feel to the design .
Note , however , that the headings are displayed in a much lighter color than the main body text .
Another good rule of thumb states that , if you want to use larger sizes for headings , use a lighter color to keep the overall feel of the page balanced .
It ’s also worth pointing out those headings as a particularly successful use of a serif font ( in this case , Times ) on the screen .
Emphasis
Emphasizing text is a relatively simple way to bring your words to life on the Web .
There is a great fashion at the moment — particularly in online promotional or advertising text — to scatter bold font weights liberally around the page .
Although traditional typographic convention would warn against the over - use of related faces such as bold or italics , on the Web , this technique can be used to encourage the eye through the text when there are so many other distractions on screen .
There are various ways we can introduce emphasis into text :
Bold :
On the Web , the most common and effective method is the use of a bold face from the current font family .
Of course , as with all these techniques , ensure that you do not over - use the bold face .
The key is to use bold faces sparingly , or not at all .
Italics : Italic text can suffer on low - resolution monitors because of the slanted and more curved shapes of italicized letters .
These are likely to look too pixilated when aliased , and too blurred when anti-aliased , and will spoil legibility when used in lengthy body text .
However , this should not stop you from using an italic face when convention approves it , for example , quoting foreign words and phrases , or listing books and periodical titles .
Underlining :
It ’s commonly understood that underlining text on the Web is not a good idea .
Web conventions tell us that any underlined text is a link , and can be clicked on .
It ’s a pretty fair bet that if you go around underlining text that ’s not clickable , you ’re going to confuse users .
Color : Using color for emphasis is also a rather tricky business .
Like underlined words , colored words could be mistaken for a link within body text .
In the past it was common to use a distinct background color to give emphasis to a passage of text , but even this has now become a convention for identifying links .
Furthermore , there are the accessibility issues assocaited with using color to display important meaning on the Web , which further add to the conclusion that using color for emphasis is not an ideal method .
Capital Letters :
Never set passages of text in full or small caps .
Not only is doing this considered rather rude and inelegant , but typographically , it is a very poor choice .
CONSIDER THE LEGIBILITY OF THIS SENTENCE COMPARED TO THE ONES THAT PRECEDE AND FOLLOW IT .
There is no doubt that , without the distinct shape of the words created by the lower case letters , readability is severely inhibited .
The example below highlights this clearly .
There is no doubt that it is easier to make out the words in the upper half of the sentence due to the more obvious shape of the words .
Note how the upper half of the sentence is easier to read than the lower
However , nice touches can be achieved using full or small caps in the right situation .
Try using small caps for abbreviations and acronyms within text , and of course , full caps for acronyms that stand for personal names or place names .
This is a detail that is rarely considered on the Web , but that should be simple to achieve with site - wide CSS files .
Line Spacing
A crucial detail when setting type on the Web is the issue of line spacing , or leading .
The vertical distance between lines of body text can make a huge difference to the legibility and overall style of your message .
A comparison of the two blocks of text below should demonstrate the point clearly .
A general rule of thumb when selecting a line - height value is that the longer the line length ( measure ) of your text , the more leading is required for legibility .
Notice the clarity that the increased line height brings to the text
The default line - height for most browsers is around 1.2 ( where 1 is where the tops of one row of characters would touch the base of the row above ) .
This is not sufficient for text on screen ; I ’d recommend increasing your line - height value to between 1.4 and 1.6 .
Letter Spacing and Kerning
In my opinion , letter spacing ( or tracking ) as controlled by the letter - spacing property in CSS should never be used for body text .
It ’s not very cross - browser friendly , and what you may see in Firefox may be drastically different in Internet Explorer or Safari .
Furthermore , it seems wrong to mess about with the tracking that each font has built into it .
The type designer carefully calculates these spaces , and most of the time , they ’re going to provide good results without any extra tampering .
However , letter spacing can be a very effective tool in short headings .
A classic example of this can be seen at Zeldman.com .
The large letter spacing of the titles in the right hand column allows for a bolder , uppercase typeface , but ensures that the overall balance of the page is consistent .
Letter spacing of titles at Zeldman.com
Kerning refers to improving the appearance of a word by adjusting spacing between certain pairs of letters .
On the Web , it ’s not realistic to attempt this with body text .
However , if you ’re creating headers or logos in graphics software , a little kerning can make a dramatic difference to the overall result .
Look at the two examples below .
The first shows the default kerning of the Verdana font ; the second has been tweaked in Fireworks with the goal of creating a more balanced and well - proportioned word shape .
Word Spacing
As with letter spacing , word spacing should be considered carefully before it ’s applied to the screen .
I am of the belief that if you think your text needs spacing and tracking manually , then you have probably chosen the wrong typeface for the job .
As with all the text properties that CSS allows us to control , consistency is the key .
Keep readers focused on the text , and make it easy for their eyes to flow through the words .
If you ’re breaking up the letters and words , you ’ll only serve to distract them , and disrupt the flow of the text .
Alignment
Margins can have a surprisingly large influence on the look and feel of your pages .
They help keep your text apart from other elements of your site , and from the edges of the browser window .
Larger margins produce an open , free feeling , while smaller , tighter margins give a constricted and more intimate aesthetic .
Assuming your content is in a language that flows left - to - right ( ltr ) , you should nearly always left - align your text on the Web .
Right - aligning should only be used for very specific purposes , and certainly not for long passages of text .
The ragged left edge of right - aligned text makes it very difficult for the eye to move from one line to the next and reduces legibility considerably .
Text that is set flush with both left and right margins is known as justified text .
Justification is extremely popular in books and newspapers , and gives a uniform and controlled feel to a page .
Justification on the Web would be far more popular if it were n’t for the fact that no browser or operating system has a hyphenation dictionary built in .
This means that the only way the browser has to justify text is to space out and / or squash up words to fit into the specific line length .
This is fine to an extent , but there comes a point — particularly with shorter line lengths — when a bit more flexibility is required .
The designer Todd Dominey provides an option on his site to justify all text , and the two screen shots below shows the good and bad results of doing that .
Good justified text at Whatdoiknow.org
Bad justified text at Whatdoiknow.org
The text in the wider column looks great , and the browser has dealt well with the justification .
However , in the smaller left - hand column you can see that the word spacing is very mixed and inconsistent , and this drastically affects the legibility of the text .
Extending Web Typography
While a lot can be achieved with CSS in the ways described above , designers must still endure a number of limitations when it comes to Web typography .
We are still stuck with a limited number of good screen fonts , but even if more were available , we ’d still be relying on users having them available on their machines .
With this system , designers are never going to have the true control of type that they desire .
It is frustrating that in the ten years since designers came to the Web , this problem has not been solved .
Replacing Text
One way in which designers work around the limitations today is to use image and Flash text replacement techniques to display headers or navigation .
This kind of text is often an integral part of a site ’s design or brand , and designers are keen to get as much control over these elements as possible .
The rules for using images or Flash to replace text are no different from those we use to choose body text typefaces .
Legibility should always be your prime concern , followed by suitability for the task at hand .
However , you do have a little more flexibility , mainly because you are more likely to be working with large font sizes and thus many legibility issues are already solved .
This situation may then be a suitable case for experimentation , and for basing a typeface choice solely on the character , or personality that you ’re trying to convey in your design .
One Flash replacement method that has caused a lot of buzz over the last year or so is sIFR ( pronounced siffer ) .
SIFR is touted as an accessible , scalable method of embedding custom typefaces in Web pages , and as such has generated a great deal of excitement among designers .
It is a superb tool for Web designers to have at their disposal .
There are specific cases in which sIFR is an unrivalled solution to the problem of creating dynamic headers in a custom typeface .
However , it is not the final solution to custom typography on the Web , and it ’s important to understand what the specific cases are before deploying it in your next design .
Like any powerful tool , sIFR has the potential for serious misuse .
To learn more about sIFR and its use cases , visit the official sIFR Wiki .
The Future
Flash replacement techniques , such as sIFR , hint at the future of Web typography , but they themselves are not the future .
They are stop - gap solutions that , with luck , will show browser makers , type foundries , and the W3C that Web designers will not rest until they have a way to display custom typefaces in their pages .
There have been attempts in the past to solve this problem , notably Microsoft ’s Web Embedding Fonts Tool ( WEFT ) , which allows for fonts to be stored on a Web server and downloaded when required .
Unfortunately , this has never developed into a satisfactory tool , simply because no other browser maker has implemented the Microsoft technology .
The type foundries too , are worried about the consequences of having their copyrighted type easily spread around the Web .
Once this problem is finally overcome , which it surely will be ( albeit later , rather than sooner ) , we will enter another age of Web typography .
However , the same rules will still apply , because the fundamental principles of typography will transfer to any medium .
The real challenge is to continue understanding the medium we are designing for as it develops , and to continue adapting these rules and guidelines to fit it .
In the meantime , though , keep an eye on what will surely prove to be an incredible new resource for Web typographers : Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web .
This new site takes the principles of Robert Bringhurst ’s classic book , The Elements of Typographic Style , and steps through them one by one , explaining how they can be applied to the Web .
If this article has got you thinking about what you could do with typography on your site , this will be the perfect place to take your knowledge a step further .
The site ’s owner , Richard Rutter , is adding one chapter per week .
Each illustrates examples of practical CSS that can be used to replicate the principles of Bringhurst ’s classic text , and explaining how and why they work on the Web .
It ’s definitely a site to keep an eye on over the coming months .

Last Saturday I started FON .
It ´s been the craziest 6 days of my business life .
And my business life is not short .
I started Viatel , Jazztel and Ya.com .
But in those three cases the launch itself was not an event .
I don´t remember the actual first week of Viatel .
I had the idea in 1990 , a sort of virus that reverted the calling patterns of international telecom networks and gave foreigners US dial tone .
It was a big idea , but it took me maybe a year of hard labor to get to the level of global awareness that I have achieved in 6 days with FON through my blog .
And it took 10 years and a great team effort for the company to be worth over $ 1bn .
Same is true with Jazztel .
Jazztel was a Spanish telecom company .
A fiber optic network / dsl provider .
But even though it was local , it took me at least 2 million euros in advertising to get to the level of awareness that FON has achieved in 6 days … and all through my blog .
Jazztel is now Spain´s second largest publicly traded telecom company with a market cap of over $ 1bn .
Same with Ya.com .
Spain´s second largest internet company .
We launched Ya.com when the internet was so small in Spain that most advertising had to be done on TV and print , and it costed a fortune .
True , we invested 38 million euros and we sold it two years later to T Online for 550 million euros , but close to half of the 38 million was spent in regular advertising in 2000 / 2001 .
But now , there´s my blog .
From what I know , mine is not a very popular blog .
It is read by only about 2000 people per day .
But it seems that 2000 people talking to their friends adds up to a LOT of people .
Last night I searched “ fon varsavsky ” in Technorati and I couldn´t believe the amount of blogs that were writing about FON .
And we are not even ready with our software !
The official launch date is November 15th .
Moreover , the concept of FON is not that easy to understand .
Yesterday , for example , I met with the former head of Vodafone in Spain , Ignacio Sanchez Galan , and he just did not get it , which surprised me as Vodafone could be one of the companies whose stock value would tank the most if FON becomes the Skype of the mobile world .
Not only there is an incredible amount of people reading blogs now , but they are smarter than the former head of Vodafone !
Now , of all the crazy things that happened , the one that stands out is the case of Daniel Isenberg , a Harvard Business School professor who wants to do a Harvard Business case on FON , only 6 days after it appeared on my blog .
I know this could be dangerous .
If FON in the end fizzles , people do not download our software and we don´t get to build a unified wifi nation , we will look like idiots .
But at least we won´t be broke idiots , as it happened to many during the bubble , as we are spending exactly O euros in advertising and very little on all the rest .
In FON , so far , there´s a lot of talent among the people who work there , but no money spent on marketing .
Blogging has turned the equation of being a big success or a big failure into being a small failure or a big success .
I like this new risk profile and will do whatever I can to turn FON into a big success .
The Bush administration has a theory to explain why the Founding Fathers secretly intended for the president to have boundless power .
Even though the new unitary executive theory  is nowhere in the Constitution , White House officials continually invoke it to justify scorning federal law .
The fact that the administration is getting away with this charade symbolizes how docile much of the American media and political opposition have become .
Earlier this year , members of Congress anguished publicly over how many of the original USA PATRIOT
Act surveillance powers should be renewed .
A bipartisan agreement was finally reached , giving the White House almost everything it wanted .
As part of the deal to renew the Patriot Act , Bush administration officials agreed to provide Congress more details on how the new powers were being used .
However , Bush reneged in a signing statement  quietly released after a heavily hyped White House signing ceremony on March 9 .
He decreed that he was entitled to withhold any information that would impair foreign relations , national security , the deliberative process of the executive , or the performance of the executive ’s constitutional duties .
He announced that he would interpret any provision in the law obliging notifying Congress in a manner consistent with the president ’s constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to withhold information . 
In other words , any provision of the law that requires disclosure is presumptively null and void .
The crux of the unitary executive is that all power rests in the president , and that checks and balances are an archaic relic .
This is the same principle the Bush administration invoked to deny Congress everything from Iraqi war plans to the records of the Cheney Energy Task Force .
Bush has invoked the unitary executive doctrine almost a hundred times since taking office , according to a study by Miami University professor Christopher Kelley .
One of the starkest statements of this theory came in the confidential August 2002 Justice Department / White House memo justifying torture .
That memo revealed ,  In light of the president ’s complete authority over the conduct of war , without a clear statement otherwise , criminal statutes are not read as infringing on the president ’s ultimate authority in these areas . 
And even if Congress did try to explicitly restrain executive power , any such law would be unconstitutional because of the inherent power vested in the presidency , according to the memo .
When he was White House counsel , Alberto Gonzales spoke of a commander - in - chief override to justify scorning the Anti-Torture Act .
The Bush administration ’s sense of entitlement is obvious from the ongoing controversy over warrantless National Security Agency wiretaps of Americans .
Such wiretaps are clearly prohibited by the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Yet Bush declared that he is entitled to order such wiretaps because of the inherent authority of the presidency .
The administration ’s attitude toward both the law and Congress was stark in the responses recently delivered to congressional questions on the scope and nature of the NSA warrantless wiretap program .
The basic answer to almost all the questions was ,  None of your business . 
Again and again , the White House declared that decisions about what communications to intercept are made by professional intelligence officers . 
Apparently , the job titles of the NSA officials automatically negate the Fourth Amendment ’s requirement for a warrant before the feds can intrude .
The Bush administration has claimed that the wiretaps are legal because of the president ’s duty to protect America .
Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee asked ,  What is the limiting principle of the president ’s claimed inherent authority as commander in chief ? 
The administration replied ,  In light of the strictly limited nature of the Terrorist Surveillance Program , we do not think it a useful or a practical exercise to engage in speculation about the limits of the president ’s authority as commander in chief . 
There is no reason to accept that the program is strictly limited — because Bush in 2004 publicly declared that no wiretaps could be done without a court order .
The administration has done nothing since then to signal greater respect for the truth .
And Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ’s written responses to Senate Judiciary Committee questions hinted that there may be other surveillance programs not yet revealed to the public .
The Bush White House also asserted that the September 2001  Authorization to Use Military Force resolution passed by Congress after 9/11 entitled Bush to tap Americans ’ phones .
But if the authorization actually entitled the president to do whatever he thinks necessary on the home front , then Americans have been living under martial law for the last four and a half years .
At this point , Americans can only guess which laws Bush feels obliged to obey .
According to Newsweek , Steven Bradbury , head of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , recently informed the Senate Intelligence Committee that Bush could order killings of suspected terrorists within the United States .
Americans cannot expect to have good presidents if presidents are permitted to make themselves czars .
The unitary executive theory is simply another in a long series of intellectual cons crafted to trample freedom .
The sooner that it is tarred and feathered and ridden out of Washington on a rail , the safer Americans ’ remaining rights will be .

なんか以前のコーディング規約といい、ヤヴァいとこ踏みまくってますが。
ソフトウェアをリリースするときのバージョン番号って、あれは絶対なにかあるね。自分だけで作ってリリースするだけならもちろんご自由にどうぞ、でいいんだけども、こっちが依頼して、こういう番号にしてくれとまで言って、それがただの番号だからね、と何度言っても、ほんとうに通じない。さいとうさんがAさんに以下のようにバージョン規約をお願いしたとしよう。
仕事の区切りや経理の締めなどで、さいとうが契約上正式に受領したものはメジャーバージョンを1つあげ、マイナーバージョンを0にリセットした番号を付ける。 さいとうとAさんの間で、テストやデバッグなどの理由で適宜必要に応じてソースを渡す場合は、現行のメジャーバージョンにマイナーバージョンを1つあげてつける。
メジャー・マイナー間の番号の繰り上がりは無い。番号9の次はそのまま10、11、12、...と続ける。
たったこれだけの事が実に通じない。どう通じないのか挙げてみよう。なにかの法則が見えるかもしれない。
最初の0.1、0.2くらいまではいいが、0.3あたりから付けるのを渋り始める。
0.7、0.8あたりになると「まだ0.8とは言えないんですが」と怪しい言い訳を始める。
0.9を過ぎると0.91とか0.92とかいう番号を使い始める。無用なteenyを足し付けるのも常套手段。
" 0.7 " の番号の後ろに以下の文字を意味無く(ここ重要)付けたがり始める : " alpha、beta " のギリシア文字英語表 記
" RC " 、" Preview " といった、リリースの意味合いを付加したもの
" 0.7 ksaito " みたいに自分や会社の名 前 上記の意味無し文字を付けた後にまた修正が入ると、なぜか(ここがまたわからんのだが)、その後は平気で文字列の後ろにベタに10進数を書く。
" 0.7alpha2 "
" 0.8ksaito4 " 上記の複数桁、teeny、各文字列の使用方法が一環せず、ひとつを採用して何度かバージョンを上げてはまた別の方法を採用する。 " 0.95.4ksaitoRC2 " 番号は、マイナーバージョンの後ろに採用された方法ほど少なくなる。
複数の方法(マイナーバージョンを含めて大体3方法程度)を並行採用して複雑な番号体系になってしまうと、いきなり番号を付けなくなる。 番号無しでリリース

" 最新( latest ) " などと形容す る
こんなとこですか 。
全然まとまらんが 、
" リリース 1.0 " = 「 やったねオレ !!」という感情 小数表記と桁上がり感 なんかかっこいい
という気持ちが入り混ざってるんでしょうかねえ。私は番号は「仕事/契約上、かならずすぐわからなければならないことが、書類も見ず話も聞かずに一目でわかるように」つけるのが一番助かるので、それで付けるようにしてます。フリーソフトウェアとちょっと考えが違うのは、
大きな仕様変更もあるけど、相手に正式納品した時点でメジャーを上げる。
開発中の場合はマイナーだけをいじる。だから、マイナーが0以外のものは客が文句を言ってもサポート対象にならないので、しない。
ってあたりかな。この何年か、やたらと奇数偶数でやりたがるのが居ますが、客相手に「開発版」も無いだろうよ、ってことで却下。0.9の次が0.10なのは気持ち悪いって人の気持ちはわからないでもないけれど、なにせこっちは仕事ですから、「開発開始から10回以内にリリース」なんて事はあるわけないし、じゃあどう付けようか、などとそんな事で頭を使いたくないのでそのまま連番。
書き出した時はなんかちょっとは結論がつくはずだったんだが、今日はここでおしまい。オチがやったねと小数だけじゃ全然ダメダメだが、なにしろ腹が減った。風呂入って晩飯にしよう。もう午前だけど。
For all the Ajax calendars that are appearing , it ’s a shame I can’t find one which really meets my needs .
I tried out Trumba , Kiko , 30 Boxes , Yahoo !
Calendar , and Spongecell .
I could n’t recommend any of them .
My needs are probably weird , but not that weird .
Here ’s what I need a calendar to be able to do :
Enter flights .
Many of these calendars only lets me enter things that start on 15 minute intervals , and flights are just not scheduled that way .
Many of these calendars insist I specify the duration , which I do n’t know — I know when the flight lands , but not the duration .
Understand enough about time zones so I can enter a flight .
Flights from New Zealand to Los Angeles arrive before they departed .
It ’s confusing but it ’s true and if I ca n’t enter them properly on my calendar I ’m back to typing itineraries in Word .
Allow my assistant to enter appointments and see my schedule , although some things may be private .
Many calendars have this feature .
Notify me in advance of a meeting using some reliable mechanism .
Surprisingly many of the hot new Ajax calendars omitted this basic feature because they ’re web apps .
At the very least , I ’d like something to pop up on Windows , which means a downloadable widget , and an SMS message on my cell phone .
Different meetings need different advance warnings …
I need to be notified 3 hours before a flight at Kennedy but 3 minutes before a meeting in my office .
Print out something reasonable that I can take with me before a trip listing my complete schedule for the trip .
Some of my appointments have driving directions or complicated notes attached .
I just want a list of where I need to be , when , and it ’s surprising that very few online calendars can handle this .
Listen , I know that everybody is saying that the cool thing to do these days is Ship Early and Often , but when you ship half - baked ajax calendars that do n’t do much and then get Scoble to go nuts about how great they are , well , you ’re going to have a lot of people like me checking it out and realizing that , for example , no thought whatsoever has gone into printing , which is fine , it ’s a 1.0 release , but you know what ?
I ’m not going to look at 30 Boxes again — I ’ve spent enough time evaluating it .
G’bye .
I ’ve talked about this before — it ’s the Marimba phenomenon — when you get premature publicity , lots of people check out your thing , and it ’s not done yet , so now most of the people that tried your thing think it ’s lame , and now you have two problems : your thing is lame and everybody knows it .
Why so many Ajax calendars ?
My theory is that about a year ago , there was a lot of buzz ( possibly true , possibly false ) about Google shipping a calendar , and everybody thought , oh gosh , it ’s gonna be really good , like Gmail , and then Yahoo !
is going to be embarrassed again , and run out and buy the best Ajax calendar company they can find , just like they did with Oddpost , making those very funny kids millionaires overnight .
So people are n’t really building calendars to sell to people like me who need calendars : they ’re building calendar companies to sell to Yahoo ! , which , for some reason , has given up on the old concept of hiring programmers to write code , and is going with this new age concept of buying entire companies on the hopes that they might contain a good programmer or two , which , by the way , is a sure sign of trouble for a technology company .
But anyway , how many Ajax Calendar Companies do you think Yahoo ! is gonna buy ?
You do n’t build a product for one customer .
It ’s just too risky .
Getting a website on the net as a novice is n’t exactly cake .
It requires registering a domain name ( example.com ) , hiring a web designer , and paying a monthly fee to host the site .
A content management system is also preferable over paying a web designer hourly to make updates when he can fit it into his schedule .
Therefore , a website can run several thousand dollars not including the monthly hosting fee or the occasional updates .
These are the reasons that paved the way for me to separate myself from the rat race and become an entrepreneur .
I decided to create a web - based application called Posima.com that does all of the above for a low monthly fee .
I hired 4 contractors from 4 different countries to complete all the necessary work for the project .
I ’ve learned many things over the course of the past 14 months , but have 5 suggestions I would like to pass on to any entrepreneurs who are ready for battle .
1. Do n’t Panic
Panicking is overrated and does n’t help anybody do anything .
If you are buried alive in a coffin , you will use air less quickly and have a better chance of surviving by keeping a calm head vs. panicking .
I ’ve had contractors try to quit on me or turn MIA for weeks at a time .
At first I flipped out , and flipped out often .
But I realized that it was n’t the end of the world and I ’d figure out how to get the work done one way or another .
Panicking wasted valuable time I could have been utilizing elsewhere .
If a problem arises that needs a fast solution , panicking will do nothing but burn up your remaining air .

2. Reframe problems
I got this from a book about Alexander the Great .
Reframing means find the correct problem first then follow with the proper solution .
For example , during the sales process my host told me I could do “ x ” with my shared hosting account .
Later I clarified with support how to accomplish “ x . ” Once “ x ” started being done , my host shut down my account saying I was taking up too much of the shared servers resources .
I started talking with a lawyer , compiled all the conversations where the company said “ x ” was OK , etc etc .
Upon further review I decided going this route was a bad idea , it would cost money and headache with no obvious solution .
I originally thought the problem was the host lying to me .
The real problem was that “ x ” needed to be in working order for me to continue .
I solved the problem by leasing a server from the same host on which I can do whatever I please .
The host gave me some extra goodies for the trouble .
3. Budget
Budget is a fake word made up to explain a fake process .
A budget is how much you have or are planning on spending .
You will go over budget ; it ’s inevitable .
If you have $ 10,000 to spend , why make your budget $ 10,000 when we know you ’ll go over ?
I think it ’s smart to make your budget 50 % of what you have to spend .
Plan your project around $ 5,000 .
When those inevitable issues arise ( having my own server costs $ 250 a month more than what I had before ) , you ’ll still be in the black vs. trying to figure out where you ’re going to find that extra cash .
If by some miracle you stay within budget , you ’ll have extra cash to allocate elsewhere or put into savings .

4. Outsource
Outsourcing usually has a negative connotation .
We outsource every day a hundred different ways .
When I need food , I do n’t go outside , shoot a cow and pick tomatoes from my garden .
I go to a grocery store .
When I want to talk to a friend , I do n’t send up smoke signals or talk into a can attached to a long string .
I pick up the phone and dial .
Just because you have a tech guy on staff , does n’t mean he knows the finite details about making a standards based web site .
Just because you have an office manager that keeps the books , does n’t mean come January she ’s a CPA .
I ’m a one - man show .
I came up with the idea for my service but did n’t have any of the necessary skills to fulfill my dream .
I could have raised venture capital or brought in “ co- founders ” to help me , but then I ’d get less pie at the end ( and I like my pie ) .
Instead I contracted out all work I could n’t do myself .
It took a little longer , but cost less in the long run .
Do n’t be afraid to hire a professional to do certain tasks .
5. Forget the Others
This one I hold dear to my heart .
After graduating college from the University of Texas I worked at a large corporation as a cubicle monkey for a year .
I could n’t handle the bureaucracy and quit knowing I wanted to start my own business .
I worked the pick axe and shovel for months digging holes for septic systems while toying with different ideas for a business .
When I finally got my idea , I dug holes during the day and molded my software with my contractors at night via email .
During this process I received an uncanny amount of pushback from my friends and family telling me to get a real job .
No one quite understood what I was trying to accomplish with my software and wrote it off as a dumb idea .
I blew everyone off and stayed the course .
I now have those same skeptics eating their words , calling my software a multi-million dollar idea .
My point is do n’t worry about what the skeptics say , it ’s not their life to lead .
Advertising
All in all , be agile in whatever you do .
Just as nothing goes exactly right in life , it does n’t in the business realm either .
At 24 years old , it took me 13 months to create my web application .
Often times it was rough and I was poor , but I now have a very cool product to offer small businesses that I believe they will be very pleased with .
The experience was incredibly rewarding emotionally and have my fingers crossed that it will be just as rewarding financially .
I highly recommend starting your own business if not for the experience alone .
If you happen to need a website for that business , why not check out my web application ?
Chad Sakonchick is a 24 - year old entrepreneur from Austin , Texas .
His business , Posima , is a web application that makes it easy for small businesses and non-profits to get up and running on the web .
It provides the domain name , the hosting , the design and a content management system all rolled into one .
Before FDR stole the term coined by Yale Professor William Graham Sumner , " The Forgotten Man " was a hypothetical " D " who was stuck with the bill after " A " and " B " got together to find a way to help poor , suffering " C. " ( FDR of course , tried to make us forget about " D " by claiming " C " was " The Forgotten Man . " )
I have attempted to make my new book ( The Big Ripoff : How Big Business and Big Government Steal Your Money ) a book for the Forgotten Man .
Specifically , I describe how big businesses lobby for and profit from big government programs  higher taxes , stricter regulation , corporate welfare  that rip off consumers , entrepreneurs , and taxpayers .
The Forgotten Man is an abstraction , but in researching some big ripoffs for The Big Ripoff I came across a man whose name is now immortal among lawyers , but who still is fairly called " The Forgotten Man . "
His name is Pennington : James Pennington .
In the field of anti-trust , that name is now synonymous with the collusion between big business , big government , and big labor .
Lest his story be forgotten , I will tell it here .
The 1950s began with labor unrest in the coal industry .
Mineworkers , protesting their wages , shortened their weeks and threatened to walk out .
Things were approaching a crisis .
That year labor and ownership came face to face .
George H. Love had worked in a coal mine in his youth , but then went to Harvard Business School .
By 1950 , Love had pieced together a coal empire , combining a handful of coal companies into Pittsburgh Consolidated Coal Company , the world 's largest coal company .
When Love sat down at the table he was representing not only his own coal giant , but all the big soft coal mine operators in the country .
Across from him was John L. Lewis .
The son of Welsh immigrants , Lewis was working the mines by the age of 15 .
At 37 years old , he was the head of the United Mine Workers of America ( UMW ) .
He founded the Congress of Industrial Organizations , which is now the " CIO " of the AFL - CIO .
When the two hammered out an agreement giving Lewis almost everything he wanted on wages and hours , newspapers called it " submission " on the part of Love .
As the agreement played out for the rest of the decade , it began to look like something else .
A jury later it called it " a conspiracy . "
The agreement was modified over the next few years , and by 1958 , the coal companies Love had represented were paying far higher wages than any other industry .
They were also prohibited from buying coal from or selling it to non-union shops , and could not lease their land to non-union shops .
This arrangement , it turns out , was a good one for the big coal companies .
The large mine operators were already shifting towards increased mechanization of mining .
This increased productivity , which offset the higher wages .
If George Love paid a worker 50 % more , but the worker dug up twice as much coal each day , Love was paying less per ton than before .
These machines , however , were expensive , and the smaller coal companies could not afford them .
If all mineworkers demanded these wages , the small coal companies would go out of business .
Even with mechanization , Love and Lewis knew these agreements would drive up the cost of mining coal .
1
This was unproblematic as long as the costs were being absorbed by the whole industry — which was almost the case .
There still remained , however , small coalmine operators who did not sign onto Love 's agreement .
The agreements surely made things harder for the little guys , with the higher union wages dragging away most potential labor .
But they could still survive as long as they had customers .
Given their lower costs , these small , non-union mines ( such as James Pennington 's Phillips Brothers Coal Company ) could get customers by charging less for their coal than Love 's mines would .
So , the unions and big coal mines tried to take away these small coal companies ' labor .
A union organizer in 1955 beat Andrew Frost for refusing to sign a union contract , Frost testified in court .
2
But this was n't enough , so big business and big labor had to take away their customers .
The typical way to do that would be to offer a better product or lower prices .
But coal is a commodity : a ton of Mr. Pennington 's coal is no worse than a ton of Mr. Love's .
Also ,
Love was charging more , and had to , thanks to his higher wages .
Why , then , would a buyer ever willingly pay higher prices for a commodity ?
He would do so only if he were spending someone else 's money .
Enter big government .
During the Depression , Franklin Roosevelt created the Tennessee Valley Authority , which was supposed to create jobs and electrical power at the same time .
The TVA originally was in the business of building and operating dams , which would use water to generate electricity .
By 1954 , however , it was in the business of coal - run power plants .
This made it the largest coal customer in the country .
In 1954 , the TVA bought 8 million tons of coal from the " dogholes in the mountains " as Lewis called the small coal mine operators .
3
Lewis and Love would set this right .
Lewis met with Dwight Eisenhower 's Secretary of Labor , James Mitchell .
The Labor Department , Lewis argued , should invoke the Depression - era Walsh - Healey Act , which allowed the federal government to set a minimum wage for any company receiving a government contract worth $ 10,000 or more .
Love , of course , agreed with Lewis , and all the biggest coal companies joined forces .
They leaned on the Eisenhower Administration to go even farther than Lewis 's original request , and stop making even small purchases ( exempt from Walsh - Healey ) from small mine operators .
Lewis and his big business cohorts got their way , and the federal government agreed to freeze out any coal company not paying union wages  all in the name of protecting the worker , FDR's " Forgotten Man . "
But what about Sumner 's Forgotten Man ?
The small operators were now unable to sell coal or subcontract for the big operators ( thanks to the labor agreements ) and also unable to sell to the biggest coal customer in the country : Uncle Sam .
From the small mine operators ' perspective , a conspiracy of big labor , big business , and big government , was threatening their existence .
Some tried to make due under these restrictions .
Others caved and signed the union contracts .
James Pennington ran the Phillips Brothers Coal Company , which , facing all these handicaps for non-union operators , signed on with Lewis 's agreements .
Soon he found it impossible to afford the high costs , and he was unable to make the contributions ( 40 cents per ton ) to the mineworkers ' retirement fund that the agreement demanded .
Pennington went out of business , but then he fought back .
He went to court in 1961 , alleging a conspiracy in restraint of trade that violated anti-trust laws .
Pennington argued that the big coal companies and the UMW had conspired to drive him and other small coal companies out of business by demanding the companies contribute 40 cents to a UMW retirement fund for each ton of coal mined and by imposing the high minimum wage .
He also alleged that the unions loaned millions of dollars to the companies to help them conspire against the little guys .
Pennington 's argument , as summarized later by the Supreme Court , was : " the union entered into a conspiracy with the large operators to impose the agreed - upon wage and royalty scales upon the smaller , nonunion operators , regardless of their ability to pay and regardless of whether or not the union represented the employees of these companies , all for the purpose of eliminating them from the industry , limiting production and pre-empting the market for the large , unionized operators . "
In May 1961 , a jury found the union guilty .
In December 1963 , a federal appeals court upheld that verdict .
UMW went to the Supreme Court .
Justice Byron
White wrote that the agreements between Love and Lewis might have constituted a conspiracy in constraint of trade , but that bilateral agreement was n't what drove Pennington under .
The nail in Pennington 's coffin was the entrance of the government into the conspiracy .
According to White , that government 's involvement also made the conspiracy legal .
The opinion read : " Joint efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition . "
4
The irony in the case of Pennington is that as long as the conspiracy did not involve the government , it was ineffective and illegal .
Once the government entered , the big business - big labor plan to drive out the small guy started to work .
The net effect of coal companies ' going out of business was a marginal upward pressure on coal prices for consumers .
This meant that electricity bills were higher than they would have been .
To the degree the TVA was paying more for coal , its customers and its patrons — the taxpayers — were paying more .
The agreements also led to massive unemployment in the coal mining industry .
James Pennington lost his coal company , and then his court case .
In so doing , he won eternal fame among anti-trust lawyers .
The Noerr - Pennington doctrine , combining the coal case with a similar case ( Noerr ) in the realm of trucking and railroads , lays out , in effect , that a conspiracy in restraint of trade is legal as long as one of the co-conspirators is the government .

It will make this proposition economically sustainable by providing the means to integrate contextual advertising , relevant affiliate products and sponsors as well as commissions from affiliate products and services promoted on the page while sharing the returns with each mini - guide author .
A lens it 's a mini-universe of know - how and resources focusing on a very specific topic .
It is a one - page encyclopedia about a specific topic , product or issue .
The new service called Squidoo is now in " secret " beta , will allow anyone to build their own public mini - guides on whichever topics they will want to cover .
It will make it easier , faster , more credible and more accessible than it has ever been possible until now .
And at no cost .
Differently than blog pages or news articles , lenses cover a specific niche item in great detail while providing links to relevant related resources , selected opinions and reviews from others , recommended books on the topic , key source authorities and blogs or news sites covering that topic .
Mini-Guides , or lenses , as Seth Godin , the idea man behind this service has named them , are nothing else that well organized web pages focusing on one , very specific topic .
A new service is about to launch that will allow individuals to create , manage and maintain " mini- guides " to specific topics , products , people and issues .
I could n't find this proposition more timely .
I think Seth has indeed framed a peculiar need for information aggregation that has been ripening for the last 18 months and has conceived a truly effective proposition to allow individuals the ability to make more experts than a simple blog can make them .
It is indeed by writing and maintaining mini-guides that I myself have gotten the visibility and exposure that I now enjoy .
If it was n't for the " lenses " that I myself have built and continued to maintain over time , I would have never made the amount of revenue that has made a completely independent online publisher that can live and re-invest exclusively out of content generated revenue .
Here are some of the " lenses " I have published , that over time have given me such powerful visibility , topic credibility and trust from thousands of readers worldwide :
I would not be exaggerating in saying , that nearly 50 % of my traffic comes daily from people who find these mini - guides very useful for their specific needs .
Instead of having to go to multiple places and collect all the information they need , they find all they were looking for in a simple to access page .
But indeed , like Seth Godin has rightly pointed out in an introductory ebook accompanying his new service , creating , maintaining and extracting the best revenue from these unique resource pages is a dear pain in that place .
Some of the typical problems include :
a ) the way that these mini-resources are built is not standardized ,
b ) the need for a good dedicated RSS feed for each one ,
c ) the missed opportunity to showcase and add more related and relevant products requires costly customization jobs ,
d ) visibility and exposure are only as good as your skill in titling , categorizing and giving proper exposure to your site ( something not everyone is very good at these days ) ,
e ) creating a mini - guide from scratch is not easy , and does require competence , research abilities and time ,
f ) hardly no tools facilitate this process while providing tools to facilitate the different needs a newsmaster ( my term for a human information aggregator ) would have .
This is why I think Seth 's new idea is right on target .
I have n't been invited to test this out , and while I have requested access as a beta tester I have not been yet accepted .
So , what I am saying here is all based on what I have read on Seth 's own blog , what I have seen through the samples he has put up , or by checking some of the information available on the Squidoo blog .
I strongly invite you to evaluate , analyze , test and question Seth 's upcoming new service .
I strongly think that this is indeed a great opportunity for independent publishers or would - be ones , to more effectively focus their knowledge , research abilities and desire to establish themselves as experts within their specific topic universes .
Here below is an edited summary of the key idea , strategy and benefits behind this new service , as originally conceived and written by Seth Godin himself ( Everyone is an expert - PDF ) .

LET'S SAY YOU JUST DISCOVERED ESPRESSO .
For years and years , you were afraid to try it , sticking with herbal tea and the like , but one day , wrestling with boredom and hunger at
O'Hare , you broke down and ordered a decaf latte at Starbucks .
And fell in love .
Now , you love espresso .
You need it .
All the time .
But you really do n't want to spend your entire income at Starbucks , and you believe , deep down , that maybe it 's possible to make even better espresso at home .
So , you do the obvious thing .
You go to Google .
And you type in " buy espresso machine . "
Of course , you 're not ready to buy an espresso machine right this second .
Even if the perfect machine at the
perfect price from the right vendor appeared in a Google ad at the top of your screen , there 's no way on earth you 'd buy that machine right now .
Right now , you 're just looking .
You just want to learn about what 's going on .
So , you do your search and find way more than 820,000 matches ( * ) .
The first few are triumphs of Search Engine Optimization ( SEO ) .
These sites sell espresso machines and have done a great job of getting listed high up in the
Google results .
But that , of course , is not what you want .
You do n't want to only see the listings of machines , not yet .
You want to understand what 's important , what matters , what 's worth it .
Seeing the machines now is like shopping for a car before you know how to drive .
Without meaning , it 's a waste of time .
A few sites down the list , I found that Engadget.com , a site I know and trust , has an article .
So you click on it .
It 's a pretty worthless article .
But you notice that there are literally hundreds of comments .
You click and read a few .
The first few comments are worthless because they are unsubstantiated boasts from people you 've never heard of .
But about five comments down , you discover a long , thoughtful post by someone who knows all about espresso
machines .
Not everyone is seduced by rational textual argument , but you are , so you get excited .
Finally !
You 're starting to understand .
So you go to www.coffeegeek.com , which you find through another comment .
Nirvana !
This is the site that should have been # 1 .
But alas , it 's disorganized and hard to follow .
So you spend three hours ( I 'm not kidding , three hours ) reading up on espresso .
Now you 're informed , you know what 's out there and you 've read a few reviews of different machines .
Finally , you know enough to think about buying .
So you go back to your original Google search .
And now you click on an ad .
You look at that site for a while , hit Back , click on another ad .
After you 've clicked on six ads , you decide to go back to coffeegeek and buy a $ 1,400 espresso machine .
Did you know that those ads sell for about $ 5.50 a click ?
You clicked on six of them .
That 's $ 33 Google earned because of your incessant clicking .
And you ended up buying somewhere else .
Google deserves every penny , of course , because even though you did n't buy anything , you were exactly the kind of prospect the advertisers were looking for .
You just were n't ready yet .
This is the best advertising the Web has to offer .
Congratulations .
Now you understand how surfing the Web really works .
You used to think that a magic search engine would find your answer and you 'd be done .
Not so .
You found clues , you invested time , and you turned it into meaning .
Since 1994 , Web 1.0 has been an ongoing effort to give you more ( and better ) clues .
Web 2.0 is about something else entirely .
I BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU GO ONLINE , you do n't search .
You do n't even find .
Instead , you are usually on a quest to make sense .
That 's the goal of most visits to Google or Yahoo !
or blogs or the Wikipedia .
How do you make sense of the noise that 's coming at you from all directions ?
You wo n't take action , you wo n't buy something , book something , hire someone , or take a position on a political issue -- until you 've made sense of your options .
Think about the way you shop - - online or in the real world .
Unless the item is a staple or the store is quite familiar , it 's unlikely that you buy the very first option you come across .
Instead , you circle the store , putting off the salespeople ( " I 'm just browsing " ) , or you click around the Web , poking and exploring and searching until you
understand your options .
You 're not seeking the answer at first -- first you want to understand the meaning behind your choices .
Before you download that software or buy that product , you might want a better understanding of how a
technology works .
Or you might want to find three or four choices for your budget before you book your hotel in London .
You might want to be more comfortable about the ways to persuade your school board not to ban a certain book , or you might want to know how Moby 's new album is coming along .
If this sounds a little like word of mouth , that should come as no surprise .
Not only does word of mouth give us
confidence in a decision , it acts as a filter .
It gets rid of the extraneous and presents just the focused good stuff .
Sooner or later , you 'll figure out whatever it is you 're trying to understand .
Sooner or later , the picture will snap into focus , and then you 'll stop investing your time on researching the issue and take action instead .
After that , maybe you 'll take your newfound understanding and use it to teach and persuade others ( after all , now you 're an expert ) .
Or maybe you 'll move on to discover something else .
Searching online should really be called poking online .
Because that 's what you do .
You poke around .
You poke in Google or at Yahoo !
and you poke at some ads .
You 're not ready to take action , but you are willing to spend a few minutes poking .
After looking at a bunch of links and pages , then , finally , you get it .
You understand enough to take action to buy something or make a decision .
The thing is , this takes a long time .
The Web ought to accelerate and even replicate that word of mouth phenomenon that works so well in the real world .
The mistake :
The engineers who built the Web believed that if they presented the " right " answer , intelligent
humans would be pleased .
In fact , before you get it , before you discover the meaning , there is no right answer .
...
But what if there were a librarian you trusted ?
What if she had a desk near yours , or she was available on some
instant messaging program , a click away , standing by , waiting to hear from you ?
You could say , " Hey Sarah , there 's a reference on Scoble 's blog to a guy named Seth .
Who 's that ? "
And she would know .
And she could tell you in two or three sentences , and the picture would snap into place and you could go back to work .
Because Sarah is trusted , and because she 's a person -- a person who understands ideas and context and relevance , she could give you meaning far faster and with far more authority than a computer ever could .
The first version of the Web -- the clue machine -- continues to get better and faster and more complete .
The first version of the Web is , in essence , a miracle , something few people could have predicted even ten years ago .
But the first version of the Web is still focused on poking .
It always will be .
It delivers matches , but it does n't deliver meaning .
A LENS FILTERS LIGHT AND SHOWS US WHAT WE NEED TO SEE .
It focuses on some elements and hides others .
Lenses are often different and frequently personal .
( " Do n't wear your friend 's glasses , " mom shouts ; " you might go blind ! " ) .
An online lens is a page , a single page , that highlights one person 's view of the Web - - not the whole Web , just one
tiny part of it .
A lens gives context .
When it succeeds , it delivers meaning .
A lens can tell you which books , records , and Web sites are the best way to appreciate Miles Davis .
A lens can show you the ten most important things you need to know about copyright on the Web .
A lens can highlight the key players in the hospital crib business and give you the confidence you need to go ahead and buy something without worrying about whether you missed a key player or did n't understand a critical choice .
A lens quickly answers the question " What do I need to know ? "
I call the person who makes a lens a lensmaster .
A lensmaster uses the tools available online to provide links , feeds , abstracts , and lists to users who are trying to make sense of a topic .
These are users in search of meaning , users in a hurry , users who wo n't wait .
Give users meaning , and they are far more likely to take action .
LIKE MOST EBAY SELLERS OR VIRTUALLY ALL SUCCESSFUL BLOGGERS , lensmasters are individuals with strong personal agendas , expertise , causes , products and even opinions .
They are not employed or directed by a corporation .
Lensmasters build their lenses for fun , or for
ego , or to drive traffic to their corporate sites or their blogs .
Lensmasters build lenses to raise money for charity or to earn royalty checks for themselves .
Blogs were a breakthrough because they allowed intensely personal thoughts to be shared ( over time ) online .
A lens is the perfect companion to a blog .
A lens amplifies a blog ; it does n't replace it .
A lens gives the surfer a window into a blog and into the world that surrounds it .
A lens does n't pretend to deliver the complete truth , any more than a blog does .
Instead , a lens says , " Here 's my take on what you need to know about this topic . "
The topic might be your favorite business books , or everything you know about bars in San Diego , or lists of reasons to support your local alderman .
The topic might be the lensmaster himself !
Where better for people to find out about you than on a page you build ?
A page that points to your résumé and your photos and your Flickr account and your current employer .
If you do n't claim your name , who will ?
The idea is simple : A lens provides meaning and the links necessary to take action on that meaning .
A lens is a guide .
Provide the meaning , and the surfer will go ahead and take the action .
Lenses are connected .
UNLIKE A BLOG , just about every single item in a lens is connected to something on the Web .
Lenses do n't hold content .
They point to content .
And like all good guides , they comment on what they point to .
So your lens can point to blogs or to predefined Yahoo ! searches or to a MapQuest map to your favorite restaurant .
Your lens can point to the weather report or to treasured books on Amazon or to your wedding
pictures on Flickr .
A lens is n't filled with content .
It points to content .
And your lens also points to other lenses .
Lenses on similar topics .
Lenses by people you know and trust .
Lenses that are highly rated by Web surfers , and lenses that a lot of other people have linked to .
A lens does n't work unless a Web surfer can find it when she needs it .
And a lens does n't work unless it 's easy to build and even easier to maintain .
Squidoo lets lensmasters build lenses quickly .
Then it connects those lenses to other relevant lenses and provides a search engine to make it easy for any Web surfer to find the right lens at the right time .
Make it pay .
THE BENEFITS OF A LENS include :
Lenses are free .
A royalty payment .
Royalties are earned from all the keyword clicks , affiliate income , and referral fees the lenses generate .

MAKE NO MISTAKE .
You can build your own lens , right now .
You do n't need help from me or from Squidoo .
You do n't need permission from anyone .
You can hire a designer , get some hosting , and build a page .
That page can have ads from Google or Yahoo !
or someone else , so you can make money if you need to pay the overhead .
Your page can have links to sites you like .
It can aggregate RSS feeds or feature searches you 've done on your chosen topic .
Once you build a lens , you can compute how much you 're making on the average visitor .
Or you can discover how good a job you 're doing in teaching people what you were hoping to teach them .
And once you discover that , you can invest money in buying AdWord traffic or doing other sorts of promotions to get visitors to your lens .
There are lenses all over the Web .
They 're not very well organized , though .
And they are hard to find and they 're not very well linked .
And they cost too much to build .
And we need more of them .
You can build your lens .
And of course , you could have built one yesterday , but you did n't .
You did n't because it 's
too much of a hassle and because it would n't have been worth the trouble .
It would be great if someone would make it easier . "

Robotics vs. Helotics
( Will Japan be the mid-21st century superpower ? )
by John Derbyshire ( July 2006 )
Let ’s start this month ’s column with a movie .
If your PC and internet connection are happy to play a moderate - sized video , here is the movie .
If not , I ’ll just tell you that the star of this movie is a gadget named Robomow ** , made by Friendly Robotics , a firm based in Kadima , Israel , founded by two former F - 16 pilots for the Israeli Air Force .
Robomow is a robot lawnmower .
It labors away day and night keeping your grass neat and short .
When its battery gets low , it heads to the recharger and plugs itself in .
When fully recharged , it unplugs itself and continues its task .
Household robots of this kind have been around for some years , of course .
Friendly Robotics was founded in 1995 , and even that makes them five years younger than iRobot , manufacturers of the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner , the most successful domestic robot so far .
Roomba has been selling well in the U.S. for four years now , with over two million units shipped .
Robots for industrial and military uses go back further .
Production - line factory workers began losing their jobs to welding and assembling robots in the late 1970s , and the Wheelbarrow robot began saving the lives of bomb disposal specialists half a decade before that .
Further back yet go the robots of our imagination , through the tales of Isaac Asimov that enlivened my own childhood , via Karel Capek ’s 1921 story “ R.U.R. , ” which actually gave us the word “ robot , ” to the 16th - century golem legends of Central Europe .
Announcements that we are approaching some technical turning - point or other are always hazardous .
That the capabilities of robots have not , in a third of a century , advanced much from spot welding and grass cutting , might suggest that getting machines to perform any really complicated physical tasks is extremely difficult .
So it is , especially if you want some reliability and safety in the performance .
Technological progress rarely goes at a steady pace , though .
It has its spurts and leaps , generally driven by force of necessity , and there are signs that the advance of robotics may be about to speed up dramatically .
Another third of a century from now , Robomow and the Roomba ( and its pal the Scoomba , which will mop your kitchen floor for you ) may look as quaintly primitive as the wire - and - canvas biplanes of WW1 looked to the jet pilots of 1950 .
Necessity , well - known as the mother of invention , may be about to go into labor .
* * * * *
The force of necessity in this case will be — in fact , as we shall see in a moment , already is — the Great Demographic Plunge .
Modernity has now seeped into all but the most remote and tradition - bound societies of the world , one result being that few women anywhere are willing to comply with the old one - pregnancy - a - year pattern of procreation .
Fertility rates are going off a cliff .
This is true everywhere , though the mathematics of demography means that the effect in actual population numbers can take a while to work through .
Population can swell even as fertility declines , because babies born during the higher - fertility period take twenty years to join the fertile population .
Still , fertility rates win in the end , and they are dropping world - wide .
Mexico , which was averaging seven births per family in the 1970s , is now down to just over two .
Even the Middle East has declining fertility , with 1970 vs. 2005 fertility rates of 6.6 vs. 2.9 for Egypt , 6.8 vs. 1.8 for Iran , 7.3 vs. 4.0 for Saudi Arabia , and so on .
Some nations will go off the demographic cliff before others , of course .
You can make a case that the still - increasing populations of regions like the Middle East and Indonesia are demographic threats to the now - or - soon - declining populations of regions like Europe and northeast Asia .
No right - wing ranter can get through a column nowadays without at least a passing whine about Our Demographic Deficit : not Mark Steyn , not the War Nerd , not me .
Perhaps we make too much of this .
Certainly there are other factors in play .
Military clashes , let alone civilizational ones , are rarely decided by demography alone .
The Sweden of Charles XII had only one tenth the population of Peter the Great ’s Russia , yet Charles gave Peter a run for his money , and his kingdom was not overwhelmed even when Peter triumphed at last .
Sweden is still with us , for better or worse ( see below ) .
The steppe nomads who terrorized medieval Europe , and stole entire regions from it , were demographically far inferior to their victims .
Even more sensationally , early - Victorian Britain , pop. 25 m , easily trounced late - Qing China , pop. 350 m , in the Opium Wars , in spite of being handicapped by 8,000 - mile - long lines of communication .
One important factor in the last two of those encounters was decadence on the part of Byzantium and China , respectively — a sort of civilizational tiredness , and the complacency induced by too much gazing backwards at a long and glittering history .
That is what we conservatives worry about when we contemplate Europe ’s position vis-à - vis the Moslem world .
Whether the Europe of today is really as far gone in decadence as 11th - century Byzantium or 19th - century China is a matter of opinion .
So , for that matter , is the question of whether the Islamia of today really has the gut - busting vitality of those bumptious Seljuk Turks and Victorian Britons .
The example of the Opium Wars , at any rate , suggests a possible rule for figuring out which nation is likely to become Top Dog in any historical epoch .
Britain was able to do to China what she did , and to then dominate the 19th century , by virtue of having been the first nation to accomplish an industrial revolution .
Assuming that all nations were bound to have industrial revolutions sooner or later , there was a huge prize waiting for the nation that had it first — even if that nation was one of modest population and inconvenient location , like Britain .
Since demographic collapse seems as inevitable a feature of the 21st century as industrialization was of the 19th , it may be that the nation that dominates the coming era will be the one that gets through that inevitable demographic transformation first , and comes out the other side .
Which nation will that be ?
* * * * *
Japan was the first important nation to go over the fertility - rate cliff , passing downward through replacement level — 2.1 children per woman — in 1960 , to a present 1.3 .
The actual population of Japan began to decline last year .
The Japanese are falling into the demographic black hole ahead of the rest of us .
This is a topic of endless worried discussion in Japan .
The government there has tried to encourage women to have more children , so far without any noticeable effect .
If you read much political commentary , you will be familiar with all the gloomy predictions about the impact of aging , graying populations on current economies and welfare systems .
However , if it is really the case that every other nation will face this issue in the coming decades , then the Japanese are , in a sense , ahead of the game .
They may be dropping into a demographic black hole ; but there are physicists who argue that falling into a black hole does not mean utter annihilation — that , in fact , you may pass right through the black hole and out into another place ***.
If that ’s right , the Japanese will get to that place , and adjust to it , ahead of the rest of us .
What form will the adjustment take ?
There are all kinds of speculations .
Longer working lives seem to be inevitable , with much less indulgence of the old .
The word “ old ” itself will change meaning , very likely with the help of pharmacological perk - up aids to mind and body .
Our grandchildren may think of 45 as young and 70 as middle - aged .
The health fanatics ’ slogan “ Live long , die fast ” may come to represent the norm — no bad thing , in my opinion .
And then there will be robotics .
With a shortage of young hands willing to do low - paid physical chores , the robots will come into their own .
The Japanese are definitely ahead of the game here , with the South Koreans ( whose fertility rate is even a tad lower than Japan ’s ) close behind .
“ Japanese industrial firms are racing to build humanoid robots as domestic helpers for the elderly , and South Korea has set a goal that 100 % of households should have domestic robots by 2020 . ”
That ’s from a report in the June 10th Economist .
The Europeans are waking up to robotics , too , with a series of European Robotics Symposiums started up this year .
The first symposium was held in Palermo , Sicily , in March .
One of the participants , Dr. Henrik Christensen of Sweden ( I told you we ’d get back to Sweden ) , got my attention , and a paragraph in National Review ’s “ The Week , ” with his claim that robot sex partners are in our near future .
As Dr. Christensen says : “ People are willing to have sex with inflatable dolls , so initially anything that moves will be an improvement . ”
( I had better warn readers that if you raise the topic of robotic sex in a room full of married American males , you will be greeted with many anguished cries of : “ Been doing it for years ! ” Ladies should not take offense .
This is just a harmless and very common male way of venting about the general frustrations of married life .
Some years ago a business colleague of mine , whom I knew to have been very happily married for over twenty years , had some major work done on his property , work that required shutting off the power for several hours .
The contractor suggested that the homeowner might want to give a thought to the food in his freezer , perhaps transferring it to a neighbor ’s freezer .
“ Nah , ” replied my colleague , “ I ’ll just put the wife to bed and pack the food around her . ” )
Sexbots illustrate the ethical issues we shall come up against with robotics .
What , for example , would be the ethics of selling child - sized robots to pedophiles , or four - legged robots to zoophiles ?
And while I can’t imagine that any male has ever got into a life - threatening situation with an inflatable sex toy , women might be more vulnerable .
Remember Jane Fonda and the Orgasmotron .
* * * * *
Japan might , therefore , be on track to become the superpower of the mid-21st century , having by then put behind her problems the rest of us will still be struggling with .
It is no use arguing that a superpower needs big armies , which an older , grayer population wo n’t be able to supply .
Military affairs are roboticizable too****.
It would be nice to think that we , the U.S.A. , will be up there with the Japanese and Koreans , winning the technological game .
Unfortunately we do not feel the pressure of necessity as keenly as the East Asians do .
One reason is that our fertility rate has not dropped as dramatically low as theirs .
Another is that our attitude to immigration is much more generous than theirs .
Actually these two reasons are one , because while native American fertility is now below replacement level , the fertility rate of legal immigrants is about a third higher , and that of illegal immigrants higher yet .
Immigration into Japan and South Korea is essentially nil .
This is not because nobody wants to go and live in those countries — several hundred million Chinese , Filipinos , and Indonesians would love to — but because the Japanese and Koreans do n’t think immigration would be good for their countries .
They prefer robots over helots .
We might ask ourselves whether that preference might not , in the long run , prove to be a wise one .
Our fathers mowed their own lawns .
We hire gangs of helots — illegal immigrants — to mow our lawns .
Since the demographic crunch will dry up the supply of helot labor everywhere , our children , in their middle age , will likely have their lawns mowed by some descendant of Robomow .
The East Asians , however , with their aversion to cheap immigrant labor , and their fascination with robotics , will have got there long before us .
With the demographic transition behind them , and , one assumes , their economic inefficiencies long since corrected , they will be sailing under clear skies through the mid-21st century , while we are still fighting our way through demographic gales .
-------------------------------------------------------
** The promotional material also calls the gadget “ RoboMower , ” I do n’t know why .
***
There need to be some very special conditions here — your black hole needs to be rotating , for instance — and even then the physics is n’t conclusive .
There is also the drawback that the entire process , seen from the outside , may require an infinite amount of time .
But heck , I ’m just making a loose analogy .
****
Though we had better take care not to end up in the situation of the humans in Philip K. Dick ’s story “ The Defenders , ” who retreat to underground caves when the earth is devastated by a long war , leaving robots on the surface to continue the war .
The robots keep sending down film reports of tremendous battles and huge destruction wrought upon the enemy by the new weapons the humans spend all their time inventing .
After several decades without either side looking like winning the war , a party of men gets up to ground level .
They find that the robots , having called off hostilities the moment the last hatch was sealed , and agreeing that mankind could never be trusted not to start things again , have been spending their time faking their reports as interestingly as possible .

The World ’s smallest one person helicopter
by Dhiram Shah
Sean Connery using a Jet Pack to escape from the bad guys in the 007 flick “ Thunderball ” was cool , after seeing something like that everyone of us must have thought if only … .
Here is a more practical and comfortable alternative , the GEN H - 4 from Gene corporation – Japan is your personal helicopter .
It comes with a seat and landing gear so all you have to do is strap on and you are ready to go .
Unlike traditional helicopters it has 2 sets of coaxial , contra- rotating rotors ( KA - 52 Hokum for all you military buffs ) which eliminates the need of a tail rotor for balancing .
The rotors have a length of only 4 meters ( 118 inches ) so no parking problems too .
It is powered by 4 lightweight 125 cc 2 cylinder engines which use standard gasoline .
The GEN H - 4 can fly to a maximum altitude of 1000 meters at a top speed of 90 km / hr ( 59 mph ) for upto 30 minutes .
You dont require a license to fly the GEN H - 4 in Japan and the inventors claim it is easy as riding a bicycle and with just 2 hours of practice you can master it .
The controls also resemble a bicycle handle .
( Images and Video after the jump )
You dont get the GEN H - 4 as a ready unit , Gene corp is selling it as assembly kits .
It is available in Japan for 3,780,000 Yen ( $ 32,500 ) .

Children are still advised not to use mobile phones unless necessary
The study of 2,782 people across the UK found no link between the risk of glioma - the most common type of brain tumour - and length of mobile use .
Among cancer sufferers the tumours were more likely to be reported on the side of the head where they held the phone .
But the British Medical Journal study said people over - reported phone use on the side their cancer developed .
The research , which was carried out by the British arm of an international project called Interphone , reiterates the findings of most earlier studies in saying that there is no connection between cancer and mobile phone use .
These results are reassuring for everyone with a mobile
Dr Kat Arney
Cancer Research UK
The team of researchers , involving scientists from Leeds University , the Institute of Cancer Research and the University of Nottingham , spoke to 966 people diagnosed with glioma and 1,716 without the condition in five areas of the UK .
All 2,783 were interviewed about their history of mobile phone use over the previous 10 years .
They were asked to recall in detail how much they used their mobile phones , how often they used hands - free kits and what types of phones they had used .
' Biased reporting '
Research author Professor Patricia McKinney , Professor of Paediatric Epidemiology at the Leeds University , said : " For regular mobile phone users , there was no increased risk of developing a glioma associated with mobile phone use . "
She acknowledged that there appeared to be an increased risk among brain cancer sufferers on the side of the head where they held the phone .
MOBILE PHONE FACTS
Available in the UK since 1985 Widely used since late 1990s Now estimated to be owned by more than 40 m
Britons , including many children
Most studies have found no raised risk of brain tumour
But long - term effects still not known Children still advised to use mobiles only when necessary
The team , however , did not put this down to a causal link , because almost exactly the same decreased risk was seen on the other side of the head , leaving no overall increase risk of tumours for mobile phone users .
Instead , they blamed biased reporting from brain tumour sufferers who knew what side of the head their tumours were on .
Another research team member , Professor Anthony Swerdlow of the Institute of Cancer Research , said : " It would be very misleading to the public to say that because there was a positive that this ( mobile phones ) causes brain tumours . "
He explained : " If we had found a raised risk overall and it was all coming from one side , I would believe there was a real case .
" But as there is a drop on the opposing side - the overall risk is not raised .
" That makes it rather unlikely that there is a raised risk . "
But he added that epidemiological studies could never show there was no risk of an activity , they could only suggest there was no raised risk .
' Growing evidence '
The Health Protection Agency said the research was good news , but that it did not give mobile phones a clean bill of health .
The board said it would not be changing its advice that children should not make unnecessary mobile phone calls .
Dr Kat Arney , science information officer at Cancer Research UK , said research such as this was vital for getting to the environmental causes of cancer .
" This is the biggest and most thorough study into mobile phones and glioma so far , and it adds to the growing evidence that there is no link .
" Although we still do n't know about the very long - term effects of phone use , these results are reassuring for everyone with a mobile . "
Further research
Wendy Fulcher , who founded ther Brain Tumour Research Campaign , said she hoped people would be finally reassured by the results of the research .
She added : " In relation to other cancers , brain tumours are the poor relation when it comes to research funding .
" There should be more money focused on the root causes of brain tumours . "
Alasdair Philips , director of campaign group Powerwatch , says the study " does n't really prove anything " .
" I think they should have waited another couple of years and recruited more people with brain tumours so they could have interviewed them , because the trouble was they went back a few years and the people had died .
" If you get a grade four glioma you can die within a year or 18 months of it being diagnosed , and these people are just gone , so they could n't get their mobile phone history . "

While still in high school ( and a few months of casual C++ ) , I bought the GoF book because the comments on Amazon said I should .
I barely knew how to design a class , forget groking the whole polymorphic thing .
I put the book on a shelf , not picking it up until my first year in College .
Reading and comprehending it for the first time was a mind - altering experience .
It is one of the few non-religious books that becomes more meaningful each time it is read .

Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said this afternoon that he was disappointed with the decision , and that while the stay is in place “ we will continue to utilize the program to ensure that America is safer . ”
Mr. Gonzales said he remained confident that the program was constitutional , and that Congress had given the president all the authority he needed when it authorized the use of military force after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Earlier , the Justice Department called the surveillance program “ a critical tool ” against Al Qaeda and said the parties to the suit have agreed to a stay of Judge Taylor ’s order until the Sept. 7 hearing .
On that day , the judge will be asked to prolong the stay of her order pending further appeals , to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit or perhaps to the Supreme Court .
Some Republicans voiced disappointment over the ruling , while Democrats praised it .
The starkly different reactions signaled more heated debate on Capitol Hill when Congress reconvenes .
But for the moment , the ruling by Judge Taylor caused elation among the plaintiffs .
“ It ’s another nail in the coffin of executive unilateralism , ” said Jameel Jaffer , a lawyer for the plaintiffs with the A.C.L.U. And Anthony Romero , executive director of the A.C.L.U. , said Judge Taylor ’s ruling “ confirms that the government has been acting illegally , in contravention of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Fourth Amendment . ’’
The surveillance act was passed by Congress in 1978 in response to disclosures of previous government improprieties in eavesdropping .
The act established a secret court to handle applications for surveillance operations , and set up procedures for them to take place while applications for warrants are pending in some limited circumstances and for limited times .
Judge Taylor said “ the president has acted , undisputedly , as F.I.S.A. forbids , ” thus defying the express will of Congress , and she was unpersuaded by the government ’s stance that it could not defend itself in the lawsuit without doing the country harm .
America
Online last month said it would rebrand as simply AOL
It is closing its Jacksonville , Florida centre and making further cuts in Ogden , Utah and Tucson , Arizona .
The volume of calls to its centres has halved since 2004 , AOL said .
Customers have become more internet " savvy " and had better tools to resolve their own technical problems , said spokesman Nicholas Graham .
" That 's a remarkable success in terms of customer care , " he said .
" It requires us to balance our work force . "
Rebranded
The number of callers has also slipped because subscriptions are on the slide .
AOL had 26.7 million customers in September 2002 , but this had fallen by more than 25 % by last December .
It is offering more features on its free website to try and tempt users and advertisers .
The job cuts amount to about 7 % of its global workforce .
It follows 700 posts being lost in the final quarter of last year when a call centre in Orlando was closed .
AOL started out in 1985 as Quantum Computer Services and began offering an internet service four years later .
The company changed its name to America Online in 1991 .
Last month it announced it was to move away from the America Online name altogether and rebrand as AOL .
AOL merged with Time Warner in 2001 to create AOL Time Warner , but when the tech bubble deflated , the company renamed itself as Time Warner .
Through its European operation AOL Europe , the company serves about 6 million customers in Britain , France and Germany .
There ’s this dance that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists do when it comes time to negotiate the economic terms of an investment .
And it all revolves around valuation .
The question is what is the fair value of the business ?
This supposedly establishes how much of the company the venture capitalists will own for their investment .
But I think the concept of valuation is often misunderstood by the people engaged in this process .
And it ’s particularly true in early stage investing .
I do not believe that negotiating a valuation on an early stage venture investment has much to do with the current value of the business .
If it did , why would a venture capitalist agree to a $ 10 million value for a business that will lose money for the next 2 - 4 years and has little , if any , revenue ?
The fact is that almost all venture capital deals are done as convertible preferred stock investments .
That means that the money we invest is more like a debt instrument in the event the business does n’t work out very well .
We get our money out before the entrepreneurs do if the deal goes sideways or down .
It ’s only in the event that the deal works out that the percentage of the business ( the thing that valuation is supposed to determine ) matters in terms of how much money we make .
Another important factor to consider is that only a relatively small portion of early stage venture investments really work out in the way they were supposed to when the investment was made .
In my experience , which is based on 17 years in the business and over 100 different early stage investments over that time period , there is a 1/3 rule .
The 1/3 rule goes as follows :
1/3 of the deals really work out the way you thought they would and produce great gains .
These gains are often in the 5 - 10 x range .
The entrepreneurs generally do very well on these deals .
1/3 of the deals end up going mostly sideways .
They turn into businesses , but not businesses that can produce significant gains .
The gains on these deals are in the range of 1 - 2 x and the venture capitalists get most to all of the money generated in these deals .
1/3 of the deals turn out badly .
They are shut down or sold for less than the money invested .
In these deals the venture capitalists get all the money even though it is n’t much .
So if you take the 1/3 rule and add to it the typical structure of a venture capital deal , you ’ll quickly see that the venture capitalist is not really negotiating a value at all .
We are negotiating how much of the upside we are going to in the 1/3 of our deals that actually produce real gains .
Our deal structure provides most of the downside protection that protects our capital .
I think it is much better to think of a venture capital deal as a loan plus an option .
The loan will be repaid on 2/3 of our investments and partially repaid on some of the rest .
The option comes into play in a big way on something like 1/3 of our investments and probably no more than half of all of our investments .
There is more to this whole issue of valuation because there are often follow - on rounds where the deal between the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs gets renegotiated .
I ’ll save that for another post .
The Fisher Space Pen ( above ) was developed with private money , but soon became part of an urban legend involving an expensive NASA program .
( credit : Fisher Space Pen Co. )
The billion - dollar space pen Everybody has heard of the infamous Space Pen .
Space has its urban legends of course , and the Million Dollar Space Pen is one of the more enduring ones .
It is neither as outlandish nor as unbelievable as the story about faking the Moon landings , and even though it seems more credible than a massive government conspiracy , it is probable that fewer people have heard it .
The story goes like this : in the 1960s , NASA astronauts discovered that their pens did not work in zero gravity .
So like good engineers , they went to work and designed a wonder pen .
It worked upside down .
It worked in vacuum .
It worked in zero gravity .
It even worked underwater !
And it only cost a million dollars !
The crafty Russians used a pencil .
This story , like most modern urban legends , has proliferated on the Internet , but it has also been passed by word of mouth .
I ’ve even heard a well - known space historian tell the story while talking about his new book , getting the expected laugh from his audience when he held up a Number 2 pencil for the punchline .
And , of course , the story has also been embellished , with the cost of the writing device getting ever higher , from a million dollars to a hundred million dollars to a billion dollars in some variations .
Undoubtedly at some point the cost will equal the mythical trillion - dollar price of a mission to Mars .
The story of the space pen actually begins with a very expensive pencil .
Urban legends survive because they serve a social purpose .
The classic ones , like the guy with the hook who kills the couple in the woods , reinforce morality lessons like do n’t park in the woods to have sex .
The Million Dollar Space Pen myth reinforces several particular stereotypes , such as the NASA “ nerdgineers ” who like to redesign the wheel , and the government bureaucrats who waste money on stupid things .
Another common stereotype is the crude but practical Russians who lack flash , but still get the job done .
Those stereotypes and themes live on in many ways , such as claims that NASA is incessantly hidebound and bureaucratic , whereas the Russians are simplistic and cheap , but practical .
There is some truth to these stereotypes , but naturally the reality is much more complicated and nuanced .
As for the Million Dollar Space Pen , the story actually begins with a very expensive pencil .
Gemini and the space pencil On March 23 , 1965 the spaceship Molly Brown ( otherwise known as Gemini Titan 3 ) lifted off from Cape Canaveral on a mission that lasted shortly under five hours .
Gus Grissom and John Young were onboard .
The flight earned a bit of notoriety soon after it ended when the astronauts were at a press conference and were asked about a “ contraband ” baloney sandwich ( some sources claim it was a roast beef sandwich ) that Young had carried aboard the flight in lieu of the officially approved food that they had been provided .
Although the controversy might seem silly at first , it had more serious undertones because of the concern that the astronauts might have concocted it as a stunt .
At the time , the astronauts had an exclusive deal with Life magazine , and reporters and members of Congress speculated that the astronauts were prone to smuggle items or engage in media stunts that they would only reveal in their magazine stories .
Another issue was that the flight surgeon had not approved the sandwich and was concerned about it because of possible crumbs , and the fact that it was two days old .
This , however , was actually the second controversy about the flight .
Earlier in the month , several newspapers reported that the mission would carry two pencils that cost $ 128.84 apiece .
NASA had spent $ 4,382.50 to purchase 34 of the pencils .
Members of the public were outraged at NASA ’s profligate spending and naturally they demanded answers from their congressmen .
Exactly two years to the day before the flight , Congressman John Wydler , of the Fourth District in New York and a member of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics , wrote a letter to NASA Administrator James Webb ( PDF , 1.3 MB ) asking for a full investigation of the expensive pencils and an explanation why their high costs were justified .
NASA received other letters as well , such as one from the President of Elgin School Supply Company of San Francisco .
NASA officials then had to explain to Congress and people like the president of the Elgin School Supply Company that the pencils were made of lightweight , high strength materials that could be attached to the inside of the spacecraft .
The pencil housings had been expanded so that the astronauts could use them while wearing their bulky spacesuit gloves .
The writing mechanism inside the housing had been procured from a local office supply house and had cost $ 1.75 each .
But the most sensitive items carried aboard Molly Brown were … four Pentel pencils with a total cost of $ 0.49 .
Deke Slayton “ was instructed to take every precaution in preventing this item from becoming public , ” wrote an investigator after the fact .
The flap over the pencils , combined with the controversy over the sandwich , resulted in an investigation by NASA into what objects were carried aboard the spacecraft and why .
The investigation revealed that in addition to the sandwich , the astronauts carried an American flag ( flown with management approval ) , a diamond ring owned by Grissom , Florentine crosses of Saint Gemini that had been sent by someone in Italy to the astronauts — and a brassiere ( hopefully not worn by one of the astronauts ) .
The astronauts were cautioned by Deke Slayton about “ such antics in the future . ”
But the most sensitive items carried aboard Molly Brown were … four Pentel pencils with a total cost of $ 0.49 .
Deke Slayton “ was instructed to take every precaution in preventing this item from becoming public , ” wrote an investigator after the fact ( PDF , 0.2 MB ) .
It is easy to understand why : when Congress and the public were outraged about the expensive $ 129 mechanical pencils , they would be even madder to learn that regular ( and Japanese ! ) pencils were carried as well .
The public and congressional complaints about the high costs of something as simple as a pencil are not that unusual .
Every few years some mini-scandal breaks out when somebody reveals the high cost that the government pays for what seems like a simple object such as a hammer or a coffee machine for an airplane .
The reason is that the object is recognizable .
Few people understand what a spacecraft solar panel or a gyroscope should cost , and thus will have no idea if the taxpayer is being cheated by an unscrupulous contractor .
But what they also do not understand is that in many cases quite ordinary devices can be expensive when they have to be redesigned for special conditions , particularly when they are manufactured in small numbers .
Ordinary objects are cheap primarily when they are produced in massive numbers , but when a government agency needs only a few dozen of them designed to unique specifications , they then become specialty objects .
The Fisher Space Pen Several years after the Molly Brown flight , and after NASA instituted much stricter rules carrying personal items aboard spacecraft , the curse of the writing instruments arose once again .
In the mid-1960s Paul Fisher of the Fisher Pen Company developed the Space Pen .
He did this on his own , without prompting by NASA and without NASA money .
What he did want from NASA was publicity , and to this end he managed to get his congressman to insert a promotional history of his Space Pen into the Congressional Record in March 1966 .
Fisher then contacted NASA and sought their review of promotional literature about the Space Pen .
A NASA official evaluated the advertising copy for the Space Pen and noted that the company “ is not now and has never been under contract to NASA – [ Manned Spacecraft Center ] for the supply of any writing instrument to be used in a manned spacecraft . ”
However , a different Fisher pen , known as the AG - 7 pen , was under consideration for carrying aboard American spacecraft .
What various documents about the Space Pen demonstrate is that NASA did not develop the Space Pen and initially did not even purchase it .
Over two months after Fisher first contacted NASA , the space agency replied and disapproved his advertising , ( PDF , 0.6 MB ) which the agency called “ quite misleading . ”
NASA ’s procurement office was at the time purchasing Fisher ’s AG - 7 pens at a cost of $ 4 apiece ( still a significant amount of money in 1967 ) , and was not buying the Space Pen , which cost $ 1.98 .
What various documents about the Space Pen demonstrate is that NASA did not develop the Space Pen and initially did not even purchase it .
We do not know how much Fisher Pen spent to develop the Space Pen , but it was private money , not government money .
To Fisher ’s credit , his company produced a good pen .
Within a few years NASA was indeed buying the Space Pen , which NASA called the “ Data Recording Pen ” , ( PDF , 0.2 MB ) in several “ configurations ” designated - 204 , - 207 and - 208 .
The pen was carried aboard Apollo and Skylab missions .
At that point , Fisher could honestly claim that the Space Pen flew in space and was used by American astronauts .
Naturally , that became a key part of Fisher ’s advertising campaign .
The myth of the wasteful bureaucracy The Million Dollar Space Pen Myth is just that , a myth .
The pens never cost a lot of money and were not developed by wasteful bureaucrats or overactive NASA engineers .
The real story of the Space Pen is less interesting than the myth , but in many ways more inspiring .
It is not a story of NASA bureaucrats versus simplistic Russians , but a story of a clever capitalist who built a superior product and conducted some innovative marketing .
That story , however , is a little harder to sell to a public that believes what it wants to believe .

a case study in the illusions of blogging
yesterday i did some minor maintenance on my technorati account .
i logged in to change a couple of tags around to better fit the site ’s content as it has shaped up in the last year .
we do evolve after all .
while there i could n’t resist the urge to click each tag and see where i stood in the technoratic scheme of things .
the results were kind of funny and got me thinking , yet again , about the realities of blogging as compared to the number - driven illusions and mutually reinforcing delusions .
consider the following a sort of case study in the illusions of blogging .
so - technorati , the popular ranking / tracking / tagging service which many of us bloggers look to for some insight into our place in the blogoshpere , allows each blog 20 overarching tags with which to sum up general slant and content .
each of those 20 tags can be used to search out similar content and serves to place each blog in thematic relation to all the millions of others .
the following rankings are by tags which i’ve chosen to sum up the nonist and were taken from technorati yesterday -
first lets get a chunk of the data out of the way in one swoop .
for each of the following headings the nonist is ranked as the # 1 result :
fiction
humanism
ideas
observations
skeptic
belief
i must say that i find this fairly disconcerting .
this means that overall the nonist is the top ranking blog for over a quarter of the 20 tags i’ve chosen to reflect it .
if you look closely at the tags you ’ll see that most are fairly broad , but i have to ask myself is the nonist really an appropriate choice to represent fiction , humanism , or skepticism in technorati ’s cosmos ?
i try to write a bit of fiction each week , i believe whole heartedly in humanism , and am rather skeptical in general , but i have to believe there are sites with a more focussed viewpoint which people searching for said subjects deserve to see first .
the following results perhaps illustrate this more clearly :
philosophy :
1. tcs daily
2. the nonist
history :
1. Informed Comment
2. urban legends about.com
3. the nonist
books :
1. blogcritics.org
2. pop matters
3. neil gaiman
4. professor brainbridge
5. the nonist
well … certainly i’m interested in looking at most of my chosen content in a philosophical way , i post many items of historical interest i suppose , and i refer to , quote from , and scan books often , but in all these cases the inclusion of the nonist seems somewhat misleading no ?
here ’s another good example -
arts :
1. the new york review of books
2. the nonist
3. bldgblog
now take that in for a moment .
the nonist ranks just below the n.y review of books , which makes sense , but above bldgblog which seems wrong .
i can go for days without mentioning the arts at all where as bldgblog is well focussed .
the pattern of illusion begins to be evident .
now look at these -
design :
1. kottke.org
12 . the nonist
17 . design observer
writing :
3. neil gaiman
6. the nonist
16 . words for my enjoyment
25 . double tongued word wrester
29 . if : book
and
science :
1. pharyngula
2. tcs daily
3. the nonist
4. science Blog
5. the panda ’s thumb
in the design category i think it ’s important to note where design observer falls .
to my mind design observer is the most sophisticated and enjoyable site out there focussed on design .
it ’s arguable whether kottke is actually strongly focussed on design and i can say for sure that the nonist , though design “ interested , ” is by no measure a blog “ about ” design .
( i do that evil shit all day and would rather not dwell on it . )
in the writing category you ’ll notice the crazy cross-section which all sit under it ’s umbrella .
gaiman who is a world renown author , double tongued word wrester which is a wonderful etymological site , if : book which is broadly focussed on the culture of books , and those other two .
now the nonist is at 6 and words for my enjoyment is 16 even though pauly offers a new piece of creative writing every single day without fail ( he ’s a professional writer after all ) and has a very lively readership which masses 25 - 35 comments regularly on every post .
meanwhile the posts here which i would characterize as “ writing proper ” are consistently the least commented upon .
this tells me our readers do not necessarily come here for writing .
in the science category i can’t help but just laugh .
pharyngula , science blog , and panda ’s thumb , must cringe whenever they see this site ’s inclusion among them .
they are admirable , serious , sites with a proper science pedigree , where as i manipulate photo’s of darwin , prattle on about space , and post the blurbs i find of interest in the sidebar .
how can i be wedged there between them ?!
i ’ll let you all in on a little secret now which goes a long way toward explaining things -
the nonist is highly ranked on the strength of no more than 3 or 4 extremely popular posts .
sure we have a home in many sidebars but not nearly as many as the numbers would seem to reveal .
the “ nonist public service pamphlet ” on blog depression has been , without question , the single biggest key to the sites wider dissemination .
but how many of those linking the pamphlet , or following links , have been return visitors ?
meanwhile our referrer logs continue , months and months on , to show a high concentration of links pointing toward “ the erotic coloring book ” and “ making love in 1975 . ” of all the nuggets unearthed and all the original content crafted the fact that these two silly posts continue to draw such a large share of attention , owing entirely to their quasi - sexual content , is , if i’m being honest , disheartening .
in essence this begs the question , how many of the 1,739 links pointing to the nonist represent an actual readership ?
also , does a blog with a handful of popular posts deserve to rank so high ?
and finally , is this method of putting blogs in perspective even remotely accurate in representing the actual blog landscape ?
to that last question i’d have to answer no .
at least not from my perspective .
take a look at the ranking for the following tag -
eclectic :
1. boing boing
2. the nonist
in my mind “ eclectic ” might be the single most accurate tag i use in my technorati account to sum up the nonist , it is nothing if not eclectic , so a ranking of number two on that tag is actually fairly gratifying .
searching “ eclectic ” and being given this result might lead one to draw corollaries however - “ ah boing boing is huge , the “ nonist ” must be comparable somehow … ”
but now take a look at those over all linking numbers -
1. boing boing .
over all - 67,731 links from 19,764 sites
2. the nonist .
over all - 1,739 links from 895 sites
not exactly comparable are they ?
in truth boing boing is the blogoshpere ’s version of a superpower where as the nonist is akin to a small pacific island whose indigenous peoples still wear loincloths and have never seen a porsche , which is to say almost totally unknown .
or let me put it into more topical terms - if boing boing were to start a preemptive war against another blog , at best the nonist might be listed among the “ coalition of the willing , ” not because we have an army , but because we donated a single bomb - sniffing mollusk to the effort .
now you might be thinking that i’m being unfairly ( or even insincerely ) self - deprecating with all this , but really i’m just trying to illustrate a point .
if services like technorati ( each blogger has his favored service ) are not in fact representative of the landscape and the numbers themselves do n’t really signify much concretely , then what is the purpose ?
or more specifically , why do bloggers watch over the rankings and numbers and referrer logs so closely ?
when the nonist was at it ’s ranking peak , somewhere around 400 overall on technorati , things were no different than they are today , when we have dropped down to around 800 ( and still falling ) .
the experience from my point of view was ( with the exception of a few months worth of higher hosting bills ) the same .
this precipitous rise and subsequent fall did not effect the site in any palpable way .
so why then do i continue to look at the numbers ?
why do i still check technorati each morning and my referrer logs a couple times each day ?
simple - because the illusion of accomplishment which the numbers provide is the only reflection of success or failure available to me .
i have no advertising on the site , so i can not gauge popularity or achievement by my ad - sense revenue .
i do not offer a specific product or service , the sale and popularity of which i could look to as a reflection of my efforts .
i have not as of yet tried to parlay the site ’s ( possible ) popularity into any other opportunities .
in short i do not have at my disposal any of the traditional measuring sticks with which to gauge accomplishment .
where as the creators of sites which , directly or indirectly , take in profits can look to them as a marker , i am obliged to look at traffic like a store owner who does not actually sell anything so instead reviews the security camera footage from above the front door a few times a day to be sure someone showed up .
services like technorati offer bloggers like me ( of which there are millions ) a point of reference , illusory though it may ultimately be .
these are not complaints , merely observations .
i could after all load up the site with ads .
that ’s my prerogative .
but i’ve chosen not to .
which brings me back to points i’ve touched on many times already , both satirically and sincerely .
why do we blog ?
what do we hope to accomplish ?
how will we know when we ’ve succeeded ?
i ’m willing to bet that the lion ’s share of those blogging right now have no idea why they blog .
having started out of curiosity they are now simply compelled .
if asked they might answer “ because it ’s fun ! ” though i’d have to retort that if the popularity of the “ blog depression pamphlet ” proved anything it ’s that blogging is not always fun .
it ’s work .
so again i ask , why do we blog ?
the highly successful “ superpowers ” of blogging likely do n’t ask the question anymore .
there ’s no need .
they probably do n’t bother to check their stats and referrers nearly as often either .
( can you imagine cory or mark over of boing boing waking up each morning and logging on to technorati to see if anyone has linked them ? haha. i can ’t. ) they have concrete evidence of their success which make the illusory popularity contest of technorati and similar services superfluous .
perhaps for the “ non-profits ” that is the ultimate badge of success - disinterest in rank .
for the rest of us though the illusion is all we have by way of external reward .
for me personally comments , emails , involvement , and conversation of any kind is the highest reward , but failing those at least i can see when someone in poland thought enough of a post to link it .
that ’s gratifying as well .
the act of compulsively looking to technorati proves i’m not quite a success .
on the other hand the numbers there seem to imply that neither is this enterprise unsuccessful .
of course i’m a realist , and the crazy tag rankings above which place us in with pharyngula , kottke , neil gaiman , the panda ’s thumb , the n.y review of books , and boing boing , actually diminish my pleasure a bit because i know that , appearances aside , we are not at that level of popularity .
we are in fact a small blog with a modest readership which can use all the help it can get .
which is to say those monoliths listed are not our peers , gratifying though the illusion may be .
lastly let me just leave you with this bit of tagging zen , take from it what you will -
as of yesterday technorati offered the following rankings :
truth
1. the brad blog
2. the nonist
lies
1. the nonist
It is not widely known that the Apollo 11 television broadcast from the moon was a high - quality transmission , far sharper than the blurry version relayed instantly to the world on that July day in 1969 .
Among those battling to unscramble the mystery is John Sarkissian , a CSIRO scientist stationed at Parkes for a decade .
" We are working on the assumption they still exist , " Mr Sarkissian told the Herald .
" Your guess is a good as mine as to where they are . "
Mr Sarkissian began researching the role of Parkes in Apollo 11's mission in 1997 , before the movie The Dish was made .
However , when he later contacted NASA colleagues to ask about the tapes , they could not be found .
" People may have thought ' we have tapes of the moon walk , we do n't need these ' , " said the scientist who hopes a new , intensive hunt will locate them .
If they can be found , he proposes making digitalised copies to treat the world to a very different view of history .
But the searchers may be running out of time .
The only known equipment on which the original analogue tapes can be decoded is at a Goddard centre set to close in October , raising fears that even if they are found before they deteriorate , copying them may be impossible .
" We want the public to see it the way the moon walk was meant to be seen , " Mr Sarkissian said .
" There will only ever be one first moon walk . "
Originally stored at Goddard , the tapes were moved in 1970 to the US National Archives .
No one knows why , but in 1984 about 700 boxes of space flight tapes there were returned to Goddard .
" We have the documents to say they were withdrawn , but no one knows exactly where they went , " Mr Sarkissian said .
Many people involved had retired or died .
Also among tapes feared missing are the original recordings of the other five Apollo moon landings .
The format used by the original pictures beamed from the moon was not compatible with commercial technology used by television networks .
So the images received at Parkes , and at tracking stations near Canberra and in California , were played on screens mounted in front of conventional television cameras .
" The quality of what you saw on TV at home was substantially degraded " in the process , Mr Sarkissian said , creating the ghostly images of Armstrong and Aldrin that strained the eyes of hundreds of millions of people watching around the world .
Even Polaroid photographs of the screen that showed the original images received by Parkes are significantly sharper than what the public saw .
While the technique looks primitive today , Mr Sarkissian said it was the best solution that 1969 technology offered .
Among the few who saw the original high - quality broadcast was David Cooke , a Parkes control room engineer in 1969 .
" I can still see the screen , " Mr Cook , 74 , said .
" I was amazed , the quality was fairly good . "
Hubble finds new moons , rings around Uranus A photo taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows previously known rings around Uranus .
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Space Programs Hubble Space Telescope or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) --
New images from the Hubble Space Telescope show the planet Uranus has two additional moons and two faint rings never observed before .
The new moons , which were named Mab and Cupid , bring the total number of satellites orbiting Uranus to 27 .
Astronomer Mark Showalter of the SETI Institute and his colleagues were not looking for new moons or rings when they submitted a proposal to take deep exposures of the planet with Hubble 's most advanced optical camera .
Rather , they planned to study the 11 previously known rings and several moons embedded within them .
Once they saw the new moons , they re-examined images that the Voyager 2 spacecraft took when it flew by Uranus in 1986 .
The two moons are clearly there , but no one recognized them at the time .
" The discoveries all came from Hubble , " Showalter said .
" The Voyager results came because it 's much easier to find something you are looking for . "
The Hubble images also confirmed the existence of another moon , Perdita , which was first identified in the Voyager 2 pictures but had eluded telescopes ever since .
Many moons of Uranus are named after characters in Shakespeare , and these new moons follow suit .
Mab is named for Queen Mab , who is the subject of a famous speech by the character Mercutio in " Romeo and Juliet . "
Cupid is best known as the Roman god of love , but he also turns up as a character in the lesser - known play " Timon of Athens . "
The name Perdita comes from the play " A Winter 's Tale . "
All three moons are very small .
Perdita is the largest , measuring about 16 miles across .
The moons are orbiting in the same vicinity as the newly discovered rings -- outside the previously known ring system but closer to the planet than the five largest moons .
" Sometimes you find things you are n't looking for , " Showalter said .
" No one thought this region of Uranus was very interesting . "
As it turns out , that region is turning out to be very interesting , because the orbits of the moons within it are chaotic .
The system is so unstable that Showalter thinks the moons will collide and smash each other to bits one day , though probably not for a million years or so .
The private , not - for - profit SETI Institute , whose major mission involves the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and the study of life in the universe , also has some involvement in other astronomical research projects .

Key Republican breaks with Bush on Mideast Nebraska 's Sen .
Hagel calls for immediate cease - fire Sen. Chuck Hagel , R - Nebraska , called the current crisis in the Mideast " madness . "
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Chuck Hagel Middle East Israel Lebanon or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Urging President Bush to turn all U.S. efforts toward " ending this madness , " a leading Republican senator Monday broke with the Bush administration and called for an immediate cease - fire in the Mideast .
" The sickening slaughter on both sides must end and it must end now , " Nebraska Sen .
Chuck Hagel said .
" President Bush must call for an immediate cease - fire .
This madness must stop . "
The Bush administration has refused to call for Israel to halt its attacks on southern Lebanon , joining Israel in insisting that Hezbollah fighters must be pushed back from the Israeli - Lebanese border .
President Bush Monday in a speech in Miami Beach , Florida , reiterated his call for a cease - fire in the Mideast only if it brought a " long - lasting peace " that addressed Iran and Syria 's support for Hezbollah , the Islamic militia that Israel is targeting .
( Full story ) Hagel said that refusal threatens to isolate the United States and Israel and harm chances of achieving a long - term peace in the region .
" How do we realistically believe that a continuation of the systematic destruction of an American friend -- the country and people of Lebanon -- is going to enhance America 's image and give us the trust and credibility to lead a lasting and sustained peace effort in the Middle East ? " asked Hagel , the No. 2 Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Calls for ' a statesman '
He called on Bush to name " a statesman of global stature " as his personal envoy to the region .
And he urged the administration to open direct talks with Hezbollah 's backers , Iran and Syria , both of which Washington also accuses of meddling in Iraq .
" Our relationship with Israel is special and historic , " he said .
" But it need not and can not be at the expense of our Arab and Muslim relationships .
That is an irresponsible and dangerous false choice . "
Bush was headed back to Washington after a fund - raising trip to Florida , and the White House had no immediate reaction to Hagel 's comments .
Like his frequent ally , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , Hagel is a possible GOP presidential candidate in 2008 and has been critical of the administration 's handling of Iraq .
But few members of Congress have broken ranks with the president over his handling of the Israel - Hezbollah conflict .
Calls for an end to the 20 - day conflict have increased since Israel 's bombing Sunday of the Lebanese town of Qana , which left at least 54 civilians dead .
Hagel said the Israeli campaign was " tearing Lebanon apart , " and the resulting civilian casualties and economic damage were weakening the country and bolstering support for Hezbollah , which the U.S. State Department considers a terrorist organization .
Hagel urged the administration to revive the Beirut Declaration of 2002 , authored by Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah , under which Arab countries would have recognized Israel 's right to exist .
Hagel said that declaration was " a starting point " toward a regional settlement , but the United States " squandered " it .
' Bogged down ' in Iraq ?
Meanwhile , the decorated Vietnam veteran said the United States " is bogged down in Iraq , " limiting U.S. diplomatic and military options .
Last week 's announcement that more than 3,000 more American troops were needed to reinforce Baghdad amid rising sectarian violence was " a dramatic setback , " he said .
He said the 3 - year - old war is wearing badly on the U.S. military , and that Iraq 's fledgling democracy needs to take over more of its security responsibilities from American troops .
" This is not about setting a timeline , " Hagel said .
" This is about understanding the implications of the forces of reality . "

People should wipe the hard drive before they give away their old PC Bank account details belonging to thousands of Britons are being sold in West Africa for less than £ 20 each , the BBC's Real Story programme has found .
It discovered that fraudsters in Nigeria were able to find internet banking data stored on recycled PCs sent from the UK to Africa .
The information can be found on a PC's hard disk , which is easy to access if the drive is not wiped before sending .
Anti-fraud expert Owen Roberts said simply deleting files was not enough .
It is surprising how easy it is to obtain documents people leave on their computers
Owen Roberts , CPP Group
Beating Nigeria 's scammers
Users should instead use a programme to wipe their hard drive before they sell or give away their PC , a process which over - writes what is already contained on the drive .
Alternatively , people should remove their hard drives before they give away their computers , he said .
' Surprisingly easy ' " It is surprising how easy it is to obtain documents people leave on their computers , " said Mr Roberts , who is head of identity fraud at CPP Group .
SAFE PC RECYCLING
If possible , remove hard drives from PCs before recycling Use commercial erasing software , Examples include McAfee QuickClean , Acronis Drive Cleanser or ISafeguard Freeware Sign - up for a recycling service run by your PC manufacturer Some hard drive manufacturers also offer separate recycling programs
BBC Webwise - Deleting hard drives Real Story found that second - hand computers from all over the developed world could be found in virtually every PC market in Nigeria 's commercial capital of Lagos .
It said that while there was a genuine market for second - hand PCs in West Africa , identity fraud was a real problem .
Many of the PCs it found on sale in Lagos had come from UK council recycling points .
People are still being urged to give away their old PCs , but only after they have wiped the hard drive - not just to remove any bank details but also other personal information such as home addresses .
The Information Commissioner 's Office , the UK government 's regulatory office dealing with data protection , said companies had a legal requirement to delete people 's personal information from their computers when it was no longer needed .
" It is essential that companies have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that personal records on computer hard drives are rendered unrecoverable when they dispose of computer equipment , " said Assistant Commissioner Phil Jones .
" Under the Data Protection Act companies have a duty to store personal information securely and delete it when it is no longer required . "
Real Story 's investigation into the risk of identity theft from old PCs is broadcast on BBC 1 at 19:30 on Monday , 14 August .

White House wo n't rule out presidential pardon for Libby
2005-11-09 04:00:00 PDT
Washington --
The White House refused Tuesday to rule out a presidential pardon for Lewis " Scooter " Libby , the former vice presidential aide indicted for allegedly obstructing a grand jury investigation into the White House unmasking of a secret CIA officer .
Presidential press secretary Scott McClellan left the door open for a possible pardon by President Bush after Sen. Harry Reid , D - Nev. , the Senate Democratic leader , and Rep. Nancy Pelosi , D - San Francisco , House Democratic leader , called for Bush to publicly rule out a step .
Libby , 55 , the former chief of staff and national security adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney who helped market the case for war in Iraq , faces as much as 30 years in prison and $ 1.25 million in fines if convicted on all five felony charges stemming from alleged efforts to impede a grand jury investigation into the unmasking of secret CIA agent Valerie Wilson , who also went by her maiden name , Valerie Plame .
Retired Ambassador Joseph Wilson has accused the White House of leaking his wife 's undercover identity to retaliate against his criticism of the Bush administration for using what he said was twisted intelligence about Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction in order to justify invading Iraq in 2003 .
McClellan , asked twice whether Bush would pledge not to pardon Libby , declined to discuss " an ongoing legal proceeding . "
" I 'm not going to speculate about any matters relating to it , " McClellan said , adding : " There is a legal proceeding that is going on relating to that individual .
Under our system , there is a presumption of innocence , and we 're not going to comment on it while it is continuing .
And I 'm not going to -- certainly not going to -- speculate about it as well . "

The ban was very unpopular with young Swazis
The girls have had to wear large woollen tassels as a sign of their chastity since 2001 .
The sex ban was imposed to fight the spread of HIV / Aids .
About 40 % of the population are HIV positive .
In 2001 , the king fined himself a cow for breaking the ban by marrying again , but he could choose another wife at the annual reed dance this weekend .
In the two - day ceremony bare - breasted girls will dance before the monarch .
King Mswati transgressed the ban when he took a 17 - year - old girl as his ninth wife just two months after imposing the sex ban in September 2001 , sparking unprecedented protests by Swazi women outside the royal palace .
Meanwhile , the health ministry has released new figures which show that 29 % of Swazis aged 15 - 19 are HIV positive .
For pregnant women , the figures were 42 % .
Ban enforced
" We are happy that we are through with this and I am very proud that I have been faithful to this rite , " said Ntombi Dlamini , 19 , as she threw away her tassels .
No official reason has been given about why the sex ban was ended a year early .
The BBC's Thulani Mthethwa in Swaziland says the ban was very unpopular with young Swazis .
King Mswati has been criticised for his lavish lifestyle
If propositioned by a man , the girls were supposed to throw the tassels outside his house and his family would have to pay a fine of a cow .
But many Swazis were unhappy that King Mswati 's daughters were rarely seen wearing the tassels .
But our correspondent says that in rural areas , the tassels were common because the ban was enforced by local chiefs and some schools insisted that girls wore them to get a place .
King Mswati now has 12 wives and another fiancee .
His late father , King Sobhuza II , who led the country to independence in 1968 , had more than 70 wives when he died in 1982 .
I reported the other day that your cell phone records are on sale online for anyone to buy , without your permission .
Well , this morning AMERICAblog bought former presidential candidate , and former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO ( SACEUR ) , General Wesley Clark 's cell phone records for one hundred calls made over three days in November 2005 , no questions asked .
( Clark 's cell phone provider is Omnipoint Communications , which seems to be related to T - Mobile . )
All we needed was General Clark 's cell phone number and our credit card , and 24 hours later we had one hundred calls the general made on his cell phone in November .
The calls included a number of calls to Arkansas , to foreign countries , and at least one call to a prominent reporter at the Washington Post .
To ensure that we actually had General Clark 's correct cell phone number , we called the number this morning and the voice mail recording that answered said :
" Hi , this is Wes Clark , leave a message [ unintelligible ] . "
We have subsequently called that number and spoken to a real person to confirm its authenticity , and to make sure General Clark was aware of this issue and what we were doing .
This is clearly outrageous .
But let me first say , as an aside , that I bought my own Cingular Wireless phone records this past weekend and reported on it on AMERICAblog .
I would n't do this to any other public person without first doing it to myself .
But even after reporting on this gross violation of my ( and your ) personal privacy , Congress , the Administration , and the phone companies have yet to act effectively .
( And they have known about it since at least this past July when the Washington Post reported on it . )
So we decided to attempt to buy the records of a celebrity , so to speak .
And we unfortunately succeeded .
I also want to say a quick aside about General Clark .
I was a big fan of his presidential campaign , and he was the first candidate I supported .
This effort was not meant in any way as a slight to the general .
We wanted to see if it was possible to buy the phone records of someone high profile in order to prove that this is a problem with serious national security implications , and frankly , we did n't want to pick a Republican since we thought such a choice would be perceived as partisan or mean - spirited , and that is not our intent for exposing this .
Our intent is to get this problem fixed so that we all can benefit .
I bought my records via the Web site LocateCell for $ 110 .
We bought General Clark 's records via the Web site CellTolls for $ 89.95 .
It is possible that both sites are run by the same company .
Interestingly , we tried to get the cell phone records of other high - profile Washingtonians like ABC's George Stephanopoulos , the Washington Post 's Dana Milbank , and the New York Time 's Adam Nagourney , but LocateCell was unable to provide me with their records ( possibly because those three use Verizon as their cell phone service , or possibly because LocateCell was on to me ) .
We are in the process of trying to obtain additional records .
The following is the list we received from CellTolls detailing 100 consecutive phone calls either placed or received on General Clark 's cell phone from November 15 to 18 , 2005 .
The company only gives you 100 calls , then you have to pay more for additional calls .
We have blacked out all but the last two digits of every phone number , including General Clark 's cell phone number , in order to protect his privacy and the privacy of anyone he has been in contact with .
This will permit General Clark , and at least one Washington Post reporter , to confirm that the record is legit .
The only question now remaining is why President Bush , our leaders in Congress , and our wireless phone companies ( at the very least T - Mobile and Cingular , whose customers ' records are available online to anyone ) have known about this problem for at least six months but have yet to fix it .
PS CBS News is going to report on the cell records privacy scandal tonight ( 1/12/06 ) on their evening news broadcast .
Merkel im Visier
: Überwachung der Überwacher
Das Wohnzimmer der Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel und ihres Ehemannes wurde durch eine Überwachungskamera gefilmt .
So klingt , vornehm ausgedrückt , was geschehen ist .
Weniger vornehm : „ Big brother is watching you . “
Der große , beobachtende Bruder waren die Leute vom Sicherheitsdienst des Pergamonmuseums .
Mit einer dort auf dem Dach angebrachten Überwachungskamera konnte direkt ins Wohnzimmer der gegenüber wohnenden Kanzlerin geschaut werden .
Die Kamera steht schon seit acht Jahren da , ist schwenkbar und hat einen starken Zoom .
KOMMENTAR VON WALTRAUD SCHWAB
Vielleicht ist der Vorfall noch zu neu , trotzdem fällt auf : Verlautbarungen der Parteien , die die Verletzung von Angela Merkels Privatsphäre anprangern , liegen bisher nicht auf dem Tisch .
Nur die Bild - Zeitung , die keine Angst vor Doppelzüngigkeit hat , argumentiert bereits dergestalt .
Was aber ist wirklich passiert ?
Eine Vertreterin jener gesellschaftlichen Gruppe , die allen Bürgerinnen und Bürgern die vollständige Beobachtung mit Überwachungskameras unter allen Umständen schmackhaft machen will , hat den subjektiven Faktor , der damit verbunden ist , höchstpersönlich erfahren .
Denn in Momenten beobachtet zu werden , in denen man sich unbeobachtet wähnt , ruft Gefühle des Ausgeliefertseins hervor .
Dies sollten sich die Verfechter der Überwachung merken .
Umso mehr , als der objektive Faktor der Videokontrolle , dem zufolge diese mehr Sicherheit biete , bis heute umstritten ist .
Dass dennoch daran festgehalten wird , zeigt , dass die Verfechter der Bevölkerung misstrauen .
Dass die negativen Seiten der Überwachung nun ausgerechnet die Bundeskanzlerin getroffen haben , ruft neben der Schadenfreude auch die Hoffnung hervor , dass Hardliner etwas daraus lernen .
In an article in Science magazine , SUNY Downstate researchers describe erasing memory from the brain by targeting a molecular mechanism that controls memory .
Finding may be applied to chronic pain , memory loss , and other conditions .
Scientists at SUNY Downstate Medical Center have discovered a molecular mechanism that maintains memories in the brain .
In an article in Science magazine , they demonstrate that by inhibiting the molecule they can erase long - term memories , much as you might erase a computer disc .
Furthermore , erasing the memory from the brain does not prevent the ability to re-learn the memory , much as a cleaned computer disc may be re-used .
This finding may some day have applications in treating chronic pain , post - traumatic stress disorder , and memory loss , among other conditions .
The SUNY Downstate researchers reported in the August 25 issue of Science that an enzyme molecule called “ protein kinase M zeta ” preserves long - term memories through persistent strengthening of synaptic connections between neurons .
This is analogous to the mechanism storing information as 0’s and 1 ’s in a computer ’s hard disc .
By inhibiting the enzyme , scientists were able to erase a memory that had been stored for one day , or even one month .
This function in memory storage is specific to protein kinase M zeta , because inhibiting related molecules did not disrupt memory .
These findings may be useful for the treatment of disorders characterized by the pathological over - strengthening of synaptic connections , such as neuropathic pain , phantom limb syndrome , dystonia , and post - traumatic stress .
Conversely , the identification of the core molecular mechanism for memory storage may focus effort on the development of specific therapeutic agents that enhance memory persistence and prevent memory loss .
Earlier this year , SUNY Downstate scientists reported that PKMzeta was bound up in the tangles of Alzheimer 's disease , thus perhaps blocking its function in memory storage .

But , researchers say , not only would such a study be expensive -- the exercise groups would need constant support , and researchers would have to monitor how much they were exercising -- but volunteers would be unlikely to comply with their assigned regimens .
Telling someone to exercise or to remain sedentary for years is not like telling her to take a pill .
The alternative is to look at populations of people who did or did not exercise and try to correct for factors that might be linked to exercise and to cancer .
Exercisers might be thinner , for example , and if they had a lower incidence of breast cancer it might be body weight , not exercise , that was responsible .
Study after study was conducted : some found small protective effects of exercise on breast cancer ; others found none .
Now , in Dr. Henderson 's opinion , there is no point in continuing to ask the same question in the same ways .
" We 've pretty much settled the issue that there is a small effect , " he said .
The effect , Dr. Henderson added , is so small , that even if it is real , it makes little difference to an individual woman .
In one of his studies , the effect of exercise was so small that if he took into account alcohol consumption -- which has been associated with a slightly increased breast cancer risk -- the exercise effect went away .
" If you are going to exercise , there are other good reasons , " Dr. Henderson says .
" But protection from breast cancer is not one of them . "
Dr. McTiernan has a different view .
Instead of continuing to ask if there is a correlation between exercise and breast cancer , she said , she has been asking , " What are the biochemical changes that occur with exercise and could they affect a woman 's risk ? "
It 's hangover avoidance , sweetie
Contrary to how it may feel in the morning , recent research suggests smoking may reduce the effects of alcohol - nicotine may prevent the passage of alcohol into the intestine where it 's easily absorbed .
In the long run , the scientists say this will harm drinkers , who will have to consume more to get the desired effect .
But it provides a scientific basis for a belief long - cherished by some smokers - that their vice was ameliorating their other vice .
How about other pieces of conventional wisdom about drinking ?
DRINK ON A FULL STOMACH
It 's the classic piece of advice meted out in a nation where binge - drinking is next in the charts after Godliness and cleanliness - get something down you before you go out .
Dr Guy Ratcliffe , medical director of the Medical Council on Alcoholism , says the evidence suggests that drinking on an empty stomach appears to make you more drunk .
A fine drop will still get you drunk
Professor Ian Gilmore , president of the Royal College of Physicians , says the effects of drinking on an empty stomach are dramatically different , adding that health is best served by slow drinking .
Eating rich or fatty food before drinking delays the rate of " gastric emptying " .
Some alcohol is absorbed through the stomach , but the key place is the small intestine .
If the booze is n't getting there as quickly , your body has a much better time processing it .
SOME DRINKS MAKE YOU MORE HUNGOVER
Not all alcoholic drinks are the same .
There 's different strengths , different types of alcohol and , importantly for a hangover 's magnitude , what manufacturers call congeners - the chemicals that add flavour , smell and colour .
Many are toxic , as alcohol is .
Intersperse hard drinks with soft
And the long - standing belief that a bottle of Petrus or Margaux is less likely than , say , Bulgarian plonk , to leave an angry armadillo nesting in your head , may have some validity as fine wines are thought to contain fewer of these chemicals .
" The so - called congeners almost certainly do contribute to the hangover , " Prof Gilmore adds .
DRINK WATER BEFORE GOING TO BED
We all know this one .
After a heavy night , there 's nothing less appetising than a couple of pints of water .
But those who force these down swear their hangover is lessened the next morning .
Both Dr Ratcliffe and Prof Gilmore agree that the science backs up your mother .
Hangovers are in great part dehydration .
The body is using water as it processes the alcohol .
By the time you wake up you may have used too much .
Thinking ahead the night before will help .
Interspersing drinks with glasses of water is recommended .
FIZZY DRINKS MAKE YOU MORE DRUNK
" Champagne goes straight to my head , " goes the refrain , and the explanation for many a story of bad behaviour at weddings .
It 's a piece of wisdom that makes it onto a government website on drinking , although the scientific reasoning behind it is not obvious .
Prof Gilmore says : " I do n't know of any evidence but it 's a common observation .
It may be that champagne is usually drunk on an empty stomach . "
Dr Ratcliffe is a bit more confident .
" It does seem that bubbles do increase the rate of alcohol absorption , " he says .
" You may inhale some bubbles in the air you breathe . "
HAIR OF THE DOG THAT BIT YOU
It does n't take a scientist to warn that a couple of pints at 8 am the morning after the night before is not a realistic long - term plan at hangover avoidance .
" It is very much a slippery slope and a very strong indicator of alcohol dependence to drink as an eye - opener , " says Prof Gilmore .
" Drinking on a hangover will dull the pain but it is an extremely dangerous manoeuvre . "
Per the " fizzy drinks " entry : carbonation of any sort stimulates the pyloric sphincter ( stomach to gut connection ) to open , which leads to more rapid absorption via the small intestine whether it 's beer , champs , or even soda .
Shots of undiluted hard liquor ( especially if it 's iced ) will actually make the stomach seize up and will be absorbed more slowly .
Paul , Austin , USA
You forgot the one about not mixing your drinks .
I only drink red wine
White wine has different chemicals and for me the two do not mix .
I think we should avoid having different drinks in the same evening .
We dont know just how bad it is for our health creating these chemical cocktails .
scott , torquay uk
Three satsumas before going to bed = no hangover !!
Shelly , Slough UK
I disagree with Prof Gilmore , drinking on a hangover is not a slippery slope at all ; it 's more of a dizzy helter skelter of fun .
bob , London
Flat Cola ( stir it with a spoon ) and Extra Strong Mints make for a great hangover cure .
It replenishes liquids without making you feel sick and the mints settle the stomach as well as freshening your breath .
Stoo , Lancashire , UK
Take milk thistle tablets before you start drinking .
I swear this really works .
being a hardened drinker from the Highlands , I should know !!!
Claire Macdonald , Isle Of Lewis
My father always told me to " never mix the grape and the grain " - and he 's quite right !
As for curing a hangover , it is mainly down to rehydrating and replacing last sugars in the body .
Although a fruit salad will be the last thing most people want ( I usually hanker after a bacon sandwich ) , it really does the trick .
Think oranges , kiwis , melon - nice juicy fruits .

Drinking alcohol through a straw makes you drunk quicker - true , alcohol has a lower boiling point than water .
In a vacuum even water " boils " at room temperature .
By using a straw you create a vacuum in the mouth - the alcohol boils and vaporises within the vacuum and is thus quickly and easily absorbed through the well blood supplied membranes of the mouth and hence straight to the brain .

Champagne almost certainly does make you drunk quicker - and it is all down to the bubbles !
There was a scietific study contacted by the human psychopharmacology unit at the University of Surrey in Guildford in 2001 .
The study was as follows : champagne was given to 12 volunteers - half drank fizzy champagne and the other half had flat champagne , purged of its bubbles beforehand with a whisk .
The following week , she repeated the experiment but gave each volunteer the opposite kind of champagne to the previous time .
That way , everyone tried both types of wine .
Each person drank two glasses of champagne per session .
With the exact intake adjusted o that everyone drank the same amount of alcohol per kilogram of body mass .
The results ?
Well , alcohol levels rose much faster among the bubbly drinkers .
After just five minutes , they had an average of 0.54 milligrams of alcohol per millilitre of blood .
Those drinking flat champagne averaged just 0.39 milligrams of alcohol .
At the end of the experiment , the bubbly drinkers were visibly worse for wear .
Some could hardly write apparently !!

N - acetyl - cysteine ( NAC ) works well , and is available at vitamin stores in the USA ( not sure about the UK ) .
It is a biochemical pre-cursor for a molecule in liver cells called glutathione , which you use a lot of when detoxifying alcohol and other harmful chemicals .
Two x 500 mg caplets of NAC before going out or even before going to bed , seems to work wonders for a hangover .

I swear by a banana and honey milkshake .
Banana for the potassium to help the headache , honey for the sugar to aid the shakes , and milk for the alkali to settle the stomach acid .
Stick it all in a blender and it's like a gift from the gods .
Ian , Haywards Heath England
Pint of water and a Berocca before bed .
Pint of water , Paracetamol and Berocca when you get up .
Bacon sandwich on the way in to work .
Genius - works every time .
Jon , London , UK
I find Neurofen works wonders , but it must be taken before drinking .
It 's for preventing a hangover rather than curing it .

She 's sexy , she 's stylish , she 's sophisticated - and somewhat surprisingly , she 's Ronald McDonald .
A gender - bending makeover of McDonald 's marketing icon in Japan has been hailed a great success after capturing the public imagination and enticing adults back into its outlets to sample a revamped menu .
Traditionally , Ronald McDonald would goof about in oversized shoes and baggy yellow overalls in a frantic and successful pursuit of Hamburgler .
In the Japanese TV commercial the foxy female version , with shoulder - length straight auburn hair in place of Ronald 's frizzy mop , smoulders at the camera in a flowing yellow dress , and later a red and white striped bikini with thigh - length leggings and red high heels .
But the man behind the campaign insists he did not create a female Ronald McDonald - but merely appropriated his instantly recognisable outfit .
Hidekazu Sato , known by his nickname Kazoo , the associate creative director at Beacon Communications - a joint venture of Leo Burnett and Dentsu - said the costume was so recognisable it was a mnemonic - a design that people would instantly associate with McDonald's .
" We devised the costume and took the red and white stripes and the yellow , which were recognised and converted them into a stylish dress , " Kazoo said via a translator .
" We were assuming that even if we did n't include the McDonald 's logo and even if the model was a beautiful caucasian just those colours of the mnemonic design would wake up people 's association with McDonald's . "
" The important point is we did n't change Ronald himself - we played around with his costume . "
" The customers are calling her the female Ronald but that was not our intention , " Kazoo said .
It is not the first time that the fast - food outlet - which has fended off attacks from obesity campaigners in recent years - has played fast and loose with its image .
In Britain the company , faced with falling sales , abandoned the famous golden arches logo and replaced it with a question mark in a poster campaign to get consumers to reconsider its fast food outlet image .
But the chain is still protective of its reputation .
McDonald 's Japan refused MediaGuardian.co.uk permission to show the full TV advert .
The Japanese adverts , which promoted the new McGrand burger , first appeared last year and had a big impact on popular culture , particularly the culture of costume play , known as " cospre " .
" In its favour was the strong Japanese culture of costume play , an underground scene of adults dressing up as cartoon characters , " said Kazoo .
" The commercial was popular and in particular the costume .
When I go to other shoots I sense that people in the fashion industry ask who created it and who the stylist was , so it is talked about . "
The advert even led to Japanese pop singer Namie Amuro approaching Beacon Communications to revamp her image after she saw it .
But despite the successful attempt to reach out to adults , the TV commercial found favour with a very familiar audience .
" It was rated number one likeable among high school girls , a wonderful surprise .
We were able to capture the young group as well as capture a more aspirational image for McDonald's . "

Programming at Python Speed
A Conversation with Guido van Rossum , Part III
by Bill Venners
January 27 , 2003

Summary
Python creator Guido van Rossum talks with Bill Venners about the source of Python 's famed programmer productivity and the joys of exploring new territory with code .
Guido van Rossum is the author of Python , an interpreted , interactive object - oriented programming language .
In the late 1980s , Van Rossum began work on Python at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands , or Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica ( CWI ) as it is known in Dutch .
Since then , Python has become very popular among developers , who are attracted to its clean syntax and reputation for productivity .
In this interview , which is being published in six weekly installments , Van Rossum gives insights into Python 's design goals , the source of Python programmer productivity , the implications of weak typing , and more :
In Part I : The Making of Python , Van Rossum describes Python 's history , major influences , and design goals .
In Part II : Python 's Design Goals , Van Rossum talks about Python 's original design goals — how he originally intended Python to " bridge the gap between the shell and C , " and how it eventually became used on large - scale applications .
In this installment , Van Rossum discusses the source of Python 's famed programmer productivity and the joys of exploring new territory with code .
Productivity and Finger Typing
Bill Venners : I 've met many people who like Python because they feel more productive using it .
When I went from C++ to Java , I found myself way more productive in Java .
People who know both Java and Python usually tell me they are way more productive in Python .
Where does the productivity come from when programming in Python ?
Guido van Rossum :
There are many different sources .
One is that Python requires a lot less typing .
Bill Venners : Finger typing ?
Guido van Rossum : Finger typing .
It would n't surprise me if the amount of typing Python requires is five times less than Java for a typical piece of code .
That would be the ratio .
When you have that much less code , it 's so much easier to maintain , and also to change .
This is all very informal , but I heard someone say a good programmer can reasonably maintain about 20,000 lines of code .
Whether that is 20,000 lines of assembler , C , or some high - level language does n't matter .
It 's still 20,000 lines .
If your language requires fewer lines to express the same ideas , you can spend more time on stuff that otherwise would go beyond those 20,000 lines .
A 20,000 - line Python program would probably be a 100,000 - line Java or C++ program .
It might be a 200,000 - line C program , because C offers you even less structure .
Looking for a bug or making a systematic change is much more work in a 100,000 - line program than in a 20,000 - line program .
For smaller scales , it works in the same way .
A 500 - line program feels much different than a 10,000 - line program .
Python 's Powerful Data Types
Bill Venners :
Do you consider less finger typing the main source of productivity when programming in Python ?
Why do people feel more productive ?
Guido van Rossum : Another source of productivity is Python 's powerful built - in data types .
Take arrays , for example .
Python does not require you to declare an array size .
You do n't need to worry that what you want to hold does n't fit in the number of elements you 've declared .
Our array type is flexible .
It has maybe a dozen methods .
You can insert elements in the middle and everything else just moves up automatically .
You can delete .
You can also slice : work on a slice of an array at a time .
If you want a function to act on a piece of an array , for example , you can just pass a slice as a single argument .
You do n't need to pass in the original array with a start - and - stop index .
Python has a very efficient and powerful dictionary type , which is like an associative array or hash .
The dictionary type is used a lot internally by the Python implementation .
That almost guarantees that it is efficient , because we spent a lot of time making the language efficient .
But you can use the same dictionary data type for your application .
Dictionary is probably the main data type that every application uses .
Over the years Python 's data types have collected a lot of useful functionality .
The data types are powerful .
That makes Python very powerful .
And yet because Python has a very small set of data types , it does n't feel like you have to spend a year learning the language before you know everything that 's there .
The minimal finger typing and powerful data types work together to make your program small , and make you feel more productive .
Weak Typing and the Standard Library
Bill Venners :
To what extent do Python 's weak typing and libraries help programmers feel productive ?
Guido van Rossum :
Weak typing probably helps you feel productive , because it lets you bend the rules a bit when deciding what goes into your array .
You can have an array of numbers that occasionally has something else inside , if that does n't bother you .
A single sort method sorts arrays of completely heterogeneous elements , as long as you can compare them individually .
You do n't have to commit to integers and floating point numbers , for example .
They all mix properly .
You also have long integers , which are arbitrary precision integers .
In many cases , this is useful — either because you need just a little more than 32 bits , or because you need a lot more than 32 bits .
Long integers are available in Java , but they 're in a separate package and are much harder to use because you do n't have operator overloading .
In Python , you can just write x + y , and it does n't matter whether x and y are small integers or integer numbers with several thousand bits .
People also feel more productive due to the " batteries included " feeling : the standard library includes many things .
The standard library has implementations of the various Internet protocols — HTTP , FTP , NNTP , IMAP , POP , SMTP .
There 's a higher - level API to which you just give a URL and it returns something that acts like a file .
You can just read bytes from it and it gives the data corresponding to that URL on the remote site .
A lot of necessary functionality is already in the libraries , available with minimal typing .
In addition to the standard library , the Python community has produced many third - party libraries .
For years the standard library did n't have cookie support , but there was an excellent third - party cookie module .
About one or two years ago that cookie module was added to the standard library ; however , it was available to people who needed it long before then .
All those aspects let people feel more productive .
Exploring with Code
Bill Venners : I 've heard that one of the problems with Python is that it invites less design .
Because people can so easily write their programs quickly in Python , they tend to just charge ahead without any planning .
Do you think verbosity , such as the verbosity of Java compared to Python , tends to make people want to plan more ?
Guido van Rossum : Planning is good and bad .
If you know where you 're going , planning is good .
If you do n't know what you 'll encounter on the way , you should be more open - minded and improvisational .
I certainly see a place for planning , but if the language forces you to plan everything , there may be trips you 'll never undertake because it would require too much thinking ahead .
You 're then inhibited by fears that you do n't know how to do something .
In Python , you can start doing that something and discover how to do it on the way .
You can build something quickly , get it on the road , obtain feedback , and then design the next one based on greater understanding of the problem domain .
Bill Venners : I often feel that creating software is like mixing cement .
It starts out soft and hardens over time as you stir it .
You can't see everything in advance , so you can't plan everything up front .
You can make a plan , but once you try it you realize it would be much better to do it another way .
So you iterate .
Each time you iterate you move towards a better solution , and the body of code that depends on your choices grows .
Eventually it all just kind of hardens .
You end up with released interfaces that you 're stuck with .
Guido van Rossum :
And then you really have to be backwards compatible .
Bill Venners :
So perhaps being able to make changes gets you farther ahead before things harden .
Maybe things do n't harden as early in Python because you go through the iterations more quickly .
Guido van Rossum : Yeah .
I always feel that the interesting programming jobs are the ones in which you do n't know exactly where you 'll end up .
Implementing another spreadsheet is boring .
There have been many spreadsheets .
We know what the user interface should be like .
We know what the right implementation techniques are .
We know a whole bunch of things .
Yes , you can write another spreadsheet .
You can probably plan it very well , because you can do a feature - by - feature checklist of all the other known spreadsheets .
I want this .
I want that .
I want to fix this problem with this particular one .
I want to avoid that bug .
That 's easy , but it 's not very interesting .
I like programming problems where you think , " There has to be something really interesting over there , but I can't see it clearly . "
All you can do is move one step over there , with a small bit of code , and start exploring to see it more clearly .
And maybe it actually was n't there , it was over here .
Or it had a different shape than you thought initially .
Maybe it was n't interesting at all , and you did n't waste a lot of time .
The danger of planning is that you plan for the contingencies you know about , but by definition you do n't plan for things you do n't know you 'll encounter .
So when you do encounter an unexpected event in your programming endeavor , you have to fix many interfaces and change multiple method signatures .
If you 've already committed to your original plan and that 's no longer where you 're going , then you have a problem .
I 'm not particularly worried by the fact that people say you can prototype more easily in Python , but eventually the Java version makes it easier to build a robust large system .
You can prototype in Python .
Once you 've explored the space more , you can do the planning and design that the Java version requires .
If you start writing in Java knowing as little as you did when you started writing the Python version , you 'll waste way more time exploring than actually building the system you 'll eventually build .
The Python world has some nice examples of this .
Early on , when the Web was just becoming interesting for things like shopping online , a small company called eShop was developing various commerce servers .
e Shop had proprietary protocols and proprietary applications , and it realized that it should just be able to use a Web server and Web browser .
The developers decided to do a prototype in Python .
Because they used Python , the eShop developers were the first to release a beta version compared to many other startups doing exactly the same thing .
They never actually released working code after their beta release , because the company was acquired by Microsoft .
Microsoft spent two or three product revisions to eventually replace all the Python code with C++.
But if eShop had n't started in Python , it would never have released something interesting enough for Microsoft to acquire in the first place .
That also happened with Yahoo .
Yahoo Mail started out as a successful Python application .
Again , because the developers used Python , they could respond quickly to the user feedback .
And that 's an application that almost everybody can use .
They saw many things wrong with their application , and they responded to that quickly and added new features .
Because they were doing something new , they did n't know exactly what people would need from an email Web application .
It is different from a program that has your email on your computer .
Access times are different .
All sorts of things are different .
So they were learning about what those differences were .
And again , I think Yahoo may now have replaced all the Python code with C++ or some other language , but the Python prototype was essential in order to get there .

LAST WEEK , I got a phone call from a television news producer who asked me what Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa ’s extramarital affair revealed about the nature of Latino political leadership .
I told her I ’d agree to be interviewed on air only if we could explore what Bill Clinton ’s dalliances said about white people or Jesse Jackson ’s fling with an aide told us about black activists .
Dumbfounded , she asked if I could refer her to someone else .
Remember two short years ago , when The Times rhapsodized on the front page about Villaraigosa ’s electoral triumph ?
His victory party was described in glorious terms , “ with downtown skyscrapers as a backdrop and lavender jacaranda trees glowing under lights shining from the rooftop . ”
Ah , yes , this Latino mayor , who promised to “ govern for all Angelenos , ” was expected to usher in an era of ethnic cooperation .
Of course , there were the inevitable “ Latinos have arrived ” articles in the press .
( I even wrote one for the Newsweek edition that had Villaraigosa ’s mug on the front cover over a headline that read , “ Latino Power . ” )
But as the weeks went on and the wheels of municipal governance turned , the mayor ’s ethnicity became less and less part of the story .
Sure , it was mentioned when he took a trade delegation to Mexico , but not when he tried to take over the school district , raised trash collection fees to hire more police officers , cleared the way to study the possibility of building a subway to the sea , or launched an initiative to plant a million new trees .
For a brief moment , the media seemed to understand that , other than some ethnic symbolism and his ability to speak serviceable Spanish , a Mexican American mayor behaved pretty much like any other politician .
But that was before the revelation of the mayor ’s extramarital affair with Telemundo anchorwoman Mirthala Salinas , and the media gratuitously injected ethnicity into the scandal .
Maybe , it would have been different if she worked for CBS , but I do n’t think so .
Reporters from a variety of newspapers , including The Times , the Washington Post , the San Francisco Chronicle and the LA Weekly made lame comparisons between the mayor ’s affair and telenovelas , Spanish - language soap operas .
Do you think they did n’t write “ soap opera ” because the English - language versions lack sufficient sex and intrigue ?
Or maybe it was a cute way to ascribe this behavior , as opposed to planting trees , to his ethnicity .

After hearing that Salinas had dated two other Mexican American politicians , Fabian Núñez and Alex Padilla , Times columnist Steve Lopez joked that the three men were playing a game of " ¿Quién Es Más Macho ? , ” a phrase comedian Bill Murray came up with on “ Saturday Night Live ” in a 1979 takeoff on Latino stereotypes .
Because — heh , heh — you know what they say about those Latin men .
I ’m surprised no newspaper ran a cartoon of the mayor sporting a pencil mustache , a Zorro mask and a rose clenched between his teeth .
Would all this winking ethnic innuendo be tolerated if it were applied to , say , Anglo , black or Jewish politicians ?
Imagine if New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , the grandson of a Russian Jewish immigrant , were embroiled in some sort of scandal over his kid ’s marriage , would a mainstream newspaper say the meshugeneh mayor ’s predicament was straight out of “ Fiddler on the Roof ” ?
Probably not .
In fact , last week an Associated Press story stated bluntly that in New York , “ Bloomberg is n’t known as the Jewish mayor . ”
The truth is that despite the integration of such Latino figures as Villaraigosa into mainstream American life , when push comes to shove , the media still fall back into old , condescending patterns of exoticization and marginalization .
In this case , they treated Villaraigosa ’s troubles as if they were Latino as opposed to American or male or politicians ’ peccadilloes .

Go back 75 years and you ’ll find that mainstream newspapers rarely mentioned Latinos at all .
After they were “ discovered ” in the late 1960s and early 1970s , most news items about Latinos were about social dysfunction , barrio success stories or political activism .
But over the last 15 years , the mainstream media have gotten wind of the fact that Latinos are complex and wildly heterogeneous , some whose families have been here for generations , some who arrived yesterday .
They are a multiclass , multilingual , multiracial , multinational and geographically diverse population that ca n’t be summed up into simple stereotypes .
And , no , they do n’t all live in the same neighborhood .
So why , last week , would The Times report from just three neighborhoods — downtown , Boyle Heights and Pico - Union — to gauge the reaction of the 1.8 million Latinos who live throughout this vast city ?
( What three neighborhoods would you choose to get the man - on - the - street opinion of 1.2 million white Angelenos — Tujunga , Chatsworth and Westchester ? )
Latinos are a near - majority in this city .
So maybe it ’s time to stop treating them as if they were a quaint — and even menacing — group with funny customs that lives on the other side of the bridge .

Nick Lachey made a much - anticipated appearance on MTV's " Total Request Live " this afternoon with current squeeze Vanessa Minnillo co-hosting , and the chemistry was crackling -- between Nick and co-host Damien Fahey , that is .
Despite the fact that the two were just laying it on one another thick and heavy at New York 's Butter nightclub the other night , Nick and Vanessa barely looked at each other during Lachey 's appearance on the show , and no physical contact between the two was noted even when Vanessa passed just in front of Nick on the way to look out the window .
What 's more , their one moment of banter , when Minnillo made the observation that Nick is " everywhere , " inspired a deeply awkward response from Nick .
Indeed , Nick , who was premiering his new video , left Vanessa ( and the audience ) wanting , much as he did Monday afternoon at a Manhattan restaurant , when , despite her best efforts , she could n't get Nick to give her a kiss .
IT COULD give the term “ power suit ” a whole new meaning .
Getting dressed a few years from now , you may find yourself putting on more than mere fabric .
Your clothes may by then sport electronic sensors and tiny computers .
As you walk out of the door , you will be not just fashionably attired , but digitally enhanced — a living , breathing node on the internet .
This prospect will delight some people and horrify others .
But it could actually happen , if the field known variously as smart fabrics , electronic textiles or “ washable computing ” can achieve the breakthrough its proponents believe is just around the corner .
As recently as five years ago the idea of clothing , furniture and upholstery that combined fabric with electronics was a fantasy .
Yet today the first examples of the technology are on sale , with more advanced products on the way .
Current products are aimed at early adopters , but both hopeful start - ups and big firms such as Nike , DuPont and Philips are searching for an application that will carry the technology into the mainstream .
Smart fabrics look and feel like ordinary textiles , but can do extraordinary things : generate heat , monitor vital signs , act as switches or sensors , and even change colour .
With so much fabric woven into daily life , proponents of smart fabrics see them as a natural way to increase the pervasiveness of today 's gadgets and add snippets of intelligence to everyday items .
Computing power is already being incorporated into cars , household appliances and entertainment systems , notes Stacey Burr , the boss of Textronics , a spin - off from DuPont based in Wilmington , Delaware , that is developing electronic textiles and clothing .
So fabric , she argues , is a natural next step .
“ About 70 % of the materials that people come in contact with are fabrics , ” she says .
“ We want to create fabrics that warm , illuminate , conduct , sense and respond . ”
Smart fabrics will be particularly useful in the fields of medicine , sports , communications and personal security , Ms Burr predicts .
Material benefits
She is not alone in her enthusiasm .
“ There is a really big market , ” says John Collins of Eleksen , a British start - up that sells sensors based on smart fabrics that can be incorporated into clothing , accessories and furniture .
Eleksen has so far sold 70,000 units , but already has firm orders for 600,000 units in 2006 , and expects sales to rise tenfold again in 2007 .
Smart fabrics can take many forms .
The most basic kind is electrically conductive , such as Textronics ' “ textro - yarn ” , a slightly elastic material that resembles ordinary fabric .
Because it conducts electricity , it can be used for heating ( by passing a current through the fabric ) , as a radio antenna , for electromagnetic shielding , to provide power to other devices embedded into clothing , and even to make electrodes , for example to monitor vital signs .
The company has just launched a sports bra that monitors the wearer 's heart - rate and calorie consumption , and displays them on a wristwatch - sized screen .
Another of Textronics ' smart materials is “ textro - polymer ” .
Its fibres have the useful property that their resistance changes when they are stretched .
This can be used to detect bending , stretching or tugging , which can in turn reveal whether the wearer of a smart garment is moving or stationary , or whether a particular car seat or bed is occupied .
In September , Textronics announced a deal with Konarka , a pioneer in flexible solar panels , with a view to making jackets that can recharge mobile phones and other devices .
International Fashion Machines ( IFM ) , a firm based in Seattle , has just launched a range of light switches based on conductive yarns .
Squeezing the fuzzy , pom-pom - shaped blob of material changes the amount of current flowing through it .
This difference is detected by a control circuit that then turns lights on or off accordingly .
Maggie Orth , IFM 's founder , hopes these playful switches will find use in children 's playrooms and designer hotels .
The smart fabric made by Eleksen , called ElekTex , acts as a more elaborate touch sensor .
It consists of three layers : a top and bottom layer of conductive material , and a middle layer that conducts electricity when it is compressed .
Voltage gradients are applied across the top and bottom layers , at right angles to each other .
When the fabric is pressed , current flows through the middle layer .
By measuring the change in voltage across the top and bottom layers , it is possible to determine where ( and roughly how hard ) the fabric is being pressed .
This means that sliding and tracing gestures , as well as individual presses , can be detected .
Eleksen claims that the fabric can survive being washed , crumpled , punctured and even driven over .
It has already been used to make roll - up fabric keyboards for handheld computers , to control a heated jacket made by Innovative Sports , and to incorporate iPod controls into ski jackets made by Spyder , Kenpo and Westcomb .
The iPod is popped into a special pocket and plugged into a control wire , and it can then be controlled using fabric sensors in the jacket 's cuff or on its sleeve .
Buttons start and stop playback and select tracks , and stroking a strip adjusts the volume .
Fancy fabrics , clever clothes
In France , a cinema has experimented with using ElekTex to count the number of occupied seats ; another proposed use is to incorporate television controls directly into the fabric of sofas .
“ The real value in our stuff is being able to keep the interface as soft as the thing it 's going into , ” says Miles Jordan of Eleksen .
The company has also devised a second form of smart fabric , again made up of several layers , which functions as a moisture sensor .
The top two layers allow only a small proportion of incident moisture to reach the third , bottom layer , which contains a matrix of conductive fibres .
The amount of moisture can be determined by measuring variations in the resistance of this layer .
This smart fabric can be used for what Eleksen delicately calls “ incontinence detection ” in medicine , and to detect moisture in buildings .
As well as acting as sensors and switches that gather information , smart fabrics can also function as output devices .
One approach is that taken by Luminex , the result of a collaboration between Caen , an Italian electronics firm , and Stabio , a Swiss textiles company .
Luminex is a fabric with fibre - optic strands woven into it , which are then illuminated using light - emitting diodes powered by a small battery pack .
Luminex has already been incorporated into glowing clothes , safety garments , handbags and furniture , and even a wedding dress .
Electric Plaid , devised by IFM , takes a different approach .
Rather than emitting light directly , it contains stainless - steel yarns coated with “ thermochromic ” inks that , as their name suggests , change colour depending on the temperature .
Applying a current causes the yarns to heat up , which changes the ink 's colour .
This makes possible fabrics with slowly changing patterns ( see photo on previous page ) , and even information displays : a wallhanging that changes colour depending on the weather forecast , for example .
A kinder , gentler light switch
As smart as these fabrics are , they still rely on separate control circuitry to detect pressure , motion or moisture , or change their appearance .
Smart jackets based on ElekTex , for example , contain a small control unit to connect the touch sensors on the sleeve to an iPod.
Rehmi Post , a researcher at the Centre for Bits and Atoms at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , says the real breakthrough will come when the control electronics are not simply housed in clothing , but are woven directly into the fabric .
Today 's products , he points out , are a halfway - house in which the textiles and electronics are not fully integrated .
“ They are n't ambitious enough , ” he says .
Seamlessly weaving cloth , power and data , Dr Post admits , will be easier said than done .
Many of the required technologies exist already , but overcoming problems such as electrical interference , programming and power supplies will not be trivial .
“ There are a few fundamental problems that have to be solved , but they are solvable , ” he says .
Integrating fabrics and electronics more closely will , Mr Collins predicts , make possible phones , music players and other portable devices that are part electronic and part fabric .
They will , he says , be smaller , lighter , less power - hungry and more durable than today 's devices .
Smart clothing could not only blur the lines between materials and electronics but , if items of clothing start to absorb previously discrete devices , between people and machines .
“ They will be a kind of second skin — functionality will blend into the background , ” says Ms Burr .
Perhaps .
But in the short term , at least , it seems more likely that smart clothing 's appeal will be limited to particular , well - defined situations , such as skiing , policing and emergency rescue .
That said , many people now refuse to go out without their mobile phones .
The challenge for believers in smart fabrics is to make people feel similarly naked without them .
Mr O'Leary calls for a return to normal measures
O'Leary news briefing
The budget airline says a larger cabin baggage allowance and fewer passenger body searches would avoid handing " extremists an enormous PR victory " .
The " no frills " airline prefers to put less luggage into plane holds to maintain its low prices .
The government said it would not pay compensation or " compromise security " .
A spokesman at the Department for Transport said the government does not believe it has to pay compensation under the law .
The DfT said on Friday : " The security regime in place at UK airports is necessary because of the level of security threat and is kept under constant review .
" We have no intention of compromising security levels nor do we anticipate changing our requirements in the next seven days . "
The best way to defeat terrorists and extremists is for ordinary people to continue to live their lives as normal

' Plot ' inquiry spanning UK Curbs spook budget airlines
The DfT spokesman added that the restrictions were introduced under the Aviation Security Act of 1982 , which allows the government to implement measures for the safety and protection of the public .
Ryanair has threatened to claim compensation under a different act - the provision of section 93 of the Transport Act 2000 .
Meanwhile , Virgin says it will discuss the cost of extra airport security staff with BAA .
Virgin said it was " not seeking compensation from the government " , but thought it should pay for the staff .
Ryanair is keen to encourage more customers
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary described the situation at London airports after the security measures were imposed last Thursday , as a " shambles " .
He said : " If they allow these restrictions to stay in place , then the government will have handed the extremists an enormous PR victory . "
Demands
In launching a campaign to " get Britain flying again " included one million seats for sale on more than 100 routes , priced at £ 25 , one way , including taxes and charges .
The measures the airline has demanded include :
Restoring the hand luggage allowance for passengers leaving British airports to the normal International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) dimensions of a small , wheeled case , which is just 20 % larger than the current restriction of a " large briefcase " dimension

Something to Watch : Health Care Becomes a “ Competitive Disadvantage ” ?
We ’ve recently noticed several corporations complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage operating in the US because of health care costs .
These firms claim that it is to their advantage to employ workers outside the US or to cut US benefits because health care systems in many other countries are nationalized .
Thus , these corporations believe they can become more competitive by operating outside the US because they do not have the semi- fixed cost of US private sector health care benefits .
This is an interesting twist to the health care debate , and should be watched closely as next year ’s mid-term elections approach .
The political environment might force both sides of the aisle to suggest programs to counteract that competitive disadvantage and save / create jobs in the US .
We find this somewhat disconcerting from an investment strategy point of view .
This could be a risk to our highlighted , but admittedly hardly out - of - consensus , overweight of the Health Care sector .

Music
Miles Davis , “ Kind of Blue ”
“ This is one of the worst albums I ’ve ever bought .
It ’s so boring and lifeless .
Good to fall asleep to . ”
“ its boredom , nostalgia and scarcely concealed contempt make it the perfect background music for this narcissistic age of ours . ”
“ I found Mr. Davis ’ playing to be laughable at best .
Finally , it ’s irritating ; and confusing that so many people laud it . ”
“ If pretension , tedium , and self - indulgence are your idea of what should animate music , then this is the album and Miles Davis is the ‘ artist ’ for you . ”
The Beatles , “ White Album ”
“ Kindle for your campfire ; better yet an apology from Apple Records for creating this toxic waste ”
“ This CD looks good in a garbage can ….. god awful , what were they thinking ??? ”
“ This is , put simply , one of the worst albums I have ever listened to . ”
“ If you want to hear a peak in popular rock music listen to ( for example ) “ Use Your Illusion I & II ” by Guns N’ Roses .
These are the kind of albums that deserve all the praise the White Album gets . ”
Beach Boys , “ Pet Sounds ”
“ This is not the Beach Boys .
It ca n’t be .
Why ?
No beach songs !
I thought it was some kind of joke .
All ‘ Pet Sounds ’ offers is the opportunity to hear Brian Wilson whine for forty minutes , backed by elevator music . ”
“ It ’s full of bland harmonizing by guys that could barely swim . ”
“ The lyrics consist of commonplace rhyming conversational prose , totally lacking in imagery , metaphor and anything else that separates verse from poetry . ”
Bob Dylan , “ Highway 61 Revisited ”
“ One big giant dud !
Insane lyrics , horrible singing ”
“ He set the precedent that doomed rock ‘n roll to always being a semantic eunuch . ”
“ Most of the songs are as a rule decent enough , but can anyone really listen to the howling vocals for longer than a few minutes at a time ? ! ”
“ Bob Dylan had to either have been completely tone deaf , or carried one of the largest egos on the planet not to let someone better sing his songs , or at least to take lessons . ”
John Coltrane , “ A Love Supreme ”
“ Coltrane ’s A Love Supreme is the most overhyped jazz album in history .
It is music ?
Maybe .
But I find it to be unlistenable , despite several efforts to find something good in it . ”
“ The first number is torture if you like melodic music .
There ’s no connection between the phasing and the rhythm .
Again , is this supposed to be clever ? ”
“ Nobody will care about the technical achievements of these guys in 100 years . ”
“ I think about Kenny G. , for instance .
His rythmic session is much more regular , whereas Coltrane ’s session seems sometimes to loose the beat . ”
Movies
Casablanca
“ I ’m pretty sure I will enjoy it a lot more when Warner Bros finally gets around to releasing the colorized version , the way this movie needs to be seen – the world is not black and white , why should our movies be ? ”
“ Bergman ’s constant near nervous breakdown into weepiness or breathy asthma seems forced and adoleescent rather than the mental state of a mature woman . ”
“ I would like to have rated this ‘ video ’ zero - stars , but 1 - star is as bad as it can be rated . ”
“ This movie is horrible !
It is so boring and unoriginal that I ca n’t stand it . ”
The Wizard of Oz
“ If you ’re a fan of hammy acting and schmaltzy stories , this movie is for you . ”
“ Also the color — what is this fixation on color in that period ?
Tone things down , please . ”
“ For one thing , I do n’t like to watch things with witches in them , especially if one of them is portrayed as a ‘ good witch ’ – that ’s an oxymoron I ca n’t reconcile with . ”
“ Well , maybe in 1939 it was great , put today in 2001 this film is just toooooooooo outdated and hokey . ”
Citizen Kane
“ The only good thing about Citizen Kane is that it will put you to sleep faster than any film . ”
“ Please stop the hype on Citizen Kane .
It does n’t work .
It ’s like you are trying to convince people that poop smells good . ”
“ Citizen Kane is a hymn to all filmmakers who have ever tried to create something artistic and meaningful and failed miserably every step of the way . ”
“ It was just a bad attempt at a boring story about newspaper tycoon .
It ’s one of the worst movies I have ever seen . ”
The Shawshank Redemption
“ This paean to middle - aged scofflaws , attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists , thieves , and murderers . ”
“ That pretty much sums up the plot of Shawshank , nothing but a formula picture that you have seen before . ”
“ It ’s a shame that a briliiant actor and director had to fall victum to the use of vile language when it was proven by the television version that it was completely unnecessary to the impact and story line . ”
“ And finally … what kind of ending is it where two dudes are together on a beach . ”
The Godfather
“ It ’s a boring hype , with not enough action . ”
“ ‘ The Godfather ’ has an ugly consciousness and a mean spirit .
I see no justification for it , thoroughly disliked it , and have tried to forget it . ”
“ This movie was so violent I could n’t believe it ! ”
Books
James Joyce , “ Ulysses ”
“ Pretentious intellectual self - absorption ”
“ Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun . ”
“ For all the great style modern authors may use , they are just using it to cover up a total lack of substance . ”
“ Life is too short to waste your time on this crap ! ”
“ Ulysses is a hardcover bounded knife in the face . ”
F. Scott Fitzgerald ’s “ The Great Gatsby ”
“ It was poorly structured , the story is unclear and it is not very memorable . ”
“ Anyone who is an ancestor to that worthless excuse of an American novelist should be offered sincere consoling and extreme sympathies . ”
“ The love story was predictable and the characters were obnoxious . ”
“ It ’s just so haphazard and bad that people mistake it for being good . ”
J.D. Salinger , “ Catcher in the Rye ”
“ A dull , pendantic book about a dull , pedantic hypocrite . ”
“ This book was linked with the murders of John Lennon , and actress Rebecca Schaeffer .
How could this book be around , when so many nutcases use it for such things ? ”
“ Salinger is the real phony here . ”
“ I find it as pointless as the day i read it .
You would be much better off reading a nice Grisham , actually … ”
Kurt Vonnegut , “ Slaughterhouse Five ”

Several years ago , we were offered the opportunity to sell our interest in Inteliseek , which was merged yesterday into the new Nielsen Buzzmetrics .
We declined the opportunity because although the offer for our stock was fair value given where the Company was at the time , we felt that our stock had option value .
Option value is a cliche I hear a lot in the venture capital business and it is fundamental to what we do , particularly the early stage venture business .
I believe that regardless of the " valuation " placed on the Company in most first round investments , what you are really paying for is option value .
Option value means the potential for a gain .
If you own 20 % of a company , you own 20 % of the current value plus 20 % of the potential upside .
It 's the latter that I am calling option value .
I heard recently about a book or an article that made the case that options are bad .
That people actually prefer less choice not more choice .
That may be true in real life , but it is certainly not true in money and finance .
Options , particularly long life options , which is what early stage stock really is , are very valuable .
It 's hard to value these instruments with traditional option pricing mechanisms but we know that if you hold onto them and good things happen with the portfolio company , you are going to get rewarded .
So the next time you buy or sell early stage stock , think less about the current value of what you are buying , because there honestly is n't much value in an early stage company , and think more about the potential value creation , the odds of success , and the time frame it would take to get there , and value what you are buying or selling as an option .
You may be surprised at the results of that analysis .
By firing rapid pulses of polarized light at corn , spinach and other crops , researchers have uncovered a picture of plant health that is invisible to the naked eye .
Using a portable light source and detector technology , the researchers can differentiate minute differences in leaf colors - indicators of over - or under- fertilization , crop -nutrient levels and perhaps even disease .
The researchers hope their tractor - mountable N - Checker ( for " nitrogen - checker " ) apparatus will help farmers determine in real time how much fertilizer to apply .
By preventing waste , the system could decrease the cost of crop production and dramatically cut the nitrogen - laden runoff responsible for algal blooms and other damage to wetlands and waterways .
Steve Finkelman , Paul Nordine and their colleagues at Containerless Research , Inc. of Evanston , Ill. , Louise Egerton - Warburton and partners at the Chicago Botanic Garden , and graduate student Tim Smith of the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign , will present their new technology July 19 at the InfoAg 2005 Conference in Springfield , Ill .
" With our technology , we are able to easily see what is hidden from conventional instruments , " says Finkelman .
" The system eliminates interference from light reflected at a leaf 's surface and allows us to see light re-emitting from within . "
Depending on the plant , leaves reflect , transmit and absorb varying amounts of light .
Polarized light that enters a leaf 's interior can lose its polarity and be re-emitted as " depolarized " light .
The depolarized light reveals nitrogen content and other properties the proprietary sensors in the N - Checker can detect .
Changes in nitrogen levels change the way light interacts with the molecules in the leaf , characteristically affecting the spectrum of light that re-emits from the plant .
Chlorophyll molecules , in particular , contain nitrogen atoms that play a critical role in photosynthesis .
The researchers have experimented with two versions of their apparatus .
The original version channels broad - spectrum light from a xenon flashlamp through a series of calcite crystals to illuminate each corn , sugar beet , cotton or other broad - leaf crop with a tiny , transient spot of polarized light .
Moving from leaf to leaf , that system can measure nitrogen levels in 60 plants per minute .
Instead of a broad - spectrum lamp as its source , the N - Checker uses two red - light sources that cut down on sensor and polarizer costs and increase the system speed .
The red region of the electromagnetic spectrum is important because it reveals not just total chlorophyll content , but also relative amounts of the various types of chlorophyll molecules .
" Other devices use both red and infrared wavelengths , " says Finkelman .
" Those devices tend to be imprecise because they measure bulk chlorophyll content , which can result from a number of factors . "
By using two specific , visible , red wavelengths , the N - Checker can differentiate among the several types of chlorophyll molecules and therefore reveal nitrogen - dependent plant health information .
The N - Checker can take 1000 measurements per second -- at least every 10th of an inch -- while moving at roughly 5 miles an hour .
At that speed , a farmer could survey and fertilize tens of acres in a day , or hundreds of acres per day with a multi-sensor system .

: Reverse - Colorblind Test : Update , 13 March 2007 : First , thank you for stopping by .
You should read my blog entry about this test , which explains its background a little more , and also discusses some of the results people have communicated to me over email , since I first put this page online in April of 2001 .
It also explains that this test is only a proof - of - concept , and is not meant to be robustly diagnostic .
In other words , YMMV .
Enjoy !
And , please feel free to email me with your own experience of the test .
End Update Color blind is the name given to people who do not have a ' normal ' range of chromatic ( color ) contrast sensitivity .
There are several different kinds of color blindness , and not all are due to genetic variation .
The subjective experience of color vision is partially created by the retina measuring differences in the wavelengths of incident light .
That is , ' normal ' color vision is enabled by having essentially three relatively independent ' channels ' , each sensitive to a different distribution of wavelengths .
When , say , the red channel is stimulated relatively more than another , then we subjectively experience the color red , with the details being partially controlled by the relative intensity of the stimulation .
A fourth channel - your rods - is not used in this way , and is thus more sensitive to variations in lightness versus darkness ( luminosity ) .
( For a much more thorough explanation of how color vision operates , try here . )
Tests for color blindness ( such as the popular Ishihara test ( a fancy flash version is available here ) - the one where bubbles of diferent sizes and colors are used to conceal a number from color blind people ) are typically designed around ' confusion lines ' , which are basically colors that do n't differentially stimulate different color channels , and thus appear to be basically identical .
In April of 2001 , while discussing with a close friend of mine Nick Yee , who is red - green colorblind , the differences in our subjective visual experiences , we realized that color vision is not an unequivocal gain .
That is , in some situations , he could perceive variations in luminosity that I could not .
This difference got us to thinking whether we could design a " reverse " color blindness test - one that he could pass because he is color blind , and one that I would fail because I am not .
The hypothesis we worked from is that , under certain circumstances for a color - sighted person , the information the brain receives about color contrasts can overwhelm ( or otherwise discount ) the information it receives from luminosity contrast .
That is , we could distract color - sighted people with bright colors from noticing " hidden " information in subtle but systematic variations in luminosity .
This test is the result of that conversation .
Red Spectrum Gradient
This image contains both a simple red gradient , and a pattern .
colorblind_gradient.jpg
If you can see the pattern overlayed on the gradient , this suggests that you may be red - green color blind .
If you can't see it , you could try looking to either side of the image .
Outside of the fovea - i.e. , in your peripheral vision - there is a greater relative concentration of rods than cones , and this may increase your ability to distinguish variations in luminosity .
( For instance , ever notice that when looking up at the stars , there are some you can't see when you look dead - on , but which you can if you look slightly away ?
Your rods are so sensitive that they can basically detect single photons , but obviously color contrast requires more light than that ! )
Red Speckles
In this example , I created an image more reminiscent of the classic Ishihara plates .
Again , there is a pattern ( different from the previous one ) overlayed on the background speckles .
If the pattern is clear to you , then you may be red - green colorblind .
That is , if you ' fail ' this test , then you probably have the full range of color sensitivity that is attributed to ' normal ' people .
colorblind_speckle.jpg
' Answers ' for these images are on a separate page .
To make these , I tweaked the color contrast to make the overlayed patterns significantly more obvious .
If you ' failed ' the test , once you 've seen the answers , come back and look again .
It may be easier to pick out the subtle variations in luminosity now that you know what to look for .
And , I 'm always interested to hear about people 's subjective experiecnes with this test , so please feel free to email me directly about them !
( Over the years that this page has been online , I 've received about 100 personal testimonials , and while there are certainly some people who erroneously ' fail ' or ' pass ' the test , it seems to be otherwise pretty accurate . )

The government has the legal authority to prosecute journalists for publishing classified information , Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said yesterday .
" There are some statutes on the book which , if you read the language carefully , would seem to indicate that that is a possibility , " Mr. Gonzales said on the ABC News program " This Week . "
" That 's a policy judgment by the Congress in passing that kind of legislation , " he continued .
" We have an obligation to enforce those laws .
We have an obligation to ensure that our national security is protected . "
Asked whether he was open to the possibility that The New York Times should be prosecuted for its disclosures in December concerning a National Security Agency surveillance program , Mr. Gonzales said his department was trying to determine " the appropriate course of action in that particular case .

There are some things that become so ubiquitous and familiar to us – so seemingly obvious – that we forget that they actually had to be invented .
Here ’s a case in point – the weblog post ’s permalink .
I mean – let ’s think about it .
The problem was that a weblog ’s front page is by far its most visited page .
This is the page where everyone actually sees your content ( or at least it was until the creation of RSS feeds ) .
But it ’s not possible for someone to effectively bookmark or link to that particular entry on that page , because shortly it will scroll off the bottom .
Added to that , bookmarks operate at the level of pages , not posts .
So how do you handle that ?
How can you make it possible for people to link to something with a higher level of granularity than just the page ?
Moreover , how can you get them to link to something that ’s not actually on the page you ’re looking at ?

In the post , he referred to them just as “ permanent links ” – I believe it was Matt Haughey who coined the term ‘ permalink ’ , but I could be wrong .
I ’ve researched both their sites , but I ’ve found little commentary about them …
When permalinks first emerged , I was highly dismissive of them .
I felt really uncomfortable with how hacky they seemed .
Late - 1999 / early - 2000 was quite a creative time for people making weblog - related toys and paraphenalia .
The concept of the permalink had all the signs of being equally useless and badly thought - through .
For a start , it required yet more clutter on the weblog - page .
The designer in me railed against them .
But more than that , they seemed to be a kind of weird abomination – a sin against what links were there to do .
Clicking on a permalink did n’t take you anywhere , you just ended up roughly where you were before , only in a more stable form .
Sometimes ( assuming you were already inside a site ’s archives ) clicking on a permalink would even take you to the same place on the same page you were before .
At the time I honestly did n’t believe that they ’d take off – that anyone would use them .
But of course they did …
But why did it take off ?
What was so important about the permalink ?
It may seem like a trivial piece of functionality now , but it was effectively the device that turned weblogs from an ease - of - publishing phenomenon into a conversational mess of overlapping communities .
For the first time it became relatively easy to gesture directly at a highly specific post on someone else ’s site and talk about it .
Discussion emerged .
Chat emerged .
And – as a result – friendships emerged or became more entrenched .
The permalink was the first – and most successful – attempt to build bridges between weblogs .
It existed way before Trackback and I think it ’s been more fundamental to our development as a culture than comments …
Not only that , it added history to weblogs as well – before you ’d link to a site ’s front page if you wanted to reference something they were talking about – that link would become worthless within days , but that did n’t matter because your own content was equally disposable .
The creation of the permalink built - in memory – links that worked and remained consistent over time , conversations that could be archived and retraced later .
The permalink stopped all weblog conversations being like that guy in Memento …
And yet no one seems to remember much about their creation .
At the time they were a tiny paradigm shift in a tiny community of committed web - weirdos .
No one thought that they might be one of the fundamental structuring principles of half a million sites .
And so no one ’s really written about them .
No one ’s really researched their creation .
And no one ’s given Paul Bausch and the Blogger crew the mad props they deserve .
It ’s probably time we did something about that …

* Between 1946 and 1971 , the Chinese seat on the Security Council was occupied by the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) , which used the veto only once ( to block Mongolia 's application for membership in 1955 ) .
The first veto exercised by the present occupant , the People 's Republic of China , was therefore not until 25 August 1972 .
1 ) Only a minority of vetoes have been cast in cases where vital international security issues were at stake .
59 vetoes have been cast to block admission of member states .
Additionally , 43 vetoes have been used to block nominees for Secretary General , although these vetoes were cast during closed sessions of the Council and are not included in the table above .
Limitation of veto use to Chapter VII ( threats to international peace and security ) , as many members propose , would be a long step towards total veto abolition .

New - car smell is going away :
It 's no good for you By Hans Greimel , Associated Press TOKYO 
Anyone who 's pulled away from the dealer 's lot in a shiny , new car knows the seductive scent of fresh plastic , paint and upholstery that evokes a rush of pride and consumer satisfaction .
But that unmistakable new - car smell may soon be heading the way of the rumble seat :
Recent research linking it to a toxic cocktail of harmful chemicals is spurring efforts by Japanese automakers to tone down the fumes .
Japanese manufacturers have become the first to set an industrywide goal of reducing cabin concentrations to within government guidelines .
The push could spur similar action by U.S. and European rivals , making interior air quality an emerging auto safety issue .
" The industry in Japan as a whole has recognized the need for this and is coordinating efforts , " Toyota spokesman Paul Nolasco said .
" Cutting down on the things that lead to these smells is only something that can be better for you . "
The new - car smell emanates largely from chemicals known as volatile organic compounds , or VOCs , that leach from glues , paints , vinyls and plastics in the passenger compartment .
The fumes can trigger headaches , sore throats , nausea and drowsiness .
Prolonged exposure to some of the chemicals can lead to cancer , though there 's no evidence linking that to concentrations in cars .
Critics liken the problem to so - called sick - building syndrome , which traces some illnesses to similar agents seeping from walls , carpet and fixtures of new buildings .
Just sitting in a new car can subject riders to toxic emissions several times the limits deemed safe for homes or offices by some health authorities , though the problem tends to dissipate after about six months , according to a 2001 study by Australia 's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization .
" We find new car interiors have much higher VOC levels than any building we 've researched , " research leader Steve Brown said .
" Ultimately , what we need are cars with interior materials that produce lower emissions . "
Japanese automakers are now trying to do just that .
Earlier this year , they agreed to cut cabin levels of 13 of the compounds , including possible cancer - causing agents styrene and formaldehyde , by 2007 to match Japanese Health Ministry guidelines for air quality in homes .
The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association initiated the drive after tests found some models made by three of the nation 's top carmakers failed to meet government recommendations .
The industry group refused to identify which companies or models were evaluated .
Automakers worldwide have been trying to reduce volatile organic compounds for years .
But the Japanese effort marks the first time the industry has adopted government guidelines , JAMA 's Tatsuya Ota said .
Most of Japan 's top five makers — Toyota , Nissan , Honda , Mitsubishi and Mazda — are already rolling out cars in compliance and touting the lower volatile organic compound levels as a key selling point , a move that is likely to catch on globally .
" There is good potential for the Japanese to take the lead in this field , " said Koji Endo , an auto analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo .
" People are starting to feel that VOCs are an issue , and the new efforts are one advantage that they ( Japanese manufacturers ) can claim . "
Brown says he does not know of any government with volatile organic compound guidelines for car interiors , but says matching building levels is a good start .
Japan 's recommendations were adopted in 2002 to combat sick - building syndrome .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets no guidelines for volatile organic compounds in non-industrial settings , though formaldehyde is regulated as a carcinogen by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration .
The Washington - based Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , which represents nine carmakers including General Motors , Ford and DaimlerChrysler , says it does not follow the issue of volatile organic compounds .
Daimler Chrysler said it has no initiatives on the volatile organic compound - induced new - car fumes .
Toyota , Japan 's largest automaker , currently has six models on the road that meet the new standards , while Nissan has four .
Honda 's new Civic , unveiled this month , is that company 's first , while Mitsubishi will begin its lineup with the " i " next year .
All say they are on track to have all new models pass muster beginning in 2007 .
While some customers complain about the new - car smell , others cherish it enough to have spawned a cottage industry in aerosol " new - car sprays " to keep their rides smelling fresh from the factory .
" Some people are annoyed by the smell and some people love it , " Honda spokesman Takayuki Fuji said .
" This is not just for Honda users , but for all users . "

Brain 's rewind function argues for taking a break .
Resting rats run instant replays of their memories .
© Getty
Idlers , loafers and layabouts , listen up .
A new study suggests that the times when we sit around twiddling our thumbs could in fact be vital for learning .
The idea stems from experiments in which neuroscientists eavesdropped on the brains of rats as they explored their environments .
They found that the rats ' brains ' replay ' their experiences in reverse when the animals pause briefly to rest .
The scientists , David Foster and Matthew Wilson working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge , inserted a pincushion of fine wires into the animals ' skulls .
These allowed the team to simultaneously monitor the electrical activity of around 100 individual brain cells in the hippocampus , a brain region involved in learning and memory .
The researchers placed each wired - up rat in a straight 1.5 - metre run .
They recorded brain - cell activity as the rats scurried up and down , pausing at each end to eat , groom and scratch their whiskers .
As the rats ran along the track , the nerve cells fired in a very specific sequence .
This is not surprising , because certain cells in this region are known to be triggered when an animal passes through a particular spot in a space .
But the researchers were taken aback by what they saw when the rats were resting .
Then , the same brain cells replayed the sequence of electrical firing over and over , but in reverse and speeded up .
" It 's absolutely original ; no one has ever seen this before at all , " says Edvard Moser , who studies memory at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim .
This instant replay could help the animals to learn about a recent place and what parts of it are most important , the investigators propose .
The rerun could coincide with a burst of the reward chemical dopamine , which is released in the brain when the animal finds food .
By playing the pattern of activity backwards , those brain cells nearest the food fire first and at the same time as the dopamine signal .
The idea is that this might etch the position of the food into the rats ' brains .
" It 's saying , ' this is the place I want to be ' , " says Foster .
Time out
If this idea proves true in people , it could have many implications for human learning .
It suggests that those idle times , perhaps spent gazing into space , are actually crucial for our brains to replay , and learn from , recent experiences .
The discovery could also help to explain why people tend to learn a new task quicker when they take short rests between each practice round .
It suggests that eliminating such breaks could actually interfere with learning , and perhaps even explain why hyperactive children often have learning difficulties .

Wilson and his colleagues showed in earlier experiments that rats also replay firing patterns in their sleep , but in the same , forward - running order in which they were experienced .
This process could help to firm up memories after the fact , Foster says .
The result is also of keen interest to those who study artificial intelligence and try to teach computer systems or robots to learn through reward and punishment .
Some such systems already work by playing back a sequence of moves so that the computer can identify at which point it made the trial or error .
" It 's remarkable how it squares up with what we expected , " says computational neuroscientist Read Montague at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , Texas .

Top Ten Myths about Iraq in 2005
Iraq has unfortunately become a football in the rough and ready , two - party American political arena , generating large numbers of sound bites and so much spin you could clothe all of China in the resulting threads .
Here are what I think are the top ten myths about Iraq , that one sees in print or on television in the United States .
1 . The guerrilla war is being waged only in four provinces .
This canard is trotted out by everyone from think tank flacks to US generals , and it is shameful .
Iraq has 18 provinces , but some of them are lightly populated .
The most populous province is Baghdad , which has some 6 million residents , or nearly one - fourth of the entire population of the country .
It also contains the capital .
It is one of the four being mentioned !.
Another of the four , Ninevah province , has a population of some 1.8 million and contains Mosul , a city of over a million and the country ’s third largest !
It is not clear what other two provinces are being referred to , but they are probably Salahuddin and Anbar provinces , other big centers of guerrilla activity , bringing the total for the “ only four provinces ” to something like 10 million of Iraq ’s 26 million people .
But the “ four provinces ” allegation is misleading on another level .
It is simply false .
Guerrilla attacks occur routinely beyond the confines of Anbar , Salahuddin , Ninevah and Baghdad .
Diyala province is a big center of the guerrilla movement and has witnessed thousands of deaths in the ongoing unconventional war .
Babil province just south of Baghdad is a major center of back alley warfare between Sunnis and Shiites and attacks on Coalition troops .
Attacks , assassinations and bombings are routine in Kirkuk province in the north , a volatile mixture of Kurds , Turkmen and Arabs engaged in a subterranean battle for dominance of the area ’s oil fields .
So that is 7 provinces , and certainly half the population of the country lives in these 7 , which are daily affected by the ongoing violence .
It is true that violence is rare in the 3 northern provinces of the Kurdistan confederacy .
And the Shiite south is much less violent than the 7 provinces of the center - north , on a good day .
But some of this calm in the south is an illusion deriving from poor on the ground reporting .
It appears to be the case that British troops are engaged in an ongoing struggle with guerrilla forces of the Marsh Arabs in Maysan Province .
Even calm is not always a good sign .
The southern port city of Basra appears to come by its via a reign of terror by Shiite religious militias .
2. Iraqi Sunnis voting in the December 15 election is a sign that they are being drawn into the political process and might give up the armed insurgency
So far Iraqi Sunni parties are rejecting the outcome of the election and threatening to boycott parliament .
Some 20,000 of them demonstrated all over the center - north last Friday against what they saw as fraudulent elections .
So , they have n’t been drawn into the political process in any meaningful sense .
And even if they were , it would not prevent them from pursuing a two - track policy of both political representation and guerrilla war .
The two - track approach is common among insurgencies , from Northern Ireland ’s IRA to Palestine ’s Hamas .
3 . The guerrillas are winning the war against US forces .
The guerrillas are really no more than mosquitos to US forces .
The casualties they have inflicted on the US military , of over 2000 dead and some 15,000 wounded , are deeply regrettable and no one should make light of them .
But this level of insurgency could never defeat the US military in the field .
4. Iraqis are grateful for the US presence and want US forces there to help them build their country .
Opinion polls show that between 66 % and 80 % of Iraqis want the US out of Iraq on a short timetable .
Already in the last parliament , some 120 parliamentarians out of 275 supported a resolution demanding a timetable for US withdrawal , and that sentiment will be much stronger in the newly elected parliament .
5. Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , born in Iran in 1930 , is close to the Iranian regime in Tehran Sistani , the spiritual leader of Iraq ’s majority Shiite community , is an almost lifetime expatriate .
He came to Iraq late in 1951 , and is far more Iraqi than Arnold Schwarzenegger is Californian .
Sistani was a disciple of Grand Ayatollah Burujirdi in Iran , who argued against clerical involvement in day to day politics .
Sistani rejects Khomeinism , and would be in jail if he were living in Iran , as a result .
He has been implicitly critical of Iran ’s poor human rights record , and has himself spoken eloquently in favor of democracy and pluralism .
Ma’d Fayyad reported in Al - Sharq al - Awsat in August of 2004 that when Sistani had heart problems , an Iranian representative in Najaf visited him .
He offered Sistani the best health care Tehran hospitals could provide , and asked if he could do anything for the grand ayatollah .
Sistani is said to have responded that what Iran could do for Iraq was to avoid intervening in its internal affairs .
And then Sistani flew off to London for his operation , an obvious slap in the face to Iran ’s Supreme Jurisprudent Ali Khamenei .
6 . There is a silent majority of middle class , secular - minded Iraqis who reject religious fundamentalism .
Two major elections have been held .
For all their flaws ( lack of security , anonymity of most candidates , constraints on campaigning ) , they certainly are weather vanes of the political mood of most of the country .
While the Kurdistan Alliance is largely secular , the Arab Iraqis have turned decisively toward religious fundamentalist parties .
The United Iraqi Alliance ( Shiite fundamentalists ) and the Iraqi Accord Front ( Sunni fundamentalists ) are the big winners of the most recent election .
Iyad Allawi ’s secular Iraqiya list got only 14.5 percent of the seats on Jan. 30 , and will shrink to half that , most likely , in this most recent election .
A clear majority of Iraqis , and the vast majority of the Arab Iraqis , are constructing new , fluid political identities that depend heavily on religious and ethnic sub-nationalisms .
7 . The new Iraqi constitution is a victory for Western , liberal values in the Middle East .
The constitution made Islam the religion of state .
It stipulates that the civil parliament may pass no legislation that contradicts the established laws of Islam .
It looks forward to clerics serving on court benches .
It allows individuals to opt out of secular , civil personal status laws ( for marriage , divorce , alimony , inheritance ) and to choose relgious canon law instead .
Islamic law gives girls , e.g. , only half the amount of inheritance received by their brothers .
Instead of a federal government , the constitution establishes a loose supervisory role for Baghdad and devolves most powers , including claims on future oil finds , on provinces and provincial confederacies , such that it is difficult to see how the country will be able to hold together .
8. Iraq is already in a civil war , so it does not matter if the US simply withdraws precipitately , since the situation is as bad as it can get .
No , it is n’t .
During the course of the guerrilla war , the daily number of dead has fluctuated , between about 20 and about 60 .
But in a real civil war , it could easily be 10 times that .
Some estimates of the number of Afghans killed during their long set of civil wars put the number at 2.5 million , along with 5 million displaced abroad and more millions displaced internally .
Iraq is Malibu Beach compared to Afghanistan in its darkest hours .
The US has a responsibility to get out of Iraq responsibly and to not allow it to fall into that kind of genocidal civil conflict .
9 . The US can buy off the Iraqis now supporting guerrilla action against US troops .
US military and civilian officials in Iraq have on numerous occasions alleged in the press or privately to me that a vast infusion of billions of dollars from the US would dampen down the guerrilla insurgency .
In fact , it seems clear that far more Sunni Arabs support the guerrilla movement today than supported it in September of 2004 , and more supported it in September of 2004 than had in September of 2003 .
AP reports that the US has spent $ 100 million on reconstruction projects in Diyala Province .
These community development and infrastructural improvements , often carried out by US troops in conditions of danger , are most praiseworthy .
But Diyala is a mess politically and a major center of guerrilla activity ( see below ) , which simply could not be pursued on this scale without substantial local popular support .
The Sunni Arab parties , which demand US withdrawal and reject the results of the Dec. 15 elections , carried the province , winning 6 seats .
The guerrillas are to some important extent driven by local nationalism and rejection of foreign occupation , as well as resentment at the marginalization of the Sunni Arab community in the new Iraq .
They have a keen sense of national honor , and there is no evidence that they can be bribed into laying down their arms , or that the general populace can be bribed on any significant scale into turning the guerrillas in to the US .
Attributing motives of honor to one ’s own side and crass economic interests to one ’s opponent is a common ploy of political propaganda , but we should be careful about believing our own spin .
Even a simple economic calculation would favor the guerrillas fighting on , however .
If they could get back in control of Iraq through a coup , they ’d have $ 50 billion a year in oil revenues to play with .
The total US reconstruction aid promised to Iraq is only $ 18 billion , and much of that will be spent on security – i.e. it wo n’t benefit most Iraqis .
10 . The Bush administration wanted free elections in Iraq .
This allegation is simply not true , as I and others pointed out last January .
I said then , and it is still true :
‘ Moreover , as Swopa rightly reminds us all , the Bush administration opposed one - person , one - vote elections of this sort .
First they were going to turn Iraq over to Chalabi within six months .
Then Bremer was going to be MacArthur in Baghdad for years .
Then on November 15 , 2003 , Bremer announced a plan to have council - based elections in May of 2004 .
The US and the UK had somehow massaged into being provincial and municipal governing councils , the members of which were pro-American .
Bremer was going to restrict the electorate to this small , elite group .
Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani immediately gave a fatwa denouncing this plan and demanding free elections mandated by a UN Security Council resolution .
Bush was reportedly “ extremely offended ” at these two demands and opposed Sistani .
Bremer got his appointed Interim Governing Council to go along in fighting Sistani .
Sistani then brought thousands of protesters into the streets in January of 2004 , demanding free elections .
Soon thereafter , Bush caved and gave the ayatollah everything he demanded .
Except that he was apparently afraid that open , non-manipulated elections in Iraq might become a factor in the US presidential campaign , so he got the elections postponed to January 2005 .
This enormous delay allowed the country to fall into much worse chaos , and Sistani is still bitter that the Americans did n’t hold the elections last May .
The US objected that they could n’t use UN food ration cards for registration , as Sistani suggested .
But in the end that is exactly what they did . ‘
Iraq ’s situation is extremely complex .
It is not a black and white poster for an American political party .
Good things and bad things are happening there .
The American public cannot help make good policy , however , unless the myths are first dispelled .
" We sent him out there to get away from this horrible life , " Christopher 's father , Errol Rose , said yesterday .
" All these years -- seven and a half years -- I 've been back and forth from Pennsylvania with this boy .
He did n't last too long before they rubbed him out . "
Christopher and his friends were on their way to the Port Authority Bus Terminal to catch a bus back to Pennsylvania on Saturday when they were attacked .
Usually , someone would drive him to the subway or take him to the bus terminal , Mr. Rose said .
But since he and his wife were attending a wedding , Mr. Rose said he gave Christopher permission to head back on his own .
It was one of the few times the Roses had allowed Christopher to walk around the neighborhood alone .
Just before Christopher left his family 's home , his father called to give him clear instructions .
Mr. Rose said that Christopher and three friends -- had planned to take the subway to the bus terminal , where they would catch a bus to Pennsylvania , arriving in time to watch a fireworks display .
Traveling with Christopher were Kenneth and two brothers , Richard , 15 , and Jonathan , 11 , whose mother asked that their last name be withheld .
" Do n't talk to strangers ; if you need to talk to anybody , talk to someone in uniform , " Mr. Rose recalled saying .
He called Christopher back to emphasize his point .
" Did you hear what I said ? " he asked .
Christopher was stabbed to death just a few minutes later on 40th Street near Avenue D , a block and a half from his home .
Several teenagers approached Christopher and his three friends just after they began walking on Avenue D. Richard was showing Kenneth his iPod when one of the older boys approached them and demanded it , Kenneth said .
Richard handed the iPod to Jonathan before turning back toward the Rose home .
Several teenagers in another group , some riding bikes , began approaching them .
" There were like 15 or 20 of them , and there were more coming , " Kenneth said yesterday .
He spoke in front of the Rose family home with his back facing the news cameras , hiding his swollen and bruised right eye .
" We were trying to get away . "
Salim Ahmed Hamdan never planted a bomb , never took a hostage , never wielded a box cutter , never fired a weapon in anger , and never planned an attack of any kind .
What he is alleged to have done , according to his US military commission charge sheet , is work as Osama bin Laden 's driver in Afghanistan .
So how could military prosecutors at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , charge him with being a terrorist and war criminal ?
The answer boils down to a single word : conspiracy .
The same legal approach that helped put mafia dons , capos , and associates behind bars in America is at the center of US military efforts to prosecute suspected Al Qaeda members for war crimes .
But now in the wake of the US Supreme Court 's decision in the Hamdan case invalidating the military commission process , it is unclear to what extent military prosecutors can continue to use conspiracy as a war crimes charge .
The Bush administration is asking Congress to simply pass a law recognizing conspiracy as a war crime .
But some legal experts warn that the law of war is a reflection of both domestic and international standards that should not be watered down unilaterally by US lawmakers .
They say such a move would further undermine US standing as a champion of human rights and set the stage for another major defeat in the courts for President Bush .
" This is just contempt for the court 's opinion , " says George Fletcher , a professor at Columbia Law School who authored a friend of the court brief in the Hamdan case that first raised the conspiracy issue .
" If Congress says we can go around it , that is just crazy .
They do n't understand what they are doing . "
In its June opinion , a five - member majority of justices struck down the military commissions at Guantánamo because they did not comply with the requirements of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions .
That part of the decision addressed what the high court viewed as fatal procedural defects – including a rule allowing the exclusion of a defendant from parts of his own trial .
Congress is now considering how best to rewrite those procedures to strike the proper balance between a fair trial and safeguarding national security .
But there is another part to the Hamdan decision .
Four of the eight justices participating in the case ruled that the military commissions at Guantánamo did not have jurisdiction under the law of war to prosecute suspected Al Qaeda members for allegedly engaging in a conspiracy .
Conspiracy is not a war crime , said Justice John Paul Stevens in his plurality decision .
And special military commissions can only try war crimes , he said .
Conspiracy charges for 10
The ruling is significant because all 10 detainees at Guantánamo slated for military commission trials have been charged with conspiracy , and seven of them ( including Mr. Hamdan ) face only a single conspiracy charge .
According to the Stevens plurality , military prosecutors must base their cases on actual war atrocities or attempted atrocities , not merely on a criminal agreement ( conspiracy ) to violate war crimes .
Legal experts say this significantly increases the burden military prosecutors would face to win convictions at trial , and some say it could make it impossible to convict defendants like Hamdan .
Justice Anthony Kennedy provided the decisive fifth vote striking down Guantánamo commission procedures in the Hamdan decision .
But he declined to provide a fifth vote on the jurisdictional question involving conspiracy .
Instead , he left the matter to the legislative branch .
" In light of the conclusion that the military commissions at issue are unauthorized , Congress may choose to provide further guidance in this area , " Justice Kennedy wrote in his concurrence .
" Congress , not the court , is the branch in the better position to undertake the sensitive task of establishing a principle not inconsistent with the national interest or international justice . "
Analysts say it is unclear how Kennedy might vote in a future case .
" What does Kennedy think about this ?
We 'll be asking that a lot , " says Diane Amann , a law of war expert at the University of California , Davis , School of Law .
But she adds , " The fact that Kennedy held back – if I were the government I would not take comfort in that fact . "
In a dissenting opinion in the Hamdan case , Justices Clarence Thomas , Antonin Scalia , and Samuel Alito said the law of war is flexible enough to permit military commissions to hear conspiracy cases .
" The plurality 's inflexible approach has dangerous implications for the Executive 's ability to discharge his duties as Commander in Chief in future cases , " Justice Thomas wrote .
The Bush administration agrees with Thomas 's expansive view of presidential power .
" We believe that the dissenting opinion in Hamdan was correct in its analysis and that the plurality 's view on this particular question is not sustainable , " Acting Assistant Attorney General Steven Bradbury told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Aug .
2 .
In the same hearing , Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D ) of California asked the top legal officials for each of the four armed services whether Congress should designate conspiracy as a war crime for use in military commission trials at Guantánamo .
Three said yes , one said he would prefer a charge of providing material support to terrorists .
" If the Congress is just going to try to add conspiracy onto the existing military commissions , that could be problematic , " says Michael Scharf , director of the Frederick K. Cox International Law Center at Case Western Reserve University School of Law .
" I think they are better off leaving conspiracy out of it . "
Professor Scharf and other international law experts say that while conspiracy charges are an accepted part of the legal system in the United States and Britain , that legal approach has been rejected by most other countries – including international war - crimes tribunals .
Full rights for mafia , not detainees
In addition , analysts say that when federal prosecutors used conspiracy charges to help convict organized crime figures in the US , the alleged mafia members were afforded all the legal protections of the US court system .
In contrast , military commissions do n't provide the same range of trial protections .
One alternative to conspiracy , analysts say , is to charge suspects with a form of aiding and abetting .
That would bring the military commission process within international standards .
But it would also make it harder for prosecutors .
" From a prosecutorial standpoint , prosecuting someone for aiding and abetting requires a heck of a lot more proof than prosecuting them for conspiracy , " says Professor Amann .
Military prosecutors may not have enough evidence to win an aiding and abetting case , she says .
Scharf says military prosecutors still might win convictions .
" My hunch is that everybody they are interested in trying , they can get for either committing the crime [ a specific atrocity ] or aiding and abetting .
They do n't really need the conspiracy , " he says .
The bottom line , these analysts say , is that conspiracy charges would make it much easier to win convictions , but in the eyes of most of the world such trials would be viewed with suspicion and distrust rather than as beacons of international justice .
" Most people around the world look at the Hamdan decision as a return to the rule of law , " Professor Fletcher says .
" If Congress defies the Supreme Court and says : ' No , we think we can get around this , ' it will hurt the country enormously . "

As our tech issues have continued , we 'll continue adding posts on Thursday and Friday as well . )
Let the free exchange of thoughts and ideas begin ...
Thursday 's Additions :
It 's back to school time over at Thespis Journal .
In a reflexive post , Thespis takes a look at some of the problems confronting public school educators today
and proposes some solutions
.
D - Ed Reckoning notes that standardized test scores have been going up recently .
But why ?
Is it due to The No Child Left Behind Law or is there another reason ?
Will the trend continue ?
And is there an " I.Q Achievement Gap " in our kids ' future ?
Reckoning College student Margaret Paynich links to ( and comments upon ) a piece by Julia Steiny that posits an interesting idea : " Do adults who ask the right questions help teens make the right choices ? "
There 's some Food for thought there ...

EduPolicy :
The title of this week 's submission from The Colossus of Rhodey says it all :
Cali law :
No teaching of anything " negative . "
The field of education research continues to be hotly debated throughout the EduSphere .
When it comes to teaching and learning in the k - 12 classroom , how should it be done ?
Over at HUNBlog , they take a look at the issue
and present their case
.
Here 's a sample :
Paradigms for education must be found that take social inequities into consideration .
( Granted , whereas I agree that this approach too often leads to negative results due to a lowering of expectations , it does not need to .
With the discipline to hold all students to the same standards while at the same time recognizing the additional needs of challenged students , we should be able to identify ways to provide the additional help needed to succeed . )
In California , voters said " no " recently to Universal Preschool .
But over in Massachusetts , the battle is heating up over whether or not the state can mandate pre-kindergarten classes for all .

We liked what we read
when RedKudu said
,
Teachers are never fully prepared for what they will encounter in the classroom .
There are not enough student - teaching hours in a lifetime to ready one for the constant daily exposure to a clientele so reluctant and resistant as a student .
The daunting arrival of new initiatives for education , poorly supported by equal financial enthusiasm , make public school teaching in this day and age a strange , almost apocalyptic landscape , the survivors of which are those who learn how to dumpster dive for useful left - overs , convince students to keep the caps on markers so they do n't dry out , and turn a sheet of black poster paper into a working chalkboard .

This is corewar .

The ultimate source for any information regarding corewar , a programming game where small programs fight each other in the core memory of a virtual computer .
The researchers monitored activity in the brain
Teams at University College London and University of California in LA could tell what images people were looking at or what sounds they were listening to .
The US team say their study proves brain scans do relate to brain cell electrical activity .
The UK team say such research might help paralysed people communicate , using a " thought - reading " computer .
We are still a long way off from developing a universal mind - reading machine
Dr John - Dylan Haynes , University College London
In their Current Biology study , funded by the Wellcome Trust , people were shown two different images at the same time - a red stripy pattern in front of the right eye and a blue stripy pattern in front of the left .
The volunteers wore special goggles which meant each eye saw only what was put in front of it .
In that situation , the brain then switches awareness between both images , sometimes seeing one image and sometimes the other .
While people 's attention switched between the two images , the researchers used fMRI ( functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) brain scanning to monitor activity in the visual cortex .
It was found that focusing on the red or the blue patterns led to specific , and noticeably different , patterns of brain activity .
The fMRI scans could reliably be used to predict which of the images the volunteer was looking at , the researchers found .
Thought - provoking ?
The US study , published in Science , took the same theory and applied it to a more everyday example .
They used electrodes placed inside the skull to monitor the responses of brain cells in the auditory cortex of two surgical patients as they watched a clip of " The Good , the Bad and the Ugly " .
They used this data to accurately predict the fMRI signals from the brains of another 11 healthy patients who watched the clip while lying in a scanner .
Professor Itzhak Fried , the neurosurgeon who led the research , said : " We were able to tell one part of a scene from another , and we could tell one type of sound from another . "
Dr John - Dylan Haynes of the UCL Institute of Neurology , who led the research , told the BBC News website : " What we need to do now is create something like speech - recognition software , and look at which parts of the brain are specifically active in a person . "
He said the study 's findings proved the principle that fMRI scans could " read thoughts " , but he said it was a very long way from creating a machine which could read anyone 's mind .
But Dr Haynes said : " We could tell from a very limited subset of possible things the person is possibly seeing . "
" One day , someone will come up with a machine in a baseball cap .
" Then it really could be helpful in everyday applications . "
He added : " Our study represents an important but very early stage step towards eventually building a machine that can track a person 's consciousness on a second - by - second basis .
" These findings could be used to help develop or improve devices that help paralyzed people communicate through measurements of their brain activity .
But he stressed : " We are still a long way off from developing a universal mind - reading machine . "
Dr Fried said : " It has been known that different areas of the temporal lobe are activated by faces , or houses .
" This UCL finding means it is not necessary to use strikingly different stimuli to tell what is activating areas of the brain . "
Is Your Printer Spying On You ?
Imagine that every time you printed a document it automatically included a secret code that could be used to identify the printer - and potentially the person who used it .
Sounds like something from an episode of " Alias " right ?
Unfortunately the scenario is n't fictional .
In a purported effort to identify counterfeiters the US government has succeeded in persuading some color laser printer manufacturers to encode each page with identifying information .
That means that without your knowledge or consent an act you assume is private could become public .
A communication tool you 're using in everyday life could become a tool for government surveillance .
And what 's worse there are no laws to prevent abuse .

The ACLU recently issued a report revealing that the FBI has amassed more than 1 100 pages of documents on the organization since 2001 as well as documents concerning other non-violent groups including Greenpeace and United for Peace and Justice .
In the current political climate it's not hard to imagine the government using the ability to determine who may have printed what document for purposes other than identifying counterfeiters .
Yet there are no laws to stop the Secret Service from using printer codes to secretly trace the origin of non-currency documents ; only the privacy policy of your printer manufacturer currently protects you ( if indeed such a policy exists ) .
And no law regulates what sort of documents the Secret Service or any other domestic or foreign government agency is permitted to request for identification not to mention how such a forensics tool could be developed and implemented in printers in the first place .
With no laws on the books there 's nothing to stop the privacy violations this technology enables .
For this reason EFF is gathering information about what printers are revealing and how - a necessary precursor to any legal challenge or new legislation to protect your privacy .
And we could use your help .
In the preliminary research paper linked below we explain what we 've observed so far briefly explore the privacy implications and ask you to print and send us test sheets from your color laser printer and / or a color laser printer at your local print shop .
That way we can watch the watchers and ensure that your privacy is n't compromised in ways that harm your fundamental constitutional rights .
In addition to documenting what printers are revealing EFF has filed a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request and we will keep you updated on what we discover .
In the meantime we urge you to participate and pass the word along about this research project .
Thank you for your support !
Wikipedia is fast becoming the number - one online resource for web surfers hungry for context about breaking news , in what must be a sad comment on the ability for traditional news media to keep its audiences well - informed .
Wikipedia , the online encyclopedia assembled in realtime , has reportedly experienced a 154 per cent hike in traffic during the last year , according to internet traffic watchers at Hitwise .
The Wiki - fiddlers ' big - book o' facts appears to be benefiting from a happy coincidence of a lot of big - headline news combined with the apparent inability of so - called traditional news channels - both online and off - line - to satiate surfers ' need for reference material .
A high ranking in Google , boosted by the replication of the Wikipedia material , has n't harmed the project either .
Wikipedia attracted 22.3 per cent of users searching for information about the Gaza Strip as Israeli troops closed down settlements and withdrew from the region .
Wikipedia 's market share numbers meant it drew five times more traffic than Google News , Yahoo News or the BBC and tied with CIA World Factbook for information on the strip .
Wikipedia tied as the second most visited site among US web users eager for details about Pope Benedict XVI , Pope John Paul II 's successor .
The top destination was Newadvent.org , the old - school Catholic encyclopedia that has resisted the temptation to go Wikipedia - style .
The service has also eclipsed Dictionary.com is the internet 's number - one reference site .
Hitwise failed to make more information on Wikipedia traffic , specifically the number of page views , publically available . ®
Media in the age of the swarm
by Clive Thompson
Here 's the bad news :
The bestseller is dying .
Here 's the good news :
The bestseller is dying .
Let me unpack that a bit .
Recently , a study found that the amount of time the average bestseller spends on the charts has been eroding steadily , for decades .
Back in the 1960s , only three books on average each year hit the # 1 spot on the New York Times bestseller list - and they stayed there for 21 weeks .
In the last five years , things have been much more democratic ; over 18 books a year become # 1 bestsellers .
But they remain there for only three weeks .
No single book , it seems , can command the sort of broad and longstanding civic attention that " big " ideas used to regularly enjoy .
This is the sort of finding that tends to terrify journalists :
If the nation can't focus on one single issue at time , how can writers make an impact ?
But it turns out things are n't quite so dire - once you understand what 's really going on .
It is n't merely that the bestseller is struggling .
It 's that the nature of popularity itself is changing - the nature of society 's attention span , as it were .
And this has deep implications for the future of all types of journalism .
The changes are driven by today 's 500 - channel universe - and its ferocious stepchild , the internet .
The internet has radically changed the way we find out about things , and how we decide they 're important .
We 're living in a world where the sheer volume of public speech is expanding exponentially .
In our parents ' days , books and TV shows and radio shows were scarce .
The problem our parents faced was simply getting access to these precious , rare blasts of culture and ideas .
Now the internet has opened the floodgates , drenching the world in a zillion witty bloggers , searing podcasters , instant pundits , and hipsters recording skatepunk video clips on their mobile phones .
The audience 's problem has become precisely the reverse : information overload .
This is why blogs and " social " technologies have had such a catalytic impact on media .
Bloggers and MySpacers are our filters .
They sift through the daily torrent of stuff , then shear off the coolest material and bring it to us .
They are the TiVo for our 500 - channel mediasphere .
The same goes for search tools like Google , or blog - search engines like Technorati :
We love them because they tame the six - billion - page internet .
RSS - the tool for helping people scan hundreds of blogs quickly each day - became popular for the same reason .
These technologies are all fundamentally driven by word of mouth , and there 's nothing we trust more than word of mouth .
But while word of mouth is powerful , it 's also a tricky social force .
It does n't favour all things equally .
Word of mouth tends to produce " power law " effects - in which a small number of websites are granted massive , planet - wide star status , while the vast majority are ignored .
The same thing happens to news articles and broadcast segments every day .
The vast majority languish in obscurity .
But once one of them becomes slightly popular online , it instantly becomes massively so - as word of mouth quickly takes off like a brush fire , with each digital neighbour passing it along to her friends .
That 's why we see so many books and websites become famous for intense , short periods , often only a day or two at a time .
Remember the " Lazy Sunday " video ?
Or the " Hamster Dance " ?
They came out of nowhere , flared brilliantly , then vanished .
This winner - take - all effect is only going to become more and more pronounced as the internet matures , because new tools gives us more ways to reach out , tap each other on the shoulder , and say hey , check this out !
Mobile devices , which are becoming more and more video - and - internet equipped , will soon amplify this pass - around culture .
Social - networking sites like MySpace will become ever more a part of life .
What does this mean for journalism ?
It means that the newspapers and broadcasts and magazines that open themselves up - that make it easy for the audience to pass them around and share them - will thrive .
Those that close themselves off to the audience 's cut - and - paste culture will slowly die .
Want proof ?
Compare the Christian Science Monitor and The Wall Street Journal .
The Monitor has a hard copy circulation of barely 71,000 , a pale shadow of the Journal 's mammoth two million readers .
But online , the Monitor dominates :
It is proportionately 377 times more frequently linked - to than the Journal .
That means it enjoys proportionately far higher traffic , far higher online influence , and far more attention from search engines like Google .
How did the Monitor accrue this advantage ?
By being promiscuous .
The Monitor leaves all its stories permanently online for free , while the Journal locks its behind a pay - to - see wall .
Bloggers thus almost never link to Journal articles , while they love to link to Monitor articles .
Because it makes itself so amenable to blogging culture , the Monitor taps into pass - around culture and these rolling cascades of popularity .
( Granted , the Journal is undoubtedly assuming that what it loses in online audience it gains , financially , by having a more exclusive readership .
But that 's no way to influence the world , when the world now lives online .
And given the steady migration of advertising online , it may not even be the soundest financial ploy . )
So this is how journalists in the future will capture the protean attention - span of society :
They 'll make it easy for the online world to engage with them .
And , interestingly , they wo n't try and dictate what the most " important " stories are .
Indeed , they 'll have to relinquish the very idea that they have the cultural inside track - that they are the ones dictating the agenda of society 's attention span .
That 's because the internet has a way of figuring out what it finds most interesting - and half the time it 's never what we journalists would expect .
In the U.S. , Washington writers pretty much ignored a racist comment by Senator Trent Lott until political blogs began transcribing his words and passing them around online .
It turned into an enormous cultural conversation , and the mainstream media eventually started reporting on it .
In the end , Lott was so discredited that he resigned as Senate majority leader .
So here 's the future of journalism :
You show up at work having no idea whether the article or broadcast you 're working on will sink into total obscurity , or rocket into planet - wide notoriety .
What 's going to pop ?
That piece on insurance - rate gouging ?
Trucking garbage over the border ?
Inuit throat singers ?
One thing is sure :
The more promiscuous we make the news - the easier it is for the online audience to sample , pass around , cut up , remix - the more likely it 'll gain online currency .
It 'll also transform the practice of journalism itself .
Ask writers who blog regularly ( like me ) , and they 'll tell you how exciting it is to be wired in directly to your audience .
They correspond with you , pass you tips , correct your factual blunders , introduce you to brilliant new ideas and people .
The internet is n't just an audience :
It 's an auxiliary brain .
But you have to turn it on , and it takes work .
You can't fake participation and authenticity online .
So that 's a little road map to the immediate future .
But I can't take you any further than that .
That 's because the mediasphere today is driven by new online tools like blogs and RSS , and it 's virtually impossible to predict what new tools we 'll have in the future .
Go back 10 years - hell , go back three years - and no one predicted the enormous influence of Napster , instant messaging , blogging , the iPod , MySpace , or Amazon 's " people who bought this book also bought [ this book ] " suggestions .
The only thing I can predict is that things will change :
Some kid in her dorm room will invent a new way of sharing information online , and we 'll all scramble to get used to it .
So , yep - the bestseller is dead .
Our ability to dictate the national conversation is dead .
It 's now in the hands of the swarm intelligence of the internet .
Some will mourn this , many will complain about it , but I think we journalists are simply in a new and much more interesting place .
Now we 're part of the audience .
Do you share Clive Thompson ’s view of online media , blogs and the future ?

The game risk for the cards
A roast duck to eat before you start , three bottles of wine , one bottle of strange wheat beer , a large selection of different whiskies and some crazy luminous bacardi stuff .
Six hours with Zoe , Matt , Susan and me to wage war .
Vangelis ' soundtrack to 1492 because it 's great invading music .
The size difference between this and traditional Risk .
War
The game begins , Pete ( blue ) , Susan ( purple ) , Matt ( green ) and Zoe ( red ) .
Australia falls to Pete( blue ) in the first round .
The state of play after each player has had a turn , Susan ( purple ) has taken and held North and South America on her first go !
Matt ( green ) decides that attempting to hold Asia as a first continent is a losing strategy and commits his troops to conquering Australia , which he succeeds at .
After a shock defeat across the atlantic from Susan ( purple ) , Zoe retakes North Africa in a no nonsense fashion .
The africans invade Afghanistan from the Middle East only to discover the defending troops were expecting trouble from Europe .
In a shock feat of Naval engineering the North Africans boat a small army across the Atlantic and completely fail to conquer Brazil .
After having lost some of the fringes of America to the blue democrats , the crazy gun-toting purple necks exercise their right to the second amendment .
Four hours in , it 's looking like a fight between Matt ( green ) and Susan ( purple ) .
Some goes later Matt goes for broke and mounts a huge invasion of Africa ...
... handily eradicating all of Zoe 's red troops , he uses his remaining forces to finish off Pete 's blue ones .
This nets him a total of ten cards in his hand .
Susan mounts a peace keeping force across the atlantic to quell the African uprising ...
... but due to severe lack of knowledge about world geography outside America ends up conquering Australia instead .
Matt ( green ) , does a triple cash in for a bonus 30 troops , added to his twenty anyway and runs out of pieces , choosing to borrow Zoe's .
Deploying everything into Scandanvia he looks at Iceland .
Institutionalised racism immediately develops in his army and operation ' Get behind the Darkies ' ensues .
The view from Iceland .
Where are they going to stand ?
A quick trip through the whole of North America , South America , Africa and South - east Asia later , and the fourth conquest of Australia begins , to win the game .
If you can draw , you might end up with the much more beautiful and much larger version of Giant Risk done here .
Someone has to buy them both the croupier sticks and a dustpan and brush for the dead pieces though .

The web server software is running but no content has been added , yet .
Some 5.3 billion credit - card solicitations have been mailed this year , and it probably seems like half of them landed in your mailbox .
It 's a veritable fantasia of marketing gimmicks :
No late fees !
Free miles !
Elite cards !
All too often , this flimflam disguises how ill - suited the card in question is to a person with your plastic habits -- and how much that miscasting will cost you .
So MONEY spoke with industry experts , scoured the fine print on rates , fees and rewards , and finally zeroed in on seven outstanding cards .
Read on .
One of them is best - in - class for the kind of credit - card user you are .
( Rates quoted are variable unless otherwise noted , and widely available to average applicants . )
If You ( Usually ) Pay in Full BEST CHOICE American Express Clear CONTACT 888-917-3030 WHY
No annual fee ; one - month grace period APR 12.99 % ANNUAL FEE $ 0 WHAT TO LOOK FOR
If you pay your balance off every month with near - religious fervor , congratulations -- you 're already a winner in the credit - card game , whatever card you choose .
Plus , your virtue entitles you to more than one option :
You could go for a card that offers rewards in exchange for your loyalty .
( If so , see the pages that follow . )
But maybe you 're the type who does n't want to establish a relationship with a piece of plastic -- or devote even a minute to managing points and navigating the system for trading them in .
And you 'd rather not pay for what you wo n't use .
What you want , then , is a card that charges no annual fee and that gives you a long grace period before you 're hit with interest on late payments or a late fee is levied .
After all , even the best - intentioned can go astray for a week or two .
WHY THIS CARD Introduced in October , AmEx Clear has no annual fee and offers a one - month grace period , one of the longest in the industry .
It does offer a loyalty reward , a $ 25 gift card after you 've spent $ 2,500 , but you 'll get it automatically - - without submitting forms or tracking points .
If You Carry a Balance BEST CHOICE Pulaski Bank Visa Classic CONTACT 800-980-2265 WHY
Ultralow interest rate APR 6.99 % fixed ANNUAL FEE $ 35 WHAT TO LOOK FOR
If you 're among the 43 % of American cardholders who do n't pay their balance in full every month , you need to put one criterion ahead of all others : the interest rate .
Forget cards that offer rewards , which typically charge at least a percentage point more than comparable cards without givebacks ( or charge a hefty annual fee ) .
Anytime you pay interest on a rewards card , you lose the value of the reward .
The hitch is that cards with the very lowest rates are available only to those with pristine credit histories and credit scores of roughly 720 or higher .
So we picked two winners , one for those with sterling credit and another for more middling scorers .
In either case , keep in mind that rates change frequently , so check for the best deals at Bankrate.com and at local banks , which often beat top national cards , especially for their own customers .
WHY THIS CARD
The approval process for the Pulaski Bank Visa Classic is more stringent than for most major issuers .
Still , says Justin McHenry of IndexCreditCards.com , " a good number of people qualify . "
Its 6.99 % fixed rate is among the best available and comes with other friendly terms , such as a relatively mild penalty rate of 18 % that drops back to the regular rate as soon as your account is current , not after the more common six months .
All this justifies the annual fee of $ 35 .
If you do n't have near - perfect credit , the lowest rate available is through the " above - average credit " version of the Capital One Platinum MasterCard , which charges 8.9 % .
You should be able to sign on , the issuer says , if you have carried a loan or credit line for three years , have held a credit card with a limit of at least $ 5,000 and have not been late paying bills over the past six months .
One caveat :
You must sign up online , at capitalone.com .
If You Sometimes Pay Late BEST CHOICE Amalgamated Bank MasterCard CONTACT 800-365-6464 WHY
No penalty rate ; low APR and penalty fees APR 11.25 % ANNUAL FEE $ 0 WHAT TO LOOK FOR
In an ideal world , you 'd never miss a payment .
But your job , your kids -- in short , the real world -- can get in the way of your best - laid plans .
So you need a card that 's not going to exact too great a penalty for minor infractions .
Issuers know that many credit - card users fall into this category and that everyone resents paying a fine for being a day or two late , so cards without late fees are all the rage these days .
But what many of those seemingly sympathetic issuers soft - pedal is that they 'll instead jack your interest rate sky - high the minute you miss a due date .
Over the long haul ( and even in the short term , if you carry a hefty balance ) , that can cost far more than a late fee or two .
And the penalty rate can last six months or more for a single infraction .
Another bit of fine print to beware of : a so - called universal default policy , which allows an issuer to increase your rate if you 're late paying another lender or if other signs of risk show up on your credit report .
WHY THIS CARD
While regional banks offer some of the most consumer - friendly cards , often you have to be a customer to apply .
But anyone can sign up for the Amalgamated Bank MasterCard , which does n't have a penalty rate , a universal default policy or an annual fee .
The APR ranges from 11.25 % to 12.75 % , depending on your credit history ; there 's a 25 - day grace period ; and late fees and over - limit fees are below average , at $ 25 and $ 20 , respectively .
If You Gotta Have Cash Back BEST CHOICE Blue Cash from American Express CONTACT 800-223-2670 WHY
Maximum cash rewards for big spenders APR 11.99 % ANNUAL FEE $ 0 WHAT TO LOOK FOR
It 's worth reiterating that you should not sign up for a rewards card if you carry a balance .
Not even the best giveback program justifies the extra interest .
Got that ?
Now if you 're still looking for a rewards card , know that there 's often a trade - off between the variety of givebacks offered and their value .
The GM Card , for example , kicks back a generous 5 % -- but only to buy General Motors vehicles .
The most efficient way to expand your options , says CardRatings.com 's Curtis Arnold , is to go for a card that offers rewards only in cash .
WHY THIS CARD
If you charge a lot , the best cash - back card is Blue Cash from AmEx , which , after $ 6,500 ( and up to $ 50,000 ) in annual spending , kicks back 5 % on everyday purchases ( at supermarkets , drugstores and gas stations ) and 1.5 % on everything else .
Rewards could top $ 1,000 a year .
If your card usage is lighter -- below about $ 15,000 a year - - you 'll do better with Citi Dividend Platinum Select ( 800-248-4226 ) , which returns 5 % for everyday purchases and 1 % for anything else , but which caps rebates at $ 300 a year .
If You Want to Transfer a Balance BEST CHOICE Discover Platinum CONTACT 800-347-2683 WHY
No interest for a year on balance transfers and new spending ; relatively mild penalty rates APR o % for 12 months ; 9.99 % ANNUAL FEE $ 0 WHAT TO LOOK FOR
If you 've resolved to pay off your credit - card debt , you may be inclined to consolidate it using one of the ubiquitous offers of 0 % interest on balance transfers .
These deals can be a useful tool for keeping your liabilities from spiraling out of control while you try to get on top of them , but there are pitfalls .
First , transfer your balance only if you 're committed to paying off the loan before the 0 % rate expires and to paying on time every month ( with many cards , missing a due date even once can wipe out the promotional rate and trigger a penalty APR as high as 30 % ) .
Also , unless the offer extends the 0 % rate to new purchases , do n't continue shopping :
The new charges receive a separate APR , and your monthly payment usually goes toward the portion of your balance with the lowest rate first .
WHY THIS CARD Like other cards , the Discover Platinum offers a 0 % balance - transfer rate for 12 months and a 0 % rate on new purchases for the same period .
But unlike many , it does n't bump your rate into the stratosphere if you 're late just once .
Instead , it uses a tiered penalty system , imposing a comparatively low 17.74 % rate for the first offense .
If Your Kid Needs a Card BEST CHOICE Sovereign Preferred Student Visa CONTACT 800-551-0839 WHY
Low interest rate ; no annual fee APR 9.9 % fixed ANNUAL FEE $ 0 WHAT TO LOOK FOR Learning to use credit cards wisely takes time , and chances are your college students will slip up a bit along the way , if only around exam time .
So encourage them to focus on interest rates , fees and penalties when choosing a card -- and to ignore rewards .
( Student cards often start with a $ 500 limit , so any potential rewards would be minimal anyway . )
If you want to monitor your children 's spending online , you 'll have to cosign for a card or put them on one of your accounts .
WHY THIS CARD IndexCreditCards.com reports that the average APR on student cards is close to 15 % .
But the Sovereign Student Visa charges a fixed 9.9 % and carries no annual fee .
Late payments do trigger a penalty interest rate , but at 19.99 % , it 's well below the industry standard .
If You Gotta Have Free Travel BEST CHOICE Citi PremierPass MasterCard CONTACT 800-353-2484 WHY
Points awarded for spending and flying ; points good for free flights on any airline APR 12.99 % ANNUAL FEE $ 0 WHAT TO LOOK FOR
The whole rewards thing began with free travel , and for some people that 's still the only reward worth thinking about , other considerations be damned .
Fair enough .
If you regularly fly on a single airline ( maybe one with a hub at your local airport ) , it pays to use that airline 's branded credit card so you can combine spending points and frequent - flier points , says Tim Winship , publisher of FrequentFlier.com .
But if you spend more than you fly , you spread your travel across multiple airlines or you worry that you 'll lose your miles in one of the increasingly common airline bankruptcies , a card that allows you to collect points in one account and redeem them with any airline is your best bet .
Plus , most such cards have lower annual fees and interest rates than airline - branded cards .
WHY THIS CARD Last year Citibank introduced the only major card that both awards points for spending and air travel and lets you use them on a large number of airlines .
The Citi PremierPass awards one point per dollar spent using the card and one point for every three miles flown by you or anyone else whose tickets were purchased with the card .
You need the industry standard of 25,000 points to collect a free domestic ticket .
But unlike with most other cards , the ticket price has no cap .
FEEDBACK : cbigda@moneymail.com , agengler@moneymail.com
The Qi language has the ability to create functions that return different results depending on the inputs .
In most languages besides Haskell , ML , and Prolog , you must simply specify inputs and then test each input to determine what you want the function to return .
This ends up cluttering the function definition with many “ if ” or “ case ” statements .
This in turn lowers the readability and writeability of the language in question .
Advanced functional languages take advantage of a special syntax that allows the definition of the return value based on the inputs to the function .
A second , and more important , use for pattern matching is for binding the formal parameters of the function .
In many languages , if you wish to extract different parts of the parameters in a function , you have to define local variables to hold the parts that you are interested in .
In Qi , you use the pattern matching operator to do the special assignment for your cases up front .
This simplifies the programming and makes the program more readable ( and hence maintainable ) .
Qi provides 2 special operators for the purposes of parameter pattern matching .
The -> operator is equivalent to the = operator in Haskell .
It specifies that a pattern matched to the left of the arrow will produce the results specified on the right of the arrow , after rewriting the function on the right to use the values matched on the left .
The other operator is _ and it basically tells the rewriter to “ throw away ” the input .
Thus the Qi pattern matching system corresponds to what computer scientists call a priority rewrite system .
Now that we have dispensed with some dense technical verbiage , let us look at what all of this actually means to a Qi programmer .
We will start with the first meaning of pattern matching , namely matching basic elements with no bound formal parameters ( i.e. none of what you would call “ variables ” ) .
We will take 3 animals , jane , chuck , and rex and make a function called likes_to_eat that lets us know that jane likes pizza , chuck like cereal , and rex likes dog_food . ( define likes_to_eatjane -> pizzachuck -> cerealrex -> dog_food ( 11-) ( likes_to_eat jane ) pizza( 12 -) ( likes_to_eat rex ) dog_foodSeems simple enough , no ?
So now lets see what our function has to say about what bob likes to eat .
( 13 -) ( likes_to_eat bob ) error : partial function likes_to_eat ;
It produces an error as expected as we have not defined what bob likes in the above function .
The error message could perhaps be more useful , but it does point us to the problem .
Qi will also then ask if we want to “ track ” the function .
This is Qi’s way of helping us find where we went wrong in our function call .
If you say yes , Qi will display a lot of diagnostic messages when it encounters the likes_to_eat function so you can determine what went wrong .
So let us modify our function to return the symbol “ unknown ” whenever we do n’t know the animal that the function was called with .
We use the _ operator to tell the system that we do n’t care about the input , we just want to return unknown if we reach the pattern . ( define likes_to_eatjane -> pizzachuck -> cerealrex -> dog_food_ -> unknownRunning this version gives us the following output .
( 21-) ( likes_to_eat bob)unknownNote the difference between this version and the following ( define likes_to_eat_ -> unknownjane -> pizzachuck -> cerealrex -> dog_food ( 23 -) ( likes_to_eat jane ) unknown
The pattern matches from top to bottom .
Thus the _ operator matches anything input and returns unknown as a result , even though we have specified jane later on in the function .
This is only the beginning of how tricky these sorts of rewrite rules can be , but as long as you remain aware of the order of evaluation , you should have relatively few problems with them .
While returning “ unknown ” is OK , we may want a more useful error message .
We now want to modify our function likes_to_eat to display a helpful error message that tells us WHAT caused the function to fail .
We also want to stop the computation at this point .
Qi provides a helpful function called “ error ” that stops the program and returns a string .
We will make the string say “ likes_to_eat has not heard of bob ” if we input bob .
To make the program work as we described , we want to return the following function ( error " likes_to_eat has not heard of ~ A " bob ) .
Of course , you can immediately see that bob is a variable that we will need to input into the error function .
This allows us to introduce the concept of formal parameters .
In Qi , formal parameters start with an upper case letter .
For simplicities sake , let us call the variable which will bind to bob X .
Now our result becomes ( error " likes_to_eat has not heard of ~ A " X ) where X is bound to bob .
The Qi syntax makes this rule easy to write , just put X on the left of the arrow .
We thus create a new definition of likes_to_eat .( define likes_to_eatjane -> pizzachuck -> cerealrex -> dog_foodX -> ( error " likes_to_eat has not heard of ~ A " X ) ( 26 -) ( likes_to_eat bob ) error : likes_to_eat has not heard of bobNow let us take a look at a more complicate pattern matching question .
In Qi , we can use any of the special constructor forms on the left hand side of the arrow operator .
These forms are “ list ” , “ cons ” , and “ @p ” .
We can also use the “ | ” operator inside a list to extract the cons form .
I recommend reading the Qi Language book to better understand these forms , but a simple exercise should suffice to show any programmer versed in list processing how they operate . ( 43 -) ( list a b c ) [ a b c ] ( 44 - ) [ a b c ] [ a b c ] ( 45 -) ( cons a ( cons b ( cons c [ ] ) ) ) [ a b c ] ( 46 -) ( @p 1 2 ) ( @p 1 2 ) ( 47 - ) [ a b | c ] [ a b . c ] ( 48 - ) [ a | b c]error : Improper use of | ( 48 - ) [ a | [ b c ] ] [ a b c ]
Let us create an analog of the Haskell take function that takes N arguments from a list and returns the elements extracted .
Defining it recursively , we find that if N is 0 , then return [ ] or if the list is [ ] for any N , return [ ] .
Finally , return the application of take to itself by making a list of the head elements and the tail elements being the results of take N – 1.( define take - alpha0 _ -> [ ] _ [ ] -> [ ] N [ X | XS ] -> [ X | ( take - alpha (- N 1 ) XS ) ]
) For the first 2 patterns , we can easily see what the patterns match to .
For the final pattern , we find that we get a number N and something called [ X | XS ] .
This form means that X is the single element head of the list and XS is the remainder of the list .
Each call to take - alpha reduces the number of elements in the list by one and reduces the N by one .
( 50 -) ( take - alpha 2 [ a b c ] ) [ a b]
The first 2 patterns work slightly differently than Haskell programmers may be used to .
To show this , let us define a function take - beta that reverses the first 2 rules . ( define take - beta_ [ ] -> [ ] 0 _ -> [ ] N [ X | XS ] -> [ X | ( take - beta (- N 1 ) XS ) ] ) ( 51 - ) ( take - alpha 0 bad_thing ) [ ] ( 52 -) ( take - beta 0 bad_thing ) [ ] ( 53 -) ( take - alpha bad_thing [ ] ) [ ] ( 54 -) ( take - beta bad_thing [ ] ) [ ]
This differs from Haskell in that Haskell would return the bottom operator for the middle 2 elements because it could not match bad_thing to the list or the number respectively .
The typesafe version of Qi would throw an error at compile time if we attempted such a call .
In that case , Qi provides a default symbol called # \Escape that works along the lines of the Haskell bottom operator ( with significant differences not described here ) .
Regardless , we can see that the notion of “ more defined ” that we find in Haskell does not apply to the general version of Qi .
You can make the left hand side of the equation as complicated as you wish .
We will create a list that has alternating types , the first being a number and the second being a tuple created by the @p operator .
For example , we would like the function to make [ 1 ( @p 3 4 ) 5 ( @p 8 5 ) ] add up to 26 .
We want it to be able to do it for any valid list length .
The definition follows .( define complicated - list - add [ ] ->
0 [ X | [ ( @p Y Z ) | XS ] ] -> (+ (+ X (+ Y Z ) ) ( complicated - list - add XS ) ) Testing this function gives ( 58 -) ( complicated - list- add [ 1 ( @p 3 4 ) ] ) ( 59 -) ( complicated - list - add [ 1 ( @p 3 4 ) 5 ( @p 8 5 ) ] )
26
If we try to simply input 3 numbers we get the following error .
( 60 -) ( complicated - list - add [ 1 2 3 ] ) error : partial function complicated - list - add ; The pattern matcher could not match 2 to ( @p X Y ) so it returns the same error we saw when we tried to call likes_to_eat with bob .
It does n’t know how to apply it and it gives us an error .
If we wished , we could add error handling in the same manner as likes_to_eat .
One final point remains on the basics of pattern matching in Qi .
What happens if we have a variable that we did n’t specify on the left hand side of the arrow ?
The rewrite rule described above would n’t know how to decipher it as we did n’t explicitly define it .
Qi has chosen the route of warning the user but defining the function as opposed to generating an error .
We can see the behavior below . ( define bad - rewriteX -> Y ) ======>
Warning : the following variables are free in bad - rewrite : Y ; bad- rewrite ( 62 - ) ( bad- rewrite 10 ) If you are a Lisp programmer , you may worry about variable capture due to this rewrite rule .
Fortunately , Qi handles this case for us via the rewrite system and we do n’t have to worry about it in this case .
This also means we can return proper names from functions in the relatively few cases where we want to do this .
But expressive power always means we need to take care of how we code things , thus the reason for the warning .
( 63 -) ( ( /. Y ( bad - rewrite Y ) ) 12 ) Whew .
Congrats to all that made it to the bottom of this pedantic look at the Qi pattern matching system .
You should note that this only covers rewrite rules without guards ( the Qi “ where ” special form ) .
If you delve further into Qi , you will find that the combination of the arrow and where can allow native backtracking of the functions that you call .
Yes , I said native backtracking of function calls !
More on that later .
Enjoy your Qi!
PS : Mark Tarver , the main implementer of Qi , had this to say about the warn vs error issue with Qi variables .
The main motivation for this is to allow users to mix
Lisp code into Qi code .
Since Lisp reverts to the
uppercase when case sensitivity is invoked ( Qi is
case sensitive ) , if you want to mix Lisp into Qi you have to violate
the free variable condition .

====== >
Warning :
the following variables are free in implode : COERCE ; STRING ;
implode
( 1-) ( implode [ # \a #\b # \c ] )

You see the idea , that is why you get a warning and
not an error .
Being able to mix the two is a big plus .
However if you really want to block off functions like
bad - rewrite then ( strong - warning + ) will do it and you
get an error and not a warning .

In the ever - changing landscapes of privacy and cryptocurrency , it ’s vital that all information is kept up - to - date .
We keep our content updated in line with the latest developments in the space , so you do n’t have to worry about stale information and outdated advice .
See our most recent updates below :
To me , Perl 6 is like a director 's cut of CPAN .
From the RFC process till today , each part of Perl 6 feature either came from , or has been realized , as CPAN modules .
( cf. the v6. pm stack diagram -- much more modules are present in each layer than shown there . )
During the making of Perl 6 , what we are doing can be seen as : Take those Perl 5 extensions , which are all nice tools that solves real problems , present them as the default , and make them play well with each other .
Of course , the " play well " part involves a lot of work .
However , one thing I like about the v6.pm path is it 's gradual and completely opt-in .
If you are interested only in some part of Perl 6 , use them as CPAN modules today .
For the few features that truly needs internals support , simply upgrade to 5.10 .
When the CPAN community is reasonably happy with the tool chain , we 'll see more CPAN modules written with " use v6 - alpha ; " as their first line , calling for more integrated internal support in Perl 5.12 .
When all of it works well together enough that TimToady ++ is happy to declare the syntax stable , then it'd be time to drop the " - alpha " suffix .
Which would n't be this Christmas , but the advent has started now . :-)
That plan , however , omits one part of CPAN :
It can not get all the Inline : :* languages play well with each other .
Fortunately , the Parrot project is making a director 's cut of all dynamic languages , and have them play well with each other ...
Question for you .
You are a lot closer to Parrot development than I am .
However as an outsider I 've given up on Parrot achieving its original goals .
Has there been any sign that what I complained about there is changing ?
Is there , for example , any sign that we will someday have a version of Python running on Parrot that can pass the Piethon ?
Like the Python and JPython do , and IronPython almost does .
After this I 've wondered from day one how incompatible behaviours between different languages will be handled .
Everything from minor discrepancies ( eg whether you create new copies of data upon assignment , or upon modification ) to major design issues ( eg how you break down your error - handling hierarchy ) .
But over time I 've become convinced that we 'll never get to the point where we have to worry about that .
I 'd love to be wrong on this .
I really would .
But I fear I 'm not .
To me , Perl 6 is like a director 's cut of CPAN .
So , will Han shoot first ? :D
I enjoyed Perl4 .
I was also glad when Perl5 came out , and as successive versions of Perl5 acm out , and CPAN dramatically expanded its capabilities , Perl has become a central part of my work life .
Based on its current strengths and the promising plans for Perl6 , my team at work is planning to move our legacy applications into Perl .
I also really like Perl .
I like the Perl community .
I like the appreciation of language that it brings to working with computers .
I 'm even not that impatient about the wait for Perl6 , since it was clear some time ago that Perl6 was a very large undertaking .
Thus am I one of the faithful .
But as one of the faithful , I think there are some important issues highlighted in both Perl needs The Solution and Perl is dying .
While Perl6 will give us a great deal , there are still some problems that it wo n't solve .
And yes , some of those problems may be significant enough to blunt Perl 's future success .
Pluralism is one of Perl 's greatest strenghts , and responsible for much of its thriving success .
While we 're benefitting from pluralism , we also need to mittigate some of its costs .
For me , the most important ways we can do this are to provide : A guide to Best Practices .
A set of recommendations on pre-Perl6 goodies , one that is aimed at the people who ask questions on PM .
A package of modules for doing web apps , one which well serves those who are n't committed to using Perl , and who would rather go check out Rails if you present them with a list of different choices with the strengths and weeknesses of each .
The Damian has given us the first item on this list and we owe him our deep gratitude , both for seeing the need and for doing the job .
While the recomenations are very good , IMO , for some purposes just the existence of authoritative recomendataions is the most important part , and is enough to take care of a score of reasonable concerns about Perl .
When you 're selling perl for a major project , and management has heard rumors about tower - of - babble coding practices , you can plunk his book down on the table and you do n't have to say much after that .
If those with the knowledge and credibility can establish the other two items anywhere near as well as TheDamian has managed the first , with Best Practices , then Perl will be a very strong contender for being " the language for the rest of us " .
The additions wo n't make it any less of a wonderfully flexible language for those of us who already know it fairly well , they will just help others to follow .
This is not a matter of fad or fashion , it 's just a matter of improving service to a wider community .
There _is_ a Perl Best Practices , by HRH Damien Conway .
Excellent book , BTW .
> package of modules for doing web apps
Try WebGui - its more than a CMS , it is a " an application framework that handles content management " .
Sigh .
WebGui may be may be an absolutely wonderful system .
For myself , I appreciate the tip and I will check into it further than I have , but my point was that most people who are newer to perl wo n't do that .
There are many wonderful systems and modules out there providing functions that may be relevant to a first project .
There are even some less wonderful systems that look good at the start .
It 's too much to deal with for someone who is learning his / her way around .
Later , as experience grows , it can be a valuable education to look at what others have done and how they 've done it , and it can be a satisfying exploration .
We need to help people through the early stage so they can get to that later one .
WebGUI is not a framework IMHO , it just is a CMS with plugins .
The original article mentions two web frameworks and they are the best IMHO : Catalyst and CGI :: Application .
I do n't think Perl hackers have any sort of " inferiority complex " .
What I see happening is that some people are perhaps feeling a bit threatened by the popularity of other languages , wondering whether they 're wisely staying with a superior language ( Perl ) , or whether they 're missing something even better .
That 's always going to be a question with computer trends .
In the past , conservatism has usually resulted in stagnation and losing the lead on new technology .
Why trouble with those new - fangled VDT's , when you can just toggle the code in through the front - end switches ?
I fought like a tiger against using a mouse ...
Part of the problem , I suspect , is our impatience to see Perl6 unveiled .
Everyone else has a bright , shiny new toy to play with , and we 're still using good old Perl 5 .
Poor us ...
And yet , it says a great deal that Perl 5 is still competitive , considering its advanced age .
I like Perl 5 .
I 'm content to use it , until Perl6 comes along .
I still have plenty to learn about Perl 5 , to keep me busy .
Once I 've learned all the language , I 'll get impatient - but if I ever get that good , I 'll start helping out with Perl6 .
I agree that TIMTOWTDI has paid off handsomely and continues to do so .
It seems to me that a similar approach works in biology .
Genetic diversity pays off .
You never know when some off - the - wall mutation will be the one to survive the changing environment .
Too much purity leaves a species vulnerable to extinction by impairing its ability to create these mutations .
That 's OK if the environment is stable - but history shows this is not the case .
In IT , the environment is even less stable .
Perl 5 is n't hard for newbies - unless you 're referring to those who have never programmed in any language .
Programming itself is difficult for a newcomer , because it requires a highly structured way of thinking that is not usually taught to non-programmers .
It 's the disciplined thinking that is difficult , not the particular idiom ( though some idioms are more difficult to grasp ) .
For someone who already understands the concepts of programming , Perl is not at all difficult to learn .
I agree , Perl 5 is n't hard for newbies , it 's just a little hard for the relative newbie to accomplish what they want in Perl .
That accomplishment usually involves the web .
PHP and Ruby make that easier , as matthewsnape above makes clear .
If we reduce the hastle of that first accomplishment in Perl , more talented people will start Perl earlier , get used to its advantages , learn , and contribute .
The health of a language depends as much on the new talent coming in as it does on the accomplished fellows already here .
I have read discussions about " dying Perl " , " Perl needeng a solution to survive " and i went through the comments to this node .
I still think that my Engish is to poor to explain my thoughts about this discussion .
But i'll try .
I think that every computer language is a INSTRUMENT .
Like a hammer or a drill .
And if you need to to a certain work , you will choose the instrument to do it — but you wo n't think that " My hammer is better than any drill , so i'll perforate holes in the wall with it " or " Hammers are dying , so i'll drive this nail with my favourite drill " .
You will take the drill or the hammer and do the appropriate work with it , wo n't you ?
I do my own work with Perl — and i can explain why i chose Perl to do it .
And it does not matter for me if PHP is more popular than Perl or not .
And i do n't understand how the popularity of PHP , Python , Ruby or VB does affect the usage of Perl for tasks that are better solved with it .
P.S .
I understand that there are people who learn their first language to create the first dynamic webpage in their life .
They will choose PHP .
As PHP is a " language for creating dynamic webpages " :)
And if somebody forgot , PHP was initially written in Perl as The Solution for creating webpages :) s;; Just - me - not-h- Ni-m - P - Ni-lm - I - ar - O - Ni ; ; tr?
IerONim-?
HAcker ?d; print
" Hammers are dying " Hilarious . :)
Yes , very well said - it's the tool ( or " instrument " as you said , but same point ) .
There is a saying , though - " to someone with a hammer , every problem looks like a nail . "
Something to think about .
Our choice of solution may depend on our tool or instrument , as much as our choice of tool might depend on the problem .
I 'm sorry to hear that hammers are dying .
I 'll have to go out and buy another drill now .
IMO when Perl was the only alternative for fast programming , it got many attention .
When other scripting languages appeared , they , of course , distract attention .
However I do n't see perl comunity as shrinking ...
Also , consider following evolution - assembler - is convenient way to write machine code .
C - is big assembler ( much more convenient to code , and still very close to hardware )
Perl - is big C , it is very similar to C except its code more condensed and easier to write .
But other scripting languages could perfectly replace Perl .
XXXXX - is big Perl .
At this step something special should be invented ...
Is it perl6 ? :)
I think that the whole " is perl dyeing " debate tends to over complicate the issue .
It assumes that people even make a coherent decision as to what framework or language they use .
I have spent years coding perl to create web applications .
The reason I decided on Perl in the begininng was because it was a scripting language supported on the free netfirms hosting package .
Since then PHP has taken over as the easiest most available scripting language .
My point is that we tend to over emphasize the importance of high end coding .
I continued with Perl because it was so acessibile to people with little coding experience .
You could create inrteresting stuff by using a handfull of modules .
The quality of the source was low , but you could still get results .
In recent years Perl has become less useful to people like me .
Things like Class :: DBI , CGI :: Application and mason are great , but out of the reach of most people who dont have there own server .
Look at godaddy ( largest shared hosting provider in North America ) , most of CPAN is out of reach to these users .
Just to difficult to install .
Perl may run on any OS , but it is inaccesible to many users .
The Perl community has always prided itself for being compatible on any os .
But Perl does have an accessibility problem for new users on limited systems .
A small nit .
It 's perfectly possible to run a CGI :: Application on a shared hosting provider .
See " Hello world " for CGI :: Application .
But is it easy for an inexperienced user to do ?
I believe that CPAN offers a huge benefit to inexperienced programmers .
But expecting them to install the modules themselves and adjust their code to use those libraries may be to great a hurdle .
CPAN is cool precisely because you dont have to install modules yourself or adjust your code .
New users of language are fickle and to many " Internal Server " errors can really put them off .
Inferiority Complex ??
I would say the opposite .
Most Perl hackers , when confronted with another language , respond with " I do n't need that sh*t , I already have Perl " . :-)
I 'm not really a human , but I play one on earth .
I 'm not really a human , but I play one on earth .
Cogito ergo sum a bum
Let me explain what I mean by " insecure " .
Never needing to look outside our own box to find a solution sounds like a good thing ( and it is ) , but after years of not having to look elsewhere for solutions , I found myself questioning whether I was missing out !
It is so rare that I come across a coding problem that requires more than 2 minutes searching CPAN before I discover a solution ( or several ! ) .
Rare .
Maybe too rare .
So rare in fact that I feel insulated from the rest of the coding world .
I have never come across a problem I could not solve with Perl .
The added bonus of direct access to the source code of CPAN modules has given me an accelerated learning path ( compared with Java or . NET ) - further perpetuating the cycle of Perl - only knowledge .
Or is it ?
I happen to work at a 50/50 Microsoft / OSS shop where everything * we * write is written in VB , and anything * I* write is in Perl .
At one point we were going to convert everything to Perl , but nobody else bothered learning Perl .
To make a long story short , we 're doing .NET now .
Having spent the last few weeks porting some VBScript code to C# , it 's not much different than when I ported something similar from VBScript to Perl .
It could be that it was me doing the porting both times , and that both Perl and C# have a C - style syntax .
In the past I have experimented with C++.
Even though it is considered a " real " programming language , I could n't see how anyone got anything * done * in it - so much that I took for granted with Perl simply was not available to me .
Learning C# was very different .
Even though it has static typing and " One Way To Do It " , its garbage collection and the .
Net framework class library ( analogous to a proprietary CPAN ) means I can be more productive than I would be with C++ , since most of the wheels I need have already been built and are part of the standard install .
( Nice run-on sentence ! ) .
I look forward to Perl6 with its vast CPAN library , built - in object system , threading and delegation .
The " insulation " factor will probably still be there , but since Parrot will promote interoperability , the insulation may be more transparent .
These two last years , when the chief requested a new task to me , my motto was :
" Naaah ! , I can make it in TWO lines !... "
This was my work :)
A hammer for a nail ; a screwdriver for a screw .
Yeah , there are some people who will use a butter knife to screw in the leads to an electrical socket , just as there are those who will use a stale loaf of bread wrapped up in six layers of aluminum foil and dipped in three coats of shellac to use as an organic mallet on the third day after midsummer 's eve to pound Hershey 's kisses into used corn cobs .
Why do people do these things ?
It 's a fear of change , or sheer laziness .
And learning a new perl dialects is no different .
One chum codes everything as .pl files , all Perl4 - esque , and hates anything OO in Perl5 .
Another has been living on the latest tidbits of Perl6 to come out .
However , I 've also encountered people completely new to Perl programming , and they 're not overwhelmed at all .
They credit the plethora of books that have been written , and especially the user community here at perlmonks.org , with dispelling any FUD they might have about the language .
I myself am helping them become more comfortable about using regexes , and sure enough they learning it , and learning it well .
No fancy IDEs , no Eclipse , no VS.NET .
Just vi and a dream .
I 've used Eclipse , and I like it for Java , but it 's like jumping back into smalltalk on steroids after a fashion , and using a heavy IDE can sometimes be daunting , just like trying to learn enough TSO / ISPF and JCL to compile COBOL programs .
Do Perl hackers have an inferiority complex ?
Not that I 've seen .
We 're some of the most capable , strong - willed , upstanding bunch I know .
The industry tends to play us down in favor of more traditional ( read : compiled ) languages , such as Java or C# .
What Perl6 will do to that perception will depend on which CIO reads the appropriate Hip & Trendy ™ buzzwords in some magazine recommended by Someone - Who - Knows .
Is Perl in any danger of dying out ?
No .
It 's ubiquitous because it is useful , and continues to evolve with its programming family of adherents .
Falling off my soapbox ,
- v. " Perl .
There is no substitute . "
I think your title is too melodramatic , and overgeneralizing .
You make good points , and I agree with most of what you say , but - IMHO - you overstate the validity of the claims made in those threads .
Just look at the arguments made by chromatic and Ovid .
Their points are convincing enough in their own right , but if you realise where they work , you can see how that gives them an excellent view on the overall state of Perl .
From where I stand , that makes them far more authorative than some random anonymonk .
< rant >
I have the sneaking suspicion that the handful of FUD - spreading anonymonks are just a bunch of whiny saps who landed lousy jobs , where they resent the technology desicions being made higher - up , and think their peers are all monkey coders .
Their complaints are n't with Perl itself , but stem from their unhappiness with their personal situation .
</ rant > --
Yes , it 's a hot day ;^ )
Finally a place for people to weigh in where the parent node is n't a Diggthink - powered troll .
I use perl because
* it 's on every * N * X server I encounter and I never have to install it
* I can use it for just about everything
* the might of clean code is insignificant compared to the power of a stream of oneliners Given these three , even if there were no CPAN I would use perl .
By way of analogy the trolls are saying I should throw away my dependable Swiss Army knife and learn how to use the new deluxe canopener that just came out instead .
It bears mentioning that drivel like this never saw the light of day back when perl5 was released .
We said things like " I like sed better than perl because I know it so well " .
We never said " perl is teh suxors , use C " and we killfiled anyone who did .
We did n't have time for meaningless noise because we were too busy building the Internet with perl , all because we had a dream that someday moronic youngsters would be able to send each other into fits of apoplexic rage by insulting each others technology from a thousand miles away .
If you have a church I want to join !!
Hallelujah brother !
The internet was n't built on perl .
The biggest problem I have with perl is this idea that no other language should exist .
In this thread alone , how many people have indicated that " after Perl 6 comes out and we get some GUI environments for it , etc. then no one will want to use any other languages " .
You do n't see this in any of the other comunities , why is it seemingly the dominant voice in Perl land ?
It was this attitude expressed daily from a college for over 5 years that has driven me away from Perl forever .
Personally , I would n't know what is said in other communities , because I find everything I need with Perl and PM .
If you 've been " driven ... away from Perl forever " , what are you doing here ?
Apparently you still have some feelings for the language or its users - some attraction .
I am often puzzled by how many people come here to explain how Perl is n't worth anything , it 's a useless , stupid language , blah , blah , blah - and yet , they return here daily to tell us all about it .
Do n't you have any programs to write ?
Problems , not The Solution .
No , Perl does not need ' The Solution ' to survive , it needs Problems , and there are lots of problems in daily development work that Perl is The Uniquely Best Suited Tool to solve in the most clean , concise , efficient and portable way .
Results , not Hype .
To realize this requires a broad and deep personal experience with computer architectures , OS 'es , languages and tools ( ie . you must have worked with complex data structs such as deep combined hashes&arrays and you must have wrestled with pointers / references in C , C++/ STL , C# , Java , AWK , Perl etc. on DOS'es , UNIX 'es and WindowsXX'es ) .
The Perl Way , or the Highway .
Maybe you just need a fast & flashy framework to put up a web site .
Maybe you just need a large scale team framework to crank out a lot of heavy business objects .
Then , maybe you do n't need the general power and flexibility of Perl to solve the tasks in your specific problem domain , or maybe you do n't want to enter a long learning curve to master yet another general language with a large library .
Then by all means : take The Highway that will solve your specific problem today !
" Who 's inferior or dying ? "
But do n't think Perl is dying because the majority of developers may take The Highway to solve specific problems ;
The majority of developers do not have a broad and deep personal experience with computer architectures , OS 'es , languages and tools , but the day they really crash&burn on The Highway with their slick&slim or obese&obstructing vehicles , they will either die , -- or they will go looking for an offroader like Perl to cruise the bush , just like wee did , back then when we needed it .
And they will certainly not feel inferiorior for having a Hummer in the driveway
The Way i see it ,

Why hide behind anon monk ?
How is Perl5 hard ?
I am not a programmer by trade and I was able to write things .
Unless of course you are that snob that wrote about writing perfect code .
Perl is not going away anytime soon .
New languages are just like fads .
Some last , many do n't , and some you never hear about .
It does n't mean anything , but I have n't heard about Eclipse ....
Why hide behind anon monk ?
I do n't remember my password ( I'm jdrago_999 ) and I can't check the email address it goes to ( my work email ) from home .
How is Perl5 hard ?
It 's not hard - it 's super easy .
And super powerful .
And , to paraphrase Larry Wall , maybe just a little too flexible at times .
I have n't heard about Eclipse ....
Eclipse is a platform that happens to have a popular Java IDE built on top of it ( as well as several other languages , including Perl ) .
You can learn more at The Eclipse Website
Yes !
We need a best IDE that Eclipse ... but as long as with Eclipse we can program in Perl ( screenshot ) .
( Komodo is the best commercial tool , of course )
For the record - I 'm now at work and this was my post .
I 'd just like to point out that I feel a lot better about the imminent doom that is Perl 6 after seeing Autrijus ' v6 talk at Boston .
PM .
With v6 you can start using some of the good bits of Perl 6 , but are n't yet forced to adopt all the nastiness too ;-) ... although they are working on it .
As for newbies , I too , do not see how P6 is going to be " beeter " .
Indeed , for sometime it will probably be worse until everyone gets used to having the rug yanked out form underneath them .
UPDATE : By everyone , I mean the experienced perl hacks whom would help the newbies .

Justification against Java

A Perl vs. Java fight brews over in SoPW is quite relevant to this discussion .
Take a look at it if you have n't seen it yet .
And if you know Java reasonably well then it's a chance to help make the case for Perl where it counts , in a team 's pending design decision .
Update : link fixed .
( Thanks jdporter . )
I use both C# and Perl without considering one superior to the other one .
If I want a GUI interface , I use C# ( version 2003 - have n't been able to convince my fiance that 2005 is needed ) .
For utility type programs , I tend to use perl .
I use the tool that is best for the particular job at hand .
Perl and .NET are about the same for cross platform compatibility ( . NET * does * work with other platforms : see Mono ) .

I have n't coded Perl for a while now , but I read this and felt obligated to comment .
I 've coded Perl and found it easy to learn , but sophisticated enough to handle very complex problems .
I have n't been keeping up with it primarily because of demands from my programming job , where I 'm having to master .
Net , but I can honestly say Perl rocks , and will always have a place in my toolbox and on my resume .
I have been a big Perl fan for many years , but I admit I 'm on to Ruby now .
Why ?
Because Ruby 1.8 has many of the features Perl 6 is going to have , but Ruby 1.8 is here NOW , and that makes all the difference in the world .
Also , the implicit comparison of Rails to any old CPAN module is disingenuous .
Rails is far more comprehensive than any single CPAN module and far more well integrated than any handful of CPAN modules one might combine to do the same thing .
I miss CPAN , though , for most things that are not Rails .
CPAN has far more modules and most of them are more mature of course than their Ruby equivalents .
I often come back to Perl so I can get at something I need from CPAN , and when I do , I find now that the core language feels " clunky " compared to Ruby .
Maybe when Perl 6 gets here people like me will once again count Perl their favorite language instead of second favorite .
" Dying " may be an exaggeration , but there 's no denying that the long development of Perl 6 has cost some mindshare .
But that leads to another point - who cares ?
It 's not like Ruby and Perl are competing for market cap or customer dollars .
Like I said , I can switch between them at need because I paid zero dollars for both of them .
The plural of library is " libraries " not " librarys "

It 's hard to take someone seriously who does n't pay attention to details .
The plural of library is " libraries " not " librarys "
You mean
The plural of " library " is " libraries " , not " librarys " .
It 's hard to take someone seriously who does n't pay attention to details .
Indeed .
Heh - I would have fixed it but I wrote it as " Anonymous Monk " .

Well , we can allude to the forthcoming Perl6 all we want , but : " real artists ship . "
We need n't allude to Perl6 .
Perl 5 is alive and well , doing quite nicely , thank you .
If you feel some other language is more appropriate , do not hesitate to use it .
As Ernest and Julio Gallo said , " We will ship no software before its time " - or words to that effect .
A reply falls below the community 's threshold of quality .

You have to wonder whether reality ever comes knocking on George W. Bush 's door .
If it did , would the president with the unsettling demeanor of a boy king even bother to answer ?
Mr. Bush is the commander in chief who launched a savage war in Iraq and now spends his days happily riding his bicycle in Texas .
This is eerie .
Scary .
Surreal .
The war is going badly and lives have been lost by the thousands , but there is no real sense , either at the highest levels of government or in the nation at large , that anything momentous is at stake .
The announcement on Sunday that five more American soldiers had been blown to eternity by roadside bombs was treated by the press as a yawner .
It got very little attention .
You can turn on the television any evening and tune in to the bizarre extended coverage of the search for Natalee Holloway , the Alabama teenager who disappeared in Aruba in May .
But we hear very little about the men and women who have given up their lives in Iraq , or are living with horrific injuries suffered in that conflict .
If only the war were more entertaining .
Less of a downer .
Perhaps then we could meet the people who are suffering and dying in it .
10 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know About Ruby
I do n't really remember why I decided to do this , but roughly a month and a half ago I began automatically forwarding copies of all my email to my GMail account .
I wanted to see what it'd be like to use GMail on a daily basis -- not using it exclusively but as a supplement to Thunderbird on my desktop .
What I 've discovered is that GMail is rather amazing .
Like Flickr , it 's on a very short list of Internet applications that are at least as good as their desktop counterparts .
In the case of GMail , it 's faster and easier to use than any desktop mail application I 've tried .
Let me say that again , to reinforce my point .
GMail is really damn fast .
Fater than desktop email .
And the interface feels no more complicated than it needs to .
Like many habit changing attempts , it took a few weeks of forcing myself to use the service before I really started to see the light .
This explains why I missed the point last August .
Most of the buzz and chatter was about the size ( 1GB at the time ) , and that turns out not to be the big deal .
Does this mean I 'm switching to GMail and away from Thunderbird ?
No .
At least not yet .
But it means that GMail is now on equal footing with Thunderbird .
When I need to find an old message or check mail quickly , there 's a 50/50 chance I 'll try GMail .
I hinted at changes to my email behavior when I wrote about Winning the Inbox Battle in Thunderbird .
It just so happens that my new style email habits work exceptionally well in GMail too .
The more I use GMail , the more I find myself re-thinking about the question :
Where will you store your data ?.
I 'm becoming more and more comfortable with it living on servers -- mine and Google 's in this case .
It 'll be really interesting to see if that 50/50 ratio changes over the next few years , especially as wireless Internet access becomes all the more common .
At this point , I 'm not willing to bet either way .
How about you ?

African Greys are often considered the best speakers among parrots
Suzy Collins had been meeting ex-work colleague " Gary " for four months in the Leeds flat she shared with her partner Chris Taylor , according to reports .
Mr Taylor apparently became suspicious after Ziggy croaked " Hiya Gary " when Ms Collins answered her mobile phone .
The parrot also made smooching sounds whenever the name Gary was said on TV .
New home
Mr Taylor , 30 , a computer programmer , confronted the woman he had lived with for a year who admitted the affair and moved out , several newspapers reported .
He also gave up his eight - year - old African Grey parrot after the bird continued to call out Gary 's name and refused to stop squawking the phrases in his ex-girlfriend 's voice .
" I was n't sorry to see the back of Suzy after what she did , but it really broke my heart to let Ziggy go , " he said .
" I love him to bits and I really miss having him around , but it was torture hearing him repeat that name over and over again . "
Ms Collins , 25 , said : " I 'm not proud of what I did but I 'm sure Chris would be the first to admit we were having problems . "
Ziggy - named after David Bowie 's former alter ego Ziggy Stardust - has now found a new home through the offices of a local parrot dealer .
It happened again .
There I was , meeting with someone who I thought had nothing to do with books or publishing , and it turns out his new book just came out .
With more than 75,000 books published every year ( not counting ebooks or blogs ) , the odds are actually pretty good that you ’ve either written a book , are writing a book or want to write one .
Hence this short list :
Lower your expectations .
The happiest authors are the ones that do n’t expect much .
The best time to start promoting your book is three years before it comes out .
Three years to build a reputation , build a permission asset , build a blog , build a following , build credibility and build the connections you ’ll need later .
Pay for an eidtor editor .
Not just to fix the typos , but to actually make your ramblings into something that people will choose to read .
I found someone I like working with at the EFA .
One of the things traditional publishers used to do is provide really insightful , even brilliant editors ( people like Fred Hills and Megan Casey ) , but alas , that does n’t happen very often .
And hiring your own editor means you ’ll value the process more .
Understand that a non-fiction book is a souvenir , just a vessel for the ideas themselves .
You do n’t want the ideas to get stuck in the book … you want them to spread .
Which means that you should n’t hoard the idea !
The more you give away , the better you will do .
Do n’t try to sell your book to everyone .
First , consider this : ” 58 % of the US adult population never reads another book after high school . ”
Then , consider the fact that among people even willing to buy a book , yours is just a tiny little needle in a very big haystack .
Far better to obsess about a little subset of the market –that subset that you have permission to talk with , that subset where you have credibility , and most important , that subset where people just ca n’t live without your book .
Resist with all your might the temptation to hire a publicist to get you on Oprah .
First , you wo n’t get on Oprah ( if you do , drop me a note and I ’ll mention you as the exception ) .
Second , it ’s expensive .
You ’re way better off spending the time and money to do # 5 instead , going after the little micromarkets .
There are some very talented publicists out there ( thanks , Allison ) , but in general , see # 1 .
Think really hard before you spend a year trying to please one person in New York to get your book published by a ‘ real ’ publisher .
You give up a lot of time .
You give up a lot of the upside .
You give up control over what your book reads like and feels like and how it ’s promoted .
Of course , a contract from Knopf and a seat on Jon Stewart ’s couch are great things , but so is being the Queen of England .
That does n’t mean it ’s going to happen to you .
Far more likely is that you discover how to efficiently publish ( either electronically or using POD or a small run press ) a brilliant book that spreads like wildfire among a select group of people .
Your cover matters .
Way more than you think .
If it did n’t , you would n’t need a book … you could just email people the text .
If you have a ‘ real ’ publisher ( # 7 ) , it ’s worth investing in a few things to help them do a better job for you .
Like pre-editing the book before you submit it .
Like putting the right to work on the cover with them in the contract .
And most of all , getting the ability to buy hundreds of books at cost that you can use as samples and promotional pieces .
In case you skipped it , please check # 2 again .
That ’s the most important one , by far .
Blurbs are overrated , imho .
Blog mentions , on the other hand , matter a lot .
If you ’ve got the patience , bookstore signings and talking to book clubs by phone are the two lowest - paid but most guaranteed to work methods you have for promoting a really really good book .
If you do it 200 times a year , it will pay .
Consider the free PDF alternative .
Some have gotten millions of downloads .
No hassles , no time wasted , no trying to make a living on it .
All the joy , in other words , without debating whether you should quit your day job ( you should n’t ! )
If you want to reach people who do n’t normally buy books , show up in places where people who do n’t usually buy books are .
Media places , virtual places and real places too .
Most books that sell by the truckload sell by the caseload .
In other words , sell to organizations that buy on behalf of their members / employees .
Publishing a book is not the same as printing a book .
Publishing is about marketing and sales and distribution and risk .
If you do n’t want to be in that business , do n’t !
Printing a book is trivially easy .
Do n’t let anyone tell you it ’s not .
You ’ll find plenty of printers who can match the look and feel of the bestselling book of your choice for just a few dollars a copy .
That ’s not the hard part .
Bookstores , in general , are run by absolutely terrific people .
Bookstores , in general , are really lousy businesses .
They are often where books go to die .
While some readers will discover your book in a store , it ’s way more likely they will discover the book before they get to the store , and the store is just there hoping to have the right book for the right person at the time she wants it .
If the match is n’t made , no sale .
Writing a book is a tremendous experience .
It pays off intellectually .
It clarifies your thinking .
It builds credibility .
It is a living engine of marketing and idea spreading , working every day to deliver your message with authority .
You should write one .
Here ’s the prequel to this post …
WASHINGTON , June 28 ( UPI ) -- President Bush was swift to react angrily against the New York Times for exposing U.S. monitoring of SWIFT ( Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications ) as a suspected conduit for the transfer of terrorist funds .
Former Attorney General Edwin Meese accused the newspaper of giving " aid and comfort to the enemy , " which is tantamount to treason .
Belgian and European authorities also reacted angrily against the Bush administration for tapping SWIFT 's Belgian - based supercomputers without the green light of a Belgian judge .
The hullabaloo generated much heat and little light .
SWIFT is the heart and lungs of the global banking industry , operating a secure electronic exchange service for fund transfers between some 7,800 banks in 200 countries .
The network routes a staggering $ 6 trillion daily -- America 's annual GDP is $ 10 trillion -- between banks , brokerages , stock exchanges and all manner of financial institutions .
Its banks of supercomputers process orders at the rate of several trillion moves per second .

The National Security Agency 's electronic vacuum cleaners that suck in over a billion bits of information daily , in scores of languages , are the only ones capable of doing the heavy sifting of gazillion accounts .
The New York Times also broke the story of NSA 's global eavesdropping program , which allows NSA 's search engines to browse back to the United States and figure out the American end of a conversation with a terrorist suspect in another continent .

The U.S. intelligence community is compelled to obey U.S. laws in the United States , but is authorized to operate illegally in the rest of the world .
The SWIFT disclosure case is particularly sensitive in European capitals as the EU and the United States are at odds over the way some civil liberties were curtailed in the global war on terrorism .
The EU has also taken the United States to task over the practice of " renditions " and the abduction of suspected terrorists on European soil and then flying them to countries that conduct torture .
SWIFT says it has done nothing wrong by responding to compulsory subpoenas from the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department .
The electronic clearing house also said it was a transatlantic organization with branches on both sides of the Atlantic .
But the nerve center is in Belgium .
President Bush 's denunciation of the New York Times seemed a tad hyperbolic .
Transnational terrorists have studiously avoided getting tangled in the ones and zeros of electronic interception in favor of a time - honored , time - tested , interception - proof system known as Hawala ( Arabic for " transfer " or " wire " ) .
It 's an informal funds transfer ( IFT ) mechanism , swifter than SWIFT that leaves no paper or digital trail .
It is based entirely on trust between two individuals separated by thousands of miles .
Hawala is much faster than a normal bank transfer .
Originally devised as protection against the dangers of traveling with gold and precious stones and other forms of payment on roads prowled by bandits , today 's system is transnational .

How would an al - Qaida operative transfer funds from , say , Quetta in Baluchistan , to Queens in New York ?
He / she would hand a specific amount to a " hawaladar " who then calls a trusted friend at the other end of the transaction to hand over the equivalent amount to the person ( man , woman or child ) who gives him the coded word or phrase already mentioned , either by e-mail , fax or phone , or VOIA ( voice over internet protocol ) .
Two hawaladars who work together -- with two - way traffic -- settle up their accounts at the end of a fiscal year .
If one owes the other more than he / she transferred , the balance is frequently settled by putting something of value in a bank 's safe deposit box , or in goods and services .
Hawaladars charge lower than bank fees and use the exchange rate spread between countries to generate more income .
The system is also used for settling debts through import - export transactions .
Hawala transactions are usually initiated by emigrant workers on contract in Saudi Arabia or the emirates of the Gulf to their families in Pakistan , India , Bangladesh and the Philippines , or to Muslim communities in the Middle East , North Africa and Western Europe .
It is fast , efficient , traceless , sans banking fees .
Funds are often delivered FedEx - style door - to - door within 24 hours by a hawaladar who has quick access to villages in remote areas .
Hawalas are also based on kinship , ethnic ties , village solidarity , and personal relations .
Even wealthy parents in developing countries use the system to transfer university tuition fees and pocket money to their children studying in developed countries .

Overlooked in the secret program to keep tabs on the trillions of dollars that whiz through SWIFT in Belgium is the low cost of major al - Qaida and copycat terrorist incidents to date : an estimated $ 30,000 for the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi ; $ 10,000 for the 2000 attack on the USS Cole that killed 17 U.S. sailors and immobilized a $ 1 billion warship for two years with a repair bill of $ 250 million ; $ 500,000 for the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon ; $ 50,000 for the attacks on commuter trains in Madrid March 11 , 2004 ; and $ 35,000 for the 2005 attacks on a London bus and subway train .
Such amounts would have been pepper - corn change among SWIFT 's trillions .
For al - Qaida , hawala is fast , reliable and secure .

State officials announced Thursday that California has finally achieved its goal of reducing landfill waste by 50 % , thanks to diligent recycling by residents and businesses .
The milestone culminates a 16 - year campaign by the state to persuade people to separate recyclables out of the trash .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Sunday September 03 , 2006 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches ; 58 words Type of Material : Correction
Recycled trash : A story in the Aug. 25 California section on the state reaching its goal to recycle half of its trash incorrectly stated that a 1989 state law mandated that at least 50 % of all recyclable trash be diverted from landfills .
The law calls for 50 % of all trash , not just recyclables , to be diverted from landfills .
The state passed a landmark law in 1989 mandating that communities establish waste - management plans for residents and businesses that would ultimately divert at least 50 % of all recyclable trash from landfills .
California was supposed to reach the goal in 2000 , but preliminary data released Thursday show that the goal was n’t reached until last year .
A total of 88 million tons of solid waste was recycled in 2005 for a 52 % recycling rate , said Jon Myers , a spokesman for the state ’s Integrated Waste Management Board .
In 2004 , 76 million tons were recycled , or 48 % .
Advertisement
Though some cities still lag behind , other communities that are now diverting 60 % or more of their waste to recycling centers made up the difference .
Myers said the recycling push has achieved one of the intended effects :
No new landfills have opened in California in a decade .
“ I ’m really proud of everyone , ” said Scott Von Lanken , a Thousand Oaks resident who on Thursday was doing his part for recycling .
He and his daughter placed special recyclable bedding for their hamster cage into the recycling bin set aside for composting .

Thousand Oaks was one of the cities that exceeded the 50 % standard , and Von Lanken said he was pleasantly surprised .
“ I was really shocked that that much stuff is going to recycle .
I ca n’t believe it , ” he said .
The recycling effort got off to a slow start , in part because it focused largely on recycling household waste .
But officials said the effort picked up as more businesses agreed -- or were required -- to recycle .
At least 20 % of the state ’s garbage comes from construction and demolition projects , and cities and counties are increasingly requiring builders to recycle their materials .
Advertisement
In Pasadena , which achieved a 62 % rate in 2005 , such an ordinance helped push the city over the top , said Ursula Schmidt , Pasadena ’s recycling program coordinator .
The law requires nearly all projects of 1,000 square feet or more to recycle , salvage or reuse at least 50 % of the waste material they generate .
The city provides builders and demolition crews with a list of places that will take their old concrete , wood and lumber .
Old doors and window frames can be donated to Habitat for Humanity , Schmidt said .
“ The reception has been very positive , ” she said .
“ That ’s tonnage that ’s being diverted to recycling . ”

Increasingly , Myers said , businesses are realizing the cost savings associated with recycling and that consumers want to patronize companies viewed as environmentally friendly .
“ They see the professional value of becoming a green business and recycling , ” he said .
Determining how much trash is being recycled is a delicate task .
The tonnage ca n’t be compared with 1989 levels because there were far fewer people in the state .
So the state uses a complex formula that takes into account economic and demographic factors to estimate how much trash would be dumped at landfills without recycling .
Advertisement
The state recently changed the formula , resulting in a slight increase in the amount of trash that officials estimated was recycled .
But Myers said that even without the change , California would still have 50 % .
With the modification , it got to 52 % .
Lawmakers approved the 1989 rules at a time when Californians feared they were running out of space for their trash .
As old dumps filled up and neighbors blocked new ones , counties closed their landfills to outsiders .
At the time , only 35 curbside recycling programs existed in the state .
The law was considered a national model that other states have since adopted .

There were widespread cheers in 1994 when the state reached the 25 % target .
But at the time , some blamed the drop in trash in part on the recession and questioned whether California would hit the 50 % target .
I recently read the book Slack : Getting Past Burnout , Busywork , and the Myth of Total Efficiency .
My previous post on Working Smarter , Not Harder already discussed the main premise of the book .
However , DeMarco writes compelling arguments on other issues , one of which is overtime .
Much analysis has been done to determine the correlation between software function points / lines of code and work effort .
This analysis has shown that using workdays is more reliable as an indicator / predictor than using workhours .
The result is that " overtime is explicitly ignored in projecting effort required to perform new work " ( Slack , page 64 ) .
This means that on average , working overtime does not mean more is accomplished than working a normal work day .
DeMarco identifies four reasons why overtime hurts enough to offset the effect of the added hours :
Reduced quality
Personnel burnout
Increased turnover of staff
Ineffective use of time during normal hours
( See Slack , pages 65 - 70 for further elaboration on these four points . )
This analysis matches my personal experience .
When doing lots of design & coding , I am often mentally exhausted after 7 or 8 hours - I 'm no longer at my ' A ' game : I get slower , make more errors , and take longer to figure things out .
I can sometimes push myself to go as long as 10 hours , but usually that only works when I 've had meetings or other non-mentally - draining activities to break up my day .
And I certainly do n't try to do that more than one day in a row .
Why not ?
Because I 've experimented with working 9 - 10 hours for multiple days in a row , and I do n't find it to be a maintainable speed .
Working regular overtime ( more than a week or two ) has a significant negative impact on a person .
Factors such as increased stress , strains on family and personal relationships , less sleep , and less exercise all add up over time to affect an individual 's mental , emotional and physical health .
Over time , this can result in increased physical illnesses , lack of motivation , and eventually complete burnout .
During my university years at a summer manual labour job , one supervisor who had been working extreme amounts of overtime ( 70 + hours per week for several months ) had a nervous breakdown and had to be hospitalized .
This ties in to DeMarco 's discussion on turnover , which I found quite interesting .
He makes the point that turnover has a cost in terms of hiring & training , and this ' human capital ' cost is seldom explicitly measured and tracked .
A manufactoring company makes capital investments in factories and equipment in order to produce goods , and these investments are carefully tracked .
Knowledge companies invest time & effort in hiring & training employees , but how often is this tracked ?
A quick test for managers : what is the annual turnover rate for your company / department , and how does it compare with the average for the industry ?
How much does this turnover cost your company ?
Think about this before continuing with the next paragraph .
If you do n't know , then try making a guess .
DeMarco mentions studies which show that " companies whose turnover places them in the best third of the sample are experiencing less than half the turnover loss of those in the worst third " ( Slack , pages 67 - 68 ) .
The annual turnover rate was measured at 35 % in the computer field as of 1990 .
An estimated 20 % of the average company 's total labor expense is turnover cost .
( Steve McConnell .
1996 .
Rapid Development , page 293 ) .
I 'm interested in seeing more recent statistics on this - let me know if you come across any .
I feel that overtime is harmful , both to the workers engaged in it , and to the company itself - especially regular overtime .
As a call to action , just say no to overtime and make our industry a better place to work .

Copy &Paste - Epidemie an Schulen und Universitäten Florian Rötzer
Das Internet erleichtert das Schummeln und Plagiieren , aber was ist die Ursache ?
Dass Schummeln und Abschreiben natürlich keine Erfindung der Angehörigen der digitalen Generation sind , hat gerade erst die Entdeckung deutlich gemacht , dass sich der russische Präsident Putin auch durch Abschreiben seinen Doktortitel in der Wirtschaftswissenschaft 1997 erworben hat .
Allerdings musste wohl Putin , damals noch beim KGB , nicht einmal selbst abschreiben , sondern hat sich die Doktorarbeit machen lassen , wozu angeblich seitenweise Auszüge aus einem Buch von amerikanischen Ökonomen verwendet wurden .
Aber mit dem Einzug von Computern und vor allem dem Internet wurde das Finden sowie das Kopieren und Einfügen von Textstellen natürlich erheblich vereinfacht , was zum Anschwellen von Plagiaten geführt haben dürfte ( Von Sub - , Geister - , Ehren - und Vielschreibern ; .
Nach einer Umfrage von Times Higher Education Supplement , für die über 1000 Stundenten an 119 Institutionen befragt wurden , ist Schummeln mittlerweile weit verbreitet .
Jeder Sechste gab zu , von Freunden , aus dem Internet oder von Büchern etwas kopiert zu haben .
Allgemein wird davon ausgegangen , dass mindestens ein Viertel aller studentischen Arbeiten kopierte Inhalte enthalten ( Mit Shake and Paste ans Ziel ) .
Auch an Eliteuniversitäten wie Oxford wird plagiiert , um sich die Arbeit zu erleichtern ( Shake , Rattle and Paste ) .
Und natürlich reicht die Copy & Paste - Kultur nicht nur bis zur Erstellung von sogenannten Geheimdienstdossiers der Regierung ( Geheime Cut - and - Paste - Informationen ) , sondern sie herrscht auch an den Schulen vor , wo allerdings darüber hinaus nach einem Bericht der Qualifications and Assessment Authority auch schon gerne einmal zum Schummeln bei Prüfungen das Handy zum Einsatz kommt .
Einen interessanten Vorschlag zur Bekämpfung der postmodernen Plagiate und Scheinautorschaften hat kürzlich Frank Furedi im Guardian gemacht .
Ausgehend von dem Phänomen , dass die erwischten Kopierer und Betrüger selten ein schlechtes Gewissen und kaum Einsicht in ihr Fehlverhalten haben , sondern eher ob der Folgen erstaunt sind , tritt er nicht für bessere Aufklärung oder gar für eine Kritik an der verlangten Originalität von Schul - und Hochschulaufsätzen ein , sondern macht andere Sündenböcke aus .
Schon oder gerade Schulanfänger kommen bereits in die Klassen und präsentieren Hausaufgaben , die mehr oder weniger von ihren Eltern erstellt wurden .
Und die würden den Kindern mit ihrer Hilfe nicht nur die Selbstverständlichkeit und Legitimität des Schummelns lehren , sondern selbst ausgiebig Gebrauch von Suchmaschinen oder Büchern machen .
Und oft genug würde diese Schummelei , obwohl erkannt , nicht von den Lehrern verurteilt .
Das Internet selbst also habe keine Schuld , auch wenn es das Kopieren und Plagiieren einfacher als jemals zuvor mache .
Aber auch die Eltern trifft nicht die volle Schuld , die schon die Schulanfänger in die Praxis einüben , sich mit fremden Federn schmücken zu wollen .
Die Eltern helfen schließlich nur aus , weil das Schulsystem schon ganz früh auf deren Mitwirkung setzt .
Sie wollen ihren Kindern eine gute Chance geben und sehen sich verpflichtet , diese möglichst zu unterstützen , denn von der Ausbildung hängt tatsächlich zu einem großen Teil auch ihre Karriere ab .
Gleichzeitig gebe es , so Furedi zurecht , einen wachsenden Druck vom staatlichen Ausbildungssystem , das immer mehr Hochqualifizierte für die Wissensgesellschaft herstellen will , aber mit den steigenden Leistungsanforderungen nicht auch die Angebote und Betreuung intensiviert .
Daher müssen die Eltern als „ unbezahlte Lehrer “ antreten , um das zu kompensieren , was die Kinder in der Schule nicht mitbekommen ( was gleichzeitig bedeutet , dass Kinder aus benachteiligten Schichten zurückfallen , weil ihre Eltern dazu nicht die Zeit , das Geld und / oder die Kenntnisse besitzen ) .
Mit dem Outsourcing des Schulsystems werden die Eltern aber an den Leistungen und auch an den Hausaufgaben ihrer Kinder stärker beteiligt , wodurch Helfen und Schummeln verschwimmen und die Kinder sozusagen auf die schiefe Copy & Paste - Bahn kommen und dann wahrscheinlich auch noch die Contentindustrie schädigen , weil sie das gleiche Verhalten auch auf die Aneignung anderer Inhalte anwenden .
Trotzdem , der Erklärungsansatz ist einen Versuch wert gewesen .
Der Wahn , schon möglichst früh die Kinder möglichst gut zu fördern und zu intelligenten Karrieremaschinen zu machen , ist zumindest in der Mittelschicht weit verbreitet – und von Propaganda nachhaltig unterstützt , dass die Eltern sich um ihre Kinder mehr kümmern müssen .
In der Mittelschicht zahlt man vielleicht nicht so viele für Privatschulen , Internate und Nachhilfelehrer , weil man es nicht hat , aber man rüstet sich mit Bildungstechniken auf und sorgt sich um das Kind – präventiv , um die Wohlstandskarriere zu fördern ( Burnout mit Fünf ) , während der Staat immer früher die kriminelle Karriere verhindern will ( Gefährliche Dreikäsehochs ) .
Die Karriere frisst Eltern und Kinder auf , während der Staat spart und mehr Leistung erfordert .
Aber für die Karriere sind alle Mittel recht , wenn sie nur effizient und kosten - bzw .
zeitsparend zum Erfolg führen , auch Schummeln und Copy &Paste .
Unter Bildung hat man mal etwas anderes verstanden als den Output an konkurrenztüchtigen , ellenbogenstarken und flexiblen Arbeitstermiten für die sogenannte Wissensgesellschaft .
Dazu aber ist Originalität und Kreativität nicht unbedingt notwendig .
Die wiederum durchaus auch damit zusammenhängen , dass man nur auf den Schultern der Vorhergehenden stehend und im vorhandenen Wissen schwimmend Neues erzeugen kann .
Weil aber die Aufnahme und Integration immer schneller an die Grenzen des Copyright und damit des Profits von denjenigen stößt , die sich noch schnell der Fertigkeiten der Anderen bedienen konnten , wird nun eine Originalität auch schon in der Schule gehuldigt , die in ihrer extremen Ausrichtung wahrlich konterproduktiv ist .
Auch aus 95 und mehr Prozent Copy , Paste& Shake kann Neues und Kreatives entstehen .
Irgendetwas läuft falsch – nicht nur bei den Schülern und Studenten und mit dem Internet .

Unicycling enthusiast John Drummond , a technical writer at IBM , decided it might be fun to sell a few cycles over the Internet .
Seven months after unicycle.com debuted in 1999 , Drummond , of Marietta , Ga. , was so overwhelmed by demand that he enlisted the help of his wife , Amy .
The pair soon sped sales up from $ 150,000 in 1999 to $ 900,000 this year .
No , there was n't an inexplicable uptick in the clown population .
They attribute their success to a straightforward Internet domain name .
" Customers found us at the top of their Google searches , " he says .
So in 2003 , when Drummond looked to profit from his other hobby , banjos , he naturally sought to pluck banjo.com .
He had paid $ 4,200 for unicycle.com , but the owner of the banjo address wanted $ 150,000 .
Drummond wo n't say how much he ultimately paid , but he 's happy with the deal .
Banjo.com pulled in $ 120,000 in sales in 2003 and is on track to reach $ 450,000 this year .

NonEuclid allows the curious explorer to gain experience in Hyperbolic Geometry and to empirically investigate questions such as : " Does the Euclidean geometry method for constructing an equilateral triangle work in Hyperbolic geometry ? " or " In Hyperbolic Geometry , are the base angles of an isosceles triangle congruent ? "
Aside from being interesting in itself , a study of hyperbolic geometry can , through its novelty , be helpful to high school geometry students .
For example , when asked to prove that the opposite sides of a rectangle have the same length , many beginning geometry students will be confused about what to do .
Students sometimes think : " Why I am being told to prove what I learned in kindergarten is just part of the definition of what it means for a figure to be a rectangle . "
The strangeness of hyperbolic geometry helps such students think about and understand the difference between what is part of an object 's definition and what is a theorem about an object .
Hyperbolic Geometry also has practical aspects such as orbit prediction of objects within intense gravitational fields .
Hyperbolic Geometry is used in Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity and Curved Hyperspace .

Trade officials met in Geneva in November , but failed to broker a deal on subsidies ahead of the Hong Kong meeting .
Those talks ended with a warning that failing to move ahead on agriculture risked jeopardizing the progress made in other trade discussions since July 2004 .
The White House trade representative , Rob Portman , said on Friday that " Hong Kong will not be a time for us to make some major breakthroughs that the United States had hoped for , but we do hope that we can make incremental progress and establish building blocks that would go toward even more progress early in the new year . "
He added that the United States was moving to address West African concerns about cotton subsidies , and that the United States expected some form of duty - free , quota - free access to be agreed upon for many goods from the poorest countries .
The European Union began allowing duty - free , quota - free imports in 2001 for most goods from these nations , and is now offering to eliminate its remaining barriers by 2009 on the imports of bananas , sugar and rice .
Japan is also offering a broad elimination of quotas and duties on imports from these countries , although it is seeking exemptions for rice and shoe imports .
Depending on what definition or threshold is used for the world 's poorest countries , 32 to 49 such countries could benefit .
The Group of 7 leading industrial nations , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are all preparing plans to provide extra aid to help these countries ' more vulnerable industries adjust to international competition .
Mr. Tsang and Mr. Lamy have each said that further progress is needed this week on broader issues like liberalizing global farm trade , lowering tariffs on industrial goods and increasing international competition in service industries like banking , insurance and transportation .
But they are also calling for early understandings among ministers on trade issues involving the poor countries , and for turning these understandings into an actual agreement .
" I have placed development issues at the top of the agenda right from the outset , " Mr. Tsang said Sunday afternoon , " and I would like to see an early harvest of the key development issues " at the meetings this week , " or at least see that we have made substantial progress in resolving them . "

Sprint Calls Dorm
My brother ( who is also my roomate ) has always had a unique way of dealing with telephone salespeople .... He talks to them .
and talks and talks and talks ..... It is always very interesting to hear .
One night about mid-night I decided I wanted to hear him do it again , but I was n't aware of any tele - marketers that were planning to call ( especially that late ) , so I decided to play a joke on him and create the call myself .
On Sprint 's web page they have a Call Back feature .
You enter your telephone number and within a few seconds your phone rings .
When you pick it up it says , " Thank you for using Sprint , " you hear one or two rings , and an operator asks how they can help you .
I had them call the room and stepped out in the hall .
Michael figured it must of been me , so he did n't wait long enough to talk to the operator .
However we did get an idea .
Why did we have to use our own number in the call back feature ?
It suddenly occured to us that this could the means of a very interesting prank .
We tried telling it to call Dave down the hall .
As it was calling , we went and stood outside his room .
Since both Dave and the operator thought the other person had placed the call it was pretty funny .
Dave had just gotten a new Sprint Phone card , so he thought they were calling about that .
The operator thought Dave was calling with a question about the phone card .
When they finally realized that they really did n't want to talk to each other , Dave told the operator to have a good evening and they hung up .
( Dave is very polite . )
The joke on Dave turned out good , so we went back to the room and called the number across the hall from Dave .
That conversation did n't last very long , but the guy came out of his room and told Dave about the weird call he had just received from Sprint .
We called Dave 's room again , but as soon as he picked up with the first operator we reset the Call Back page and entered his number again .
He was talking with the operator saying that this was the second call he had received that night when he got a call on the second line .
He asked the operator to hang on and switched over only to find yet another Sprint operator on the phone .
We heard him yell across the hall , " Sprint is calling me while they 're already on the phone with me ! "
We then called all the people at Dave 's end of the hall who were up .
Most of them had heard the commotion so they knew they were n't the only one to get the call .
Finally about 5 of them decided that a guy named Bryan must be down in the computer lab doing what we were actually doing from our room .
All 5 of them took off down the stairs to find Bryan .
As they were going downstairs we had Sprint call the front desk of our dorm .
Bryan was no where to be found , but they stopped to talk to the desk attendent who said , " The strangest thing just happened ...... "
It was several months before we actually took credit for the prank .
" The Most Beautiful Machine " is an idea of Claude E. Shannon , who died in 2001 .
His " Mathematical Theory of Communication " is the fundament of the digital machine .
It 's a communication based on the functions ON and OFF .
In this special case the observers are supposed to push the ON button .
After a while the lid of the trunk opens , a hand comes out and turns off the machine .
The trunk closes - that 's it !.

How does the idea of the long tail relate to patents ?
How big is the long tail of patentable ideas compared to the handful of developments that get anywhere commercially ?

Is Forgent a budding patent troll ?
Apart from a subsidiary that sells a
scheduling package , their only " products " are a couple of patents .

This looks to me like a preemptive strike by the pubpat organization against a
would - be patent troll .
It seems to have worked .
I wonder if prior art ever helps once someone actually is under attack from
someone who has decided to " monetize the intellectual property
assets " .
The two cases that come to mind are the Blackberry ( RIM ) case , and the case
reported earlier where Kodak went after Sun with some old apparently overly
broad patent they had bought .
RIM seemed to lose the infringement case even
though the troll 's patents were in the process of being thrown out .
Sun seemed
to decide it was cheaper to pay off Kodak , and judging from what happened to RIM
it seems hard to argue that paying was a bad financial decision by Sun . [ Reply to This | # ]

I seem to remember that when applying for a US patent you sign your name against
a statement that you have included all the prior art you know of and that you
have made reasonable efforts to discover more .
Furthermore is n't this statement
made " under penalty of perjury ? " .
If this is so should not the
inventors be expecting a call from officers of the law ? [ Reply to This | # ]

This is good news .
It will be even better if the patent office shows some
spirit and actively pursues the people who filed the patent on the perjury
angle .
I 've heard that this almost never happens , so patent filers think they
have nothing to fear should they fail to do a thorough search for prior art .

Here is the question :
Forgent should have known that there was prior art that invalidated theit patent
and failed to report this to the patent office .
Forgent made public claims against several companies on the basis of the tainted
patent .
Could a lanham claim be used against Forgent for making false statements ?

Now that it appears USPTO is finally starting to do it 's job according to it 's mandate , we need to follow up by keeping an eye on senators Dianne Feinstein ( D ) and Orrin Hatch ( R ) .
As you are probably aware , Feinstein is the poster girl for overreaching IP laws , due to her representing Hollywood .
Hatch is the poster boy for same , due to the fact that he is a manufacturer of intellectual property .
He is a capable song and hymn writer , and by pandering to ASCAP etc .
he hopes to make his first billion this way .
However , someone ought to tell him that the reason he is n't rolling in it has nothing to do with current legislation , but more to do with lack of salesmanship .
If you go to hatchmusic.com to order the music you get :
" 404 Error - The Page you have requested cannot be found . "
With USPTO enforcing the law according to intentions , I bet it will not take long before Hatch and Feinstein in bipartisan harmony will step up to the plate and introduce a bill to restore the broken order .
Last time I saw them on C - SPAN they made a hash out of XM sattelite radio , pandering to the record companies and ASCAP etc .
Did you know that old fashioned broadcast radio pays absolutely nothing in licenses ?
While internet streaming , and XM , Sirius etc. pays a huge chunk of their revenue ?
And that the record companies wanted even more , and have XM classified as distribution , instead of broadcasting .? [ Reply to This | # ]

I strongly disagree that this shows the system working to any useful degree .
1 . They have held the patent for a while , during which time they have intimidated people to prevent them from using the technology .
Even if all the claims are invalidated , they will never be held liable for the untold damage they have done by disallowing people for using it for that period of time , and I see no disincentive to trying this sort of thing again just because they got caught on this particular nuiscance patent .
2 . Demonstrating prior art is something that may not be doable in a vast majority of cases , because the evidence is not there .
Even if there was no prior art , it is likely ( based upon many examples ) that it was the obvious direction to go to solve a problem but they are apparently doing nothing to fix that .
I believe at this point , the system is still so open for abuse , that cooperating with the Patent system is endorsing its many abuses .
It allows them to say that the submissions have been competently reviewed , which they clearly have not .
People who file patents should be liable for class action lawsuits at the very least with attorneys fees paid so that there can be a strong incentive to overturn invalid patents and not the huge legal bill hurdle and a strong disincentive to do anything that harms others legitimate developments .

The problem in Patenting IDEAS is that probably , somewhere ,
somehow , has thought up the same idea before , and wrote it
down .
If you think about this for a while , it makes it very
hard to patent and IDEA , like software .
On the other hand , if you think up an IDEA , and track it
back to the original person , you are too late to have him
patent it because its already published as prior art .
I predict that in a couple of years , instead of having
" Patent Trolls " we are going to have " patent busting
trolls . "
These are the guys that , for a fee of course ,
will Bust any software patent you want busted !

I think what 's being said is that patent trolling should be made illegal .
Patent trolling is , by its very nature , fraud since organizations like Forgent
or RAMBUS do n't use their patent portfolios for anything except as a cudgel to
bludgeon everyone for money .
They do n't actually MAKE anything with those
patents except money .

The administration ’s new theme , designed to sell the Iraq war and the larger " war on terrorism " as an historic struggle against " fascism "  or " Islamo - fascism , " as the president and his blogger fan club would have it  is not merely a very bad joke .
As an analysis of where we are and what we are facing , it is worse than useless to compare Osama bin Laden ’s scattered , ragtag legions with the massed might of the Wehrmacht : it is a delusional inversion of reality .
Listen to Rummy as he tries to convince us it ’s 1939 :
" It was a time when a certain amount of cynicism and moral confusion set in among Western democracies .
When those who warned about a coming crisis , the rise of fascism and nazism , they were ridiculed or ignored .
Indeed , in the decades before World War II , a great many argued that the fascist threat was exaggerated or that it was someone else ’s problem .
Some nations tried to negotiate a separate peace , even as the enemy made its deadly ambitions crystal clear .
It was , as Winston Churchill observed , a bit like feeding a crocodile , hoping it would eat you last .
" There was a strange innocence about the world .
Someone recently recalled one U.S. senator ’s reaction in September of 1939 upon hearing that Hitler had invaded Poland to start World War II .
He exclaimed : ‘ Lord , if only I had talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided ! ’ "
He ’s talking about Sen. William E. Borah , the " Lion of Idaho , " a staunch opponent of U.S. intervention in World War II  along with the overwhelming majority of the American people at the time .
This majority included , I might add , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who  at least in his public pronouncements  declared his total opposition to U.S. intervention in the European conflict .
When Hitler invaded Poland , the president gave a press conference the next morning in which he echoed Borah ’s hope that American involvement could be avoided .
Questioned as to whether the U.S. could stay out of the war , he said , " I not only sincerely hope so , but I believe we can , and that every effort will be made by the administration to do so . "
Was Roosevelt , too , a victim of this " strange innocence " ?
Whatever else one may say about him , " innocent " is hardly [ . pdf ] the word that comes immediately to mind : he was , in fact , a coldly calculating politician and champion liar who , step by step , embroiled us in a worldwide conflagration that killed millions , handed Stalin half of Europe and much of Asia , and ensured the Soviet mutant a half century more of monstrous life .
In any case , the president that Rumsfeld and the other 1939ers would liken to our reigning chief executive echoed Borah ’s hopes for peace , however insincerely .
Roosevelt was a lot smarter than the current crop of warmongers , however , in that he pursued his goal  involving the U.S. in a world war  by indirection and stealth .
In 1939 , the strategy of the War Party was to gradually but persistently push the U.S. into war via a series of provocations , both overt and covert : this crowd is opposed in principle to such subtlety .
They declare outright that a new world war is on the horizon , one that will last for at least a generation .
Far from making every effort to avoid it , the American government is openly delighting in the prospect :
Bush brays , " Bring ’em on ! "
While regretting , in retrospect , this burst of honesty , his only mistake was in letting the mask slip down that far .
Justin Logan , an analyst with the foreign policy studies program at the Cato Institute , saw through the rhetorical subterfuge early on :
“ Can we get a name for inappropriately invoking the appeasement of Nazis ?
This is a tactic frequently used by neocons and various sundry warmongers who wish to portray opposing various wars as morally equivalent to pulling up a lawn chair and a Corona to watch the Holocaust .
For a recent example of ‘ The Fallacy of ’ 39 ’ ( as I ’ll call it until somebody offers something better ) , see Bill ‘ I ’m One of the Worst NYT Columnists  And That ’s Saying Something !’
Safire ’s latest , in which not invading Iraq would be the same as failing to oppose Nazism . ”
Charles Krauthammer has found this fallacy particularly useful : whether it ’s China , Russia , North Korea , or Iran , as Brendan Nyhan points out , the face of the enemy always morphs into the mustachioed visage of the German chancellor .
Somehow , it ’s always 1939 .
I wo n’t go into the absurdities of conflating German national socialism or Italian fascism with the theological obscurantism peddled by Osama bin Laden and his cohorts .
Suffice to say that the modernist vision of a super - centralized corporatist state , secular at its core , that constitutes classical fascist ideology is in many ways the opposite of the Islamist vision , which is supranational , not super - nationalistic , and nowhere commands state power .
There is , at any rate , no real attempt to validate the Fallacy of ’ 39 : it is simply asserted , without any real arguments drawing on the supposed historical parallels .
It is nothing but rhetorical wind , the passing of which is meant to befoul the political atmosphere and smear the War Party ’s opponents as the contemporary equivalent of Nazi sympathizers .
Bin Laden and his fellow terrorists are monsters , surely , but they are not fascists  a term that has a very specific meaning , one that hardly fits al - Qaeda .
Yet there are fascists in this world .
We are indebted to Lew Rockwell , president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute , for identifying a new variant of this totalitarian creed in what he calls " red- state fascism , " which is fast becoming the dominant ideology of the neoconized GOP .
To be sure , he diagnoses this as an incipient breed of the fascist virus , not yet full - blown , but a dangerous trend nonetheless  and one that has been greatly exacerbated since the publication of Lew ’s prescient article .
I took up this theme in a column , as did Scott McConnell in The American Conservative , and those interested in the subject can peruse these pieces at their leisure .
The point , however , is that the " Islamo - fascist " meme is a classic example of projection  that is , superimposing one ’s own motives and psychology on someone else .
The " red- state fascism " exemplified by the Bushian Republican Party does indeed resemble the classic version in more ways than one :
There is the Leader Principle , which gives the presidency nearly as much legal and political weight as the national socialists gave their Führer .
There is the creation of a super - centralized surveillance society , in which the civil liberties of individual citizens are liquidated in the interests of " national security . "
And there is , above all , a militantly expansionist foreign policy , a vision of world hegemony founded on conquest and baptized in the blood of innocents .
When the Bushians call bin Laden a " fascist , " the only proper response is , Look who ’s talking !
There is a fascist threat to America , all right , but it is n’t coming from overseas .
It is n’t hiding in the caves of Wahhabistan , but lurking in Washington ’s corridors of power .
The same people who warn us of a " fascist " threat coming from abroad are the main purveyors of authoritarianism on the home front .
And that is what life is like in the Bizarro World of America in the year A.D. 2006 , where the most militant fascists of all style themselves the leaders of a new " anti-fascist " popular front .

Tauschen verboten
VON CHRISTIAN RATH
Die Hüterin der Schulhöfe hat nun doch nachgegeben .
Justizministerin Brigitte Zypries ( SPD ) verzichtet bei der geplanten Reform zum Urheberrecht auf die von ihr angekündigte „ Bagatellklausel “ .
Mit dieser Klausel wollte sie gelegentliche Nutzer von Internet - Musik - und Filmtauschbörsen vor Strafverfolgung bewahren .
Durchgesetzt hat sich nun aber die CDU .
„ Es darf keine unterschiedliche Wertung zwischen dem Diebstahl eines Kaugummis und einem illegalen Download geben “ , hatte der CDU - Urheberrechtsexperte Günther Krings gefordert .
Künftig wird der vor allem bei Jugendlichen beliebte Download von Musiktiteln aus Internet - Tauschbörsen also strafbar sein .
Zulässig bleibt nur das Brennen einer CD für Freunde – wenn dabei kein Kopierschutz der Plattenfirma verletzt wird .
Dies sind die Kernpunkte einer Reform des Urheberrechts , die die Bundesregierung gestern in die Wege geleitet hat .
Noch in diesem Jahr soll der Bundestag den Gesetzentwurf beschließen .
Anlass der Reform sind Klagen der Plattenfirmen und Filmverleihe über Umsatzrückgänge , für die sie Internettauschbörsen sowie selbst gebrannte CDs und DVDs verantwortlich machen .
In zwei Schritten hat Ministerin Zypries deshalb versucht , das Urheberrecht den neuen Zeiten anzupassen .
Ihr Ziel ist ein Interessenausgleich zwischen Kultur - und Industrielobby einerseits und Internet - Nutzern andererseits .
Traditionell gilt im Urheberrecht : Jeder kann für sich und seine Freunde Privatkopien eines geschützten Werkes anfertigen .
Früher wurde eine Schallplatte auf Kassette überspielt .
Heute kann man mit dem Computer von der selbst gekauften CD eine Doublette brennen und an Freunde verschenken .
Das bleibt auch weiterhin zulässig .
Im erste Teil der Reform wurde zugunsten der Plattenfirmen aber eine wichtige Einschränkung eingebaut .
Wenn die Plattenfirmen ihre CDs mit Kopierschutz versehen , dann darf dieser nicht umgangen werden .
Damit war die Industrie eindeutig Gewinner der ersten Reform , die im Herbst 2003 in Kraft trat .
Auch die zweite Runde scheint nun ganz im Sinne der Industrie abzulaufen .
Indem die Novelle Internet - Tauschbörsen komplett für illegal erklärt , schließt sie das letzte noch verbliebene Schlupfloch .
Bisher war der Download von Dateien nämlich nur verboten , wenn die Vorlage „ offensichtlich rechtswidrig hergestellt “ wurde .
Damit war nicht der häufige Fall erfasst , dass jemand ein Stück anbietet , das von einer legal gekauften CD stammt .
Hier war zwar bisher schon das Angebot illegal , nicht aber das Herunterladen .
„ Wer einen Kinofilm schon vor dem offiziellen Start aus einer Internet - Tauschbörse herunterlädt , weiß natürlich , dass es sich um ein rechtswidriges Angebot handelt und agiert daher selbst rechtswidrig “ , sagte Zypries gestern .
Das gilt allerdings auch für kommerzielle Musik - CDs .
Es gibt künftig keinen gutgläubigen Download von kostenlosen Tauschnetzwerken mehr .
Weil damit die Strafbarkeit künftig deutlich ausgeweitet ist , wollte Zypries zum Ausgleich eigentlich eine Bagatellklausel einführen .
Von der Strafverfolgung wären demnach diejenigen ausgenommen worden , die Internet - Tauschbörsen nur selten und „ zum privaten Gebrauch “ nutzen .
„ Die Schulhöfe sollten nicht kriminalisiert werden “ , sagte Zypries damals .
Sie wollte die Akzeptanz des Urheberrechts bewahren , indem der kleine Privatnutzer generell unbehelligt bleibt .
In der Bundesregierung stieß dies aber auf Widerstand .
Vor allem Kulturstaatsminister Bernd Neumann ( CDU ) fürchtete um das Rechts - und Wertebewusstsein der Jugend .
Und so strich die wenig standfeste Ministerin ihre Bagatellklausel wieder aus dem Gesetzentwurf .
Ihr Argument : Auch künftig wird die Staatsanwaltschaft die Verfahren gegen Gelegenheits - Downloader „ wegen Geringfügigkeit “ einstellen .
Allerdings kann man ein Ermittlungsverfahren nur einstellen , wenn es zuvor eröffnet wurde .
Es muss also zumindest eine Akte angelegt werden .
Das findet nicht jeder angenehm .
Außerdem könnte die Praxis der Staatsanwaltschaften je nach Bundesland ganz unterschiedlich ausfallen .
Bisher gibt es in Deutschland kaum Strafverfolgung gegen Tauschbörsen - Nutzer .
Das könnte sich aber schnell ändern , wenn ein zweiter parallel verfolgter Entwurf zum Gesetz wird .
Die Bundesregierung plant nämlich , der Musik - und Filmindustrie erstmals Auskunftsansprüche gegen Internet - Provider zu geben .
Diese müssen dann sagen , wer in größerem Stil illegale Tauschbörsen nutzt .
Die Industrie kann dann Schadenersatz von den so Entlarvten verlangen .
Sie kann aber auch Strafanzeige gegen konkrete Personen erheben , was eine verschärfte Strafverfolgung möglich macht .
Auf Urheberrechtsverletzungen stehen bis zu drei Jahre Haft oder Geldstrafe .
Dennoch spricht die Ministerin nach wie vor von einem fairen Ausgleich zwischen Industrie und Nutzern .
Being clever , it seems , is a good way to avoid being eaten .
Predators such as chimpanzees and wild cats tend to hunt small - brained prey that are less able to think their way out of a tight corner .
Robin Dunbar and Susanne Shultz of the University of Liverpool , UK , examined predator and prey relationships in five forest communities , and found that the most important factor determining which prey chimps and cats like to eat was the relative size of its brain ( Biology Letters , DOI : 10.1098/rsbl.2006.0519 ) .
The explanation , say Dunbar and Shultz , is that while prey species implement a wide variety …
One in six UK workers have partaken of alcohol during working hours , a shock YouGov survey of 1,500 full time employees commissioned by Royal & SunAlliance has revealed .
Or rather , one sixth of the Brit workforce has been " under the influence of alcohol at work in the last six months " , while two million wobbly employees have pulled a hangover - induced sickie during the same period .
This " crisis " is , according to Royal & SunAlliance 's Alcohol in the Workplace , set to escalate into a full - blown business disaster next month as staff abandon their desks and rush to the nearest boozer before sinking the obligatory twelve pints as England go down 3 - 1 to Trinidad and Tobago .
Indeed , an estimated 2.9 m workers - representing one tenth of the working population - will bunk off early to watch the footie .
Of these , 1.4 m will soak up a skinful in the pub before returning to work .
Some employers have decided to tackle this problem head - on , with 20 per cent of firms planning to show England matches , and an enlightened 12 per cent offering all World Cup games .
Four per cent of companies have gone so far as to say they will give their workforce the day off if England win the World Cup , although they must be aware that the chance of having to fulfil this pledge are extremely remote .
The basic purpose of Alcohol in the Workplace was to gauge the effect on business of 24 - hour licensing .
While it found that neither employers nor employees thought the problem of workplace leglessness had got worse as a result , it does note an " ongoing cultural problem in Britain " .
The places where this cultural problem is most ongoing is London and eastern England , where 26 per cent of employees admitted to drinking while on duty .
These were closely followed by the south west , notching up a liver - bashing 24 per cent .
The north east and north west were identified as not giving it 110 per cent with the lowest pissed - at - my - post ' fess - up rate .
Although the Royal & SunAlliance figures may cause alarm among UK biz 's resolutely sober management , there is cause for optimism .
Back in 2004 , a related survey claimed that 76 per cent of workers got sloshed at lunchtime - a statistic which seemed to augur the imminent collapse of the British economy . ®

A quick survey of the staff at Vulture Central revealed the following :
100 per cent of the journalistic staff admitted to sinking at least one bottle of scotch per week while at work - rising to three bottles if they were on " financial results " duty .
A similar number declared their intention to abandon the office for England matches , with two hacks even admitting to having applied for joint UK / Brazilian / French / German nationality in order to maximise the World Cup skive potential .
Those among the Reg staff of Antipodean persuasion were 73 per cent more likely to call in sick as a result of a hangover - not because they drink more , but because they simply can't handle the pace .
Should You Leave It All to the Children ?
If you do , you may not be doing them a favor .
But if you want to , there are sensible ways of passing on what you have without depriving the kids of a feeling of achievement .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) – WARREN BUFFETT , 56 , the chairman and guiding genius of Berkshire Hathaway , the phenomenally successful holding company , is worth at least $ 1.5 billion .
But do n't bother being jealous of his three children .
Buffett does not believe that it is wise to bequeath great wealth and plans to give most of his money to his charitable foundation .
Having put his two sons and a daughter through college , the Omaha investor contents himself with giving them several thousand dollars each at Christmas .
Beyond that , says daughter Susan , 33 , '' If I write my dad a check for $ 20 , he cashes it . ''
Buffett is not cutting his children out of his fortune because they are wastrels or wantons or refuse to go into the family business -- the traditional reasons rich parents withhold money .
Says he : '' My kids are going , to carve out their own place in this world , and they know I 'm for them whatever they want to do . ''
But he believes that setting up his heirs with '' a lifetime supply of food stamps just because they came out of the right womb '' can be ' ' harmful ' ' for them and is '' an antisocial act . ''
To him the perfect amount to leave children is '' enough money so that they would feel they could do anything , but not so much that they could do nothing . ''
For a college graduate , Buffett reckons '' a few hundred thousand dollars ' ' sounds about right .
How much should you leave the kids ?
Agonizing over that question is a peculiarly American obsession .
In much of the world custom and law dictate that children , unless they have committed some heinous crime , automatically receive most of the parents ' wealth when they die .
Only Britain and her former colonies -- common - law countries all -- give property owners the freedom to leave their children whatever they want .
And nowhere is the feeling about inherited wealth so ambivalent as in the U.S.
No country so readily celebrates the self - made man , no culture is more suspicious that the silver spoon contains something vaguely narcotic .
Says Curtis L. Carlson , 72 , the Minnesota travel and real estate magnate ( Radisson Hotel Corp. , TGI Friday 's restaurants , and the Ask Mr. Foster travel agency ) , who has a net worth of $ 700 million and two married daughters : '' There 's nothing people like me worry about more -- how the hell do we keep our money from destroying our kids ? ''
Certainly nowhere else in the world do so many parents enjoy the privilege of grappling with this dilemma .
The Federal Reserve Board estimates that some 1.3 million U.S. households enjoy a net worth of at least $ 1 million .
The vast majority of millionaires inherited their wealth or built it on a business they founded .
Plenty of corporate careerists have also racked up seven - figure estates by taking advantage of profit - sharing and pension plans .
But concern for how best to provide for the offspring is not exclusive to the millionaires ' club .
Estate planning is fast becoming a major concern of the middle class .
Whatever their misgivings about inheritance , most Americans -- rich , poor , and somewhere in between -- keep the bulk of their estates in the family .
Once formed , a chain of inherited wealth is rarely broken -- until the money runs out .
It has pretty much run out for some of the great names of U.S. business : the Dodges , Reynoldses , and Vanderbilts .
The sons of Texas oil tycoon H. L. Hunt , whose fortune was once estimated at $ 8 billion , have just filed for bankruptcy protection for the family 's corporate jewel , Placid Oil Co .
Of 30 multimillionaires recently surveyed by FORTUNE , six say their children will be better off with only minimal inheritances .
Almost half plan to leave at least as much to charity as to their heirs .
In an area where almost no research exists , Alexander Sanger , a partner with the law firm White & Case in New York , offers a revealing statistic .
Of 20 wills Sanger has drawn up for newly wealthy parents with net worths of $ 20 million or more , 16 left at least half the estates to charity .
Of 12 comparable old - money estates , only one gave so much away .
Old money tends to keep its wealth in the family .
'' After a generation or more , inheritance becomes a stewardship kind of thing , '' says Alexander Forger , head of estate law at the New York firm Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy .
Sometimes , as in the case of one of the firm 's clients , the Rockefeller family , the progenitor already fattened some foundation with a big endowment years ago .
Even inheritors who want to give their money away feel duty - bound to pass on some of their wealth to their children .
George Pillsbury Jr. , 37 , a scion of the Midwestern baking family , inherited more than $ 1 million while still in college .
He has spent his adult life building and bankrolling a network of foundations that tap young inheritors for a variety of liberal causes .
'' Robin Hood was Right , '' declares one foundation pamphlet .
Pillsbury believes in '' much , much higher '' inheritance taxes .
Yet despite his politics , he says '' it seems unfair ' ' not to leave his two young children at least a few hundred thousand dollars .
Why should n't parents leave it all to the children ?
Newspaper headlines shriek the more lurid reasons -- drugs , derangement , even murder .
In July a Pennsylvania judge ruled Lewis du Pont Smith , 29 , heir to $ 1.5 million of the Du Pont fortune , '' mentally incompetent ' ' to manage his affairs ; Smith had been handing over thousands of dollars to political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. This month a Florida judge sentenced Steven Benson , 35 , heir to a $ 10 - million tobacco fortune , to 72 years in prison for killing his mother and her adopted son with a car bomb .
WHAT usually troubles successful entrepreneurs and executives , however , is the mundane but far more likely prospect that large inheritances will encourage their offspring to do nothing useful with their lives .
They worry that Commodore Vanderbilt 's grandson William , heir to some $ 60 million in 1885 , was right when he declared that '' inherited wealth . . . is as certain death to ambition as cocaine is to morality . ''
( An indifferent businessman and dedicated bon vivant , William suffered a fatal heart attack at a fashionable French race track in 1920 . )
Says centimillionaire Curt Carlson : '' I know one extremely wealthy Minnesota family that has 63 heirs in the fourth generation , and none is gainfully employed .
I think that 's terrible . ''
One self - made multimillionaire wants to ensure that his heirs are leading productive lives before they get a share of his estate .
He has set up trusts for each of his children -- a sound estate - planning practice even for middle - income families ( see box , page 24 ) .
None of the trusts pays a penny until the child reaches 30 .
Until then , the entrepreneur says , he expects his sons and daughters , all still under 30 , to ''live on the salaries that young adults who are college graduates can make . ''
The terms of his trusts also allow him or his executors to withhold the kids ' patrimony in certain situations .
Says he : '' I believe you 've got to be doing right , or you do n't get anything .
If I end up with a 30 - year - old who 's not worth a plugged nickel , all his money goes to my personal foundation . ''
ENCOURAGING rich children to be self - supporting can be good for them .
John L. Levy , executive director of the C.G. Jung Institute of San Francisco , has spent the past five years studying the effects of inherited wealth on 30 families .
He concludes that many wealthy children experience '' considerable suffering and deprivation ' ' because they have little self - respect .
'' It 's hard for them to take much satisfaction in their accomplishments since they always suspect that their successes are at least partly the result of the wealth and position they have inherited . ''
To let children grow up free of their parents ' long shadows is the main reason rich individuals choose to withhold or limit their legacies .
New Yorker Eugene Lang , 67 , for example , built a fortune of more than $ 50 million by founding REFAC Technology Development Corp. , a high - tech licensing company .
Lang paid for the education of his three children and after college handed each '' a nominal sum ' ' -- he wo n't say how much .
Since then he has given them nothing but encouragement .
Says Lang : '' To me inheritance dilutes the motivation that most young people have to fulfill the best that is in them .
I want to give my kids the tremendous satisfaction of making it on their own . ''
Now in their 30s , his children are a lawyer , an actor , and an investment analyst .
They will get nothing from their father 's estate .
Lang plans to provide '' adequate security '' for his wife and bequeath the rest to a charitable foundation .
He has already given away more than $ 25 million to hospitals , colleges , and a scholarship program for Harlem schoolchildren .
Californian Gordon Moore , 57 , who co-founded semiconductor maker Intel and is worth $ 200 million , agrees that '' children ought to have a sense of accomplishment for what they 've done . ''
Moore set up small trusts for his two sons when they were young -- '' the sort of thing that let my older boy make a down payment on the house ' ' -- but does not plan to do much more .
He expects to leave '' almost everything ' ' to charity .
Still , the urge to heap most of the wealth upon the family continues to be powerful .
'' I 'd rather give my money to my kids than do anything else with it , '' says Jackson T. Stephens , 63 , chairman of Stephens Inc. of Little Rock , Arkansas , the largest investment bank outside New York .
'' If my heirs want to clip coupons , that 'll be their business .
I can't control the future , and I 'm not going to worry a whole bunch . ''
Stephens , who has four children , and his older brother Wilton , who also has four children , share a net worth of at least $ 500 million .
Some entrepreneurs and their heirs argue that rather than being a disincentive to work , an inheritance can give a child a target to outstrip .
'' I feel I 've got to make my mark equal or better than my father , '' says Warren Stephens , 29 , Jackson 's son .
California real estate developer M. Larry Lawrence , 60 , who has three children and a fortune worth more than $ 200 million , concurs .
Says he , '' If the children have been brought up right , they end up attempting to outdo the parents . ''
INEVITABLY those who hand on their wealth see proper upbringing as the ultimate safeguard against potential problems .
Says Katharine Graham , 69 , chief executive of the Washington Post Co. and head of a family whose fortune totals some $ 350 million : '' My instinct would be to just pass the money on and hope that in doing so you also pass on your values -- how to use it , the life to lead , the standards to have . ''
Besides , some rich individuals argue , not giving it to the children can cause problems too .
Says one : '' If you 're the child and you see your father with all this dough and you get some but not much , I just can't help thinking resentment will enter in . ''
Susan Buffett , who works in Washington as an administrative assistant to the editor of U.S. News & World Report and is married to a public interest lawyer , admits her father 's position is tough to live with .
'' My dad is one of the most honest , principled , good guys I know , '' she says .
'' And I basically agree with him .
But it 's sort of strange when you know most parents want to buy things for their kids and all you need is a small sum of money -- to fix up the kitchen , not to go to the beach for six months .
He wo n't give it to us on principle .
All my life my father has been teaching us .
Well , I feel I 've learned the lesson .
At a certain point you can stop . ''
Parents who disinherit not on principle but because they disapprove of their young heir 's behavior face a troubling prospect -- they might be making a mistake .
Just days before committing suicide in 1963 , R. E. Turner Jr. , the father of maverick television mogul Ted Turner , arranged a quick sale of his Atlanta billboard business to Curt Carlson .
Recalls Carlson , who had no idea that the elder Turner was planning to kill himself : '' He told me he wanted to have some money to leave his wife when he died , but that everything he had was tied up in his business .
He said he was sure if Ted got his hands on the business , he would run it into the ground .
''
Within days of Turner 's death , Carlson got a call from his widow , Florence , and a visit from Ted , then 24 .
Says Carlson , '' His mother wanted Ted to have the business back , and Ted , who can be very convincing , talked about how this was his one chance to get going in life . ''
Persuaded , Carlson sold the business back to Ted , who has been going fast ever since .
Estate planning is particularly tough when the legacy is a family business .
Most entrepreneurs do not plan to sell out , as R. E . Turner did , but try to keep the business in the family .
Says Curt Carlson , whose privately held Carlson Cos. brought in revenues of more than $ 3 billion last year : '' You think of your company as your own baby .
You hate to think of someone buying it and then the name is gone . ''
But leaving it to the children will not guarantee that the business stays in family hands .
Because of fraternal fights , the Bingham family 's Louisville newspaper and broadcasting empire went up for sale last January .
Destructive squabbles are most likely to break out when family members try to sell company stock to outsiders , an act viewed as disloyal by those desperate to keep control .
In St. Louis the heirs of legendary Joseph Pulitzer staged a noisy row this year over the attempted sale of some Pulitzer Publishing Co. stock .
The family members who wanted to sell backed a takeover bid by Alfred Taubman , a Detroit - based real estate developer .
Chairman Joseph Pulitzer Jr. , his half brother , and a cousin struck a deal to buy out the dissidents ' shares at three times the pre-feud price .
Taubman is still fighting in the courts .
Chicago centimillionaire Lester Crown , 61 , worries that mercenary motives among family members could one day force the breakup of his very private business empire .
The Crowns ' holdings range from building materials , hotels , and real estate to 23 % of General Dynamics , one of the largest U.S. defense contractors .
Over the years , says Lester , he and his father , Henry , 90 , have '' always treated our operations as a common pot . ''
They have handed out voting shares and limited partnerships in the various businesses to Lester 's uncles , cousins , brothers , nieces , and nephews , as well as his seven children .
Lester predicts that '' one of these days we 're going to get hit in the back of the head because we did this . ''
If he could do it over again , he would still give the family '' the ability to enjoy the good life ' ' by setting up a single trust to pay out a guaranteed income to everyone .
But he would make sure that control of the companies was '' retained by those who operate the business . ''
The Coors family of Colorado has kept its brewery bubbling with just such an arrangement since 1969 .
All the company 's voting stock sits in a trust , whose trustees can only be family members active in the business .
Says Bill Coors , 70 , chairman of Adolph Coors Co. and grandson of the founder : '' We 've minimized family feuds by concentrating control in the hands of those most dedicated to preserving the family values . ''
Warren Buffett argues that most proprietors should forget trying to keep the management of their beloved companies in the family ; he assumes current nonfamily management will continue running Berkshire Hathaway after he is gone .
He grants that occasionally an heir may be the most suitable candidate to manage a company but believes the odds are against it .
Says Buffett : '' Would anyone say the best way to pick a championship Olympic team is to select the sons and daughters of those who won 20 years ago ?
Giving someone a favored position just because his old man accomplished something is a crazy way for a society to compete . ''
Buffett especially admires how fellow Omaha businessman Peter Kiewit solved his legacy problem .
Kiewit arranged his affairs so that when he died in 1979 his 40 % stake in the family 's enormously successful construction company was sold to employees .
The proceeds from the sale then went to a charitable foundation that he had established to promote education and social services in Nebraska .
Kiewit left approximately 3 % of his $ 186 - million estate to his widow , his son , Peter Jr. , 60 , and other relatives .
Peter , a successful Phoenix lawyer , was surprised by the $ 1.5 - million legacy he received at age 53 .
Says he , '' I was raised to expect nothing , and supported myself all my life .
In the end , I think my father was saying from the grave that he approved . ''
FOR WEALTHY PARENTS , and even for those with more modest estates , the question of how much to leave the kids is a highly subjective matter .
But here are a few points worth keeping in mind .
Do n't play hide - and - seek .
Forget locking your will away in mystery like some 19th - century miser .
Bring the family finances into the daylight , so the children will know what they are getting and where it came from , and will have some idea how to hold on to it .
They should also , of course , know if they are not getting anything .
For example , George Pillsbury knew that he would get more than $ 1 million when he turned 21 -- '' It 's tough to be unaware of your wealth when you have a brand name , '' he says .
But many of his friends had no idea what was coming to them .
'' A lot of them were shocked , '' he recalls , and some had trouble coping with their new fortunes .
John Train , whose investment firm claims to be the largest in New York City serving rich families , recommends that talks about money , like those about sex , begin as early as possible .
These can evolve into full - scale sessions on the family finances .
Lester Crown is a big booster of this idea : '' We started when the kids were young and put the dollar signs in as they got older . ''
Former Treasury Secretary William Simon , who has made tens of millions in leveraged buyouts since leaving Washington , says that at one of his family 's regular meetings , his seven children had to read and discuss 19th - century steel magnate Andrew Carnegie 's essay '' The Gospel of Wealth . ''
( Carnegie argued that by giving away their great fortunes , rich men would produce '' an ideal state in which the surplus wealth of the few will become , in the best sense , the property of the many . '')
Though the children of Eugene Lang will not share in his estate , they and Lang 's wife are trustees of his private foundation and join in deciding where to give .
Says Lang : '' In a way they 're spending their inheritance with me here and now and getting a lot of satisfaction and joy from it . ''
No amount of family talk will guarantee that the children will not turn out like Tommy Manville , the asbestos heir who went through 13 marriages and millions of dollars , or Huntington Hartford of the A&P fortune , who has lost a reported $ 90 million in a lifetime of bad business deals .
But it should help .
Shelve the silver spoon .
Psychiatrists say the lack of work experience not only alienates heirs from humanity , but also contributes to insecurity about their ability to survive without their inheritance .
H. Ross Perot , 56 , the Texas billionaire who founded Electronic Data Systems , a computer services company , and sold it to General Motors , puts it this way : '' If your kids grow up living in fairyland thinking that they 're princes and princesses , you 're going to curse their lives . ''
T. Boone Pickens Jr. , chairman of Mesa Petroleum and worth tens of millions of dollars , remembers his middle - class upbringing as '' the best a boy could have . ''
When he graduated from college , Pickens thought his father , a buyer of oil leases for Phillips Petroleum , might give him $ 500 or so .
Instead , all he got was '' good luck . ''
Pickens plans to leave at least half his estate to charity ; he has arranged what he considers small trusts for his five children and three stepchildren .
Says he : '' If you do n't watch out , you can set up a situation where a child never has the pleasure of bringing home a paycheck . ''
Do n't be afraid to experiment .
Robert D. Rogers , chief executive officer of Texas Industries , a manufacturer of cement and steel , swears by a Texas - size version of every parent 's basic financial training tool -- the allowance .
At 18 , each of his three children began receiving annual stipends that covered living expenses and then some -- college costs , clothing , travel .
The youngsters were not accountable for the money , but if it ran out , tough luck .
As an incentive to save , the children could claim whatever remained when they reached 25 .
'' My oldest son ran through his first year 's income in nine months and had to go to work , '' recalls Rogers , who credits a Texas Instruments co-founder , Eugene McDermott , with the idea .
Young Rogers never ran out again .
If you are going to leave money to your children , a generous living allowance should give you a good idea what they will do with it .
Parents who want to encourage their offspring to work , and provide them a little extra money besides , can create incentive income trusts designed to match or double the child 's salary .
The trusts also can be set up to pay out principal if a child achieves some objective , such as attaining tenure at a university or even holding down a steady job .
Give later rather than sooner .
Most estate advisers now agree that 21 , the age of majority , is too early for most children to reap a windfall .
Warns John Train : '' Very large sums handed over to children who have done nothing to deserve them almost inevitably tend to corrupt them . ''
Ross Perot , as usual , is more blunt : '' Anybody who gives kids a lot of money at 21 does n't have much sense . ''
Bill Simon suggests that '' sensible parents ' ' put a reasonable amount in trust that only starts paying interest at , say , 35 , and then allows access to principal in two installments at 40 and 45 .
What 's a reasonable amount ?
Says Simon : '' Everybody has to define that for himself . ''
Trust in God and take short views .
It 's 2075 .
Do you know who your great - great - grandchildren are ?
Do you really care ?
Louis Auchincloss , the novelist , estate lawyer , and scion of one of America 's most prominent families , believes the ' ' dynastic impulse ' ' is on the wane in America .
'' When I came out of law school , people were always deeply concerned about their great - grandchildren , '' he says .
'' Not now . ''
That may be no bad thing ; the U.S. is littered with indolent people who were ruined by trusts set up by adoring grandparents .
Besides , Congress has tightened tax loopholes that encourage generation - skipping trusts .
If you want to ensure some accountability among your heirs , you might consider Ross Perot 's advice to make bequests one generation at a time .
Says he : '' Let your children decide how much to give their children . ''
Do n't live and die in Louisiana .
The Bayou State adheres to the Napoleonic Code , which requires forced heirship : A single child is entitled to claim one - quarter of any estate , two or more children split half .
If you want to give more , that 's no problem .
If you want to disinherit , Baton Rouge lawyer Gerald Le Van says the state recognizes a few reasons as valid -- attempted assault against the parent , conviction for a felony , and a debatable rule , just passed by the legislature last session , '' failure to communicate for two years without just cause . ''
If you want to give it all to charity , Le Van advises moving to another state .
Put child rearing before estate planning .
Chicago psychoanalyst Roy Grinker Jr. worked with the children of the very rich for 15 years .
Often the problem in wealthy households , he says , is that parents pay too little attention to their children 's upbringing .
'' Rather than give rich parents money advice , I would give them child - rearing advice , '' says Grinker .
'' I would say , ' Pay attention to your kids , spend some time with your kids , love your kids . ' ''
Warren Buffett cheerfully agrees : '' Love is the greatest advantage a parent can give . ''
Amazon , the online retailer , has begun selling Kellogg ’s Corn Flakes and Campbell ’s Cream of Mushroom soup , as it continues its push to establish itself as the dominant online one - stop shopping destination .
The retailer ’s US customers can now buy almost 2,000 basic packaged foods online , including 12 - packs of Campbell ’s Cream of Mushroom soup for $ 12.99 , and multi-packs of 70 individual servings of Kellogg ’s Corn Flakes for $ 28 .
The retailer will also pay for the delivery of most grocery orders of more than $ 25 – underlining the degree to which it is absorbing costs as it expands its online presence into everything from sex toys to loose diamonds .
Amazon said it had gradually expanded the “ food and snacks ” segment of its online “ health and personal care ” store in recent months .
It said the move mirrored the increasing availability of basic food items at mainstream US drug stores such as CVS and Walgreens .
“ We look on this as a drug store , and you are going to find food items in a drug store , ” said Tracy Ogden , an Amazon spokeswoman .
By focusing on bulk purchases of non-perishable items delivered by parcel service , Amazon ’s grocery sales contrast with the limited number of online grocers in the US such as Peapod , a unit of Royal Ahold , and Safeway.com .
The move also reflects the development of websites such as 1800 diapers.com which order bulk sales of low margin packaged items such as baby supplies , creating online competition for discount clubs such as Costco and Wal - Mart ’s Sam ’s Club .
Amazon ’s food selection – beyond canned soup – is also dominated by more upscale , higher - margin brands in line with the demographics of its typical users , with organic products from Wild Oats , the second largest US organic and natural grocery chain , and from Paul Newman ’s Natural Organics .
But its bulk purchase pricing is also undercutting its online competition .
Campbell ’s Beef and Rice chunky soup , for instance , sells for $ 1.57 a can on Amazon , compared with $ 2.69 per can on Peapod , the largest US online grocer .
However , one online grocer commented that Amazon ’s bulk strategy did n’t seem to present a direct threat to a service that stressed fresh products and reliable and convenient delivery .
Amazon offers a range of estimates for delivery of its food items , with the Campbell ’s soup taking up to five weeks .
Without free shipping , it would incur standard delivery costs of $ 9.65 .
Online grocery services have been less successful in the US than in Europe , reflecting lower population densities and differing shopping habits .

F ull - time freelancing : 10 things learned in 180 days
~ 28 November 2005 ~
This Friday will welcome two special events : 1 ) the birthday of my beloved wife ( Happy B- day Suzanne ! ) and 2 ) the 6 - month mark of freelancing full - time .
The first was an extremely solid decision — gratitude overflows at the thought of her saying ‘ yes ’ more than 7 years ago .
The second , however , was a veritable leap of faith .
I was physically and mentally tired from several years of doing the day job / side work thing , I ’m the sole provider for our family , and our fourth son was to be born just 2 days after making the leap .
Somehow it ’s all worked out .
We ’ve continued to pay the bills .
There ’s no shortage of requests for work .
And I ’ve enjoyed recapturing my evenings and Saturdays , filled with family and personal time .
Thus , here are 10 things learned over the last 6 months .
This topic has been exhausted elsewhere by many others , so I hope I ’ve avoided duplicating what ’s already been said .
1 . Err on the side of abundant contact .
If choosing among infrequent contact vs. abundant contact with clients , always offer more than less .
Currently only 2 of my clients reside in Utah .
The rest are scattered abroad .
That typically means a remote working environment , in which email , IM , and phone replace traditional face - to - face or in - house interaction .
Do whatever each project requires to ensure clients feel cared for and attended to .
I ’ve even held daily phone calls with clients over an extended period of time when it meant keeping a project on task .
2. Care for the future .
It ’s extremely easy to get caught up in client work in the present and fail to give proper attention to the marketing of one ’s business in the future .
Roughly 90 % of my work comes as a result my site , and I ’d be foolish to fail to author articles or other fresh content .
However , my writing has slowed at times because of workload , and it ’s a constant battle to ensure I keep a fresh presence .
Set aside at least one - half day a week to promoting your business , whether that means cold calling , blogging , direct marketing , or other forms of self - promotion .
3 . Care for the present .
A charge to care for the future comes only with the harsh reality of caring for the present .
It ’s impossible to be concerned about future business without first successfully executing what ’s already on the table .
Work in progress is by far the better revenue stream when compared to potential prospects that may or may not pan out , so treat existing clients with care .
4. Avoid Monday deadlines .
A while back I asked many of you to test 37 signal ’s newly launched Writeboard by answering the question , “ Mondays : Excellent or lousy for deadlines ? ”
( You can still access the board here by entering the password “ authentic ” . )
I ’m not certain this is the best use of Writeboard , but the exercise was worth the effort .
Some of you argued for Monday deadlines , others against .
My take ?
Unless the thought of spending your weekend behind a PC gets you giddy , you ’d be wise to avoid Monday .
I , for one , made the leap to freelance precisely to avoid working the weekends .
A Monday deadline is anything but elusive of weekend client work .
Sure , I ’ve had to work my share of Saturdays since making the leap — it ’s inevitable at times .
But when I have any say in a deadline or the preparation thereof , I avoid Mondays at all costs .
5 . Be cautious responding to emails outside business hours .
Though I typically check email on Saturdays and evenings , I tend not to respond unless urgent .
I ’m cognizant of the fact that if I respond on a Saturday at 2 pm or a Wednesday evening at 9 pm , that gives every reason for others to assume I work any and all hours of the day .
Again , I made the leap to avoid hectic work schedules , and I make every attempt to let others know that my availability comes without restriction during normal business hours but on a limited basis after hours .
6. Say ‘ no ’ as often as you say ‘ yes ’ .
I quoted Michael Porter in my ALA article and I ’ll do so again here : “ The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do . ”
Realize that every project you say ‘ yes ’ to inevitably locks up time that may or may not be better spent elsewhere in terms of project revenue , portfolio depth , and overall work satisfaction .
It ’s a game of opportunity cost , so be sure you ’re choosing those projects that maximize a ) the talent you offer clients and b ) what you take home at the end of the day .
7 . Make project expenses justify themselves .
Often a project requires expenses for “ raw ” materials ( e.g. stock photography ) or additional contractor assistance .
When these occasions arise , do your best to anticipate these expenses when bidding , and disclose them accordingly .
Should they arise halfway through a project , discuss them with the client to see if a bid addenda is warranted .
If not , evaluate the necessity of the expense , if it ca n’t be included aside from other allocated costs ( your time , taxes , etc. ) , consider alternatives .
Do n’t rob Peter ’s up - front payment on Project X to pay for Paul ’s raw materials on Project Y .
It ’s simply good business practice to force each expense to be paid for by the project it ’s tied to .
8. Beware the inevitable check delay .
Though I ’d been doing side work for over 5 years before making the leap , I do n’t know that I was as prepared as I could have been to deal with check delays .
Think about it :
You submit an invoice .
Your contact submits the invoice for payment .
The check is cut .
The check is mailed .
You deposit the check .
Your bank may or may not place a hold .
The cash is finally available .
Typical , right ?
Well , it ’s not so bad when it ’s side work , but when it ’s your sole income , you better prepare accordingly .
I ’ve had the invoice to cash - in - hand cycle take up to 60 days before , regardless of net 30 , late fees , or other terms I ’ve assessed .
Have enough cash in the bank to fill in gaps between cycles , or consider alternative payment methods ( e.g. PayPal ) .
9 . Be chummy with your point of contact .
Speaking of potential client point - of - contacts , if you do n’t a ) get along well with him or her and b ) think he or she is web savvy , you might avoid the project altogether .
I ca n’t stress how crucial a good point - of - contact is in determining the outcome of a project .
I ’ve been fortunate to have stellar contacts for the duration of my freelancing .
Be sure it ’s someone you can establish a good relationship with and someone you can confide in driving the project forward wisely and timely .
10 .
Do n’t leap without solid footing .
Some of you have sent emails in recent months , most of which began like this : “ I ’ve been thinking about going solo … ”
If I did n’t say it in my response to you , I ’ll say it here :
Do n’t make the leap until you ’ve got the necessary experience and exposure to make it all happen .
I said earlier that my leap was one of faith , and though it was , I was also quite confident the timing was right .
I had the necessary experience ( portfolio , client roll , variety of projects ) and exposure ( Google search , incoming links , readership ) to leave the ground with solid footing , as ironic as that sounds .
Had I made the leap a year earlier , I imagine I ’d be back at a day job by now .
So leap when you ’re confident you ’ll land smoothly .
Hope that helps some of you aspiring to full - time contract work .
Here ’s to another solid 6 months .

Via Lawyers , Guns , and Money , Chris Muir takes a stab at intellectual history :
and the next day :
Apparently , ' later ' in this last one used to read ' Locke ' , but someone clued Muir in to the fact that Locke was , in fact , Christian , and based his theory of property on our duties to God .
But that , of course , is n't the real howler , nor is the bizarre idea that this country was in any serious way " based on " Kant , let alone Schopenhauer , who was just one year old when the Constitution was adopted .
What actually makes my head explode is this :
Yeeeaaarghh !!!
The usual complaint about Kant is that he was too inflexible .
( He thought , for instance , that if a murderer comes to the door and asks where to find the person he wants to kill , it 's wrong to lie . )
To call him a nihilist , or a relativist , or someone who does n't believe in objective truth , is like -- well , one of LG& M 's analogies is " command economy Hayekianism " .
Since truth is one but error is infinite , there 's no shortage of further subjects for Chris Muir 's strips : Leninist anarchism , Kierkegaardian rationalism , Thomist atheism , Nazi Judaism , cautious and sober Maoism , Britney Spearsian profundity , Caligulan propriety and decency , Robespierrian restraint , Mozartian lugubriousness , and of course Muirian thoughtful , well - informed commentary .
Commenters at LG&M googled the phrase ' Kantian nihilism , and found that most of the pages using it had gotten it from Ayn Rand .
See , for instance , here :
" Among noted thinkers of the day , Ayn Rand alone stood firm against the tide of Kantian nihilism and in support of reason , individualism , and laissez - faire capitalism - the philosophic ideals that are the foundation of American achievement and progress .
Three decades later , despite a seemingly different sociopolitical climate , the intellectual essence of the " New Left " endures .
Its continued influence - manifested in such ideologies as environmentalism and multiculturalism - renders Rand 's observations and warnings as relevant , and as urgently needed , as when they were first written . "
And here :
" Another case in point was the behavior of the crowds at Woodstock ( I will admit that I liked the music and the movie ) which , she said , served as a definitive paradigm of Kantian Nihilism ; prevalent were wild sex orgies among strangers , drug overdoses , continual wallowings in mud and feces , riotous behavior resulting in varying levels of destruction to others ' property ( thus property rights ) , and the need for food and water by those who ended up starving and dehydrated because they did not plan ahead and consider potential troubles that could and would lie ahead , all of which , figuratively speaking , amassed one big festival of animals ready to be sacrificed to the gods of Nihilism . "
Because we all know how firmly Kant supported wild sex orgies , continual wallowings in mud and feces , and not needing food and water .

Website Flags
The web becomes more global every day , and country borders are blurred .
What we really need in this day and age , even more than country flags , are flags for websites .
Like ...
1. Googlonia
Googlonia ’s flag , in classical uncluttered white , contains four stars representing the Google cornerstones search , usability , relevance , and prosperous relations with the Chinese government .
2. Amazon
The flag of Amazon.com consists of three horizontal stripes and an orange arrow in the middle .
The color blue represents freedom ( to buy stuff ) , and the arrow represents late - 90s logo designs .
3. The World Wide Web Consortium Country
W3.org , makers of all web standards , created a highly accessible design on a beloved Netscape 3 gray background .
The flag is still a draft and comes with an audio version for the sight - impaired .
4. BulkMailSolutions.com
The Nigerian government rightfully protested when their flag design was stolen to represent all spam websites .
5 . The Republic of Techcrunch
TechCrunch.com ’s flag is the only known flag containing supercool Web 2.0 elements such as extra - large icons , bevels and smooth color shades .
6. The Yahoo Kingdom
No particular meaning is attached to the fresh , colorful design of one of the oldest and most honorable of all ’ net sites .
7. Adobe.com Country
Adobe “ we believe PDF does n’t always suck ”
Inc ’s flag was hailed as a design masterpiece .
It is forgotten by whom .
8. BoingBoingistan
The Creative Commons licensed flag of # 1 blog BoingBoing .
net contains three vertical stripes ( yellow , red , green ) and a silly icon ( white ) .
Unavailable : RIAA.com
The Recording Industry Association of America does n’t allow republications of their flag .
9 . The Land of IMDb.com
The infamous Internet Movie Database website has a beautiful flag reminding people of the good old times when Hollywood movies were still fresh , original and funny ( that is , before they added sound ) .
10 . Diggaria
Digg.com ’s superior flag harvests the smart mob , with every user independently controlling a small square of the overall design .

SUSPECTED BOMBERS ARRESTED
1 : Yassin Hassan Omar , 24 , wanted over bomb attempt on Tube near Warren Street .
2 : Ibrahim Muktar Said , 27 , suspected of attempting to bomb a No 26 bus in Shoreditch 3 : Ramzi Mohamed , wanted over failed attempt to bomb a Tube near Oval 4 .
Osman Hussain , wanted over the Shepherd 's Bush attack , and arrested in Rome
In pictures : London raids Italians arrest British suspect
Roads were sealed off in west London as dozens of police , many armed and some in gas masks , surrounded properties .
Two men held in north Kensington were filmed by a witness stripped to the waist after police raided a flat .
Another suspect for the failed Tube and bus bombings has been arrested in Rome .
The fourth suspect was detained in Birmingham on Wednesday .
Friday 's raids saw armed police surround flats at Peabody Buildings , in Dalgarno Gardens , north Kensington .
Bare - chested
One of those arrested there identified himself as Ibrahim Muktar Said , 27 , wanted for the attempt to bomb a number 26 bus in Shoreditch , east London , eight days ago .
A second man said his name was Ramzi Mohamed , suspected of the attempted Oval Tube bombing , police said .
Osman Hussain had been staying with his brother
Footage taken by a resident showed the suspects standing bare - chested on a balcony outside a flat .
They had been asked to surrender to police , but failed to do so , Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke , of the Metropolitan Police , said .
" Specialist tactics " were then used , he said .
Eyewitnesses had earlier talked of seeing officers wearing gas masks .
The suspect arrested in Rome , who was named as Somali - born UK citizen Hussain Osman , 27 , will be questioned over the bomb attempt at Shepherd 's Bush station .
He had been staying with his brother , who was also taken into custody , Italian officials said .
Also on Friday , UK police arrested a third man in Notting Hill , west London , and two women at the city 's Liverpool Street station .
The as yet unnamed man , arrested in Tavistock Crescent , is said by police to be of significant interest in relation to the events of 21 July .
The suspect detained last Wednesday in Birmingham was Yassin Hassan Omar , 24 , who is being questioned over a bomb attempt on the Tube near Warren Street .
' I 'm scared '
One man was arrested following the Notting Hill raid
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said police may have been able to make their arrests following tip - offs from the public or informants ; electronic interception ; or the questioning of people who were already in custody .
" I understand that the questioning of those people they have in custody was very productive , " he said .
Our correspondent added that following Friday 's arrests , the immediate priority for police was to establish if there were any further bomb plots .
Also , officers would want to know if there were any explosives lying around in warehouses and who these detainees knew .
Mr Clarke later confirmed to reporters that the Met would be seeking the return to Britain from Italy of Mr Osman .
However , it is not yet clear if he will face any charges in Italy .
Mr Clarke added that the public " must not be complacent " that the threat of attacks had disappeared in the wake of the arrests .
" The threat remains and is very real , " he said .
Detectives believe there may also have been a fifth would - be bomber on 21 July , after a device was found on Saturday in a rucksack at Little Wormwood Scrubs , near Friday 's operation .
Scotland Yard described Friday as their " best day yet " since 21 July .
Eyewitnesses to the raids in north Kensington say they heard three sounds like shots and a large explosion as officers wearing gas masks entered one of the properties .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We were all locked in the office and told not to go near the windows

A police source later said no shots had been fired and that explosions reported by witnesses were the sounds of officers blowing off the door to a flat on the Peabody Buildings estate .
In Dalgarno Gardens , officers were continually shouting at someone in a flat to come out .
They were addressing him as " Muhammad " , eyewitnesses said .
The police asked him : " What is the problem ?
Why can't you come out ?
" Take your clothes off .
Exit the building .
Do you understand ? "
One resident told BBC News 24 she was inside a block of flats on the estate at the time .
" They were shouting to him that he needed to come out with his arms up , in just his underwear .
' Almighty bang '
" He was saying to them : ' How do I know when I come out , that you 're not going to shoot me ?
I 'm scared ' . "
Police assured him he would not get shot as long as he followed instructions , she said , and that they knew he was not a risk to the officers or the public .
Officers told other residents on the 350 - property estate to " get inside now " .
Chris Stokes told BBC
News : " We got told to move out of the way by armed police and within about five minutes we heard three gunshots go off behind the block of flats at Tavistock Crescent . "
Allan Sneddon , who lives nearby , told BBC News : " There was this almighty bang ... big enough to shake the ground . "

Why Nintendo Gets It , or Why Sony Should Start Trying

And I thought they had logged out :
Know your roots
And that brings us to the present
The \ " next \ " generation
It blows my mind that Nintendo has so effectively proven that they \ " get\ " it .
How so ?
The Revolution controller .
What ?
Yeah , that magic wand thing probably is the future of gaming .
And furthermore , in the \ " next - gen\ " launch lineup it is starting to look like Nintendo is the only company that will deliver a truly next - gen gaming platform .
Compared to the Revolution , the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are simply expensive upgrades to existing platforms .
Nintendo \ " gets \ " it .
Microsoft and Sony don\'t understand that a new generation of gaming machine does not automatically beget a new generation of gaming .
A \" next\ " generation requires a significant change in gaming itself .
Gamers care about hardware and hardware generations only insofar as those generations mark major changes in the way games are made and played .
Gamers care about framerate only insofar as framerate is connected to the limit of a player \'s reflexes .
The interaction of technology and creative expression and experience is complex terrain , which often understood in a highly intuitive array of impulses on the part of gamers .
This intuitive understanding of the relationship between tech and game leads easily into fetishization of game hardware :
Witness the hip NES controller belt buckles sold in mall shops worldwide or the Xbox 360 faceplates .
All tech - dependent art forms fetishize the mechanical aspects of their practice : photography , computers , sports , music .
In each case one can see similar devotion to the objects and implements of the practice on the part of the practitioners .
Deep down , however , gamers are ambivalent about this coming generation of gaming hardware .
A part of that ambivalence , whether conscious or subconscious , is the feeling that games are not going to be significantly different .
Gamers are often after the next , newest , more engaging , more immersive experience .
But in order to sell this new hardware cycle to many gamers , Sony , Microsoft , and Nintendo need to think big .
Graphics are already pretty .
Sound is already awesome .
Online gameplay is already fairly optimized .
What \'s next ?
But to really understand where I \'m coming from and where I \'m going with this , let \'s take a brief trip back through major generational shifts that have come before in gaming history .
Let\ 's revisit some historical generational shifts :
If we assume the Odyssey ( 1972 ) and Pong ( 1975 ) were first generation , then we can cite the Atari 2600 \'s ( 1977 ) advancement of removable game media , which allowed the whole game publishing industry to be created apart from the hardware manufacturing industry .
The Atari 5200 ( 1982 ) is viewed as an upgrade , and although systems such as Colecovision ( 1982 ) and Intellivision ( 1980 ) came out during the heyday of Atari\ 's popularity , we generally speak of all of these systems as being in the same \ " generation\ " of gaming .
The next major evolution is the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES - 1985 ) .
Nintendo revived the American games industry ( currently the largest market in the world for games ) with a fresh take on game design accompanied by a major technical upgrade that facilitated better graphics .
Insofar as technical enhancements allow new kinds of game designs , they contribute to new generations of gaming .
This generation was also populated by the Sega Master System , which was the largest competition for Nintendo and lagged far behind .
In the first formal generational shift , the NES was followed by the SNES ( 1991 ) .
We gained four new buttons on the controller , and Sega followed suit adding more buttons to the Genesis ( 1989 ) controllers .
Games became better looking and smarter , and because we had so many more options for control , games as diverse as Actraiser and Mortal Kombat are possible and become popular .
This change brought a whole new level of physical and conceptual complexity to console gaming .
Role - playing games became much more complex and early 3D experiments are born .
There were many attempts to push a generational shift to the CD - era , including most notably the SegaCD ( 1992 ) and Panasonic\'s 3D0 ( 1993 ) .
But it was n\'t until Sony launched the PlayStation ( 1995 ) that the concept of CDs took off .
This led to game design developments that have shaped much of the current gaming landscape : Cutscenes became more beautiful and cinematic , appreciated as works of art in their own right .
The ability to include a lot of dialogue and video led to the general movement of \ " games as cinematic experience \ " design .
The early addition of an analog joystick to the controller was first seen in the Nintendo 64 controller , and gamers were especially sold on it after Mario 64 demonstrated a 3D approach to platform gaming .
But it was Sony\'s Dual Shock controller that made dual analog joysticks and force - feedback a standard feature of console controllers .
Games continued to become more complex and textured , and the number of gamers continued to grow .
In this generation the Nintendo 64 ( 1996 ) stayed with their cartridge - based format , which , in the end , cost them the number one spot in the gaming industry .
Cartridges just did n\'t have as many advantages as CDs ?
the ability to store so much data had become crucial to game design and development , and gamers quickly grew to love these new qualities of games .
The current generation is marked by the release of the Microsoft Xbox ( 2001 ) , Sony\'s PlayStation 2 ( 2000 ) and Nintendo\ 's GameCube ( 2001 ) , which are all disc - based systems .
Online play was a mantra for Microsoft and Sony , both of whom managed to make that pay off to a greater extent than ever before .
However , at the same time , gamers did n\'t flock to online play the way they flocked to Final Fantasy VII ( often cited as a crucial title in the rise of gamer\ 's expectations of graphical and cinematic quality ) .
All of the platforms have benefited from another increase in technical power , allowing more enemies , more complex AI and game behaviors , and , most visibly , better graphics .
The graphical fidelity achieved in the current generation of 3D modeling and animation has eliminated much of the need for artificial game design mechanisms ( such as the ubiquitous sparkle as illustrated in games such as Resident Evil ) ?
now the game graphics are so clear we can just see the game - world objects we might be interested in .
Nintendo\ 's rejection of the online arena has just added to their image as an eccentric tinkerer who makes toys of the highest quality .
The problem is they are n\'t very fast , and sometimes they are just plain weird .
The idea of connectivity and connecting the Game Boy Advance to the GameCube never really caught on .
And the only bright spots in Nintendo\ 's last few years have been some standout first - party titles for GameCube and their handheld gaming hardware , which continues to dominate the handheld side of the industry .
The current generation of game hardware has largely been a letdown .
There have been some amazing games created , but the vast majority of games still doggedly pursue the cinematic approach to game design and confusing pervasive gaming with game - themed marketing .
Every time Microsoft wants to sell us anything it creates a game .
And it \'s painfully ironic that the genre of alt - reality games ( often lauded as a critical darling and game design breakthrough ) has mainly been used to sell us more games and game hardware .
Online gameplay has failed to really take off .
Sony\'s online games have been plagued with various cheats and hacks , and the network adapter has not sold through to as many PS2 owners as the company would have liked .
Microsoft is in a similar position , fully acknowledging that the vast majority of Xbox owners have never logged into Xbox Live , in spite of critical raves about the quality of service .
In part , game design has not really figured out the parameters of online console gaming , and in part online plans have been too focused on providing a few extra maps or skins as enticement to keep playing .
Heck , not much has happened in the way of unique online gaming ideas since Doom .
Rather than pursue an innovative game design model , game publishers have followed an expansion and enhancement model of business which has generally been a warm - up to full - fledged console - based e-commerce in the coming generation .
The problem is that online shopping has very little to do with the evolution of game design .
Combine all of this with an incredibly conservative atmosphere in the mainstream gaming industry , and we can easily understand why the industry is like it is these days .
Most games that come out are sequels to proven game design concepts .
A majority of games are based on franchises native to other media formats ?
movies , comic books , cartoons , celebrities , TV shows .
With over $ 7.3 Billion at stake , the industry is loathe to take risks .
And with a firm grip on a target demographic most industries pay through the nose to access , game publishers have little reason to try to expand their audience .
It \'s a classic example of the economics and rationale of the industry working against itself , just as we\'ve seen in the music and film industries and their struggles to deal with online distribution and marketing .
Regardless of Nintendo\ 's lagging position in the current home console race , in the next - generation of home consoles it looks more and more with every announcement like Nintendo is poised to regain a much more competitive role in the industry .
Of course , the biggest hurdle Nintendo has to get over is the ballyhoo hurdle .
In many ways games can learn from the history of other media forms , and the showmanship ( aka balyhoo ) of 1950s cinema provides an example of how gimmicks might entice audiences for a short time , but ultimately cannot become longstanding conventions of the form .
Think of 3D movies , Cinerama , or Smell - O - Vision .
A classic example is ( 1959 , dir .
William Castle ) which used buzzers inserted into the seats of theaters to add a \ " shocking \ " real - world special effect to the movie .
This , of course , did n\'t catch on to become a staple of the cinematic experience .
But sometimes innovation happens .
The whole reason behind 1950s cinema ballyhoo was a drive to make the theater experience different from TV .
Experiments like Cinerama ( an extreme multi-channel projection that gave a \ " surround - view\ " effect ) eventually evolved into what we consider \ " widescreen\ " or the theatrical aspect ratio .
It can be argued that the widescreen format is more immersive , that it better emulates our natural field of vision .
Less charitable analysis might conclude that it was simply one of the ballyhoo techniques that was easiest to accommodate in production and distribution of films ( it \ 's much easier than wiring theaters with seat buzzers ) .
And it seems clear that part of the reason widescreen format has caught on for television and videogames has a lot to do with the small screen\ 's gradual mutation into a very private large screen , and an aspiration of television and games to be as \ " good\ " as movies .
So in this case , we can see things coming full - circle into the birth of a well - defined convention : the aspect ratio of the future is 16:9 , no longer 4:3 .
But I digress .
Nintendo needs only to make their system do all the work of translating stock gaming commands from the other systems in order to make multiplatform releases painless to port to Revolution , and then they must provide developers with an easy kit to take advantage of the more complicated interactive potential offered by the Revolution .
As we\ 've seen with the NES , SNES and PlayStation One , a new controller design is definitely a viable avenue for game hardware innovation .
It is no mistake that every controller on the past five home consoles manufactured in the 10 years since Sony launched the Dual Shock controller has featured two analog joysticks and rumble features .
Microsoft has never been an innovator in the area of games .
They have been a standardizer and an optimizer , and in such a role they have helped create a clear set of conventions in the industry , mainly imitating the best qualities of all their rivals and adding to it their expertise in home computing .
The Xbox is more versatile , more powerful , and by all accounts is one of the easiest platforms to develop for .
Plus , it has the added benefit of easily porting to Windows and various Windows - derivative platforms .
Windows is THE gaming platform for PCs .
We often forget that in many ways Microsoft has already won in another games - industry war for domination .
Granted , games have been developed for Xbox that are brilliant , but even a look at the flagship franchise for Xbox , Halo , reveals the quintessential lack of innovation inherent in the vast majority of Xbox titles .
That lack of innovation stems from the hardware itself .
Halo is a game about saving Earth from impending destruction .
Who wants to destroy Earth ?
Some aliens .
At its best , Halo is a wonderful reprise of very old science fiction plots , much likeis a wonderful reprise of very old adventure plots .
At its worst , Halo is a much prettier version of Space Invaders : shoot , shoot , dodge .
What Halo offers is not any innovation in game design ;
Halo is just extremely well - made .
If it innovates , it innovates in how well it integrates with the rest of your life :
You can track games and stats online , create whole websites dedicated to clans using Bungie .
net \'s free tools , and have game stats and invites messaged directly to your cell phone or MSN - aware smart device .
Halo has loads of options for multiplayer and has received plenty of post - release attention in the form of both free and pay - for - download map packs and game expansions .
All of these are enhancements of longstanding game design models .
In all reality , this is what Microsoft promised , and this is what it has delivered : Easy for developers to make games for .
And if a developer has a good idea , it can work well on the Xbox ?
it \'s easier to make , quicker to get out , looks great .
The hard drive in the Xbox has not facilitated great advances in game design as was initially hoped ?
it \'s been used to speed up load times and offer more post - release enhancements .
As I mark it , those features fall squarely on the optimization end of the spectrum .
The Xbox 360 does not look to deviate from this :
Everything that is already on the Xbox will return in a better form , and we can look forward to at least one more new device : the Xbox 360 camera .
But not much is known about this , and the game press assumes this device will be used for Eye Toy - like game control .
Again , not an original innovation , although a welcome addition which Xbox 360 will hopefully make great use of .
Microsoft is looking strong to maintain its second - place position in the industry .
With luck , that share will grow somewhat .
Gamers can appreciate optimization and convenience , and are always very discerning about overall quality .
Xbox has always delivered on this ( for the most part ) .
No , the company that needs to be looking over its shoulder is , obviously , Sony .
It \'s lonely sitting on such a big , giant peak , and there \'s only one way to go from there .
With two big competitors coming out swinging , Sony needs something more than a boomerang controller redesign .
Thankfully , the company has recently announced that the PlayStation 3 controller will likely change before release .
Will it become a motion - sensing pointer / wand ?
That seems unlikely .
But the PS3 will need something more than online shopping integration to pull this one out .
Many gamers have stuck with PlayStation because of the wide variety of niche titles available :
The bigger selection of quirky games has helped Sony stay on top .
But if those game developers start working more with Nintendo , and if Microsoft delivers the better \ " traditional \ " gaming experience , the market could make a major shift .
The PlayStation platform does enjoy the benefit of having led to two major game controller innovations already : The Dual - Shock analog controller and the Eye Toy .
Both of these were after - market add - ons to existing systems ( the Dual - Shock for PS1 and Eye Toy for PS2 ) .
Future plans have been announced to add a \ " wand\ " to the Eye Toy control scheme in order to compensate for the issues caused by varying room quality .
And I should admit up front that I \'m stepping out somewhat to call the Eye Toy a true gaming innovation .
My reasoning goes like this : Cameras and machine vision are unavoidable future components of any computing system , so even if Eye Toy never comes out with a truly perfected version , the idea of this technology is here to stay .
It is increasingly looking like Nintendo might just be next year \'s Sony and next year \'s Sony might look a lot like this year \'s Nintendo .
Or perhaps Sony can pull out something to surprise us all .
This is definitely a two - console market at this time .
Most gaming households will own at least two gaming consoles .
There is a better chance they will upgrade to the next generation of the system they currently own , so Sony has a great advantage there .
And in the end , economics may dictate user\ 's decisions more than anything else , which would play a role in people \'s decisions about which next generation console to buy .
And a modestly priced Revolution , with retro games to appeal to parents and an approachable controller to appeal to non-gamers , could do well is such economic climates .
To further complicate predictions either Microsoft or Sony could decide to create an after - market peripheral that adds the same functionality as the Revolution controller .
We also have n\'t really seen much of Sony\'s PlayStation 3 , so we can \'t be completely confident in our analysis of its hardware .
But it \'s clear that Sony is really the only company that has anything to lose in the coming console war .
And its clear that Nintendo is not simply rolling over in submission as so many have predicted they would .
We won\'t know for sure about the Revolution or its revolutionary controller until we get it in our hands .
The tightness ?
the \ " goodness\ " ? of the control will undoubtedly be the deciding factor in the success or failure of Nintendo\ 's grand experiment .
Anything less than 100 % reliability and impeccable responsiveness will be unacceptable to gamers .
But it \'s good to see that one of the big three are finally thinking big about gaming .
It \'s high time somebody put the games ahead of the marketing tie-ins .
If your idea of gaming enhancements is supporting high - end movie discs or touting your online shopping site , then you need to get new people to think about gaming for you .
Yeah , I \'m looking at you Microsoft and Sony ?
the gauntlet is down .
What do you got for us now ?
“ THE Google brand has taken on a life of its own , ” concedes Jim Lanzone , the boss of Ask.com , the fourth - largest but fastest - growing search engine , and this simultaneously frustrates and delights him .
It frustrates him because people say they “ google ” things even when they go to Ask or other engines to search the web ; because Google is considered , for no good reason ( in his opinion ) , “ the safe choice under pressure ” ; and because many people “ do n't seem to want choice ” and stick to Google out of mere inertia .
But it delights him , because Google , having made many enemies , must now fight many battles ; and because Google , perhaps out of hubris , appears to be getting distracted .
This month , for instance , Google unveiled a free online spreadsheet program , which , like many Google products , has little to do with web search and is meant to needle Microsoft , the world 's largest software company , which has a near - monopoly on spreadsheets through Excel .
Google , in other words , has impressive momentum , says Mr Lanzone , but a good martial - artist can use his opponent 's momentum to overcome him , so “ we 're using search aikido . ”
In terms of momentum — mass times velocity — Google 's lead indeed looks daunting .
It has by far the most mass , with an American market share of 43 % as of April , which reaches 50 % counting AOL , an internet property that uses Google 's search technology .
This compares with 28 % for Yahoo ! ; 13 % for MSN , which belongs to Microsoft ; and 6 % for Ask , which is owned by IAC / Interactive Corp , a conglomerate of about 60 online media brands .
Google also has velocity : its market share grew by 17 % in the four quarters to this spring , whereas Yahoo ! and MSN both lost share .
Only
Ask has more velocity — its share grew by 35 % — but then again it has little mass .
There are also other , even smaller search engines , such as Clusty.com , a service that displays results in thematic bundles , and SNAP.com , an engine founded by Bill Gross , a pioneer in the industry .
But because barriers to entry in the search business are high — the engineering talent is limited and data centres that can simultaneously support millions of searches are expensive — most analysts think that the four big search engines will stay ahead of the tiny ones .
The industry is young and switching - costs for users are low ( a click , in effect ) , so there is still the potential for a change in leadership among these four .
The contest is fierce , because search results , which display highly targeted advertisements , are the most lucrative pages on the internet .
Comparing the quality — that is , the relevance — of search results is highly subjective , but for the past six years or so Google has probably proved the best at the job .
The stroke of genius of its two founders , Sergey Brin and Larry Page , was the PageRank algorithm , which treated the links to web pages as votes conferring authority , just as the best academic papers tend to get the most citations in other research .
Google 's problem today , says Chris Sherman , the executive editor of SearchEngineWatch , an online industry newsletter , is that “ they regard themselves as the best , and yet they do n't really seem to have a clear strategy , ” which seems to make them dabble aimlessly .
Yahoo ! , the largest internet portal with about 400 m users ( of its e-mail , instant - messaging , music and other products ) , has spotted this weakness and come up with a strategy to differentiate its own search engine .
Yahoo !
has been at this game for only two years — it used to use Google for its search technology , until it realised that this was the most profitable part of the business — but now has hundreds of engineers working on it .
In contrast to the quasi-religious faith that Google places in its mathematical algorithms , says Eckart Walther , one of Yahoo ! 's search bosses , Yahoo ! is “ about combining the best of people with the best of technology ” .
The idea , Mr Walther says , is to “ look not only at links between websites but also links between people ” and thus to use “ social search ” to solve “ subjective ” queries .
Caterina Fake , who came to Yahoo !
as the co-founder of FlickR , a popular photo - sharing site it bought last year , gives the example of her own search for a lamp shade .
A Google search returned lots of lamp stores , but all in generic styles .
A search on Yahoo !'s “ MyWeb ” , by contrast , took into account the eclectic tastes of her friends and came up with the more fashionable , unconventional lamp shade that she was after .
This approach has potential , but also limits .
The user has to be known to Yahoo ! ( ie , logged in ) and the results are best when users do a lot of work — by , for instance , “ tagging ” things they see on the web with descriptions ( “ cool lamp shade ” ) so that online friends can benefit from these trails of “ metadata ” .
But most people do n't want surfing the web to feel like work , so the metadata is limited .
To Mr Lanzone at Ask , the Yahoo ! approach sounds like “ a long walk for a short beer . ”
So Ask — which used to be called Ask Jeeves but dropped Jeeves , a knowing butler , from its logo in February — is taking a different tack .
It has come up with ExpertRank , an algorithm that also ranks web pages by incoming links , but is different from Google 's PageRank in that it first groups , or “ clusters ” , pages and links by theme .
So instead of using a web page 's overall popularity to calculate its ranking , it finds the pages that are most popular among experts on a particular subject , a method that often returns better results than Google's .
Ask also uses these thematic clusters to suggest the best ways to narrow or expand a search , a feature called “ zoom ” that is very popular .
Chris Sherman of SearchEngineWatch thinks that Ask is as good as Google for general web search — but better than Google for finding online maps and images .
Ask , he thinks , is therefore starting to resemble Apple in the computer industry , which has a small but dedicated following of fans who consider the Macintosh operating system superior to the dominant Windows system by Microsoft ( a comparison that is sure to make Messrs Brin and Page at Google cringe ) .
As for Microsoft , it has identified Google as a mortal threat to its business and has launched an all - out effort to catch up in online services in general , and in search in particular .
Last winter , it tried to buy itself market share by negotiating with AOL for a merger — or at least an agreement under which AOL would switch from Google 's search technology to MSN's ; but Google pre-empted Microsoft and itself took a defensive stake in AOL .
Microsoft has also hired former rivals who are well respected in the industry , such as Ray Ozzie , an innovator best known for inventing Lotus Notes , a collaboration programme , and Steve Berkowitz , Mr Lanzone 's predecessor at Ask , who now oversees the MSN portal .
Mr Sherman at SearchEngineWatch says the quality of search results on MSN so far “ seems to be all over the map ” .
But , as he points out , Microsoft has a history of coming late to a market with a mediocre copy - cat product that gradually gets better until it prevails .
The search - engine battle is not over yet .
After seeing a recent in - house promotional brochure , I ’d like to issue a brief request on behalf of my fellow researchers .
This is addressed to all professional photographers : please , no more colored spotlights .
I know that you see this as a deficiency , but scientists do not work with purple radiance coming from the walls behind them .
Not if we can help it , we do n’t , and if we notice that sort of thing going on , we head for the exits .
In the same manner , our instruments do not , regrettably , emit orange glows that light our faces up from beneath , not for the most part , and if they start doing that we generally do n’t bend closer so as to emphasize the thoughtful contours of our faces .
When we hold up Erlenmeyer flasks to eye level to see the future of research in them , which we try not to do too often because we usually do n’t want to know , rarely is this accompanied by an eerie red light coming from the general direction of our pockets .
It ’s a bad sign when that happens , actually .
I know that your photos have lots more zing and pop the way you do them .
And I ’m sorry , for you and for the art department , that our labs are all well lit ( with boring old fluorescent lights , yet ) , and that we all wear plain white lab coats ( which tend to take over the picture ) , and that our instrument housings are mostly beige and blue and white .
It would be a lot easier on you guys if these things were n’t so .
But that ’s how it is .
And when you get right down to it , you ’re actually doing us a disservice by trying to pretend that there ’s all sorts of dramatic stuff going on , that discoveries are happening every single minute of the day and that they ’re accompanied by dawn - of - a - new - era lighting and sound effects .
We ’d rather that people did n’t get those ideas , because the really big discoveries are n’t like that at all .
It does n’t make for much of a cover shot , but if one of us ever does manage to change the world , it ’ll start with a puzzled glance at a computer screen , or a raised eyebrow while looking at a piece of paper .
Instead of getting noisier , everything will get a lot quieter .
And if there are any purple spotlights to be seen , we wo n’t even notice them .

The latest SBCL handles slot : initform and : type options in a new way .
It ’s mentioned in the release notes .
minor incompatible change : the compiler signals a warning at compile - time when an initform of T , NIL or 0 does not match a STANDARD - CLASS slot ’s declared type . _
Sounds pretty benign , but it breaks dozens of projects in Quicklisp .
( To be fair , most of the failures are caused by a small number of core systems on which many other systems depend . )
Here ’s an example of the new behavior : ( defclass foo ( ) ( ( name : type string : initform nil ) ) )
With the above defclass form , SBCL 2.0.9 will signal a warning at compile time : ; processing ( DEFCLASS FOO ... ) ; file : foo.lisp ; in : DEFCLASS FOO ; ( NAME : TYPE STRING : INITFORM NIL ) ; ==> ; ( SB -KERNEL : THE * ( STRING : SOURCE -FORM NIL :USE - ANNOTATIONS T ) NIL ) ; ; caught WARNING : ; Constant NIL conflicts with its asserted type STRING .
;
See also : ; The SBCL Manual , Node " Handling of Types " ; ; compilation unit finished ; caught 1 WARNING condition
This compile - time warning means “ failure ” as far as loading with ASDF is concerned .
If you have both : type and : initform in your slot definitions , and you want to be compatible with the latest SBCL , make sure the initform type matches the slot type .
If you want to use NIL as the initform , one easy option is to set the type to ( or null < actual type > ) .

This library provides a Common Lisp kernel for Jupyter .
Jupyter is a scientific environment for experiments .
It is good when you want to play with data , to plot graphics and provides some comments in markdown .
Jupyter saves your programming session along with results in one file allowing to share your results with other programmers or analytics .
Maybe you did n't know , but GitHub is able to render such notebooks .
Here I found a large list of interesting notebooks .
Take a look at this one , for example : https://github.com/mqlaql/geospatial-data/blob/master/Geospatial-Data-with-Python.ipynb
Now , let 's return to the Common Lisp .
Jupyter is using a protocol allowing to write backends in different programming languages .
They are called " kernels " .
Here is how we can install Common Lisp Jupyter kernel on OSX .
I 'm using Homebrew and Roswell because they are making everything so easy !
[ poftheday ] brew install zeromq [ poftheday ] brew install jupyterlab [ poftheday ] ros install common - lisp - jupyter Now we can start a notebook in console mode : [ poftheday ] jupyter console -- kernel=common - lisp Jupyter console 6.2.0 common- lisp - jupyter : a Common Lisp Jupyter kernel ( C ) 2019 Tarn Burton ( MIT ) In [ 1 ] : ( lisp - implementation - type ) Out [ 1 ] : " SBCL " In [ 2 ] : ( lisp- implementation - version ) Out [ 2 ] : " 2.0.8 " In [ 3 ] : ( values 1 2 3 ) Out [ 3 ] : 1 Out [ 3 ] : 2 Out [ 3 ] : 3 In [ 4 ] : ( jupyter : file " / Users/art/Desktop/ Screenshot 2020-09-25 at 23.50.02.png " ) Out [ 4 ] : / Users/art/Desktop/Screenshot 2020-09-25 at 23.50.02.png
And this command will start a webserver with full Jupyter Notebook : # To start a web UI , run [ poftheday ] jupyter notebook
When the browser will open Jupyter , choose this menu to start Common Lisp Jupyter kernel :
Now if you enter the same code as we did before in console , you 'll see , that web version is able to render our " screenshot " file below the " code cell " :
It is also very easy to render formulas and to request an input from the user :
Also , you can render any HTML along with styles :
Or you might define functions which will return HTML or files :
This way , libraries extending common - lisp - jupyter may be created .
They can do plotting for example , or render graphs , etc .
Here how you can make you own classes renderable by Jupyter :
Though , it would be nice to make it possible to define render method for object not inherited from the jupyter : result .
The developer of this library did a very good job documenting it and providing examples .
You will find all of them here .
This project is in active development phase .
For example , right now support for Jupyter widgets is added .
Please , join this effort and make your pull requests to this repository , if you are interested in building CL environment for data science !

This is a tiny library by Fernando Borretti .
It implements analogue of the UNIX utility which : POFTHEDAY > ( which : which " which " ) # P " /usr/bin/ which " POFTHEDAY > ( which : which " sbcl " ) # P " / Users/art/.bin/sbcl " POFTHEDAY > ( which : which " python3 " ) # P " /usr/bin/python3 " POFTHEDAY > ( which : which " missing - binary " ) NIL
That is it .
No more , no less .
What do you think , when this library can be useful ?
By the way , there are many other trivial ( but useful ) libraries .
All of them are marked with a trivial tag on #pofthedday site .

Today I found that : read - timeout option of the Dexador does not work as expected and remembered about this small but useful library .
It provides the only one macro which executes code and limits it 's execution to a given number of seconds .
For illustration , I 'll use https://httpbin.org
This is a service which helps you to test HTTP libraries .
If you did n't hear about it , I recommend to look at .
Let 's retrieve an URL , which responds in 10 seconds .
Even with : read - timeout option , dexador waits 10 seconds : POFTHEDAY > ( time ( nth-value 1 ( dex : get " https://httpbin.org/delay/10 " : read- timeout 2 ) ) )
Evaluation took : 10.692 seconds of real time 200
If the site is not responding , a request may hang and block your application .
Here is where trivial - timeout comes to the rescue !
POFTHEDAY > ( trivial - timeout : with - timeout ( 2 ) ( time ( nth-value 1 ( dex : get " https://httpbin.org/delay/10 " ) ) ) )
Evaluation took : 2.003 seconds of real time before it was aborted by a non-local transfer of control .
; Debugger entered on #<COM .
METABANG .TRIVIAL-TIMEOUT:TIMEOUT-ERROR
{ 10055B5373} >
Internally , this library generates the implementation - specific code to interrupt the code execution .
Here how our example will look like for SBCL : ( let ( ( seconds 2 ) ) ( flet ( ( doti ( ) ( progn ( time ( nth-value 1 ( dexador : get " https://httpbin.org/delay/10 " ) ) ) ) ) ) ( cond ( seconds ( handler - case ( sb - ext : with - timeout seconds ( doti ) ) ( sb-ext : timeout ( com.metabang.trivial -timeout : :c ) ( declare ( ignore com.metabang.trivial-timeout : : c ) ) ( error ' com.metabang.trivial-timeout:timeout-error ) ) ) ) ( t ( doti ) ) ) ) )
And this is the same code , expanded on ClozureCL : ( let ( ( seconds 2 ) ) ( flet ( ( doit nil ( progn ( time ( nth-value 1 ( dexador : get " https://httpbin.org/delay/10 " ) ) ) ) ) ) ( cond ( seconds ( let* ( ( semaphore ( ccl:make - semaphore ) ) ( result ) ( process ( ccl: process - run - function " Timed Process process " ( lambda nil ( setf result ( multiple - value - list ( doit ) ) ) ( ccl:signal - semaphore semaphore ) ) ) ) ) ( cond ( ( ccl:timed - wait - on - semaphore semaphore seconds ) ( values - list result ) ) ( t ( ccl:process - kill process ) ( error ' com.metabang.trivial-timeout:timeout-error ) ) ) ) ) ( t ( doit ) ) ) ) )
Do n't know if such running the code in the separate thread can have some side - effects .
At least , library 's README says that it might be dangerous :) ) )

This is a simple library which allows to define global variables and save / restore their state to some persistent storage .
For example , we can define variables for database host and password : ;;
In real application you should define these ;; variables in the lisp file : POFTHEDAY > ( persistent - variables : defpvar * password * ) POFTHEDAY > ( persistent - variables : defpvar * db-host * ) ;;
Then in the REPL you can setup the app POFTHEDAY > ( setf * password * " Some $ ecret " ) POFTHEDAY > ( setf * db- host * " some-host.internal-to.my-company.com " ) ;;
And save it 's state : POFTHEDAY > ( with - open - file ( stream " /tmp/app.config " :if-does-not- exist : create :if-exists : supersede : direction :output ) ( persistent - variables : pv- save stream ) ) ;;
At startup your app might restore values for these variables : POFTHEDAY > ( with - open - file ( stream " /tmp/app.config " : direction : input ) ( persistent - variables : pv- load stream ) )
What this system does - it saves all symbols , defined with defpvar into the hash - table .
And pv-save / pv-load serializes and deserializes them as sexps : POFTHEDAY > ( rutils : print - ht persistent - variables : :* persisted * )
#{ :DEFAULT '( * DB - HOST * * PASSWORD *) } POFTHEDAY > ( with - output - to - string ( s ) ( persistent - variables : pv- save s ) ) " ( \" POFTHEDAY \ " \ " * DB - HOST *\ " \ " \\ \" some-host.internal-to.my-company.com\\\ " \ " )
( \" POFTHEDAY \ " \ " * PASSWORD *\ " \ " \\ \" Some $ ecret\\\ " \ " ) "
This library can be useful for interactive applications where user can change the settings and they should be restored on restart .
You probably also be interested in ubiquitous library which I did n't review yet .

Dawn of the second day .
According to the internet , the thing I intend to build is called a Roguelikelike , teetering on the very edge of being a Roguelike .
So it goes ; we 'll see if I end up taking the title or not .
Last time , we laid out the basics of prisoner s , their interactions and their strategies .
This time , lets get some different scenarios and some player interaction going .
Scenarios Payoff matrices involve deciding who gets what bonus or penalty as a result of an interaction .
Given a pair of defect / cooperate choices , a payoff - matrix will return the scores to be delivered to each player in turn .
( defun payoff - matrix ( cc - a cc- b cd - a cd- b dc - a dc - b dd - a dd - b ) ( let ( ( tbl {( cons : cooperate : cooperate ) ( list cc - a cc - b ) ( cons : defect : cooperate ) ( list dc - a dc - b ) ( cons : cooperate : defect ) ( list cd - a cd - b ) ( cons : defect : defect ) ( list dd - a dd - b ) } ) ) ( lambda ( a b ) ( lookup tbl ( cons a b ) ) ) ) )
Now we can define some basic scenarios .
A dilemma is the name I 'll pick for the situation where co-operating is better for the group , and both defecting is the worst thing for everyone , but a single defector will end out better off by defecting .
( defparameter dilemma ( payoff - matrix 3 3 1 5 5 1 0 0 ) ) A stag - hunt is a situation where a pair of players can pool their resources for a greater prize , and ignore each other for the lesser .
If either player attempts to hunt the stag alone , they get nothing , while their defecting partner still gets a rabbit .
( defparameter stag - hunt ( payoff - matrix 3 3 0 1 1 0 1 1 ) ) A trade is one in which both parties benefit , but to which both parties must agree .
( defparameter trade ( payoff - matrix 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 ) )
A theft is one where a player takes from the other .
But if both players cooperate , or both try to rob each other , they come to an impasse .
( defparameter theft ( payoff - matrix 0 0 - 3 3 3 - 3 0 0 ) )
A trap is a situation where cooperating leads to disaster , ignoring the situation leads to no gain , and defect ing to make it clear to your partner that you do n't intend to follow ends up benefiting both players .
( defparameter trap ( payoff - matrix - 3 - 3 2 2 2 2 0 0 ) )
The last scenario I 'll concern myself with is the mutual - prediction .
Where guessing what your partner / opponent will choose benefits you , and failing to do so does nothing .
( defparameter mutual - prediction ( payoff - matrix 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 ) ) Adventure
In order to move through the world , our prisoner s need a world to move through .
Let us begin at the ending .
( defparameter ending {:description " You have come to the end of your long , perilous journey . " } )
There is nothing to do at the end other than display this fact .
( defun repl ! ( adventure ) ( format t " ~ %~%~a~ %~ % " ( lookup adventure : description ) ) ) THE - PRISONERS > ( repl ! ending )
You have come to the end of your long , perilous journey .
NIL THE - PRISONERS >
But what led us here was a choice .
An adventure is more than a description , it 's also the options , a prisoner , the scenario , and a way to continue the action .
continue ing means making a choice and effectively playing the opposing / cooperating prisoner and abiding by the results .
( defun mk - adventure ( ) ( let ( ( prisoner ( polo ) ) ) {:description " A stranger approaches .
\ " I see you have baubles .
Would you like to trade , that we both may enrich ourselves ? \ " " : cooperate " accept " : defect " refuse " : prisoner prisoner : scenario trade : continue ( lambda ( choice ) ( let ( ( their - choice ( play prisoner ) ) ) ( update ! prisoner choice ) ( funcall trade choice their - choice ) ending ) ) } ) )
This sort of adventure also takes a bit more machinery to run from the repl .
We need to present the description , but also get an appropriate choice from the user .
Getting that choice is a bit more complicated than you might think at first .
( defun get - by - prefix ( lst prefix ) ( let ( (l ( length prefix ) ) ) ( loop for elem in lst when ( and ( >= ( length elem ) l ) ( == ( subseq elem 0 l ) prefix ) ) do ( return elem ) ) ) ) ( defun get - repl - choice ( adventure ) ( let* ( ( responses ( mapcar #'string - downcase ( list ( lookup adventure : cooperate ) ( lookup adventure : defect ) ) ) ) ( r- map {( string - downcase ( lookup adventure : cooperate ) ) : cooperate ( string - downcase ( lookup adventure : defect ) ) : defect} ) ( by - pref nil ) ( resp " " ) ) ( loop until ( and ( symbolp resp ) ( setf by - pref ( get - by - prefix responses ( string - downcase ( symbol - name resp ) ) ) ) ) do ( format t " ~a/~a : " ( lookup adventure : cooperate ) ( lookup adventure : defect ) ) do ( setf resp ( read ) ) ) ( lookup r-map by - pref ) ) )
Well behaved players are easy to deal with , true ...
THE - PRISONERS > ( get - repl - choice ( mk- adventure ) ) Accept / Refuse:acc : COOPERATE T THE - PRISONERS > ( get - repl - choice ( mk- adventure ) ) Accept / Refuse : ref : DEFECT T THE - PRISONERS > ( get - repl - choice ( mk- adventure ) ) Accept / Refuse : a :COOPERATE T ... but we want to be a bit more general than that .
THE - PRISONERS > ( get - repl - choice ( mk- adventure ) ) Accept / Refuse : fuck you Accept / Refuse : Accept / Refuse : boo Accept / Refuse : ( error ' error ) Accept / Refuse : ( quit ) Accept / Refuse : r :DEFECT T THE - PRISONERS >
That 's the only hard par though .
Interacting with the game once we 're sure we have valid input from our player is relatively simple .
( defun repl ! ( adventure ) ( format t " ~ %~%~a~ %~ % " ( lookup adventure : description ) ) ( when ( contains ? adventure : continue ) ( let ( ( choice ( get- repl - choice adventure ) ) ) ( repl ! ( funcall ( lookup adventure : continue ) choice ) ) ) ) ) THE - PRISONERS > ( repl ! ( mk- adventure ) ) A stranger approaches .
" I see you have baubles .
Would you like to trade , that we both may enrich ourselves ? "
Accept / Refuse:acc
You have come to the end of your long , perilous journey .
NIL THE - PRISONERS >
This is obviously not the perilous journey being spoken of .
At least , not all of it .
The simplest way to extend it into one is to wrap scenario s around our existing adventure .
( defun mk - adventure ( ) ( let ( ( def ( defector ) ) ) {:description " A muscled street thug approachs , knife drawn . " : cooperate " surrender " : defect " run " : prisoner def : scenario theft : continue ( lambda ( choice ) ( let ( ( their - choice ( play def ) ) ) ( update ! def choice ) ( funcall theft choice their - choice ) ) ( let ( ( prisoner ( polo ) ) ) {:description " A stranger approaches .
\ " I see you have baubles .
Would you like to trade , that we both may enrich ourselves ? \ " " : cooperate " accept " : defect " refuse " : prisoner prisoner : scenario trade : continue ( lambda ( choice ) ( let ( ( their - choice ( play prisoner ) ) ) ( update ! prisoner choice ) ( funcall trade choice their - choice ) ending ) ) } ) ) } ) )
THE - PRISONERS > ( repl ! ( mk- adventure ) )
A muscled street thug approachs , knife drawn .
Surrender / Run:run
A stranger approaches .
" I see you have baubles .
Would you like to trade , that we both may enrich ourselves ? "
Accept / Refuse:acc
You have come to the end of your long , perilous journey .
NIL THE - PRISONERS >
Of course , since we want it to be much longer and more perilous , we 'll want that process automated to at least some degree .
( defun wrap - scenario ( adventure scenario ) ( insert scenario ( cons : continue ( lambda ( choice ) ( let* ( ( them ( lookup scenario : prisoner ) ) ( their - choice ( play them ) ) ) ( update ! them choice ) ( funcall ( lookup scenario : scenario ) choice their - choice ) adventure ) ) ) ) ) ( defun mk - adventure ( ) ( wrap - scenario ( wrap - scenario ending {:description " A stranger approaches .
\ " I see you have baubles .
Would you like to trade , that we both may enrich ourselves ? \ " " : cooperate " accept " : defect " refuse " : prisoner ( polo ) : scenario trade} ) {:description " A muscled street thug approachs , knife drawn .
\ " Yer money or yer life , fop ! \ " " : cooperate " surrender " : defect " run " : prisoner ( defector ) : scenario theft} ) )
This is n't enough for the Roguelikelike title , and I do n't think I 'll get there today , but I do want the ability to make an arbitrarily long adventure .
The dumbest way of doing this is to make a list of scenarios , and pick from them when the need arises .
( defun random - scenario ( ) ( pick ( list {: description " A stranger approaches .

An adventure of even 5 scenarios will end up being repetitive since we currently only have a grand total of two .
But we can do something about that ... ( defun random - scenario ( ) ( pick ( list {: description " A stranger approaches .

This is about as far as I 'm going today , and I 'm not entirely sure how far I 'm going during my next session .

Ok , so I guess I 'm doing this .
In hopes of participating in the Autumn Lisp 2020 Game Jam , I 'm going to write a multiplayer game .
It 's going to deal with players in several ways , implement 1FA , and probably end up being asymmetric and heavily infulenced by some readings that The Cabal have been doing lately .
But do n't worry about that for the moment .
Piece by piece
The basics ( in - package #: the - prisoners ) ( named - readtables : in - readtable clj:syntax ) I 'm using asd file .
I 'm using clj .
You can find it on my github , and it 'll be included as part of thefile .
Ahem .
Prisoners can do two things .
They can cooperate or they can defect .
( defun coop ? ( res ) ( eq : cooperate res ) ) ( defun defe ? ( res ) ( eq : defect res ) )
In order to play a game , you take the game function and apply it to the ordered list of prisoners that will be playing .
( defun play !
( game &rest players ) ( apply game players ) )
A two - player , one - time game looks like this :
We take two prisoner s
We ask them to either cooperate or defect
We tell each of them what the other did We score them To start with , we 're going with a payoff matrix that looks like | Cooperate | Defect ------------------------------
Cooperate | 3 , 3 | 1 , 5 ------------------------------
Defect | 5 , 1 | 0 , 0 ------------------------------
We might play with this later , but lets pretend we wo n't have the time .
( defun one - time ( player - a player - b ) ( let ( ( a ( funcall ( lookup player - a : strategy ) ) ) ( b ( funcall ( lookup player - b : strategy ) ) ) ) ( if - let ( update ( lookup player - a :update ) ) ( funcall update b ) ) ( if - let ( update ( lookup player - b : update ) ) ( funcall update a ) ) ( cond ( ( and ( coop ? a ) ( coop ? b ) ) ( list 3 3 ) ) ( ( and ( coop ? a ) ( defe ? b ) ) ( list 1 5 ) ) ( ( and ( defe ? a ) ( coop ? b ) ) ( list 5 1 ) ) ( t ( list 0 0 ) ) ) ) )
The two simplest possible prisoners we can have are one who always : cooperate s , and one who always : defect s.
A prisoner needs to be able to take into account what their opponent did last time , and separately , do something .
( defun defector ( ) {: name : defector : strategy ( lambda ( ) : defect ) } ) ( defun cooperator ( ) {: name : cooperator : strategy ( lambda ( ) : cooperate ) } )
We can now play .
Would you like to play a game ?
The Simplest Game THE - PRISONERS > ( play !
#' one - time ( defector ) ( cooperator ) ) ( 5 1 ) THE - PRISONERS > ( play !
#' one - time ( cooperator ) ( defector ) ) ( 1 5 ) THE - PRISONERS > ( play !
#' one - time ( cooperator ) ( cooperator ) ) ( 3 3 ) THE - PRISONERS > ( play !
#' one - time ( defector ) ( defector ) ) ( 0 0 ) THE - PRISONERS >
There are other , simple kinds of prisoners .
One is the prisoner who tosses a coin and does what it tells them to .
( defun gambler ( ) {: name : gambler : strategy ( lambda ( ) ( nth ( random 2 ) ( list : cooperate : defect ) ) ) } )
The more general case does n't necessarily flip a coin , but can weigh either : cooperate or : defect more strongly .
( defun gambler ( &key ( cooperate 1 ) ( defect 1 ) ) ( let ( ( total (+ cooperate defect ) ) ( moves ( concatenate ' list ( loop repeat cooperate collect : cooperate ) ( loop repeat defect collect : defect ) ) ) ) {: name ( intern ( format nil " GAMBLER~a / ~a " cooperate defect ) : keyword ) : strategy ( lambda ( ) ( nth ( random total ) moves ) ) } ) )
This way , we can get a true coin - flipper .
THE - PRISONERS > ( gambler ) {: NAME :GAMBLER1/1 :STRATEGY
#< CLOSURE ( LAMBDA ( ) : IN GAMBLER ) { 1003B5824 B}>} THE - PRISONERS >
Or someone who mostly cooperates / defects , but sometimes defects / cooperates .
THE - PRISONERS > ( gambler : cooperate 5 ) {: NAME :GAMBLER5/1 :STRATEGY
#< CLOSURE ( LAMBDA ( ) : IN GAMBLER ) { 1003B69F0
B}>} THE - PRISONERS > ( gambler : defect 5 ) {: NAME :GAMBLER1/5 :STRATEGY
#< CLOSURE ( LAMBDA ( ) : IN GAMBLER ) { 1003B6C38 B}>} THE - PRISONERS >
How do they play against each of the others ?
Lets find out .
The Second Simplest Game ( defun matches ( elems &key ( mirror ? t ) ) ( loop for ( a . rest ) on elems while rest if mirror ?
collect ( cons a a ) append ( loop for b in rest collect ( cons a b ) ) ) ) ( defun all - against - all ! ( game matches ) ( reduce ( lambda ( memo res ) ( merge - by # '+ memo res ) ) ( loop for ( a . b ) in matches collect ( let ( ( res ( play ! game a b ) ) ) { ( lookup a : name ) ( first res ) ( lookup b : name ) ( second res ) } ) ) ) )
This lets us see who does better against everyone .
THE - PRISONERS > ( all - against - all !

The defector comes out on top here .
And the mostly - defecting gambler does n't do bad either .
Of course , this is what we would expect from the one - time game .
An iterated game is like a series of one - time games , and it keeps a running total of the score .
( defun iterated ( &key ( iterations 10 ) ) ( lambda ( player - a player - b ) ( loop repeat iterations for ( a b ) = ( one - time player - a player - b ) sum a into a -sum sum b into b-sum finally ( return ( list a - sum b- sum ) ) ) ) )
It plays about how you 'd expect THE - PRISONERS > ( play ! ( iterated ) ( defector ) ( cooperator ) ) ( 50 10 ) THE - PRISONERS > ( play ! ( iterated ) ( cooperator ) ( cooperator ) ) ( 30 30 ) THE - PRISONERS > ( play ! ( iterated ) ( defector ) ( defector ) ) ( 0 0 ) THE - PRISONERS >
And setting the world at its ' own throat works the way you 'd expect of this process so far .

There are more elaborate strategies we can call upon .
I wo n't implement them all here , but these have been thought of .
Thoughtful Players Robin alternates between cooperating and defecting .
( defun robin ( ) ( let ( ( prev : cooperate ) ) {: name : robin : strategy ( lambda ( ) ( if ( coop ? prev ) ( setf prev : defect ) ( setf prev : cooperate ) ) ) } ) )
And then , there are the simplest strategies that consider their opponent .
( defun polo ( ) ( let ( ( prev nil ) ) {: name : polo :update ( lambda ( opponent - action ) ( setf prev opponent - action ) ) : strategy ( lambda ( ) ( or prev : cooperate ) ) } ) ) ( defun dantes ( ) ( let ( ( plan : cooperate ) ) {: name : dantes : update ( lambda ( action ) ( when ( defe ? action ) ( setf plan : defect ) ) ) : strategy ( lambda ( ) plan ) } ) )
With the addition of these , it 's no longer obviously a defector s game .

This template engine is interesting because it allows mixing lisp code blocks and HTML in a way simple enough to be used by non-lisp developers and designers .
It 's interesting feature is that each template definition includes the arguments list .
Here is how we can define templates for user list from the previous post about cl-emb : POFTHEDAY > ( eco:compile - string " <% deftemplate user ( nickname name ) ( ) %> < a href= \ " /users /<%= nickname %>\ " ><%= name %></a> <% end %> " ) POFTHEDAY > ( eco:compile - string " <% deftemplate user - list ( users ) ( ) %> < ul > < % loop for ( nickname name ) in users do %> < li ><%- user nickname name %><% end %></li > <% end %> </ul > <% end %> " ) POFTHEDAY > ( eco-template : user - list '( ( " bob " " Bob Hopkins " ) ( " alice " " Alice Cooker " ) ) ) " < ul > < li > < a href=\" /users/bob \ " > Bob Hopkins </ a> </li > < li > < a href= \ " /users / alice\ " > Alice Cooker </ a> </li > </ul > "
Also , there is a way to load templates from the files with .eco extensions .
There is an ASDF extension which allows defining these templates as components of your ASDF system .
Documentation does not cover this , but the template components should be defined like this : ( defsystem mysite :defsystem - depends -on ( eco ) : components ( ( : module " src " : depends -on " templates " : components ( ( : file " backend - code " ) ( : file " utils " ) ) ) ( : module " templates " : components ( ( :eco-template " index - page " ) ( :eco-template " users " ) ) ) ) )
Well , let 's measure Eco 's performance !
POFTHEDAY > ( eco:compile - string " <% deftemplate perform ( title items ) ( ) %> < title ><%= title %></title > < ul > < % loop for item in items do %> < li ><%= item %></li > <% end %> </ul > <% end %> " ) POFTHEDAY > ( time ( loop repeat 1000000 do ( eco-template : perform " Foo Bar " ' ( " One " " Two " " Three " ) ) ) )

This is an interesting templating library .
The most interesting features are : named template pieces can call each other ;
debug mode allows to inspect generated code ;
different escape methods .
Here is how template functions can be reused : POFTHEDAY > ( cl-emb : register - emb " user " " < a href= \ " / users / < % @var nickname %>\ " >< % @var name %></a > " ) POFTHEDAY > ( cl-emb: register - emb " user - list " " < ul > <% @loop users %> < li ><% @call user %></li > < % @endloop %> </ul > " ) POFTHEDAY > ( cl-emb : execute - emb " user - list " : env '( : users ( ( : nickname " bob " : name " Bob Hopkins " ) ( : nickname " alice " : name " Alice Cooker " ) ) ) ) " < ul > < li >< a href=\" /users/bob \ " > Bob Hopkins </a></li> < li >< a href= \" /users / alice\ " > Alice Cooker </a></li> </ul > " Let 's see which code was generated for " user - list " .
To make this work , we 'll need to set * debug * variable and recompile the template : POFTHEDAY > ( cl-emb : pprint-emb - function " user- list " ) ( LAMBDA ( &KEY CL-EMB-INTERN ::ENV CL-EMB-INTERN::GENERATOR-MAKER
CL-EMB-INTERN ::NAME ) ( DECLARE ( IGNORABLE CL-EMB-INTERN ::ENV CL-EMB-INTERN::GENERATOR-MAKER ) ) ( LET ( ( CL-EMB-INTERN ::TOPENV CL-EMB-INTERN ::ENV ) ( CL-EMB-INTERN ::TEMPLATE-PATH-DEFAULT
( IF ( TYPEP CL-EMB-INTERN ::NAME 'PATHNAME ) CL-EMB-INTERN ::NAME *DEFAULT -PATHNAME-DEFAULTS * ) ) )
( DECLARE ( IGNORABLE CL-EMB-INTERN ::TOPENV CL-EMB-INTERN ::TEMPLATE-PATH-DEFAULT ) ) ( WITH - OUTPUT-TO-STRING ( * STANDARD -OUTPUT *) ( PROGN ( WRITE - STRING " < ul > " ) ( DOLIST ( CL-EMB-INTERN ::ENV ( CL-EMB ::AUTOFUNCALL
( CL-EMB ::GETF -EMB " users " ) ) )
( WRITE - STRING " < li > " ) ( FORMAT T " ~A " ( LET ( ( CL-EMB :*ESCAPE -TYPE * CL-EMB:* ESCAPE-TYPE *) )
( CL-EMB:EXECUTE-EMB " user " :ENV CL-EMB-INTERN::ENV :GENERATOR-MAKER
CL-EMB-INTERN::GENERATOR-MAKER ) ) ) ( WRITE - STRING " </li > " ) ) ( WRITE - STRING " < /ul > " ) ) ) ) )
As you can see , cl-emb generates a straight forward Lisp code .
Now let 's check how fast cl-emb is and compare it to HTML template engines reviewed in previous days : POFTHEDAY > ( cl-emb : register - emb " render " " < title > < % @var title %></ title > < ul > <% @loop items %>< li >< % @var value %></li>< % @endloop %> </ul > " ) POFTHEDAY > ( time ( loop repeat 1000000 do ( cl- emb : execute - emb " render " : env '( : title " Foo Bar " : items ( ( : value " One " ) ( : value " Two " ) ( : value " Three " ) ) ) ) ) )
Evaluation took : 1.436 seconds of real time 1.441475 seconds of total run time ( 1.421158 user , 0.020317 system ) [ Run times consist of 0.104 seconds GC time , and 1.338 seconds non-GC time .
]
100.35 % CPU 3,172,183,256 processor cycles 767,974,304 bytes consed
That is pretty fast .
Slightly slower than Spinneret but faster than Zenekindarl .

This library is a port of Django templates .
Its coolest feature are : template inheritance ;
autoreload ;
internationalization .
Also , there is nice documentation .
In presence of documentation , I wo n't provide many examples .
Instead , let 's implement a small function for our HTML templating engines performance test .
I did n't find the way to load a template from the string .
That is why we need to set up the library and let it know where to search template files : POFTHEDAY > djula:* current - store * #< DJULA:FILE -STORE { 100248A8C3} > POFTHEDAY > ( djula:find - template djula:*current - store * " test.html " ) ;
Debugger entered on #< SIMPLE - ERROR " Template ~A not found " { 1003D5F073} > [ 1 ]
POFTHEDAY > ; Evaluation aborted on #< SIMPLE - ERROR " Template ~A not found " { 1003D5F073} > POFTHEDAY > ( djula : add - template - directory " templates / " ) ( " templates / " )
Now we need to write such template to the templates / test. html : < h1 >{{ title }}</h1 > < ul > { % for item in items %} < li > { { item }}</li > { % endfor %} </ul >
And we can test it : POFTHEDAY > ( djula:find - template djula:*current - store * " test.html " ) # P " / Users/art/projects/lisp/lisp-project-of-the-day/templates/test.html " ( defparameter +welcome.html + ( djula:compile-template * " welcome.html " ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( with - output - to- string ( s ) ( djula:render - template * ( djula:compile- template * " test.html " ) s : title " Foo Bar " : items ' ( " One " " Two " " Three " ) ) ) " < h1 > Foo Bar < / h1 > < ul > < li>
One</li > < li> Two </ li > < li > Three </ li > </ul > "
It is time to measure performance : ;;
We need this to turn off autoreloading ;; and get good performance : POFTHEDAY > ( pushnew : djula - prod * features * ) POFTHEDAY > ( defparameter * template * ( djula:compile-template * " test.html " ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( defun render ( title items ) ( with - output - to - string ( s ) ( djula : render - template * * template * s : title title :items items ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( time ( loop repeat 1000000 do ( render " Foo Bar " ' ( " One " " Two " " Three " ) ) ) )
Evaluation took : 4.479 seconds of real time 4.487983 seconds of total run time ( 4.453540 user , 0.034443 system ) [ Run times consist of 0.183 seconds GC time , and 4.305 seconds non-GC time .
]
100.20 % CPU 9,891,631,814 processor cycles 1,392,011,008 bytes consed Pay attention to the line adding : djula - prod to the * features * .
It disables auto -reloading .
Withf enabled auto - reloading rendering is 2 times slower and takes 10.6 microseconds .
I could recommend Djula to everybody who works in a team where HTML designers are writing templates and do n't want to dive into Lisp editing .
With Djula they will be able to easily fix templates and see results without changing the backend 's code .
Also , today I 've decided to create a base - line function which will create HTML using string concatenation as fast as possible .
This way we 'll be able to compare different HTML templating engines with the hand - written code : POFTHEDAY > ( defun render - concat ( title items )
" This function does not do proper HTML escaping . " ( flet ( ( to - string ( value ) ( format nil " ~A " value ) ) ) ( apply #'concatenate ' string ( append ( list " < title > " ( to - string title ) " </ title > " " < ul > " ) ( loop for item in items collect " < li > " collect ( to - string item ) collect " < / li > " ) ( list " < /ul > " ) ) ) ) )
POFTHEDAY > ( render - concat " Foo Bar " ' ( " One " " Two " " Three " ) ) " < title > Foo Bar < / title > < ul > < li >
One </li>< li>
Two </li>< li>
Three </li></ul > " POFTHEDAY > ( time ( loop repeat 1000000 do ( render - concat " Foo Bar " ' ( " One " " Two " " Three " ) ) ) )

]
100.97 % CPU 2,053,743,332 processor cycles 864,022,384 bytes consed Writing to stream a little bit slower , so we 'll take as a base - line the result from render - concat : POFTHEDAY > ( defun render - stream ( title items ) " This function does not do proper HTML escaping . " ( flet ( ( to - string ( value ) ( format nil " ~A " value ) ) ) ( with - output - to - string ( out ) ( write - string " < title > " out ) ( write - string ( to - string title ) out ) ( write - string " < / title > < ul > " out ) ( loop for item in items do ( write - string " < li > " out ) ( write - string ( to - string item ) out ) ( write - string " < / li > " out ) ) ( write - string " < /ul > " out ) ) ) )

By , the way , I tried to use str:replace - all for escaping < and > symbols in the handwritten version of the render - concat function .
But its performance degraded dramatically and became 36 microseconds .
str:replace - all uses cl- ppcre for text replacement .
What should I use instead ?

Another month already .
Fortunately there 's a lot of stuff to talk about for Kandria this time around , so I hope you 're ready for a beefy summary !
This month was originally intended to be focused on marketing and recruitment , but for more reasons than one that 's not entirely how it went down after all .
The biggest reason among the bunch being that it has proven really hard for me to concentrate on that - they 're topics I have no experience with , so I do n't feel very comfortable dealing with them at all .
Regardless , there 's been a few things I 've done to help in that regard :
There is now a lengthy game design document that should hopefully give a good idea of what the game should be and should be about .
It 's mostly meant as a communication tool for future team members , to help them get up to speed on the project , and for potential team members to evaluate whether this project is something for them .
If you have a read through it , I would appreciate your thoughts on it a lot !
Being in an opinion vacuum does n't help with creativity .
Next I started working on an official job listing .
It 's not quite done yet and I want to run it by a few people before I get it out there , but if you are or know pixel artists or writers , I 'd appreciate it tremendously if you could keep an eye open for the listing .
I 'll make another announcement about it on all the channels once it 's out .
Edit : the job listing is now out : https://kandria.com/team-search.html?a
I 've also started a thread on some forums to try and spread awareness of the game , but I 'm worrying that I 'm spreading myself too thin and can't tend to all of the outlets as much as I 'd like .
There 's already email , Twitter , and Discord to take care of besides that .
With Kandria not being a full - time job yet , I 'm not sure how much time I should be spending on the social media channels , rather than spending it on development .
Maybe I should reserve a day for it every week ?
Either way , top priority for the coming few weeks will be finding new team members , and I 'll definitely have to invest some more energy to get that going .
I 've also made some good progress on the code and art side : first I 've implemented some more dynamic interactions to make the environment feel more alive :
These , especially the under water physics , still need some work in the future , but for only having spent a single day on them they already look quite promising .
I have a few more ideas for dynamic interactions like that that I want to try and implement soon , too .
All in all this should really help to make the world feel more alive and real , rather than being just a static map of tiles .
Sort of adjacent to this I created a custom distortion effect that 'll be useful for indicating damage and death :
Then there were mechanical changes to the game : so far you could climb up walls indefinitely .
I 've decided to change this and implement a simple stamina system , as this will allow greater control over where the player can or cannot go , thus making it possible to block off certain routes and regions until later .
It should also provide for more interesting platforming challenges and interactions with other elements like the rope .
Finally there were a bunch of good bugfixes thanks to public feedback !
These are n't rolled out in the latest downloadable prototype yet , but they 'll be in the next one , which I hope to release sometime this month .
I 've also automated deployment almost fully , allowing me to upload new updates at the push of a button .
For now I 'm keeping the public prototypes at a staggered release schedule , with a separate rolling release tester group on Steam .
I 'll provide more info about the Steam testing group once I have a better bug reporting system in place .
Then I 've gotten back to re-integrating the dialog system .
This is now pretty much done , the only missing component is the quest system that controls what dialog can be active at what point and things like that .
I 'll probably get to that next once I 've rounded up some more issues with audio , though more on that in a second .
The dialog system I have in Kandria is pretty powerful , and I 've written a lengthy bit about it in the weekly newsletter .
I also started working on profile animations for that :
They 'll need some more work though , as I 'm not convinced they fit very well into the dialog box as I 've got it so far .
I think I 'll have to try out anti-aliasing to smoothen the animations out some more .
Maybe that 'll make it feel more at home with the pretty crisp textbox .
That 's not very high on my list of priorities though , so I 'll keep it for another time .
Finally , after months of pretty painful debugging and coding , I 've made a breakthrough with my audio engine !
It 's now conceptually complete and just needs some good integration testing within Kandria .
The good news is that , aside from a missing reverb implementation , it should offer everything I need for Kandria , and more , so using it for all of my future projects is definitely on the table .
Since this has been such a long and arduous journey , I wanted to take some good time to explain the system .
If you 're interested in that , you can read about it here .
Suffice to say , the next prototype release will finally have sound !
It 'll be a bit before the sound in Kandria will be custom and accompanied by nice , composed music specifically for the game , though .
Music and sound is something I 've been thinking about for a long time , but I 'm purposefully putting it off for much later , as I know it needs to fit the places , story , and characters , all of which have not been sufficiently worked out yet .
Looking back at the roadmap that I published in June , it seems like I 'm getting ahead pretty well despite the many issues that propped up along the way .
A lot of the big blockers have already been fixed , and with a bigger team the rest should get ahead pretty well , too .
I do n't want to jinx it , but it 's looking like the March deadline for the vertical slice is doable !
Alright , so to summarise the plan for this month : complete the job listing , re-integrate the quest system , add some preliminary sounds and music , improve the bug reporting , and release the 0.0.3 demo .
We 'll see how much of that , if not more , I get done by next month .
If you want to get the weekly updates with more details on what 's going on until then , subscribe to the newsletter !

It turns out that sound processing is pretty difficult .
I 've been hacking away at an almost from - scratch rewrite of Shirakumo 's sound systems for the past few months and it 's caused a lot of anguish .
Now , Harmony is not a new system .
It dates back quite a few years , and I had even written another article on it previously .
However , this previous version had several serious flaws and problems , some of which penetrating all the way through the audio stack .
With the rewrite I 'm however now much more confident in the quality and usability of the system .
First though , a bit of terminology : in digital audio processing , audio is represented as a sequence of samples ; regularly recorded amplitudes of the audio signal .
These samples are recorded at a constant rate , the " sample rate , " which often is either 44.1 k Hz or 48k Hz .
Often each sample is represented as a float going from - 1 to +1 , and multiple such sample sequences are combined to form the signal for as many channels as you need ( stereo , surround , etc . )
When processing audio data , a limited sequence of samples is kept in a buffer , which processors can then operate on .
The initial problem with the system was one of resampling : the system was written with the assumption that one could keep a constant samplerate throughout the entire audio processing pipeline .
This , however , turned out to not be suitable .
The issue manifested itself on Windows , where the output backend could require a different samplerate to the one the system was initially configured for .
Thus , at least at the end - points , resampling would be required .
This immediately lead to another problem though : the system was also written with the assumption that every part of the pipeline could consume and produce a full audio buffer every time it was run .
However , with resampling , border issues appear and it's not always possible to consume the full input buffer .
This issue permeates throughout the processing pipeline , as now the final processor cannot consume all data , and so when the system is run next , the processor before the last cannot produce a full buffer as it would overwrite data .
Ultimately though , the fixed samplerate and fixed buffer size design lead to a restriction that made it impossible to represent certain effects like a speed change , which would produce and consume samples at different rates .
And so , pretty much everything had to be rewritten to work with this in mind .
To spare you the troublesome process of figuring out a design , let 's just jump to what the system is like now :
At the most basic level resides the bip - buffer interface , which implements a lockless bipartite buffer .
It 's lockless so that one thread can write , and another can read from it simultaneously .
It 's bipartite so that the regions it hands out are always consecutive regions of memory , rather than wrapping around like in a ring buffer .
This interface is implemented by buffer s and pack s. buffer s represent internal audio samples of one channel in float format , whereas pack s represent external audio samples in any format , with any number of channels .
Then there 's the parts that actually perform audio processing .
These are called segment s , and follow a generic interface that allows them to do their work , and also allows them to be introspected .
Namely they each have a number of input fields , a number of output fields , and a number of parameter fields .
To the input and output fields you can attach a buffer , which will cause the segment s to exchange data .
Assembling a network is then just a matter of creating the segment s , creating a buffer for each connection , and then setting them at the appropriate in / out fields .
At the endpoints , where you need to exchange data with other systems such as file decoders or device drivers , you 'll probably want to make use of the unpacker and packer segments , which perform the necessary encoding to translate between the float buffer s and the compact pack s .
These segments will also perform sample rate conversion as necessary .
Since we have proper bip buffers connecting everything , a segment can now consume and produce at a variable rate without needing to be aware of the rates going on in the rest of the system .
The rates will automatically propagate through the system as the buffers are updated .
Now , all of this behaviour , including many practical standard segment s are implemented in a C library called libmixed .
Audio has some pretty severe latency restrictions , and that 's why , with great pain , I decided to implement the bulk of the audio processing in C , rather than Lisp .
This has cost me a lot of time , but I still think the performance gains are worth it , or I would have had to spend similar , if not more time , trying to match the performance with Lisp code .
I hope that this kind of thing will no longer be necessary at some point in the future , but for now this is where we are .
Anyway , being implemented in C also means it can be useful for people outside of Lisp , and I really do hope that others will take advantage of libmixed , as I think it has a lot of useful work behind it .
To my knowledge there 's currently no free ( as in BSD ) and capable audio processing system out there .
The library also offers a plugin and reflection / introspection API so that one could build a GUI that can represent segments and buffers in a very generic fashion , allowing users to easily plug together processing networks .
Now , one level above libmixed sits cl-mixed , the Lisp bindings library that takes care of the low level stuff and wraps it all in a nice Lisp interface .
It also takes care of offering some support structures where needed , such as managing the input locations when dealing with variable input segments such as mixers .
It also offers a ton of extension systems for interacting with various file formats and playback backends : ALSA Linux playback
Linux playback CoreAudio macOS playback
macOS playback FLAC FLAC file decoding
FLAC file decoding Jack JackAudio playback
JackAudio playback OSS OSS playback ( BSD )
OSS playback ( BSD ) PulseAudio Linux desktop playback
Linux desktop playback SDL2 SDL2 integration if you 're already using SDL2
SDL2 integration if you 're already using SDL2 WASAPI Windows Vista + playback
Windows Vista + playback WAV WAV file decoding
WAV file decoding WinMM Windows 3.0 + playback
Windows 3.0 + playback XAudio2 Windows 8 + playback
Windows 8 + playback mpg123 MP3 decoding
MP3 decoding out123 Cross - platform playback ( C blob ) I 'd like to add more decoders , and at some point also input for the various operating system backends , but for now this is more than plenty .
Some of the backends still have issues ( WinMM , XAudio2 , CoreAudio ) , which I have spent a long time trying to figure out already , so far unsuccessful .
I 'm not too bothered about WinMM and XAudio2 , but CoreAudio definitely needs to be made to work properly soon .
The reason these backends are implemented in Lisp is so that there 's no additional dependencies on shared libraries that might be versioned and interact poorly when deployed .
Since the actual work performed in their respective segment amounts to requesting a buffer region and performing one call , the performance impact from it should also be entirely negligible .
cl-mixed also offers a virtual segment that allows you to implement a segment in Lisp and integrate it into a standard pipeline .
This is possible thanks to the standardised architecture in libmixed , and can be very useful to experiment with effects very quickly .
If I ever intend on developing a new effects segment , I 'll definitely implement it in Lisp first to take advantage of rapid prototyping , before lowering it down to C if performance should become an issue .
On that note , cl- mixed actually uses static - vectors to implement the backing storage of pack s and buffer s , as well as all of the bip - buffer protocol .
This means that you can interact with packs and buffers from Lisp as if they were normal Lisp arrays , without ever having to worry about FFI .
That said , cl- mixed will not do buffer management or resource management in general for you .
You 'll still have to manually create and free segments and buffers and make sure they 're connected .
You 'll also have to run the mixing loop yourself and make sure you do that often enough to not cause stuttering .
This is where Harmony steps in .
Being the high - level component , it imposes a bit of architecture on you , but in turn takes care of a lot of lower level plumbing .
In effect , with Harmony you can perform playback as easily as : ( harmony : start ( harmony : make - simple - server ) ) ( harmony : play " music.mp3 " : mixer :music : loop T ) ( harmony : play " effect.wav " : mixer :effect :location ' ( 10 0 0 ) )
It 'll take care of detecting the appropriate backend for your platform , setting up channel conversion and basic mixing infrastructure , allocating and re-using buffers , automatically cleaning up when a sound source ends , and performing low - latency audio processing in the background .
It can also do fun stuff like automatically creating a network to apply effects to a source .
( harmony : play " music.wav " : mixer :music : effects '(( mixed : speed - change : speed - factor 2.0 ) ( mixed : pitch : pitch 0.5 ) ) )
Which would play the music at double the speed , but with a pitch correction applied so that the notes should still be the correct frequency .
Hopefully this will make it easy enough to use for games without having to worry about all the low level detail aspects .
I 'm going to find out how well this all works soon , as it's now at a stable enough state that I can start working it into Kandria .
If you 're interested in using these systems or contributing to them , let me know !
I 'd be happy to provide assistance .
If you like my work in general and want to donate , you can do that too , either on GitHub Sponsors for recurring donations , or on Ko- Fi for one - time donations .
Thanks for reading !

This system implements an LTSV logs parser and serializer .
LTSV is based on TSV format but each field has a name .
This lets us easily add new fields and to process logs in a manageable way : POFTHEDAY > ( cl- ltsv:alist - ltsv '( ( " message " .
" Hello world ! " ) ( " request_id " . 100500 ) ) ) " message : Hello world ! request_id:100500 " POFTHEDAY > ( cl-ltsv: parse - line *) ( ( " message " .
" Hello world ! " ) ( " request_id " .
" 100500 " ) ) LTSV is based on TSV format which has some escaping rules for tabs , newlines and backslashes , but LTSV FAQ says forget about escaping , we do n't need it for our access logs .
I think this decision makes LTSV unusable for general - purpose logs .
For example , if you have newlines or tabs in the logged value , a log will be broken : POFTHEDAY > ( concatenate ' string " Hello " '( # \Newline # \Tab ) " World ! " ) " Hello World ! " ;;
This call should produce a single line , ; ; replacing a newline with
and tab with \t : POFTHEDAY > ( cl - ltsv:alist - ltsv ( list ( cons " message " * ) ) ) " message : Hello World ! " ;;
Parsing does not process escaped symbols either : POFTHEDAY > ( cl - ltsv : parse - line " message : Hello \
\\tWorld ! " ) ( ( " message " .
" Hello \
\\tWorld ! " ) )
That is all I have for today .
Probably tomorrow we 'll catch a more interesting library .

This system provides a framework for building parsers in a functional way .
Smug parsers are lisp functions which can be combined together to process complex grammar .
Actually , it can process anything , not only the text - any data source which can be read token by token is suitable .
Documentation on smug is extremely good !
I 'll how only the basics .
Good job , @drewcrampsie .
Read the official tutorial to learn in deep how this sytem works !
Today we 'll create a parser which will be able to transform texts like " 3 days ago " into the local - time - duration : duration objects .
To start , let 's create a simple parser which will match a digit character : POFTHEDAY > ( defun .digit ( ) ( smug : .is #'digit- char - p ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( smug:run ( .digit ) " 17 hours ago " ) ( ( # \1 . " 7 hours ago " ) )
We can use .map to capture a sequence of digits matched to the parser : POFTHEDAY > ( smug:run ( smug : .map ' list ( .digit ) ) " 17 hours ago " ) ( ( ( #\1 # \7 ) . " hours ago " ) ( ( # \1 ) . " 7 hours ago " ) ) ;;
We also might produce strings : POFTHEDAY > ( smug:run ( smug : .map ' string ( .digit ) ) " 17 hours ago " ) ( ( " 17 " . " hours ago " ) ( " 1 " .
" 7 hours ago " ) )
Now it is time to transform it into the number .
I 'll wrap all code into the parser function and use smug :. bind to process the captured values : POFTHEDAY > ( defun .integer ( ) ( smug :.bind ( smug : .map ' string ( .digit ) ) ( lambda ( text ) ( smug :.identity ( read - from - string text ) ) ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( smug:run ( .integer ) " 17 hours ago " ) ( ( 17 . " hours ago " ) ( 1 . " 7 hours ago " ) )
It is time to parse time units : POFTHEDAY > ( smug:run ( smug : . prog1 ( smug :. string - equal " hour " ) ;;
This will " eat " the " s " letter ; ; on the end of the plural form ;; if it is used : ( smug:.string - equal " s " ) ) " hours ago " ) ( ( " hour " . " ago " ) ) ;;
Again , we 'll want to convert the string into the keyword and to wrap ;; the parser into a function : POFTHEDAY > ( defun .unit ( ) ( smug :.bind ( smug : . prog1 ( smug : . or ( smug :. string - equal " hour " ) ( smug :.string - equal " minute " ) ( smug :.string - equal " second " ) ) ;;
This will " eat " the " s " letter ; ; on the end of the plural form ;; if it is used : ( smug : . or ( smug:.string - equal " s " ) ( smug:.identity nil ) ) ) ( lambda ( text ) ( smug : .identity ( alexandria : make - keyword ( string - upcase text ) ) ) ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( smug:run ( .unit ) " hours ago " ) ( (: HOUR . " ago " ) )
And finally , we need a parser to process optional suffix pointing to the time in past : POFTHEDAY > ( defun .in-past-p ( ) ( smug : . or ( smug :.string - equal " ago " ) ( smug:.identity nil ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( smug:run ( .in - past - p ) " ago " ) ( ( " ago " . " " ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( smug:run ( .in - past - p ) " some " ) ( ( NIL . " some " ) )
It is time to combine our parsers into a more complex one which will return a local - time - duration : POFTHEDAY > ( defun .whitespace ( ) ( smug : .is #'member '(# \Space # \Tab # \Newline ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( defun .duration ( ) ( smug : . let * ( ( value ( .integer ) ) ( _ ( . whitespace ) ) ( unit ( .unit ) ) ( _ ( .whitespace ) ) ( in-past ( .in- past - p ) ) ) ( let* ( ( seconds (* value ( ecase unit ( : hour (* 60 60 ) ) ( : minute 60 ) ( : second 1 ) ) ( if in - past - 1 1 ) ) ) ( duration ( make- instance ' local - time-duration:duration :sec seconds ) ) ) ( smug:.identity duration ) ) ) ) ;;
A few checks if everything is OK : POFTHEDAY > ( smug : parse ( .duration ) " 17 hours ago " ) #< LOCAL-TIME -DURATION:DURATION
[ 0/-61200/0 ] - 17 hours > POFTHEDAY > ( smug : parse ( .duration ) " 5 minute " ) #< LOCAL-TIME -DURATION:DURATION [ 0/300/0 ] 5 minutes >
That is it for today .
And again , to learn more , read SMUG 's documentation .
It is one of the best - documented Lisp systems I 've ever seen : http://smug.drewc.ca/smug.html
Thank you , @drewcrampsie !

This is the library by MichaÅ‚ " phoe " Herda .
It extends CLOS allowing to use lists of symbols as class names : POFTHEDAY > ( list - named - class : defclass ( : user : model ) ( ) ( ) )
POFTHEDAY > ( list - named - class : defclass ( : user : view ) ( ) ( ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( list - named - class : defgeneric render ( obj ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( list - named - class : defmethod render ( ( obj ( : user : view ) ) ) ( format nil " Rendered User View " ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( list - named - class : make - instance '( : user : view ) ) #<(: USER :VIEW ) { 10076F6CC3} > POFTHEDAY > ( render *) " Rendered User View "
This can be useful when classes are defined using some macros .
Not sure why somebody should prefer such class - names instead of symbols .
Here are some examples of list - named - class usage I found in the wild : https://github.com/RaptorLauncher/Gateway/blob/5fc2d404cd53854f570b8debbd869053d3a71043/wip/messages/hello.lisp

This is a small library by @thebaggers allows you to define functions which work only specified amount of time .
You can use it to define a named function or to create a lambda .
This will print a greeting only 10 seconds since definition : POFTHEDAY > ( temporal - functions : defun - t foo ( ) ( temporal - functions : before ( temporal - functions : seconds 10 ) ( print " Hello Lisp World ! " ) ) )
POFTHEDAY > ( foo ) " Hello Lisp World ! " " Hello Lisp World ! " POFTHEDAY > ( foo ) " Hello Lisp World ! " " Hello Lisp World ! " POFTHEDAY > ( foo ) NIL POFTHEDAY > ( temporal - functions : expiredp ( foo ) ) T
It is possible to create a function which starts doing something after the specified amount of time : POFTHEDAY > ( temporal - functions : tlambda ( ) ( temporal - functions : after ( temporal - functions : seconds 10 ) ( print " Now I 'm working ! " ) ) )
#< CLOSURE ( LAMBDA ( ) ) { 1001D5183B} > POFTHEDAY > ( funcall *) NIL POFTHEDAY > ( funcall **)
" Now I 'm working ! " " Now I 'm working ! "
There are also other constructions like then , repeat , each , until and once .
But I was n't able to figure out the right way to use them .
It would be wonderful if @thebaggers update the documentation !

So apparently , there 's no bcrypt implementation for Common Lisp .
There 's an ffi wrapper which is n't in quicklisp , but that 's all I could find .
Which is mildly annoying , because as mentioned last time , I need to store tokens basically the same way I would store passwords .
There does n't seem to be anything similar at a cursory glance , although it 's always possible I missed something .
Oh well .
According to the Wikipedia article pseudocode , it looks like the essence of the algorithm is use the password as a key
to encrypt the plaintext " OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt " using blowfish in ECB mode
in mode repeatedly some number of times ( determined by the cost argument )
And the end result is a sufficiently one - way function that lets you store some string to compare with input later without actually keeping that string on file .
So. tomb I preface this by saying that I am not a crypto nerd .
Probably do n't use this in production anywhere , and definitely do n't use it anywhere security is an actual concern .
I 'm not aware of a way to back out the initial plaintext , but you should take Schneier 's advice about what to think of that .
That being said , I 've got this toy project with a bcrypt - shaped hole in its : depends - on list , and I may as well try something .
; ; ; ; src/tomb.lisp ( in - package # :tomb ) ( defparameter * gen * ( session -token:make-generator : token - length 16 ) ) ( defun entomb ( string &key ( salt ( funcall * gen * ) ) ( cost 10 ) ( cipher - name : blowfish ) ) ( let* ( ( arr ( ironclad : ascii - string - to - byte - array ( concatenate ' string string salt ) ) ) ( initial - hash ( hash - for - tomb arr cipher - name ) ) ( cipher ( ironclad : make - cipher cipher - name : key initial - hash : mode :ecb ) ) ( output ( make - sequence '( SIMPLE - ARRAY ( UNSIGNED-BYTE 8 ) ( * ) ) ( length initial - hash ) ) ) ) ( ironclad : encrypt cipher initial - hash output ) ( loop repeat ( expt 2 cost ) do ( ironclad : encrypt - in - place ( ironclad : make - cipher cipher - name : key output : mode :ecb ) output ) ) ( format nil " $ 0 w $ ~ a $ ~ a $ ~ a$ ~a " cipher - name cost salt ( ironclad : byte - array - to - hex - string output ) ) ) ) ( defun hash - for - tomb ( arr cipher - name ) ( ironclad : digest - sequence ( case cipher - name ( : threefish512 : sha512 ) ( : threefish1024 : skein1024 ) ( t : sha256 ) ) arr ) ) ( defun tomb - matches ?
( string hashed ) ( destructuring - bind ( name cipher - name cost salt hash ) ( split - sequence : split - sequence # \$ hashed : remove - empty - subseqs t) ( declare ( ignore hash ) ) ( assert ( string= name " 0 w " ) ) ( let ( ( cost ( parse - integer cost ) ) ( cipher - name ( intern cipher - name : keyword ) ) ) ( string= ( entomb string : salt salt : cost cost : cipher - name cipher - name ) hashed ) ) ) )
Principles first .
Sane defaults -
We do n't want to make the user1 do any more work than they have to .
Which means that the minimal call to the top level interface should be something that goes String ->
String rather than needing the user to generate their own salt , specify a cipher or do any type conversions .
Flexible implementation -
We should n't assume a particular salting strategy , input size , or cipher .
We need to limit ourselves to ECB mode , because changing that is deep magic that I 'm not getting anywhere near without a deeper understanding .
Use Crypto Primitives - Speaking of deep magic , we 're not writing anything ourselves from the bytes up .
ironclad is a thing , and it works well if sometimes counter - intuitively , and I fully intend to take advantage .
With that out of the way , here 's tomb , which is sort of like crypt .
... ( defun entomb ( string &key ( salt ( funcall * gen * ) ) ( cost 10 ) ( cipher - name : blowfish ) ) ( let* ( ( arr ( ironclad : ascii - string - to - byte - array ( concatenate ' string string salt ) ) ) ( initial - hash ( hash - for - tomb arr cipher - name ) ) ( cipher ( ironclad : make - cipher cipher - name : key initial - hash : mode :ecb ) ) ( output ( make - sequence '( SIMPLE - ARRAY ( UNSIGNED-BYTE 8 ) ( * ) ) ( length initial - hash ) ) ) ) ( ironclad : encrypt cipher initial - hash output ) ( loop repeat ( expt 2 cost ) do ( ironclad : encrypt - in - place ( ironclad : make - cipher cipher - name : key output : mode :ecb ) output ) ) ( format nil " $ 0 w $ ~ a $ ~ a $ ~ a$ ~a " cipher - name cost salt ( ironclad : byte - array - to - hex - string output ) ) ) ) ...
The core function is entomb .
It takes a string ( your password / passphrase ) , and optionally also salt , cost and cipher - name .
If you do n't pass in any of those , it chooses sane defaults , including using session - token / cl-isaac to generate a secure random salt value .
The first thing we do is concatenate the string and salt values , convert the result to an ironclad byte - array , then hash it .
Hashing it using some secure digest method that produces the appropriate number of bytes to be used as a key for the chosen cipher .
... ( defun hash - for - tomb ( arr cipher - name ) ( ironclad : digest - sequence ( case cipher - name ( : threefish512 : sha512 ) ( : threefish1024 : skein1024 ) ( t : sha256 ) ) arr ) ) ...
It looks like sha256 is good enough for most of the ECB capable ciphers in ironclad , but threefish512 and threefish1024 need larger keys than it provides , so we use other approaches when using those ciphers .
I do n't want to make it too easy to use weaker ciphers , so I do n't bother using hashes that result in keys smaller than sha256 .
... ( cipher ( ironclad : make - cipher cipher - name : key initial - hash : mode :ecb ) ) ( output ( make - sequence '( SIMPLE - ARRAY ( UNSIGNED-BYTE 8 ) ( * ) ) ( length initial - hash ) ) ) ) ( ironclad : encrypt cipher initial - hash output ) ( loop repeat ( expt 2 cost ) do ( ironclad : encrypt - in - place ( ironclad : make - cipher cipher - name : key output : mode :ecb ) output ) ) ( format nil " $ 0 w $ ~ a $ ~ a $ ~ a$ ~a " cipher - name cost salt ( ironclad : byte - array - to - hex - string output ) ) ) ) ...
Next up , we initialize an ironclad cipher with the appropriate base state , and allocate an output simple - array to stuff the results in .
Then we use the initialized cipher to ironclad : encrypt our input hash ( complete with salt ) and put the results in output .
Once that 's done , we encrypt - in - place the output with the same settings , changing out the key each time .
The thing we 're encrypting the first time though is the key ( with itself ) , and every subsequent layer of encryption also uses itself as the key .
Once we 've done this , we stitch everything together into a string that contains documentation about its ' creation .
( defun tomb - matches ?
( string hashed ) ( destructuring - bind ( name cipher - name cost salt hash ) ( split - sequence : split - sequence # \$ hashed : remove - empty - subseqs t) ( declare ( ignore hash ) ) ( assert ( string= name " 0 w " ) ) ( let ( ( cost ( parse - integer cost ) ) ( cipher - name ( intern cipher - name : keyword ) ) ) ( string= ( entomb string : salt salt : cost cost : cipher - name cipher - name ) hashed ) ) ) ) tomb - matches ?
takes a string and an entomb ed string , and returns a yay or nay about whether they match .
It does this by decomposing the entomb ed string in a way that lets it figure out what arguments to pass to entomb , and does so on the input string .
Next Step
This library is now on github in case you are like me , and want to experiment with low - security - but - principled systems .
For my part , I 'll probably add it to quicklisp , and definitely as a requirement to cl-vote so that I can put together a good recovery token system .
It mildly amuses me to think that knowing that token in this case is technically a " known plaintext " attack .

This is a small library by @codeninja_blog .
It provides only a macro to wrap and remember any form and a function to force its evaluation .
For example , let 's create a few functions which accept and return lazy objects : POFTHEDAY > ( defun request - name ( ) ( lazy : lazy ( format t " What is your name ? ~ % " ) ( read- line ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( defun greet ( name ) ( lazy : lazy ( format nil " Hello ~A ! ~ % " ( lazy : lazy - value name ) ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( greet ( request - name ) ) #< LAZY ::THUNK UNREALIZED > POFTHEDAY > ( lazy: lazy - value *)
What is your name ?
Bob " Hello Bob ! " ;;
Second attempt to get the greeting value ; ; is not request for the user 's name : POFTHEDAY > ( lazy:lazy - value **) " Hello Bob ! "
Or we can build a simple lazy sequences library .
This function will create a sequence of numbers : POFTHEDAY > ( defun make - lazy - sequence ( &optional ( start 0 ) ( step 1 ) ) ( lazy : lazy ( values start ( make - lazy - sequence (+ start step ) step ) ) ) )
This one will skip a number of items : POFTHEDAY > ( defun lazy - skip ( n lazy - sequence ) ( lazy : lazy ( loop do ( multiple - value - bind ( item rest ) ( lazy : lazy - value lazy - sequence ) ( when ( zerop n ) ( return ( values item rest ) ) ) ( decf n ) ( setf lazy - sequence rest ) ) ) ) )
And this one will force lazy evaluation and transform the sequence into the list : POFTHEDAY > ( defun lazy - to - list ( n lazy - sequence ) ( loop with result = nil do ( multiple - value - bind ( item rest ) ( lazy : lazy - value lazy - sequence ) ( when ( zerop n ) ( return ( nreverse result ) ) ) ( push item result ) ( setf lazy - sequence rest ) ( decf n ) ) ) )
And of cause we need a generic map function to apply transformations : POFTHEDAY > ( defun lazy - mapcar ( func sequence ) ( lazy : lazy ( multiple - value - bind ( item rest ) ( lazy : lazy - value sequence ) ( values ( funcall func item ) ( lazy - mapcar func rest ) ) ) ) )
Here is how we can apply these functions to process a lazy sequence : POFTHEDAY > ( make - lazy - sequence ) POFTHEDAY > ( lazy - skip 5 *) POFTHEDAY > ( lazy - mapcar ( lambda ( x ) ( format t " Multiplying ~A to ~ A~ % " x x ) (* x x ) ) *) POFTHEDAY > ( lazy - to - list 3 *) Multiplying 5 to 5 Multiplying 6 to 6 Multiplying 7 to 7 Multiplying 8 to 8 ( 25 36 49 )
But this will work only with my pull request which makes the lazy - value return all values , returned by original form .
Anyway , lazy is a small and very nice library .
Thank you , @codeninja_blog .

This library allows to dynamically create CLOS classes as a mixin composition .
Mixins are choosen depending on parameters given to the constructor .
For example , if we have in our system users , which can be authenticated and additionally can be admins , then we can to define their classes like : POFTHEDAY > ( defclass user ( ) ( ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( defclass authenticated ( ) ( ( email :initarg : email ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( defclass admin ( ) ( ) )
Now we need to tell the system how to apply our mixins when different parameters are passed .
If there is : email , then the user will be considered authenticated .
If there is : is - admin t - he is the admin .
POFTHEDAY > ( dynamic - classes : add - parameter - > dynamic - class :user : email ' authenticated ) NIL POFTHEDAY > ( dynamic - classes : add - parameter -> dynamic - class :user : is-admin ' admin ) NIL
We also have to declare these methods to make the framework do its job .
Probably this can be avoided if only the default implementation was specialized not on class - type ( eql nil ) .
POFTHEDAY > ( defmethod dynamic - classes : include - class - dependencies ( ( class - type ( eql :user ) ) dynamic - class class - list &rest parameters )
" This method can modify list of classes used to combine into a new class for given parameters .
Or some restrictions can be applied . " ( declare ( ignorable dynamic - class parameters ) ) class - list ) POFTHEDAY > ( defmethod dynamic - classes : existing - subclass ( ( class - type ( eql :user ) ) class - list ) " This method allows to return a custom class .
If it returns nil , the first class from the class - list will be choosen . " ( declare ( ignorable class - list ) ) ( values nil ) )
Now let 's check how it works .
There is a function to create and return the class depending on the parameters : POFTHEDAY > ( dynamic - classes : determine - dynamic - class : user ' user ) USER POFTHEDAY > ( dynamic - classes : determine - dynamic - class : user 'user :email " some@gmail.com " ) USER - AND - AUTHENTICATED
POFTHEDAY > ( dynamic - classes : determine - dynamic - class : user ' user : email nil ) USER - AND - AUTHENTICATED POFTHEDAY > ( dynamic - classes : determine - dynamic - class : user 'user :email " some@gmail.com " :is-admin t) USER - AND - AUTHENTICATED-AND-ADMIN POFTHEDAY > ( dynamic - classes : determine - dynamic - class : user ' user :is-admin t) USER - AND -ADMIN
Do you see there a strange behavior ?
We can pass the nil as an email and user will be considered authenticated or we can use : is - admin without email and will get unauthenticated admin class !
Fortunately , there is a hook to apply additional restrictions : POFTHEDAY > ( defmethod dynamic - classes : include - class - dependencies ( ( class - type ( eql :user ) ) dynamic - class class - list &rest parameters ) ( declare ( ignorable dynamic - class parameters ) ) ;;
If email is not given we do n't want consider ;; the user authenticated : ( when ( and ( member : email parameters ) ( null ( getf parameters : email ) ) ) ( rutils : removef class - list ' authenticated ) ) ;;
And if : is - admin nil then he is not an admin : ( when ( and ( member : is- admin parameters ) ( null ( getf parameters : is-admin ) ) ) ( rutils : removef class - list ' admin ) ) ;;
Also , we need admins always be authenticated : ( when ( and ( member ' admin class - list ) ( not ( member ' authenticated class - list ) ) ) ( error " Admin should have an email ! " ) ) class - list ) POFTHEDAY > ( dynamic - classes : determine - dynamic - class : user 'user :email " some@gmail.com " :is-admin t) USER - AND - AUTHENTICATED-AND-ADMIN POFTHEDAY > ( dynamic - classes : determine - dynamic - class : user 'user :email " some@gmail.com " : is-admin nil ) USER - AND - AUTHENTICATED
POFTHEDAY > ( dynamic - classes : determine - dynamic - class : user 'user : email nil : is-admin nil ) USER POFTHEDAY > ( dynamic - classes : determine - dynamic - class : user 'user : email nil :is-admin t) ; Debugger entered on #< SIMPLE -ERROR " Admin should have an email ! " { 100B6CAD73} >
Now we need to wrap this into a single constructor make - user which will return objects of different class depending on arguments : POFTHEDAY > ( defun make - user ( &rest args &key email is - admin ) ( declare ( ignore email is - admin ) ) ( let ( ( class ( apply #'dynamic - classes : determine - dynamic - class : user 'user args ) ) ) ( apply #'make - instance class ;;
We do n't store is - admin as the slot : ( rutils : remove - from - plist args :is-admin ) ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( make - user ) #< USER { 1006704893} > POFTHEDAY > ( make - user :email " blah@min.or " )
#< USER-AND-AUTHENTICATED
{ 1006779083} > POFTHEDAY > ( make - user :email " blah@min.or " :is-admin t) #< USER-AND-AUTHENTICATED-AND-ADMIN { 10067C26C3} > POFTHEDAY > ( make - user :is-admin t ) ; Debugger entered on #< SIMPLE -ERROR " Admin should have an email ! " { 10067D0193} >
To make these classes print in a human - readable way , use print - items library , reviewed in the post # 0145 .
The more sophisticated use of the dynamic - classes can be found in the cl- containers library .
It uses dynamic - classes to mix container and iterator classes to give them different traits depending on constructor 's parameters .

CLJ in Practice I finally got around to using clj in a prototyping context .
And it 's going relatively smoothly so far .
My only real complaint is that I seem to have to put ( named - readtables : in - readtable clj:syntax ) at the top of every file where I want to use my cool new map / set literal syntax .
I 'm hoping there 's some way to fix this by just putting it at the top of a package file or something , but that naive solution does n't seem to work .
At first glance , there does n't seem to be a way to express " load this project with a given , non - default readtable " , and I 'm not entirely sure why yet .
Return to cl-vote
The project I put some work into is an old piece of arcana from the earlier days of the Toronto CS Cabal .
A simple voting system to help us decide what we 're reading in a given week .
The next step I 'm going to take is implementing the actual voting .
Step one was just the authentication system .
So here 's the deal .
Passwords suck , public keys are n't really being used widely for website / app authentication , and that does n't seem to be something I can easily change .
Authenticator apps and 2FA are propagating though .
For low - security - requirement situtations , one plausible alternative to passwords is just using that authenticator .
So , like , 1FA .
The current state of cl-vote is an implementation of such a system in Common Lisp .
The workflow looks like this :
You register by picking a user name that has n't already been picked .
The system instantly sends you to a screen that displays a QR code compatible with FreeOTP or Authy or whatever
When you want to log in later , enter your username and your authentication code
That 's fairly simple .
There 's no need to remember passwords , though you do now need your phone or authenticator app / browser plugin / what - have - you .
Considering Humane Interfaces
During the construction of this , I briefly considered taking the Raskin approach of letting users log in with just their " password "s .
Mechanically , this would involve iterating through the entire user database in order to find if there 's anyone whose next code matches the input at login .
I decided against it for three reasons
It opens up the attack surface ; instead of guessing a particular users ' next code an attacker now needs to guess any valid code that collides with any existing user .
Still improbably , but lets not throw caution to the wind entirely , huh ?
, huh ?
Makes login more expensive ; instead of getting a particular user entry and checking their code against the given one , I need to do it for each user until I find a matching one .
In the extreme case , like a user database big enough to shard , this will take an extremely long time .
Which segues nicely into
long time .
Which segues nicely into Makes login more inconsistent ; if we hit the negative extreme case , it might take long enough to verify codes that the given code might have expired in the meantime , giving us false negatives .
This does n't feel like something that would happen too often , but it 's not something that 's trivially or implicitly soluble either .
A user name solves enough problems that I 'm content burdening users with the task of picking one .
Considering Further Security
Once I combine it with some form of hammering protection , this system is resistant to the sorts of guessing attacks that plague password systems .
It 's still not resistant against server database breaches .
Granted , this particular one is tricky to crack in that way because it 's immune to injection attacks as a result of its ' data storage model 1 , but that 's cold comfort .
If you did manage to expropriate a user record , you 'd gain access to that users ' shared secret and could thereafter generate correct solutions for their account at will .
That 's sort of the point .
One thing I could do , as a web app proprietor , is keep client fingerprints around and be a bit more cautious about logins coming from devices that a user has n't used before .
It 's not entirely clear to me what to do if I detect an anomaly .
I guess one thing I could do is request a challenge answer through a different contact method .
Like an SMS sender or email , to which I would send a challenge generated by a session - specific secret key and then expect a response .
Doing that would also effectively mitigate the database expropriation attack .
It would n't mitigate a successful server takeover , but I 'm not sure there 's a reasonable way to mitigate that at all yet .
This might be good enough .
Considering Account Recovery
Account recovery codes are a thing that 2FA systems use to " make " " sure " that a user can still get into their account if they lose their phone / authenticator token / whatever .
The way this works is by having the user write down a bunch of codes , each of which can presumably be used for a one - time entry into the system without other authentication methods being available .
Cool , I guess .
I have n't had to use them yet , and I suspect the sorts of systems I 'm planning to build lend themselves more easily to the " make a new account " recovery path than this , but it might still be worth doing .
Mechanically , this means generating some number of alphanumeric codes that are either easy to write down or easy to remember .
Then giving the user a workflow where they can enter one of these codes , at which point they are logged in but the code they used is marked as expired .
I 'm going to try to implement a couple of these extras , then get bored and move on to the main point .
Which is collective decision making .

This system is similar to bordeaux - threads but has some unique features .
What I like is that portable - threads forces you to give the thread a name .
No more Anonumous threads !
Also , there is a shortcut macro to start any code in a thread without wrapping it into an explicit lambda : POFTHEDAY > ( portable - threads : spawn - form ( format t " Running in ~S thread " ( portable - threads : thread - name ( portable - threads : current - thread ) ) ) )
Running in " Form ( FORMAT T ... ) " thread #< SB - THREAD :THREAD " Form ( FORMAT T ... ) "
FINISHED values : NIL { 10051E61C3} >
Or there is also a shortcut to run periodical tasks in the thread : POFTHEDAY > ( defun periodic ( ) ( format t " [ ~A ] Running in ~S thread ~ % " ( local - time : now ) ( portable - threads : thread - name ( portable - threads : current - thread ) ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( portable - threads : spawn-periodic - function #'periodic 5 : count 3 : verbose t ) ;;
Spawning periodic - function thread for ...
#< SB-THREAD:THREAD " Periodic Function " RUNNING { 100466CDB3} > [ 2020-08-23T14:00:35.207071+03:00 ]
Running in " Periodic Function " thread [ 2020-08-23T14:00:40.214253+03:00 ]
Running in " Periodic Function " thread [ 2020-08-23T14:00:45.215454+03:00 ]
Running in " Periodic Function " thread ;;
Exiting periodic - function thread
Another cool feature not found in bordeaux - threads is thread hibernation .
Any thread can fall asleep and be awakened later : POFTHEDAY > ( defun do - the - job ( ) ( format t " Started a thread ~ A ~ % " ( portable - threads : thread - name ( portable - threads : current - thread ) ) ) ;;
Now we 'll fall asleep until somebody will ;; call awake .
( portable - threads : hibernate - thread ) ( format t " Thread ~ A works again ! ~ % " ( portable - threads : thread - name ( portable - threads : current - thread ) ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( defparameter * thread * ( portable - threads : spawn - thread " Worker " # ' do - the - job ) ) Started a thread Worker POFTHEDAY > ( portable - threads : thread - whostate * thread * ) " Alive " ;;
Now we wake thread up : POFTHEDAY > ( portable - threads : awaken - thread * thread * )
Thread Worker works again !

This system makes it very easy to create and use a generator in Python style .
This code demostrates how a simple generator works in Python .
The generator creates an iterable object and values can be extracted by calling the next function :
In [ 1 ] : def simple ( ) : ... : yield 1 ... : print ( ' LOG : Going to the second yield ' ) ... : yield 2 ...: In [ 2 ] : simple ( ) Out [ 2 ] : < generator object simple at 0x10752a050 >
In [ 3 ] : next ( _2 ) Out [ 3 ] : 1 In [ 4 ] : next ( _2 ) LOG : Going to the second yield Out [ 4 ] : 2 In [ 5 ] : next ( _2 ) ------------------
StopIteration
The similar generator can be implemented with snakes : POFTHEDAY > ( snakes : defgenerator simple ( ) ( snakes : yield 1 ) ( format t " LOG : Going to the second yield ~ % " ) ( snakes : yield 2 ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( simple ) #< SNAKES : BASIC-GENERATOR { 1008454D4B} > POFTHEDAY > ( funcall *) LOG : Going to the second yield 1 POFTHEDAY > ( funcall **) 2 POFTHEDAY > ( funcall ***) SNAKES : GENERATOR-STOP
Here is the more interesting example of the generator which produces an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers : POFTHEDAY > ( snakes : defgenerator fib ( ) ( loop with a = 0 with b = 1 for new - b = (+ a b ) do ( snakes : yield a ) ( setf a b b new - b ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( snakes : take 20 ( fib ) ) ( 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 ) ;;
Or we can skip first 50 numbers and output 5 next : POFTHEDAY > ( snakes : generator - > list ( snakes : islice ( fib ) 50 55 ) ) ( 12586269025 20365011074 32951280099 53316291173 86267571272 )
There are also other features like : anonymous generators ;
yield - from form ;
forms to iterate over generators ;
functions ported from Python 's itertools ;
; integration with iterate library .
Snakes has a comprehensive documentation which covers all its features .

This is a little wrapper around TeX language to make it compatible with Lisp 's sexps .
Written by @eugeneia_ .
Here is a little example , I 've taken from the documentation : POFTHEDAY > ( defun tex - menu ( menu ) ( texp : deftex item ( caption price ) ( texp : $ caption ) " " ( texp : $ ( texp : escape " $ " ) ) ( texp : $ price ) ( texp : br ) ( texp : : bigskip ) ) ( loop for ( caption price ) in menu do ( texp : tex ( item {( texp : $ ( texp: escape caption ) ) } { ( texp : $ ( texp: escape price ) ) } ) ) ) ( texp:tex ( bye ) ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( tex - menu '( ( " Mozzarella Sticks " " 5.99 " ) ( " Onion Rings " " 4.99 " ) ( " Spinach " " 5.99 " ) ) ) \def \item # 1#2{#1 \$ #2 \bigskip } \item { Mozzarella Sticks}{5.99}\item { Onion Rings}{4.99}\item { Spinach}{5.99}\bye
To render the DVI file , save this output into the file example .
tex and run tex example .
tex .
( On OSX you can install TeX using brew cask install mactex . )
This command will generate example .
tex file which will look like that :
With this system , you can use full power or the Lisp to write publishing systems .
For example , Geneva documentation system uses it to generate TeX and LaTeX outputs .

This system implements an interesting algorithm suitable for storing binary tries or transmitting them over the wire without overhead on storing pointers .
There is almost no information about this algorithm on the internet .
The best description I found is : https://datprotocol.github.io/book/ch01-01-flat-tree.html
Also , there are versions for Go , C , JS , Rust and Kotlin listed here : https://github.com/mafintosh/flat-tree
Let 's try to serialize a binary tree , represented by lists into a flat vector .
First , we need to prepare a vector which size depends on the depth of the tree : ;;
Here is a tree : ;; / ;; * ;; + 15 100.0 ;; A B POFTHEDAY > ( defparameter * structure * '(/ (* (+ a b ) 15 ) 100.0 ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( defparameter * depth * ( rutils : tree - depth * structure * ) ) POFTHEDAY > * depth * 4 POFTHEDAY > ( defparameter * size * ( expt 2 * depth * ) ) POFTHEDAY > ( defparameter * data * ( make - array ( list ( expt 2 * depth * ) ) : initial - element nil ) ) #( NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL ) Missing nodes are filled with nils .
Flat - tree is not a data - structure ; it is an algorithm to calculate the tree node 's index in the flat vector .
That is why we need to write a function which will take lists forming a binary tree and dump it into the vector as a " flat - tree " : POFTHEDAY > ( defun fill - tree ( vector obj depth offset ) ( let ( ( index ( flat - tree : index depth offset ) ) ) ( cond ( ( listp obj ) ( setf ( aref vector index ) ( first obj ) ) ( fill - tree vector ( second obj ) ( 1- depth ) 0 ) ( fill - tree vector ( third obj ) ( 1- depth ) 1 ) ) ;;
If it is a symbol ( t ( setf ( aref vector index ) obj ) ) ) ) ( values vector obj ) )
There 's never been a better time to be a cheapskate .
Free utilities ?
We 've got 'em .
Want a full - fledged image editor ?
A few gigabytes of mail storage ?
How about an entire office software suite ?
We can top that , easy .
Take the whole earth and solar system .
Free !
If you thought that the golden age of free stuff ended when the dot - com bubble burst , guess again .
The past few years have seen an explosion of giveaways -- both Web - based services and free software -- that make the anemic home - page building apps and first - generation Web mail services of the late 1990s pale in comparison .
In part , we have the open - source movement to thank .
Initially the province of uber - geeks only ( think Linux ) , open - source projects have recently produced several outstanding consumer - oriented programs .
The Mozilla project has spawned not only a terrific browser ( Firefox ) but also an e-mail client , an HTML editor , and more .
Sun 's OpenOffice.org suite has finally matured , with Microsoft Office - compatible programs that are fully the equal of their commercial competitors .
And the list goes on .
The other developments putting smiles on the faces of the tightfisted are advertising - supported software and Web services .
As online advertising gathers momentum , it no longer seems so silly to give away endless gigabytes of hard - disk storage and server bandwidth , as free video - hosting services like Putfile and Revver are doing .
As a consumer , all you need is the willingness to put up with some banner ads while you watch the videos these services host .
Revver is so confident in its ability to make money from ads that it 's willing to share ad revenue with anyone who posts videos .
In the following pages , we uncover the best free software and services you can find .
These are the real deal -- no hobbled half - products or demos that time out after 30 days .

Some while ago I wrote about jux2 , a meta search engine which let you compare results across major engines .
It was a neat idea , and the site got some good reviews .
But as happens , jux2 ’s founders ’ attention wandered to other projects , and they could no longer keep the service running .
One of them , Aaref Hilaly , emailed me yesterday and informed me that he was still getting requests about the service , and he figured that someone might want to run it .
Now , if he was really smart , he ’d dress it up and try to sell it to Rupert Murdoch , but barring that , he ’s offering to the highest bidder on eBay .
Current price :
One cent .
“ There is no reserve , ” Aaref wrote me , “ so someone can get a bargain .
After all , given the times in which we live , should n’t everyone have their own search engine ? ”
Tom Ray had studied evolution in the real world , but found it a frustrating subject .
He wanted to be able to watch its effects on thousands of generations of organisms , evolving there in front of him .
Years before , an MIT computer hacker had introduced him to the idea of self - replicating computer code in a virtual machine .
He wondered if he might be able to build some kind of artificial life or a - life software , that would let him run experiments in evolution .
He built a computer program to model a virtual computer similar to the one in the Core Wars game , and called his virtual world Tierra .
However , Ray added a new feature to the virtual world that had been missing from Core Wars : mutation .
Computers are generally programmed in textual languages of words , symbols and numbers that humans can understand -- languages like C , Java and BASIC .
However , the integrated circuit at the heart of the machine only understands a much simpler language of binary numbers .
To add two numbers together , you might need to read them from memory into spaces called registers , add the two registers together , and then write the result out to memory again .
Each of those small steps would be represented by a series of binary numbers .
Your web browser software consists of millions of binary instructions .
They were assembled automatically by software called a compiler , following instructions written in the original programming language -- the " source code " .
It 's possible to write machine code directly , but only if the program is fairly small .
The programs in Core Wars and Tierra are only a few tens of bytes , maybe a couple of hundred at most , and are written in machine language .
Ray altered the Tierra system to simulate a computer with a slight flaw .
Every now and again , the machine code instruction which copied data between memory cells would randomly flip one of the bits during copying .
If the data being copied was the machine code of the program itself as it tried to reproduce , the result would be a slightly different mutant program .
High - end computers use special error - correcting memory , specifically to avoid bits getting flipped .
They do this because if you flip bits in the machine code of a piece of software , it will almost certainly crash .
Conventional wisdom before Tierra was that randomly flipping bits of a machine code program could never result in improvement to that program -- the chances against it were astronomical .
Like in the real world , Tierra had natural selection .
Mutant programs that crashed were eliminated as unfit .
In addition , a process called The Reaper would pick off the oldest programs to free up space -- meaning this new virtual world had death , as well .
Ray decided to start his Tierra system off with a population of the most simple programs possible .
He wrote a piece of code that simply copied itself elsewhere in memory then spawned the copy .
It was 80 bytes long , so he named it 80 .
He spread a few 80s through the Tierra system 's memory , and started the clock .
For the first few thousand generations , nothing much of interest happened .
There were a few minor mutations that did n't break the code , but that was about it .
Before long , though , there were a number of 81s - - mutants with an extra byte of program code .
A little later , a 79 appeared .
Because the 79 had one less byte of code , it took less time to reproduce , and was more successful than the 80 or 81 .
It began to take over the Tierra ecosystem .
Next , something astonishing happened .
A 45 appeared .
Ray was initially mystified ; he 'd written the simplest code he could imagine and it was 80 bytes .
A 79 seemed reasonable , but how could a 45 reproduce in only just over half the space ?
Examining the code of 45 provided the answer -- and a new surprise .
The 45 was a parasite : instead of reproducing itself , it hunted for the reproductive code of an 80 , then called that code .
It was almost like a biological virus , which reproduces by inserting its DNA into a host cell and using the cell 's reproductive apparatus to build more viruses .
No parasite code had been written at any stage in Tierra 's development , and the system had not been designed to support parasites ; the fact that one program could make use of code in another was an accident .
Yet the system had reproduction , death , natural selection and mutation , and that seemed to be enough to cause parasites to appear from nowhere .
Suddenly Tierra was an ecosystem in balance .
If there were too many 45s , then the 80s would die out , unable to compete ; and then the 45s would die out too , unable to reproduce without a host .
It turned out that the 79s were immune to the 45 parasite .
Ray placed some 45s in a Tierra world heavy with 79s , and soon a new 51 parasite appeared which was able to use 79s to reproduce .
If the system was left running long enough , parasites of parasites began to appear .
Then came another surprise : after a long period of mutation and natural selection , another new program appeared .
This was a 22 , and it was completely self - contained , not a parasite .
Somehow Tierra had evolved a program that was smaller than any human being had managed to come up with .
The power of evolution had been demonstrated , but Ray was curious to see which elements of the system were required for evolution to work , and what ranges of frequency of mutation resulted in rapid evolution .
He tried turning off mutation completely , out of curiosity -- and was amazed to find that evolution carried on happening anyway !
It turned out that sometimes , two programs attempting to reproduce would choose the same location for their offspring , and would interact during reproduction .
One of the programs might be overwriting the same memory as the other , slightly behind , and then die from old age or be killed by another program .
The result would be a hybrid , with part of the code of one program and part of the code of the other .
Similar hybrids would occur if a parasite was busy reproducing using a host program , and that host program died .
In sexual reproduction in the real world , the male and female genetic material from the two sets of chromosomes gets spliced together via recombination .
Now it seemed Tierra had recombination too ; and recombination alone , with no mutation , was enough to lead to evolution through natural selection .
Whereas Biomorphs were bred by changing the parameters of a fixed algorithm , Tierra 's equivalent of DNA described operations to perform .
Like real DNA , it could alter the processes at work within the organism , change how it reproduced , and have a direct result on its evolutionary fitness .
Tierra , unlike Biomorphs , did not need a human to guide it .

A survey of 223 senior executives and managers -- including tech leaders -- across several industries found that 63 % rely on " likability " and personality of a candidate when making hiring and promotion decisions , according to a new report by research firm NFI Research .
In fact , a candidate 's " skills " mattered slightly less than likability , at 62 % .
Apparently , personality is n't just what the managers and executives themselves focus on .
The survey found that 64 % of the respondents admitted that the likability of a candidate was also something that their companies or departments relied on when making hiring and promotion decisions .
" We were stunned , the idea that a person relies on personality and likability vs. delivering results and past performance in those decisions were shocking , " says NFI CEO Chuck Martin .
Well , being likable is n't exactly everything , but the other key factors are pretty closely related , says Martin .
Some 73 % said they base their hiring and promotion decisions on a candidate 's " likelihood to fit in " with the organization ; 70 % on how the interview with the candidate went ; and 69 % said a willingness to learn .
" People tend to want to hire other people who are like themselves , clones , someone they think will fit in with them , " says Martin .
What matters least to those hiring and promoting ?
Knowledge of the organization , which was cited by only 20 % ; diversity at 19 % ; and testing , at 15 %
So what does this mean to the stereotypical techie who is often labeled as lacking sparkle when it comes to people - skills ?
" Bring on the charm , " advises Martin .
Indeed , outside of the NFI survey 's findings , employers say that building a sustainable tech career today increasingly requires a mix of tech skills , business savvy , as well as customer - facing and communication skills , the latter two of which are often helped by a " likable personality , " Martin says .
ONE morning , about a year ago , a doctor told Steve Jobs that a cancerous tumour in his pancreas would kill him within months , and that it was time to start saying his goodbyes .
Later that night , an endoscopy revealed that the tumour could be cut out .
But for one day Mr Jobs , the boss of Apple Computer , as well as Pixar , the world 's most successful animation studio , stared death in the face .
The experience seems to have invigorated him .
Last week , gaunter but otherwise undiminished , he was on a stage in San Francisco , putting on a show ( for that is what Apple product launches are ) that was as flashy and dynamic as any as he has ever thrown .
When businessmen try to rub shoulders with pop stars , the effect is usually embarrassing .
But “ Steve ” had arranged to have his pal , Madonna , pop up on screen and kidded around with her with panache .
Does she have an iPod ?
Of course she has !
“ That 's so duh , ” said the superstar playfully .
Then Mr Jobs segued into his announcements — a new mobile phone from Motorola that has iTunes , Apple 's music software , pre-installed and that represents a beachhead into the world of phones ; and the “ iPod nano ” , a new digital music - player that is thinner than a pencil , but still holds 1,000 songs .
For Mr Jobs , the product launch seemed mainly to be an opportunity to drive home the message that his hold on downloaded and portable music now seems overwhelming .
iTunes sells 2 m songs a day and has a world market share of 82 % — Mr Jobs reckons that it is the world 's second - largest internet store , behind only Amazon .
And the iPod has a market share of 74 % , with 22 m sold .
For a man who helped launch the personal - computer era in 1976 with the Apple I , but then had to watch Microsoft 's Bill Gates walk away with , in effect , the monopoly on PC operating systems ( Apple 's market share in computers today is less than 3 % ) , this must be some vindication .
The odd thing about near - death experiences — literal or metaphorical — in Mr Jobs 's life is that he seems actually to need them sporadically in order to thrive .
Mr Jobs himself suggested as much when he addressed the graduating class at Stanford University in June .
Until he turned 30 in 1985 , Mr Jobs led a life that fits almost every Silicon Valley cliché .
He dropped out of college ( like Bill Gates and Michael Dell ) ; he started a company with a friend in a garage ( like everybody from Hewlett and Packard to the founders of Google ) ; he launched a revolution ( the PC era ) .
Big deal .
The interesting event occurred when he was 30 and got fired from his own company , after Apple 's board turned against him .
He was “ devastated ” .
His career seemed dead .
Characteristically , though , Mr Jobs bounced back , once he realised , as he said at Stanford , that “ the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again . ”
He did something uninterrupted success might have made impossible : he became more creative .
In 1986 he started two new companies , NeXT , a computer - maker that was always too far ahead of its time , and Pixar , an animation studio that went on to have a series of box - office hits .
A decade later , ironically enough , NeXT was bought by Apple , and Mr Jobs was brought back to run the company he had founded .
Mr Jobs , a pescatarian ( ie , a vegetarian who eats fish ) with a philosophical streak and a strong interest in the occult , interprets these reversals as lessons .
As befits a man who grew up in California in the 1960s , he proclaims his belief in karma and in love .
Not necessarily love of his employees , apparently — some of whom have found working for him a nightmare — but love of one 's ideals .
Always do only what you love , and never settle , he advised the students at Stanford .
His brush with cancer , in particular , seems to have focused his mind .
“ Death is very likely the single best invention in life , ” Mr Jobs told his young audience .
“ All external expectations , all pride , all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death , leaving only what is truly important . ”
Do not get the impression that Mr Jobs is now hugging strangers in random acts of kindness .
He is still testy , irascible and difficult ; he is still prepared to sue teenagers who publish Apple gossip on their websites for alleged abuses of trade secrets .
But the reminders of mortality have changed him .
“ He was already softened ” after his public humbling in 1985 , says Bruce Chizen , the boss of Adobe Systems , a software company that is a long - time partner of Apple's .
After the cancer , he says , “ he 's even softer ” and , Mr Chizen reckons , even more creative .
New toys on the way
Mr Jobs 's rivals may feel the same way .
The digerati in Silicon Valley , Redmond ( Microsoft ) , Tokyo ( Sony ) , Seoul ( Samsung ) and other places now simply take it for granted that Mr Jobs has a top - secret conveyor belt that will keep churning out best - selling wonders like the iPod .
What could these toys be ?
A portable video player is rumoured .
A new and cooler sort of television is possible .
A user - friendly and elegant mobile - phone handset would be nice , perhaps called something like “ iPhone ” .
Hollywood and music studios are also increasingly frightened .
The music studios , which barely took him seriously when he launched iTunes in 2001 , are sick of his power and are pressuring him to change his 99 - cents - per - song flat rate for music .
Slim chance .
Disney , a long - time partner of Pixar whom Mr Jobs broke with when he got tired of its former boss , is now trying to worm its way back into his favour .
In short , Mr Jobs currently seems vivacious by anybody 's standards .
There are even rumours that he might run for governor of California ( as a Democrat , presumably ; Al Gore is on Apple 's board ) .
For somebody famous in large part for a spectacular defeat — to Bill Gates and Microsoft — all this must feel like a new lease of life , in every respect .

Correction Appended
If the experts are right , some time this month , perhaps somewhere in the suburban South or West , a couple , most likely white Anglo - Saxon Protestants or Hispanic , will conceive a baby who , when born in October , will become the 300 millionth American .
As of yesterday , the Census Bureau officially pegged the resident population of the United States at closing in on 297,900,000 .
The bureau estimates that with a baby being born every 8 seconds , someone dying every 12 seconds and the nation gaining an immigrant every 31 seconds on average , the population is growing by one person every 14 seconds .
At that rate , the total is expected to top 300 million late this year .
But with those projections adjusted monthly and the number of births typically peaking during the summer , the benchmark is likely to be reached about nine months from now .
" You end up with a number in October , " said Katrina Wengert , a demographer and a keeper of the Census Bureau 's official Population Clock , getting about as specific as possible this far in advance in a field subject to chronic fudging and revising .
The clock is , itself , a contrivance , of course , but no more so than other pretexts for a wintertime sexual encounter .
Rest assured that hospital publicists , canny obstetricians , entrepreneurial chambers of commerce , baby food manufacturers , public officials and countless others pursuing some political social or personal agenda , abetted by the media , are already guesstimating the growth rate to anoint any number of unsuspecting newborns as the mythical American who pushed the nation 's population to 300 million .
My job can be so exciting .
I get to work with some of the brightest minds and most accomplished luminaries in technology , politics , and business .
I am consistently humbled and feel lucky for the opportunities I get .
That said , of all the folks with whom I have interacted in the last couple of years , almost no one has impressed me more than MC Hammer .
Yeah , that 's right , MC Hammer .
I recently invited Hammer to Google to check the place out and meet some folks .
The guy has opinions on everything , but particularly likes to think about how broken the music industry is today from the perspective of the artist .
It did n't surprise me that he had he head around that space , considering he has been in the business for years .
Yet , I will admit to initially underestimating Hammer as a technologist .
As we spoke it became clear that from WiFi , to video compression , to secure payment systems , Hammer is a geek , and a well - informed one at that .
As we walked across the Google campus , Hammer told me he had been there years ago when it belonged to SGI .
Back then , he visited to better understand how his videos could be viewed by fans on the Internet .
Rather than rely on just reading about streaming video , he wanted to go to the source and get the scoop firsthand .
Anyway , the visit was a blast .
While moving through our building and cafeteria , Hammer attracted more handshakes and autograph requests than most world leaders who visit .
We had lunch with 15 or so Googlers and Hammer held court .
They were rapt with attention for over an hour .
Bottom line , five things worth noting about Hammer :
1 ) Hammer is a man of action - During lunch , we were talking about Blogger .
Hammer told us he wanted to learn more about this and understand how to set one up .
I told him I could put together a meeting next week , blah blah .
Without hesitation he said " Why not now ? " I was caught off guard .
Have I become the slow bureaucrat that pushes off meetings until next week ?
Yikes .
I cancelled my next appointment and took Hammer immediately to Blogger HQ where Case and Goldman put together a sweet blog for him and linked it to his T - Mobile Sidekick .
( blog url coming soon )
2 ) The world loves Hammer - As we walked around the Googleplex , it was amazing how many international Googlers recognized him and came up to say hi and give him props .
Asians , Africans , Europeans .
They were all excited to see Hammer .
3 ) Young people dig Hammer - I was suprised to see how young a lot of his fans were .
I mean , many of the adoring masses were 22 or 23 years old .
That means those kids were 7 or 8 years old when " U Can't Touch This " was hot .
I asked a few of them what the deal was .
Did they remember Hammer from back in the day ?
A few claimed to .
However , most told me that Hammer was all about the 80s , and the 80s are back .
4 ) Hammer is a master marketer - He has a new album in hand .
( We heard some tracks .
It 's hot .
Very well produced . )
Following his trademark style , the hooks to his tunes are very catchy and easily repeatable even by the most soulfully challenged .
On top of that , Hammer has a few new dances up his sleeves .
Hopefully , he will unleash them soon so we can all clue in before holiday party season is upon us .
Either way , I predict good things for this album .
5 ) Hammer is a nice guy -
No matter how many times people interrupted for a photo or to ask him to sign something , Hammer was beyond cordial and went out of his way to make them happy .
It was amazing how polite and cheery he was with everyone .
So cool .
The man is too legit .

UPDATE : Hammer is easily the coolest blogger I know .
Check his stuff out here : http://mchammer.blogspot.com/.
His voice is so sincere , he posts regularly , he interacts with his commenters , he even leaves audioposts .
So awesome .
Way to be , Hammer !
RFID tags are useful for a huge variety of applications .
Some of these applications include : supply chain management , automated payment , physical access control , counterfeit prevention , airline baggage management , and smart homes and offices .
RFID tags are also implanted in all kinds of personal and consumer goods , for example , passports , partially assembled cars , frozen dinners , ski-lift passes , clothing , EZ - Pass toll collection devices , and public transportation tickets .
Implantable RFID tags for animals allow concerned owners to label their pets and livestock .
Verichip Corp. has also created a slightly adapted implantable RFID chip , the size of a grain of rice , for use in humans .
Since its introduction , the Verichip was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , and this tiny chip is currently deployed in both commercial and medical systems .
A great deal of information is available on RFID technology .
Some introductory Web pages are listed here .
Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) is the latest phase in the decades - old trend of the miniaturization of computers .
RFID transponders are tiny resource - limited computers that do not have a battery that needs periodic replacement .
RFID tags are inductively powered by their external reading devices , called RFID readers .
Once the RFID tag is activated , the tag decodes the incoming query and produces an appropriate response by using the energy of the incoming radio wave to power the chip long enough to respond .
RFID tags can do a limited amount of processing , and have a small amount ( < 1024 bits ) of storage .

All wars are about the same thing .
The new way vs. the old way .
Now in New Orleans , the city where I 'm from , we very much dig the old way .
We were the last city to raise the drinking age to 21 .
We still have second line parades which ramble through the city every weekend .
4 years ago , when Ray Nagin ran for Mayor , he was the outsider .
He was going to modernize the city .
Put things online .
Run the city like a business .
Nobody knew who he was .
He was some cable executive who had made some money and was coming back to give to his city .
He energized middle class folks like my wife and I .
We loved the city but most business was done on a " who you know " basis .
The traditions which made the city such a unique place were the same things which were holding it back .
Nagin was a breath of fresh air to some of us because though he was born , raised in and obviously loved the city , he was n't tied to any political party .
He put up his own money to run .
He loved the city that much .
All the real political people ( In both parties ) hated him .
My wife and I were some of his first volunteers .
We watched him piss off the old school democrats and the new school republicans .
I did n't agree with everything he said ( The idea of running government like a business is one of the dumbest memes to ever catch on in the history of politics .
but I digress … ) but he had a vision and understood the traditions of the city .
He won the election because he was able to get middle class folks , both black and white to join in his crusade to update the city .
Nagin received a majority of both black and white voters , an uncommon occurrence in New Orleans .
Before Katrina , Nagin would have probably won in a landslide .
He was making moves .
After Katrina , the old way thought they had a chance to get back in .
Nagin 's opponent in the runoff is a nice guy .
( I 'm a big supporter of his sister )
But he was very much tied to the old way of doing things .
He just wore a new suit .
His dad was the last white mayor of the city and he had served in the legislature for a long time .
Landreiu was qualified but , in my eyes , had been around the old way of doing things for his entire life .
Electing him would have been a step backwards to the corruption and graft which has been holding the city back for years .
I think that 's one of the reasons Nagin won .
And I 'll tell give you another reason :
During Katrina Nagin got on the radio and cursed out the federal governments response to what was happening in the city .
He call for " moratorium on press conferences " .
He did n't care about politics and the long range ramifications .
He just honestly spoke the feelings of most of the residents of the city .
Instead of sounding and thinking like a politician , he sounded and spoke like a man who had watched his city destroyed and was angry with the government 's response .
And is n't that what you want a mayor to do : represent you ?

Seen above is a topographic map made by the author , from Venera and Magellan altimetry data .
It shows the continent - sized highlands of Ishtar Terra , near the north pole of Venus .
Venus From Space
In 1965 , Venera - 2 made the first attempt to photograph Venus from space .
It probably did so , but the final telemetry contact to download its experimental data was never established .
After that , the only Soviet cameras to study Venus from space were on the first artificial satellites of Venus , Venera - 9 and 10 .
They did long - term high resolution cloud - dynamics studies , combined with linear photometric and spectrometric measurements .
The results of that analysis and a few pictures have been published , but the original data has never been seen by westerners .
linear camera was similar to the Venera - 9 lander 's cycloramic camera , but with twice the resolution .
The best images of Venus ever taken were by Mariner - 10 in 1973 , during its gravity - assist flyby on the way to Mercury .
Galileo also photographed the planet during a flyby , and low - resolution cloud scans were taken over a long period of time by Pioneer - 12 .
Surprisingly , images of Venus taken from space are almost never colored or tone mapped accurately .
Close to the Sun and reflecting 70 % of its light , Venus would be a dazzling sight to the naked eye , with subtle yellowish patterns and two white polar collars .
Patterns of circulating currents are most visible at violet and ultraviolet wavelengths .
If a spectrum is known , an accurate color value can be computed .
This is accomplished by converting to CIE XYZ and then into standard sRGB which modern monitors are designed to display correctly .
On the left is the spectrum of Venus as seen from space , measured by the Cassini probe .
On the right is the spectrum of the zenith sky , measured by V.I. Moroz from the Venera 11 lander .
Wavelengths plotted are 360 to 830 nm .
Full spectral data is rarely available , and instead we must use views through color filters .
Above , the Galileo probe captured Venus through a clear filter ( left ) and through a 410 nm violet filter , which reveals the subtle yellow and white clouds .
Unfortunately , many different color images could result in the same two clear and violet signals above .
Even when so - called red , green and blue filters are used , the problem is just as difficult , because the filters are not really the right red green and blue to just plug into the channels of a color display .
Theoretically , information from the two images above and from the Cassini spectrum could be combined using Bayesian decision theory , to compute the most probable color image .
If colors are estimated correctly , there is a final issue of tone mapping .
How bright does the image appear to the eye in a given context .
The image above is the best color image of Venus I 've found , showing the planet as it would likely appear to a human observer in space .
It was made by Turkish astronomer A. Tayfun Oner , using the two color channels from the Galileo camera , and a third interpolated channel .
The images above , by the talented amateur astronomer Damian Peach , show the appearance of Venus through a high - quality telescope , at various points in its orbit .
When Venus is close , its diameter is almost visible to the naked eye ( one minute of arc ) , but it is then lit from behind .

When Natascha Kampusch was last seen on her way to school in a run-down housing estate on the outskirts of Vienna in 1998 , she was a four - foot - nine 10 - year - old with light brown hair and blue eyes squinting behind blue and yellow glasses .
But now the focus of Austria 's most enduring child abduction mystery appears to have emerged as a pale and shaken 18 - year - old after years of captivity in the cellar of a house less than 10 miles from where she disappeared .
Local media reports claim she was held captive by a man named as Wolfgang Priklopil , a communications technician who committed suicide last night by throwing himself in front of a train while on the run from the police .
The discovery has stunned the nation , and left Ms Kampusch 's father , Ludwig , choking back disbelief .
" I really hope this is really true , " he said on Austrian television .
" I 'm betting God this has really happened . "
Police said she was in good health despite apparently spending eight years locked in a room described as either a sealed cellar or garage .
" She is white - pale , looking as if she had been out of the light of day for a long time , but she articulated well and could read and write , " said a police investigator , according to Austria Presse Agentur .
Police said she had spent the night in a secure location with a female police psychologist and had eaten breakfast this morning .
Ms Kampusch said her captor allowed her occasional walks with him in the neighbourhood and access to radio , television , newspapers and books , and the garage was equipped with a bed and wardrobe , according to police and local media .
She turned up on Wednesday in a garden close to the house where she is thought to have been kept in the town of Strasshof , just outside Vienna .
Her home in the postwar Danube estate is less than 10 miles away , on the Austrian capital 's eastern fringe .
Austrian television said an 80 - year - old man discovered her .
She was running , screaming and in a state of panic .
The discovery sparked a major manhunt but Priklopil escaped in a red sports car that was found abandoned in a Vienna car park yesterday .
Officers said the captor was 44 years old and showed a picture of a strong - jawed man with a short brown fringe .
They said they were proceeding cautiously in their search of his house due to claims that it may have been booby - trapped with explosives .
Lead investigator Nikolaus Koch told Austrian television that the police had contacted Priklopil about three months after Ms Kampusch disappeared but that he had a " sturdy alibi " at the time .
His neighbours had told police that he was unsociable and kept himself to himself .
Forensics experts are still awaiting the results of a DNA test to confirm the abducted woman 's identity but said that an operation scar on her arm was identical to one Ms Kampusch had , and that they were " quite sure " it was her .
Her passport had been found in Piklopil 's house and her father , mother and half - sister had all identified her , police said .
Her sister Sabina Sirny told Austrian television that their mother had broken down when she was told of the discovery on Wednesday .
" She always said [ Natascha ] was still alive , " she said .
Despite Austrian media reports that she had been kept as a sex slave a police medical examination showed no signs of injury or sexual abuse .
However , police suggested that she may have become resigned to her captivity due to Stockholm syndrome , a condition that sometimes causes kidnapped people to sympathise with their abductors .
Ms Kampusch 's abduction at 7 am on March 2 1998 dominated local headlines for years , coming amid revelations about the series of rapes and murders carried out by Belgian paedophile Marc Dutroux .
The search for her spread across Austria and neighbouring Hungary and claims from witnesses that Ms Kampusch had been seen getting into a white van led prosecutors to investigate possible links with French mass - murderer Michel Fourniret , who was also reported to have used a white van in some of his attacks .
Most had given her up for dead .
In March , an Austrian parliamentarian petitioned public prosecutors to dig up a pond in the town of Gänserndorf , citing claims that Ms Kampusch 's body may have been buried there .

Pocket bongs , digital scales , herb grinders and exotic shamanic plants .
The shelves of King Bong in Bournemouth are packed with all the discerning drug user could possibly want .
There are brightly packaged pills such as " Yellow Veg - E's " , " vegetarian blissed - out dance capsules " , and the citrus - flavoured Lime - Fantazias which promise " euphoric sensations " all night .
And all of it entirely legal .
King Bong is one of some 200 " headshops " in the high street .
Most major towns and cities now have a resident drug emporium , selling raver toys , cannabis accessories , and a selection of legal , mind - altering drugs .
Along with several large - scale websites , they form a lucrative " legal highs " industry which markets exotic mind - changing plants and chemicals to a growing audience of drug users looking for alternatives to illegal substances .
Demand for such legal highs has never been higher .
" Business is on the up , " says King Bong 's owner , Tony Rotherham , who has run headshops for 12 years .
" We 're getting all sorts in here .
Hippies , clubbers , students , housewives , even slimmers looking for appetite suppressants . "
It was the boom in sales of magic mushrooms that kickstarted the industry .
A legal loophole led to a proliferation of vendors .
The mushrooms ' reliable and mostly benevolent psychedelic effects changed public perception of legal highs .
" Mushrooms opened people 's mind to the possibility you could go into a shop and get a legal high that had an effect , " he says .
When the loophole closed in July , vendors filled the void .
" We 've got a lot of new good products coming in , " Mr Rotherham says .
Some 20 new , effective drugs have emerged in the last year .
A hotchpotch of shamanic plants , synthetic stimulants , and psychedelic cacti , most imported from the Netherlands , New Zealand and India , are repackaged and sold across the UK .
An intoxicant plant from Thailand called Kratom is a big seller and dubbed the " herbal speedball " due its apparent euphoric effects .
Also selling well is a new breed of ecstasy - like drugs , marketed as " p.e.p pills " .
They contain piperazines , stimulant chemicals from the same chemical family as Viagra .
Magic mushroom sellers have switched to selling another mushroom , not yet outlawed : the red-and - white spotted Fly Agaric toadstool , which contains the psychoactive chemicals muscimol and ibotenic acid which can trigger delirious , dream - like states .
Thanks to the effectiveness of these legal highs and the large customer base created by the mushroom boom , the trade is booming in shops and on the web , with shoppers exploiting secure credit card orders and 24 - hour websites .
" Loads of people are getting into it , " says Mark Evans , owner of EveryOneDoesIt.com , the UK 's biggest online headshop .
" At the click of a button you can have whatever you want next day , at your home or in your office . "
His site boasts more than 5,000 products and many types of drugs : stimulant , visionary , relaxant , aphrodisiac .
Customers can give star ratings and post Amazon - style reviews .
The web ensures word of mouth spreads quickly .
Highs that do n't work or have negative side - effects quickly disappear from sale .
It is proving a lucrative international business .
" We 're selling to thousands of customers a week all over Europe and north America , " Mr Evans says .
" There 's a lot of money in the industry right now . "
His company claims a £ 2 m a year turnover , with the estimated worth of the UK industry put at £ 10 m .
While the majority of the new drugs remain unscheduled under the Misuse of Drugs Act , retailers are careful not to encourage any illegal activity or directly promote products as drugs .
Cannabis seeds are often sold as " souvenirs " .
Bottles of inhalant amyl nitrite or " poppers " are advertised as " room odourisers " .
Bongs ( a water pipe used for smoking cannabis ) are labelled for " legal smoking mixes only " .
However , some of the plant - based highs have a quasi-legal status because they contain naturally occurring illegal drugs .
The San Pedro cactus contains the outlawed psychedelic substance mescaline .
Magic mushrooms , too , contain a class A drug , psilocybin , and were banned .
Says Katy Swaine , head of legal services at drugs advice charity Release : " The circumstances in which it is illegal to possess or supply the plant are ambiguous . "
But the authorities seem unconcerned .
" We 've only had the police in here once in 12 years , " says Mr Rotherham .
" The local beat officer came in after someone from a local mental health institute bought some herbal highs .
He asked us not to sell to anyone from there .
So we did n't . "
Retailers say legal highs are safer than illicit drugs , which are often either adulterated or dangerously powerful .
In contrast , many legal highs have a history of human use dating back thousands of years .
Plant preparations such as the psychedelic Amazonian brew , ayahuasca , or Yopo Seeds , which contain the hallucinogen DMT ( dimethyltryptamine ) , are used as sacraments in some shamanic ceremonies , with vomiting and loss of bowel control common .
Some have moved to ban some legal highs as their use has increased , creating a patchwork of inconsistent legislation .
The potent psychedelic herb , Salvia Divinorum is banned in Australia and Italy but legal elsewhere .
" Governments tend to respond to very visible problems or public health scares , " says Ms Swaine .
" If there was an explosion in the use or supply of a particular substance , as with magic mushroom , they might take steps . "
Mark Evans , of EveryOneDoesIt.com , says : " The government know we 're here .
We pay 40 % tax plus 1 % for national insurance ...
I 'm sure they do very well out of the headshop industry . "

Honda prints phone sex number in 1.2 million car manuals
Honda this week said it misprinted a toll - free auto - safety phone number in 1.2 million car manuals for the 2006 model year .
Instead of an ' 888 ' prefix , Honda printed an ' 800 . '
And customers who attempted to use the phone number did n't get just any service .
They were greeted by a phone sex line -- " for live one - on - one talk with a hot fantasy girl . "
In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , Honda said it would send postcards to owners and dealers with the correction .
Evolution is a Fact and a Theory by Laurence Moran Copyright © 1993- 2002 [ Last Update : January 22 , 1993 ]
hen non-biologists talk about biological evolution they often confuse two different aspects of the definition .
On the one hand there is the question of whether or not modern organisms have evolved from older ancestral organisms or whether modern species are continuing to change over time .
On the other hand there are questions about the mechanism of the observed changes ... how did evolution occur ?
Biologists consider the existence of biological evolution to be a fact .
It can be demonstrated today and the historical evidence for its occurrence in the past is overwhelming .
However , biologists readily admit that they are less certain of the exact mechanism of evolution ; there are several theories of the mechanism of evolution .
Stephen J. Gould has put this as well as anyone else :
In the American vernacular , " theory " often means " imperfect fact " -- part of a hierarchy of confidence running downhill from fact to theory to hypothesis to guess .
Thus the power of the creationist argument : evolution is " only " a theory and intense debate now rages about many aspects of the theory .
If evolution is worse than a fact , and scientists can't even make up their minds about the theory , then what confidence can we have in it ?
Indeed , President Reagan echoed this argument before an evangelical group in Dallas when he said ( in what I devoutly hope was campaign rhetoric ) : " Well , it is a theory .
It is a scientific theory only , and it has in recent years been challenged in the world of science -- that is , not believed in the scientific community to be as infallible as it once was . "
Well evolution is a theory .
It is also a fact .
And facts and theories are different things , not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty .
Facts are the world 's data .
Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts .
Facts do n't go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them .
Einstein 's theory of gravitation replaced Newton 's in this century , but apples did n't suspend themselves in midair , pending the outcome .
And humans evolved from ape - like ancestors whether they did so by Darwin 's proposed mechanism or by some other yet to be discovered .
Moreover , " fact " does n't mean " absolute certainty " ; there ain't no such animal in an exciting and complex world .
The final proofs of logic and mathematics flow deductively from stated premises and achieve certainty only because they are not about the empirical world .
Evolutionists make no claim for perpetual truth , though creationists often do ( and then attack us falsely for a style of argument that they themselves favor ) .
In science " fact " can only mean " confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional consent . "
I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow , but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms .
Evolutionists have been very clear about this distinction of fact and theory from the very beginning , if only because we have always acknowledged how far we are from completely understanding the mechanisms ( theory ) by which evolution ( fact ) occurred .
Darwin continually emphasized the difference between his two great and separate accomplishments : establishing the fact of evolution , and proposing a theory - - natural selection -- to explain the mechanism of evolution .
- Stephen J. Gould , " Evolution as Fact and Theory " ; Discover , May 1981
Let me try to make crystal clear what is established beyond reasonable doubt , and what needs further study , about evolution .
Evolution as a process that has always gone on in the history of the earth can be doubted only by those who are ignorant of the evidence or are resistant to evidence , owing to emotional blocks or to plain bigotry .
By contrast , the mechanisms that bring evolution about certainly need study and clarification .
There are no alternatives to evolution as history that can withstand critical examination .
Yet we are constantly learning new and important facts about evolutionary mechanisms .
- Theodosius Dobzhansky " Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution " , American Biology Teacher vol. 35 ( March 1973 ) reprinted in Evolution versus Creationism , J. Peter Zetterberg ed. , ORYX Press , Phoenix AZ 1983
It is time for students of the evolutionary process , especially those who have been misquoted and used by the creationists , to state clearly that evolution is a fact , not theory , and that what is at issue within biology are questions of details of the process and the relative importance of different mechanisms of evolution .
It is a fact that the earth with liquid water , is more than 3.6 billion years old .
It is a fact that cellular life has been around for at least half of that period and that organized multicellular life is at least 800 million years old .
It is a fact that major life forms now on earth were not at all represented in the past .
There were no birds or mammals 250 million years ago .
It is a fact that major life forms of the past are no longer living .
There used to be dinosaurs and Pithecanthropus , and there are none now .
It is a fact that all living forms come from previous living forms .
Therefore , all present forms of life arose from ancestral forms that were different .
Birds arose from nonbirds and humans from nonhumans .
No person who pretends to any understanding of the natural world can deny these facts any more than she or he can deny that the earth is round , rotates on its axis , and revolves around the sun .
The controversies about evolution lie in the realm of the relative importance of various forces in molding evolution .
- R. C. Lewontin " Evolution / Creation Debate : A Time for Truth " Bioscience 31 , 559 ( 1981 ) reprinted in Evolution versus Creationism , op cit .
Today , nearly all biologists acknowledge that evolution is a fact .
The term theory is no longer appropriate except when referring to the various models that attempt to explain how life evolves ... it is important to understand that the current questions about how life evolves in no way implies any disagreement over the fact of evolution .
- Neil A. Campbell , Biology 2nd ed. , 1990 , Benjamin / Cummings , p. 434
Since Darwin's time , massive additional evidence has accumulated supporting the fact of evolution -- that all living organisms present on earth today have arisen from earlier forms in the course of earth 's long history .
Indeed , all of modern biology is an affirmation of this relatedness of the many species of living things and of their gradual divergence from one another over the course of time .
Since the publication of The Origin of Species , the important question , scientifically speaking , about evolution has not been whether it has taken place .
That is no longer an issue among the vast majority of modern biologists .
Today , the central and still fascinating questions for biologists concern the mechanisms by which evolution occurs .
- Helena Curtis and N. Sue Barnes , Biology 5th ed. 1989 , Worth Publishers , p. 972
A few words need to be said about the " theory of evolution , " which most people take to mean the proposition that organisms have evolved from common ancestors .
In everyday speech , " theory " often means a hypothesis or even a mere speculation .
But in science , " theory " means " a statement of what are held to be the general laws , principles , or causes of something known or observed . " as the Oxford English Dictionary defines it .
The theory of evolution is a body of interconnected statements about natural selection and the other processes that are thought to cause evolution , just as the atomic theory of chemistry and the Newtonian theory of mechanics are bodies of statements that describe causes of chemical and physical phenomena .
In contrast , the statement that organisms have descended with modifications from common ancestors -- the historical reality of evolution -- is not a theory .
It is a fact , as fully as the fact of the earth 's revolution about the sun .
Like the heliocentric solar system , evolution began as a hypothesis , and achieved " facthood " as the evidence in its favor became so strong that no knowledgeable and unbiased person could deny its reality .
No biologist today would think of submitting a paper entitled " New evidence for evolution ; " it simply has not been an issue for a century .
- Douglas J. Futuyma , Evolutionary Biology , 2nd ed. , 1986 , Sinauer Associates , p. 15
There are some readers who are not anti-evolutionist but still claim that evolution is " only " a theory which can't be proven .
This group needs to distinguish between the fact that evolution occurs and the theory of the mechanism of evolution .
We also need to distinguish between facts that are easy to demonstrate and those that are more circumstantial .
Examples of evolution that are readily apparent include the fact that modern populations are evolving and the fact that two closely related species share a common ancestor .
The evidence that Homo sapiens and chimpanzees share a recent common ancestor falls into this category .
There is so much evidence in support of this aspect of primate evolution that it qualifies as a fact by any common definition of the word " fact . "
In other cases the available evidence is less strong .
For example , the relationships of some of the major phyla are still being worked out .
Also , the statement that all organisms have descended from a single common ancestor is strongly supported by the available evidence , and there is no opposing evidence .
However , it is not yet appropriate to call this a " fact " since there are reasonable alternatives .
Finally , there is an epistemological argument against evolution as fact .
Some readers of these newsgroups point out that nothing in science can ever be " proven " and this includes evolution .
According to this argument , the probability that evolution is the correct explanation of life as we know it may approach 99.9999 ...9 % but it will never be 100 % .
Thus evolution cannot be a fact .
This kind of argument might be appropriate in a philosophy class ( it is essentially correct ) but it wo n't do in the real world .
A " fact , " as Stephen J. Gould pointed out ( see above ) , means something that is so highly probable that it would be silly not to accept it .
This point has also been made by others who contest the nit-picking epistemologists .

A beautiful circle of pale blue , it looks like an exotic pool where travellers could take a dip .
But do n't even think about packing your swimming gear and heading there .
For this is a patch of ice sitting on the floor of a crater near the north pole of Mars .
The picture was taken by the high - resolution stereo camera on board the European Space Agency probe Mars Express .
Water
Scientists obtained definitive proof of water on Mars more than 18 months ago and since then have produced pictures of varying quality .
This is the most spectacular image to date .
The impact crater is located on Vastitas Borealis , a broad plain that covers much of the far northern Martian latitudes .
It is 21.7 miles wide and has a maximum depth of about 1.2 miles .
The circular patch of frozen water is present all year round .
Faint traces of ice are also visible along the rim of the crater and the crater walls .
A large dune field is thought to lie beneath the ice layer , some of which is exposed at the edge of the bright patch .
The existence of large bodies of water on Mars does not necessarily mean there was , or is , life there .
But it makes it much more likely , although any such life is likely to be confined to primitive micro-organisms .
How not to
comment code
After I graduated from college , I went to Blue Sky Productions ( currently Looking Glass Studios ) and worked on this game , Ultima Underworld .
My main programming task was writing all the AI code .
It was kind of hairy , and there was this one hairy part in particular -- I think it was where all the monsters would get together while you were sleeping and vote on what they thought of you -- anyway , it had lots of special cases and weird logic , and after I had written it I could n't put it behind me fast enough .
Six months later , I realize that I 'm going to have to muck with this code .
" Man , " I say to myself , " I sure hope that I commented this code well when I originally wrote it . "
So , with trepidation , I open up the file and look at the function in question , and there is exactly one comment in it , at the very top , and it says : /* HA HA HA */
In recent years , the Internet of Things ( IoT ) has become a hot topic and continues to drive digital transformation for various business sectors .
The IoT device itself will run optimally on the 5G network .
However , considering the number of IoT devices that a company will deploy , good integration is needed so that its functions run smoothly , including from the network side .
To address the growing needs in terms of IoT network traffic which will become increasingly dense , companies need to increase network coverage such as using software or SD - WAN as a pragmatic approach .
How does SD - WAN play a role in IoT Infrastructure Development ?
SD - WAN solutions are an evolution of a wide - ranging network .
SD - WAN supports applications hosted in multiple locations over all network types and service provider connection types .
Here are 3 benefits of SD - WAN in building IoT infrastructure :
1. Security
Data security issues are of course a major concern in business due to the proliferation of cyberattacks .
The study by research firm Ovum emphasizes the importance for companies to upgrade their security infrastructure to meet IoT demands , which involves securing end - to - end traffic so that data is protected from cyber threats .

Networking manufacturer D- Link has settled a dispute with a Danish administrator Poul - Henning Kamp over the way its kit queries internet time servers .
Critics claim the way D - link equipment polls NTP ( Network Time Protocol ) servers is impairing their operations , leaving operators to carry unsustainable excess bandwidth charges .
NTP servers handle a variety of functions including , for example , helping create a record of the timing of eBay bids .
The dispute between D - Link and self - confessed " time geek " Poul - Henning Kamp over the issue went public in April after Kamp wrote an open letter to D - Link prompted by his frustrations in attempting to get the firm to acknowledge that a misconfigured implementation of NTP on its kit left him staring at a bill of around $ 8,800 a year .
D- Link products worldwide query a small NTP server located at the Danish Internet Exchange , intended to service only 2,000 or so organisations in the country , which is being maintained by Kamp .
Kamp reckons that between 75 and 90 per cent of the traffic hitting his servers comes from D - Link devices .
Growing costs forced Kamp to consider abandoning his time - keeping service .
The address of Kamp 's NTP server - which is run on a non-profit basis and allocated only minimal bandwidth resources - was hardwired into the firmware in various D - link products .
A more flexible approach would have seen the products reconfigured remotely and redirected to a more appropriate NTP server .
D- Link is freeloading onto as many as 50 NTP time servers , critics claim .
The US military , NASA and government groups worldwide are reportedly running NTP servers interrogated by D - Link kit .
Cambridge University security expert Richard Clayton , the man who tracked back the source of unwanted international traffic sent to Kamp 's Danish NTP server to D - Link kit , reckons D - Link would rack up $ 1,000 a month in bandwidth charges if it ran those time servers itself .
Instead of acknowledging that it might have made an error , D - Link first hid behind its lawyers .
D- Link 's attorneys demanded that disgruntled punters submit to Californian law .
A month later , reason has begun to prevail and an " amicable " settlement has been forged between D - Link and Kamp .
D- Link has agreed to take steps to reduce the impact of the problem .
It 's unclear if D - Link also agreed to cover Kamp 's excess costs , as he originally requested .
Kamp was unavailable for comment at the time of going to press but a statement on his website does go some way towards explaining the terms of the settlement : " D - Link and Poul - Henning Kamp announced today that they have amicably resolved their dispute regarding access to Kamp's GPS .
Dix.dk NTP
Time Server site .
D- Link 's existing products will have authorised access to Kamp 's server , but all new D - Link products will not use the GPS .

" D- Link is dedicated to remaining a good corporate and network citizen , " the statement adds . ®

You 're right about that .
And it pisses me off when someone shits on Christianity but celebrates Christian holidays , but I can't stop them , and in this country it 's perfectly okay to do this .

I 'm sure Kate is just looking for excuses as to why she wo n't cut her kid's hair .
I 'm sure citing religious reasons sounds better in her mind than , " I really like his hair and think it'd be a shame to cut it . "

Justice can sometimes be poetic : the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , which has sued 14,800 people for using peer - to - peer networks , is itself being sued .
An Oregon woman is using anti-gangster RICO laws to countersue the organisation which spends its time suing individual file sharers .
She denies ever having downloaded or distributed music and accuses the organisation of trespass - by secretly snooping into her computer .
According to documents filed with the Oregon court Tanya Andersen , a 42 - year old single mother , was accused of downloading gangster rap at 4.24 am using the user name gotenkito .
The document notes : " Ms Andersen does not like ' gangster rap ' music , does not recognise the name ' gotenkito ' , is not awake at 4.24 am and has never downloaded music . "
Ms Andersen was told she could settle with the RIAA or face expensive legal action .
Count 8 of the document accuses the RIAA of breach of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisation ( RICO ) laws .
The document says : " The record companies directed its agents to unlawfully break into private computers and engage in extreme acts of unlawful coercion , extortion , fraud , and other criminal conduct .
The record companies and their agents stood to financially benefit from these deceptive and unlawful acts . "
The RIAA was sued under the same gangster laws last year .
Unfortunately for the plaintiffs , RICO requires the explicit threat or use of physical violence .
Bootnote :
An ongoing antitrust suit against the RIAA filed by grassroots webcasters needs your help . ®
My recent post on how not to manage geeks has sparked a lot of interest and a lot of great comments .
Right now there ’s a very interesting debate going on in the comments about the need for structure in small or large organizations .
This debate is great because it goes right to the core of the central dilemma of new leadership and employee empowerment .
Here are some of the key arguments that have come up :
Elling writes : I think you re attacking structures which you can do without in a small company …
In a large company theres a NEED for the structures …
Jeremy writes : I can anticipate some of this need – the need to account for diverse costs accurately and thoroughly , the need to maintain a standard of output for workers in an organized , fair fashion , etc. – but these play to the weaknesses of large organizations .
In other words , large organizations SHOULD be at a disadvantage , and the structures were proposing tearing out actually add value only in the sense that MegaCorp is inherently inefficient and out of scale with the market .
Numeeja writes : … there is NEVER a  NEED  for self - serving , personal progression over departmental improvement  style work places and managers .
Thad writes :
The place where I work is managed by good people who dont want to be bureaucratic jerks , but they cant grasp one simple concept : they are giving me money in exchange for doing something I love they dont have to shackle me with schedules and policies to get me to produce !
I will be here working my little heart out because * I want to be * .
I try to block out the memos and TPS reports and remind myself that those things arent really changing what I get to do here , but damn , every time the red tape is thrust in my face it just deflates me and I dont even feel like trying to design or build something .
Elling writes :
If you have 20 people which you want to pull in the same direction , you NEED to have a manager whos job it will be to try and ensure that the people in the group DO pull in the same direction …
On the other hand , I do realize that there ARE idiot - bastard - managers out there .
And I m not defending them .
Cityzenjane writes : … small tech teams in my experience – when left to their own devices do a GREAT job of pulling in the same direction , getting behind technical strategic priorities that they have been part of developing .
First let me say thanks to all who ’ve commented .
THIS is what blogging is all about – one post sparking many great contributions .
I feel lucky to be hosting this dialogue .
But which is it ?
Do companies need structure or do n’t they ?
Is less management better than more management ?
Is management a necessary evil or simply evil ? :o )
Niels Bohr , the Nobel Prize - winning physicist once said :
The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement .
But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth
and that ’s exactly what I think we ’re dealing with here .
Whenever I ’m faced with one of these either - or questions , I try to loook beyond the immediate choice , to see if there might exist an answer that transcends the dilemma and includes both .
Can we have both personal freedom and structure at work ?
The answer is not only that it can be done , but that many highly succesful companies are actively doing it .
The truth is that there needs to be structure for personal freedom to even be possible .
But we are talking a different kind of structure .
Where the “ old ” structures are often opaque , rigid and top - down we can instead create new structures that are the exact opposite but perform the same function of coordinating and streamlining people ’s efforts .
These new structures are transparent , dynamic and participatory .
Companies that have done this include business school case classics like Semco , Oticon , Southwest Airlines and GE Aviation .
None of them are doing too shabby ( understatement alert ) , and people are really happy at work there .
Herb Kelleher , ex-CEO of Southwest , was once asked how he could maintain control when his employees had so much freedom .
His answer is classic :
Control ?
Never had it .
Do n’t want it .
I think we can move forward most efficiently if we shift away from choosing between freedom and structure , and work from the assimption that it ’s about choosing both and thus creating a new kind of structure .
Let me hit you with one last Niels Bohr quote ( Yes I ’m a fan , dammit ) :
How wonderful that we have met with a paradox .
Now we have some hope of making progress .

Does the Israel Defense Forces believe incoming recruits and soldiers who play Dungeons and Dragons are unfit for elite units ?
Ynet has learned that 18 - year - olds who tell recruiters they play the popular fantasy game are automatically given low security clearance .
“ They 're detached from reality and suscepitble to influence , ” the army says .
Fans of the popular roleplaying game had spoken of rumors of this strange policy by the IDF , but now the army has confirmed that it has a negative image of teens who play the game and labels them as problematic in regard to their draft status .
So if you like fantasy games , go see the military psychologist .
Dungeons and Dragons ( also known as D&D ) has been a popular roleplaying game for decades and is based on a fantasy world .
One player assumes the role of “ Dungeon Master , ” which entails directing the game and controlling the labyrinth , while the others select from a large selection of characters that includes warriors , magicians , dwarfs and thieves .
The game focuses on the results of decisions
made by the players as determined by the roll of the dice .
In a more " active " version of the game , players leave the table and go out , dressed as the characters they assume for the game , along with the requisite equipment of swords ( not real ) to play outside , usually in the forest or woods .
Most D&D players do not don costumes , and participants in such costume games are called " LARPers " ( for live - action role playing ) .
' Simply detached from reality '
Thousands of youth and teens in Israel play D&D , fighting dragons and demons using their rich imaginations .
The game has also increased in popularity due to the " Lord of the Rings " trilogy .
However the IDF does not approve of this unusual hobby and prevents D&D players from being considered for sensitive army positions by labeling them with low security clearance .
" We have discovered that some of them are simply detached from reality , " a security source told Ynet .
Game enthusiasts are aware of their problematic image in the army and prefer to maintain their anonymity .
Many of them are from the former Soviet Union , where the game is very popular .
In Israel there are thousands of players , between the ages 16 to 35 , and include lawyers , high - tech workers and businessmen .
Matan , 22 , and Igor , a 21 - year - old IDF soldier , organize activities for groups of players .
Soon hundreds of fans are expected to meet in a forest in the southern part of Israel for a two - day game of pure fantasy .
" It 's not a game of winners and losers , " Matan says , " but rather entry into another world with stories and plot changes . "
He is aware of the game 's problematic reputation , especially in the IDF .
The army is not indifferent to the unique hobby and is trying to locate soldiers who in their free time dress up as witches and play in forests .
' The game indicates a weak personality '
A security official tells
Ynet there are specific criteria for deciding the level of a soldier 's security clearance .
" One of the tests we do , either by asking soldiers directly or through information provided us , is to ask whether they take part in the game , " he says .
" If a soldier answers in the affirmative , he is sent to a professional for an evaluation , usually a psychologist . "
More than half of the soldiers sent for evaluation receive low security clearances , thus preventing them from serving in sensitive IDF positions , he says .
Igor says exposing soldiers who play the game could result in the soldiers being sent to a military psychologist or even being kicked out of the army .
" Exposing them could also harm their chances at being accepted to other military courses , " he says .
Matan says he has personally met soldiers whose military career was harmed due to their connection to the game .
Most soldiers who play Dungeons and Dragons simply do not admit to it while they are in the army , he says .
Why does IDF believe game is dangerous ?
" These people have a tendency to be influenced by external factors which could cloud their judgment , a military official says .
" They may be detached from reality or have a weak personality - elements which lower a person 's security clearance , allowing them to serve in the army , but not in sensitive positions . "
Unsurprisingly , Igor , Matan and thier friends do not approve of this IDF policy .
They say the game is only a colorful , non-violent hobby .
" Many people who play served in the most classified units , " David says .
" They are intelligent and any attempt to label them as ' weird ' is incorrect and unfair . "
But in the struggle between the gameplayers and the Defense Minister , the latter wins - or at least this is the case in the real world of the IDF .
Bill Maher
AKA William Maher , Jr.
Born : 20 - Jan-1956
Birthplace : New York City
Gender : Male
Religion : Agnostic [ 1 ]
Race or Ethnicity : White
Sexual orientation : Straight
Occupation : Talk Show Host
Nationality : United States
Executive summary : Politically Incorrect
Bill Maher was born in New York City , and grew up in New Jersey .
His father was Catholic , a newsman with a sense of humor who told jokes around the house .
His mother was Jewish , a nurse , generally quiet and serious .
As a young boy , Maher was too shy to make many friends .
While attending college at Cornell , Maher tried stand - up at New York 's famous Catch a Rising Star night club .
He was terrified and not terribly funny , but it was n't a disaster .
He hung out at the club for several years , getting to know the comedy business , and getting better at it .
Maher eventually landed the emcee job at the club , which quickly got him noticed by a talent scout for Johnny Carson 's Tonight Show .
He made numerous appearances on Tonight , always funny and always invited back , but Maher felt constrained by the show 's rules -- every comedian 's material was vetted in advance down to the smallest detail , and anything political had to be inoffensive to every important demographic .
The banter between guest and host was largely based on pre-interviews with staff members .
Maher had an itch to try something more spontaneous .
In 1993 , Maher found a format that fit his talents : Politically Incorrect debuted on Comedy Central , with Maher and celebrity guests discussing political issues of the day , but with a sense of humor and few constraints .
Maher 's perspective was and remains mostly libertarian , and his show was bizarrely open - minded by mainstream network TV standards , with guests ranging from pinkos to the conservative extreme .
It was The McLaughlin Group without the pretentiousness , and the ratings were good enough to get ABC 's attention .
The show jumped from cable to the network in 1997 .
Yet Politically Incorrect died in 2002 , a lingering casualty of its own political incorrectness .
In the immediate aftermath of September 11 , it was supposed to be unanimous that the terrorists were simply cowards who hated American freedoms .
But only six days after the attacks , Maher and the East Indian conservative Dinesh D'Souza had this conversation on the show :
D'SOUZA : Bill , there 's another piece of political correctness I want to mention .
And , although I think Bush has been doing a great job , one of the themes we hear constantly is that the people who did this are cowards .
MAHER : Not true .
D'SOUZA : Not true .
Look at what they did .
First of all , you have a whole bunch of guys who are willing to give their life .
None of them backed out .
All of them slammed themselves into pieces of concrete .
MAHER : Exactly .
D'SOUZA : These are warriors .
And we have to realize that the principles of our way of life are in conflict with people in the world .
And so -- I mean , I 'm all for understanding the sociological causes of this , but we should not blame the victim .
Americans should n't blame themselves because other people want to bomb them .
MAHER : But also , we should -- we have been the cowards lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away .
That 's cowardly .
Staying in the airplane when it hits the building , say what you want about it , it 's not cowardly .
You 're right .
Sears and Federal Express immediately yanked their ads from the show , and 17 local ABC stations stopped airing Politically Incorrect .
Instead of making its usual profit for the network , Maher 's show was suddenly costing more than it earned .
Maher made a semi-apology to people who had misconstrued his remarks , and the show limped along for several months before the axe quietly fell .
Maher quickly started a similar show on HBO , Real Time , aired live for an hour weekly .
The new show sports
Maher still saying what he thinks , with three guests instead of four -- and no sponsors or affiliates to offend .

Footnote : I realize the whole teen - starts - Web - business thing is a cliché , and this thing could totally crash and burn .
I 'm more interested in advice relating to my search for a partner -- but do n't worry , I have no irrational illusions that this business will bring incredible success .
I only know that it 's a fun project and a good learning experience .
Footnote 2 : I applied to Paul Graham's Y Combinator Summer Founders ' Program , but they turned me down ( and my having no partner was likely a big part of their reason ) .
The business is the kind that requires a few servers , some programming , and some marketing -- it does n't require much money to bootstrap .
I 've been working very hard on it since the end of November , but if I continued working alone , it'd take until mid-July or later until I even had a working prototype .
I firmly believe in the idea , but I just do n't see myself being able to do all of the work alone .
( Though I have the technical skills , it 's just too much work . )
None of my friends are tech people , and nobody at my high school does much programming .
I 've also searched for 2 months through acquaintances , to no avail .
So , how can I find other people to help me who are of a similar age and whom I live near ?
Does anyone have any experience starting a business like this with a partner who was n't already a friend ?
Should I look for an employee rather than a partner ( i.e. , pay a salary instead of share a stake in the business ) ?
Should I cast a wide net and look to team up with somebody who lives somewhere else in the U.S. ?
( I 'm in Chicago . )
Has anyone had experience starting a Web - based business with someone whom they have n't even met in person ?
When I first interviewed him a year ago he was suspected of contacts with the insurgency .
Certainly he supported resistance to US forces .
More recently , an - Ni'ami had dropped out of sight .
Then , a little over a month ago , relatives say , paramilitary police commandos from ' Rapid Intrusion ' found him at a family home in the Sha'ab neighbourhood of northern Baghdad .
His capture was reported on television as that of a senior ' terrorist commander ' .
Twelve hours later his body turned up in the morgue .
What happened to him in his 24 hours in captivity was written across his body in chapters of pain , recorded by the camera .
There are police - issue handcuffs still attached to one wrist , from which he was hanged long enough to cause his hands and wrists to swell .
There are burn marks on his chest , as if someone has placed something very hot near his right nipple and moved it around .
A little lower are a series of horizontal welts , wrapping around his body and breaking the skin as they turn around his chest , as if he had been beaten with something flexible , perhaps a cable .
There are other injuries : a broken nose and smaller wounds that look like cigarette burns .
An arm appears to have been broken and one of the higher vertebrae is pushed inwards .
There is a cluster of small , neat circular wounds on both sides of his left knee .
At some stage an - Ni'ami seems to have been efficiently knee - capped .
It was not done with a gun - the exit wounds are identical in size to the entry wounds , which would not happen with a bullet .
Instead it appears to have been done with something like a drill .
What actually killed him however were the bullets fired into his chest at close range , probably by someone standing over him as he lay on the ground .
The last two hit him in the head .
The gruesome detail is important .
Hanging by the arms in cuffs , scorching of the body with something like an iron and knee - capping are claimed to be increasingly prevalent in the new Iraq .
Now evidence is emerging that appears to substantiate those claims .
Not only Iraqis make the allegations .
International officials describe the methods in disgusted but hushed tones , laying them at the door of the increasingly unaccountable forces attached to Iraq 's Ministry of the Interior .
The only question that remains is the level of the co-ordination of the abuse : whether Iraq is stumbling towards a policy of institutionalised torture or whether these are incidents carried out by rogue elements .
Six months ago , Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) laid out a catalogue of alleged abuses being applied to those suspected of terrorism in Iraq and called for an independent complaints body in Iraq .
But as the insurgency has grown hotter , so too , it appears , have been the methods employed in the dirty counter - insurgency war .
To add to HRW 's allegations of beatings , electric shocks , arbitrary arrest , forced confessions and detention without trial , The Observer can add its own charges
These include the most brutal kinds of torture , with methods resurrected from the time of Saddam ; of increasingly widespread extra-judicial executions ; and of the existence of a ' ghost ' network of detention facilities - in parallel with those officially acknowledged - that exist beyond all accountability to international human rights monitors , NGOs and even human rights officials of the new Iraqi government .
What is most shocking is that it is done under the noses of US and UK officials , some of whom admit that they are aware of the abuses being perpetrated by units who are diverting international funding to their dirty war .
Hassan an - Ni'ami may well have been a terrorist .
Or he may have had knowledge of that terrorism .
Or he may have been someone who objected too loudly to foreign troops being in Iraq .
We will never know .
He had no opportunity to defend himself , no lawyer , no trial .
His interrogation and killing were a breach of international law .
And it is not only the case of an - Ni'ami but others too , all arrested by units of the Ministry of the Interior , many of whom were tortured and subsequently killed .
Post - mortem images show a dozen or so farmers from the insurgent hotbed of Medayeen who were apparently seized by police as they slept in one of Baghdad 's markets and whose bodies were discovered on a rubbish dump in shallow graves to the north of the city .
Like an - Ni'ami , their bodies also bore the marks of extensive torture before execution , most with a bullet to the head .
The face of the first body is blackened by strangulation or asphyxiation .
Another has bruises to his forehead where he was been hit repeatedly with something heavy .
Yet another , his hands still tied with cord , has been punched in the eye and had his ankle fractured .
Yet another shows signs of burning similar to an - Ni'ami's .
The last two have identical puncture wounds , fist - width apart , suggesting the use of a spiked knuckle - duster .
Then there is Tahar Mohammed Suleiman al - Mashhadani , seized from the Abu Ghraib neighbourhood from early prayers outside a mosque with a number of other men , again by paramilitary police from Rapid Intrusion .
When his body was found by family members in the morgue - 20 days after his arrest - he had been tortured almost beyond recognition .
These are not isolated cases .
For what is extraordinary is the sense of impunity with which the torture , intimidation and murder is taking place .
It is not just in Baghdad .
In the majority Shia south , far from the worst ravages of the insurgency , there are also emerging reports consistent with the abuses in the capital .
If there is a centre to this horror , it is Baghdad 's Ministry of the Interior , and the police commando units that operate from there .
The ministry is a strange , top - heavy building , set apart in an area of open ground off the highway .
Its entrance is guarded by concrete blast - walls and endless checkpoints on the dusty road that leads to its crowded reception .
I came here almost exactly a year ago , two days after sovereignty had been handed back to Iraq 's interim government .
The floors were occupied by civil servants and blue - uniformed officers of the Iraqi Police Service .
It was easy to wander in .
These days the ministry is a very different place .
The dusty hinterland that leads to it is busy with the new paramilitary forces that most often have been accused of human rights abuses - the Rapid Intrusion brigades , most notoriously the Wolf Brigade of ' Abu Walid ' .
There has been no investigation or official findings over the allegations .
It was here - 12 months ago - that there was the first intimation that something was going seriously wrong .
On the second day of Iraq 's new government , US military police were forced to raid the Guest House to ' rescue ' dozens of alleged criminals , scooped up in a sweep of the city , who were being subjected to beatings and forced confessions of their crimes .
Back then officials were happy to justify the violence - and angry at the US intervention .
Criminals and terrorists expected a good beating , one official said , proud of his 100 per cent confession rate .
Now it is impossible to reach those officials as they shelter on heavily guarded floors .
There are no American MPs to come to the aid of those locked in the cells .
A year ago , the worst violence was meted out in the Guest House .
Now officials say the abuse happens on the seventh floor , where those suspected of terrorist connections are brought .
One of those held at the ministry for ' terrorist interrogation ' is ' Zaid ' .
It is not his real name .
Since his release , the 25 - year - old Sunni from the western suburbs of Baghdad lives in fear of being brought back .
A taxi driver , the college graduate stopped his car in March to buy food in a market .
When a bomb exploded nearby , he went to look at the damage .
Arrested at the scene by soldiers from the Iraqi National Guard , he says he was handed over to the Ministry of the Interior .
At first , said Zaid , he was put in a room , on the seventh floor , measuring 10 ft by 12ft , with 60 others .
He was crammed in so tightly he could not sit .
In some respects Zaid was lucky .
Early in his detention , a Ministry of Justice official appeared and , furious at the conditions , demanded the men be moved .
' He said , " You can't have this many people in a room this size , " so they moved us to somewhere with more air and fed us .
He asked too whether there had been any beatings and some said yes . '
For his part , Zaid says he was hung by his arms , but not for so long that it caused any permanent damage .
His ordeal was largely to be subjected to threats of violence as up to eight guards circled him during his interrogation .
But Zaid claims he witnessed what happened to men brought from another detention facility , a barracks run by the Wolf Brigade , who were kept in the same area as Zaid until his parents paid a hefty bribe for his release .
' I saw men from Samarra [ another insurgent stronghold ] and from Medayeen .
Some appeared to have wounds to their legs , ' he recalled .
' There were others who could not use their spoon properly .
They had to hold it between their palms and move their heads to the spoon . '
His month in the ministry terrified Zaid .
If the police came again for him , he said , he would rather throw himself off a balcony than go back .
Zaid is not the first detainee to accuse the police of taking bribes for the release of prisoners .
It is a common charge , as are descriptions of prisoners being brought from other , less accountable , interrogation facilities where the worst of the violence is taking place .
What is most important about Zaid 's testimony is that it makes clear a link exists between the Ministry of Interior and the torture being conducted out of sight at other centres .
Iraqi and international officials named several of these centres , including al - Hadoud prison in the Kharkh district of Baghdad .
A second torture centre is said to be located in the basement of a clinic in the Shoula district , while the Wolf Brigade is accused of running its own interrogation centre - said to be one of the worst - at its Nissor Square headquarters .
Other places where abusive interrogations have been alleged include al - Muthana airbase and the old National Security headquarters .
' Abu Ali ' , a 30 - year - old Sunni scooped up in a mosque raid in central Baghdad , was taken to the latter for a week in mid-May where he says he was beaten on his feet , subjected to hanging by his arms and , when he angered his guards by refusing to confess , threatened with being sat on ' the bottle ' - being anally penetrated .
It is not just in Baghdad .
Credible reports exist of Arab prisoners in Kirkuk being moved to secret detention facilities in Kurdistan , while other centres are alleged in Samarra , in the Holy Cities and in Basra in the south .
' There are places we can get to and know about , ' said one Iraqi official .
' But there are dozens of other places we know about where there is no access at all . '
' It is impossible to keep track of detentions , and what is happening to people when they are taken away , ' complained one foreign official involved in trying to building Iraq 's respect for human rights .
' On top of that we have a whole culture that is permitting torture .
The impression is the judiciary are simply not interested in responding to the issue of human rights .
It is depressing .'
But it is not simply the issue of keeping track of where detainees are being taken that is a problem .
Accountability has also become more opaque since the formation of the Shia - dominated government of Ibrahim Jaffari with ministers and senior officials at the Ministry of the Interior refusing to meet concerned international organisations including Human Rights Watch .
' We have been trying to break through to someone responsible to express our concerns , ' said another international official .
' But it is impossible to meet the people we really need to see .
What is so worrying is that allegations concerning the use of drills and irons during torture just keep coming back .
And we have seen precisely the same evidence of torture on bodies that have turned up after they have been arrested .
There is a dirty counter - insurgency war , led on the anti-insurgency side by groups responsible to different leaders .
People are not appearing in court .
Instead , what is happening to them is totally arbitrary . '
There is a significance to all this that goes beyond the everyday horror of today 's Iraq .
In the absence of weapons of mass destruction , the human rights abuses of Saddam Hussein 's regime became more important as a subsidiary case for war .
It has been a theme that has been constantly reiterated : it was horrific then , and it is better now .
The second may still just be true .
In many aspects there may be some improvement , but the trajectory of Iraq now on human rights is in danger of undermining that last plank of justification .
True , there is a question of scale of the abuses .
What is also different from Saddam 's era is that Iraq is now host to multinational troops , to huge UK and US missions , and is a substantial recipient of foreign aid , including British and EU funds .
British and US police and military officials act as advisers to Iraq 's security forces .
Foreign troops support Iraqi policing missions .
What is extraordinary is that despite the increasingly widespread evidence of torture , governments have remained silent .
It is all the more extraordinary on the British side , as embassy officials have been briefed by senior Iraqi officials over the allegations on a number of occasions and individual cases of abuse have been raised with British diplomats .
In Iraq 's Ministry of Human Rights , close to the Communications Tower and the location of one of the secret interrogation centres , they were marking the international day for the victims of torture .
As officials gathered for chocolate cake and cola under posters that read ' Non to torture ' , some senior officials are in no doubt that torture in their country is again getting worse .
The deputy minister , Aida Ussayran , is a life - long human rights activist who returned from exile in Britain to take up this post .
She concedes that abuses by Iraq 's security forces have been getting worse even as her ministry has been trying to re-educate the Iraqi police and army to respect detainee rights .
' As you know , for a long time Iraq was a mass grave for human rights , ' she says .
' The challenge is that many people who committed these abuses are still there and there is a culture of abuse in the security forces and police - even the army - that needs to be addressed .
I do not have a magic solution , but what I can do is to remind people that this kind of behaviour is what creates terrorists . '
There is a sense of frustration too in the Ministry of Human Rights , for even as the security forces rapidly increase in size , the ministry tasked with checking abuses has only 24 monitors to pursue cases , at a time when officials believe it needs hundreds to keep Iraq 's police and army effectively in check .
If Ussayran is robust about her country 's problems with human rights abuses , others are convinced that , far from being the acts of rogue units , the abuse is being committed at the behest of the ministry itself - or at least senior officials within it .
' There are people in the ministry who want to use these means , ' said one .
' It is in their ideology .
It is their strategy .
They do not understand anything else .
They believe that human rights and the Convention against Torture are stupid . '
DIGG THIS
To get a better idea of what ails the world , let ’s use our imagination to transport ourselves into outer space .
From there , we can look down on Earth not as an American or as a European , but as a disinterested alien .
We see a collection of sovereign nations — some large , some small , some powerful and some weak .
We also see that some of the powerful nations do not respect the sovereignty of some of the others .
For example , by what right do the United States and the Europeans tell Iran it cannot enrich uranium ?
Other nations enrich uranium .
Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and it grants the right to enrich uranium .
Where does the United States get off telling the Iranians they ca n’t do it ?
Oh , the U.S. claims Iran wants to build nuclear weapons .
Well , first and foremost , Iran denies that , and there is no proof to the contrary .
But suppose Iran does want to build nuclear weapons .
Why should n’t it ?
We have nukes .
The British , the French , the Russians , the Chinese , the Indians , the Pakistanis and the Israelis all have nuclear weapons .
Why should n’t Iran ?
For that matter , what right does anyone have to tell the North Koreans they can’t have nukes and ca n’t even test their missiles ?
Everybody else tests the missiles .
What you see is that the United States and some of the European states are still trying to run the world to suit them , even though formal colonialism has been a long time dead .
President Bush seems to think that he has the right to engineer regime change in any country he chooses .
The U.S. record on regime change is poor .
One reason so many Iranians hate us is because we engineered a regime change in the 1950s that threw out their elected nationalist leader and replaced him with the Shah .
A lot of Iranians were executed , tortured and imprisoned before the Iranian people could finally get rid of him .
What right do we have to tell Syria and Iran that they can’t supply arms to Hezbollah ?
We supply arms to Israel .
In fact , we are about the world ’s largest arms peddler .
Mr. Bush calls Hezbollah a terrorist organization .
The government of Lebanon and the European Union do not .
Just because an American politician sticks a label on a group of people does n’t mean those people lose all of their rights .
I do n’t think the world will know peace until all the nations of the world agree to respect each other ’s sovereignty .
That means no sanctions , no externally arranged coups , no invasions , no refusal to talk .
We would do much better if we talked to the Iranians and North Koreans and , while acknowledging their right to nuclear technology , offered incentives — including a security guarantee — not to develop it .
You know , of course , that the U.S. refuses to talk to the Iranians and the North Koreans and has refused their requests for security guarantees .
Countries do n’t like to be " dissed " any more than individuals do .
I ’ve been accused by some right - wingers of not liking America .
As usual , they have it wrong .
I love America , but I do n’t like this present administration one bit .
I think the Bushies are a dangerous combination of ignorance and arrogance , and that they act in a reckless manner .
They ignore what they should pay attention to and pay attention to what they should ignore .
Bush seems intent on pursuing regime change in Syria and Iran .
If he persists , he will likely unleash a regional war , the consequences of which will be catastrophic .
What have you gotten for your $ 300 billion , your 2,600 dead , your 8,000 seriously maimed in Bush ’s ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Stability ?
Do n’t make me laugh .
Security ?
America is hated in more parts of the world today than at any time in its history .
What has Bush done right ?
Before you resurrect the slogan " Stay the course , " remember that one of the definitions of insanity is to keep doing the wrong thing .
Let ’s face it , folks .
We elected ourselves a disaster .
Bush did n’t understand the world when he was elected ; he does n’t now ; and when he goes home to Crawford , Texas , he will still be puzzled by it all .

The Best of Charley Reese
Tara " Miss Rogue " Hunt , Alex Barnett and Ben Barren have been hacking Memeorandum - trying to get a post to appear on the front page of the automated news site by gaming the system .
And it appears to have worked .
Alex even created a screencast showing exactly how they did it ( very easily , it seems ) .
The serious point here is that once someone figures out how an algorithm works , they will use that knowledge to their own advantage - if Memeorandum ever goes mainstream , it will be targeted by spammers and lose much of its usefulness to the community .
Google 's Pagerank algorithm has suffered the same fate : the abundance of spam links has undermined the usefulness of the service , resulting in a constant and unending battle between Google and the spammers .
In my post Humans vs Algorithms , I suggested that we need to put human minds in the loop if we are to keep the spam out of search engines and news sites .
Time to quote myself :
As you may already know , my feeling is that humans are generally better at editing than algorithms , but by the same token you could say that the main algorithms in use today ( Google PageRank , Memeorandum , Google News ) are largely based on human decisions , where a link generally counts as a vote .
At the other end of the spectrum , you have sites like Digg and Reddit , which are entirely edited by humans in a distributed way .
But I ’m not sure if it ’s really a case of humans versus algorithms : I think the future could lie with services like Wink , where Google ’s search results are rated , tagged and built upon by human minds .
In this way , humans could make up for the obvious failings of algorithms - namely the scourge of spam and splogs .
This recent success in " hacking Memeorandum " confirms to me that we need some kind of human intervention in these systems .
The answer may indeed lie with human annotation ala Wink.com , or it may be the case that entirely human systems ( Digg , Reddit ) are less prone to attack .
Perhaps Google could send off its search results to be rated by the human minds at Amazon 's Mechanical Turk .
Either way , I do n't believe that algorithms can survive in their current form .
Human judgement is n't infallible , but it 's the best thing we 've got .
[ More Memeorandum hacking at Hellonline and supr.c.ilio.us ]
Update : Okay , looks like I wo n't have time to follow this up today , but I 've clarified some points in the comments .
I think the key thing to say here is that I 'm not criticizing Memeorandum , but simply pointing out that humans can often step in to fix the problems we experience with algorithms .
And I do n't think I should have quoted that original post - that makes this look like a debate between human and algorithms , which is n't really the case .
Bush Brandishes Jail Time at Critics By Robert Parry
April 23 , 2006 O ver the past five - plus years , the American people have gotten a taste of what a triumphant George W. Bush is like , as he basked in high approval ratings and asserted virtually unlimited powers as Commander in Chief .
Now , the question is : How will Bush and his inner circle behave when cornered ?
So far , the answer should send chills through todays weakened American Republic .
Bush and his team  faced with plunging poll numbers and cascading disclosures of wrongdoing  appear determined to punish and criminalize resistance to their regime .
That is the significance of recent threats from the administration and its supporters who bandy about terms like sedition , espionage and treason when referring to investigative journalists , government whistle - blowers and even retired military generals  critics who have exposed Executive Branch illegalities , incompetence and deceptions .
CIA Director Porter Goss , a former Republican congressman long regarded as a political partisan , has escalated pressure on intelligence officials suspected of leaking secrets about Bushs warrantless wiretapping of Americans and the torture of detainees held in clandestine prisons in Asia and Eastern Europe .
On April 20 , Goss fired a career intelligence officer ( identified as Mary O. McCarthy ) for allegedly discussing with reporters the CIAs network of secret prisons where terrorism suspects were interrogated and allegedly tortured in defiance of international law and often the laws of the countries involved .
Goss had said the disclosure of these clandestine prisons had caused very severe damage to our capabilities to carry out our mission ,  referring to complaints from foreign officials who had let the CIA use their territory for the so - called black sites  and faced legal trouble from the torture revelations .
 This was a very aggressive internal investigation to find who leaked the information about the secret prisons , one former CIA officer told the New York Times .
[ NYT , April 22 , 2006 ] WMD Fight Goss was recruited to the task of putting the CIA back in its place by Vice President Dick Cheney in 2004 .
During the run-up to the Iraq War , Cheney had banged heads with intelligence analysts who doubted White House claims about Iraqs weapons of mass destruction .
Though many senior CIA bureaucrats bent to Cheneys pressure on the WMD intelligence , some analysts resisted .
After the Iraq invasion failed to find WMD , some of the CIAs suppressed doubts began surfacing in the press and causing Bush political embarrassment during the presidential election campaign .
After the November 2004 election , Bush and his allies sought retribution against these out - of - step CIA officials .
The powerful conservative news media joined the drumbeat against analysts who were seen as a threat to Bushs goals in Iraq and elsewhere .
Conservative columnists , including Robert Novak and David Brooks , argued the CIAs rightful role was to do the presidents bidding .
 Now that hes been returned to office , President Bush is going to have to differentiate between his opponents and his enemies ,  wrote Brooks in the New York Times on Nov. 13 , 2004 .
 His opponents are found in the Democratic Party .
His enemies are in certain offices of the Central Intelligence Agency . 
Brooks justified a purge at the CIA because the spy agency had made Bush look bad .
 At the height of the campaign , CIA officials , who are supposed to serve the president and stay out of politics and policy , served up leak after leak to discredit the presidents Iraq policy ,  Brooks wrote .
 Somebody leaked a CIA report predicting a gloomy or apocalyptic future for the region .
A senior CIA official , Paul Pillar , reportedly made comments saying he had long felt the decision to go to war would heighten anti-American animosity in the Arab world . 
In other words , conservative commentators saw what sounded like reasonable CIA analyses as threats to Bushs authority .
New Disclosures
In 2005 , as conditions in Iraq indeed worsened and anti-U.S. sentiment in the Islamic world swelled , the Bush administration lashed out at other disclosures  about the network of secret prisons ( by the Washington Post ) and Bushs decision to ignore legal requirements for court warrants before spying on communications by American citizens ( reported by the New York Times ) .
Bush , his aides and their media allies claimed the news articles inflicted severe damage on U.S. national security , but presented no precise evidence to support those claims .
What was clear , however , was that Bush was facing a steep decline in public assessments about his judgment and honesty .
By March 2006 , Bushs favorable poll numbers were sinking into the mid-30 percentiles with his negatives nearing 60 percent and his strong negatives in the high - 40s .
SurveyUSA.com , which compiles state - by - state poll numbers , reported in March that Bush had net favorable ratings in only seven states ( Nebraska , Mississippi , Oklahoma , Idaho , Alabama , Wyoming , and Utah ) .
By April , Bushs net favorable states had declined to four ( Nebraska , Idaho , Wyoming and Utah ) .
In April , too , the Bush administration was stunned when a half dozen retired generals criticized the conduct of the Iraq War and called on Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to resign .
Bushs defenders struck back , warning that letting retired generals criticize Rumsfeld  and by implication , Bush  threatened the principle of civilian control of the military .
The announcement of the Pulitzer prizes was more bad news for the White House , with awards going to Washington Post reporter Dana Priest for her articles on the secret prisons and to New York Times reporters James Risen and Eric Lichtblau for their disclosure of Bushs warrantless wiretaps .
Facing Bushs growing unpopularity and the increased resistance from influential power centers  including the military , the intelligence community and the mainstream press  administration supporters escalated their rhetoric with intimations of legal retaliation against the critics .
Sedition ?
On April 18 , Tony Blankley , editorial - page editor of Rev. Sun Myung Moons staunchly pro-Bush Washington Times , raised the prospect of sedition charges against active - duty military officers who  in collusion with the retired generals  might be considering resignations in protest of Bushs war policies .
 Can a series of lawful resignations turn into a mutiny ? 
Blankley wrote .
 And if they are agreed upon in advance , have the agreeing generals formed a felonious conspiracy to make a mutiny ? 
Blankley wrote that this possible revolt by the generals comes dangerously close to violating three articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice ,  including mutiny and sedition . 
Blankley thus raised the specter of courts martial against officers who resign rather than carry out orders from Bush .
Administration supporters also have suggested imprisonment for journalists who disobey Bushs edicts against writing critical stories about the War on Terror that contain classified information .
Former Education Secretary ( and now right - wing pundit ) Bill Bennett used his national radio program on April 18 to condemn the three Pulitzer - winning journalists 
Priest , Risen and Lichtblau  as not worthy of an award  but rather worthy of jail . 
According to a transcript of the remarks published by Editor & Publishers Web site , Bennett said the reporters took classified information , secret information , published it in their newspapers , against the wishes of the president , against the requests of the president and others , that they not release it .
They not only released it , they publicized it  they put it on the front page , and it damaged us , it hurt us .
 How do we know it damaged us ?
Well , it revealed the existence of the surveillance program , so people are going to stop making calls .
Since they are now aware of this , they re going to adjust their behavior .
On the secret [ prison ] sites , the CIA sites , we embarrassed our allies .
So it hurt us there .
 As a result are they [ the reporters ] punished , are they in shame , are they embarrassed , are they arrested ?
No , they win Pulitzer prizes  they win Pulitzer prizes .
I dont think what they did was worthy of an award 
I think what they did is worthy of jail , and I think this [ Espionage Act ] investigation needs to go forward . 
Right - wing bloggers also began dubbing the awards to the three journalists  the Pulitzer Prize for Treason . 
Damage Doubtful
However , neither right - wing commentators nor Bush administration officials have ever explained exactly how national security interests were hurt by the disclosures .
As even Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has acknowledged , al - Qaeda operatives already were aware of the U.S. capability to intercept their electronic communications .
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Feb. 6 , 2006 , Sen . Joe Biden , D - Delaware , asked Gonzales ,  How has this revelation damaged the program since the administrations attack on the disclosure seems to presuppose that these very sophisticated al - Qaeda folks didnt think we were intercepting their phone calls ? 
Gonzales responded ,  I think , based on my experience , it is true  you would assume that the enemy is presuming that we are engaged in some kind of surveillance .
But if they re not reminded about it all the time in the newspapers and in stories , they sometimes forget  a response that drew laughter from the citizens in the hearing room .
As for the secret prisons , the fallout appears to be largely political , causing embarrassment for countries that collaborated in what appears to be a clear violation of international law by granting space for black sites  where torture allegedly was practiced .
The most likely consequence is that the Bush administration will find it harder in the future to set up secret prisons outside the scrutiny of the International Red Cross , the United Nations and human rights organizations .
But that may help U.S. national security  rather than hurt it  by discouraging the Bush administration from engaging in torture that has damaged Americas reputation around the world and fueled Muslim rage at the United States .
Instead , what appears most keenly at stake in the escalating political rhetoric is the Bush administrations determination to stop its political fall by branding its critics  even U.S. generals and CIA officers  as unpatriotic and then silencing them with threats of imprisonment .
Bush is trying to mark the boundaries of permissible political debate .
He also wants total control of classified information so he can leak the information that helps him  as he did in summer 2003 to shore up his claims about Iraqs WMD  while keeping a lid on secrets that might make him look bad .
The firing of CIA officer Mary McCarthy and the threats of criminal charges against various dissenters are just the latest skirmishes in the political war over who will decide what Americans get to see and hear .
The other signal to Bushs critics , however , is this :
If they ever thought he and his administration would accept accountability for their alleged abuses of power without a nasty fight , those critics are very mistaken .

In which I contribute to Business 2.0 .
Today Google Base , Google 's semantic indexing service , launched .
The blogs are abuzz with the news , including B2Day , the official blog of the magazine Business2.0 .
In their posting on this great event , B2 Day included an image from a speculative essay on my own website , Ftrain.com .
B2 Day did not copy the image beforehand , nor did they link to my site via the image , nor did they provide attribution for the image .
They simply incorporated it into their own page , applying my bandwidth to their own needs .
This means , I thought , that they want me as a contributor !
I had only a few minutes before I needed to leave for work , so I worked fast and kept things simple .
This is how the page looked when I visited it for the first time .
Moments later it carried a message .
I should keep the discourse elevated , I thought .
Next , I decided I 'd leave a message for the blog 's proprietors - - a word of warning .
And then a commentary on their content .
But finally , I figured it would be in keeping with the spirit of their blog if I created a sizeable ad for my new novel , [ Gary Benchley , Rock Star ] .
Obviously the folks at B2D agree with my capitalist impulses , because that ad is up several hours later .
Viva commerce !
Looking back , there are so many things I could have done .
Bare breasts .
Organ transplants .
Swear words .
I remember the sweet day when I replaced [ this image ] with [ this one ] , thus confounding a few corporate websites .
I 've matured , I guess .
Not much , but some .
Or maybe I 've lost my edge .
. . . . .
Update , November 18 : Business2.0 has graciously asked for permission to include the original linked image on their weblog , attributed — which permission , of course , I gladly granted .
Sadly , they erased the numerous amusing comments about stoats that people posted to their comment board .
I am very glad that someone posted a comment that read : “ Stoat riot !
Stoat riot !
Stoat riot !” -- if Gary Benchley ever starts another band , it 'll be called Stoat Riot .
The Guardian observes ( via Jeff Jarvis ) that YouTube has overtaken MySpace — but here ’s the thing — it ’s not really YouTube vs. MySpace .
It ’s user content and community hosted by YouTube vs. user content and community hosted by MySpace .
The hosting is besides the point .
It ’s people like Fritz Grobe and Stephen Voltz who are getting people ’s attention , not some entity called YouTube .
In case you ’re not among the 5 million + people who have seen it , Grobe and Voltz created an immensely clever and entertaining performance video that channels the explosive power of Mentos added to Diet Coke :
The video that you see above ( press the play button after it loads ) has appeared on YouTube and Google Video , but not with the permission of Grobe and Voltz .
I got this code from their site , EepyBird , where they ask users :
Please do not post our videos on sites like YouTube and Google .
[ Emphasis theirs ]
But why would n’t they want their video uploaded onto the immensely popular YouTube ?
Because YouTube is n’t paying them a dime .
Neither is Google .
Instead , Grobe and Voltz are distributing the video through Revver , which shares with them half the ad revenue generated by THEIR ( i.e. Grobe ’s and Voltz ’s ) content .
As BusinessWeek reported :
It took eight months for Fritz Grobe and Stephen Voltz to mastermind a now iconic Web video that shows them creating intricate fountains of soda by dropping 500 Mentos into 100 2 - liter bottles of Diet Coke .
The video became an instant hit after it was published in June on Revver , a service that shares ad revenue .
Within days , bootlegs showed up on Google and YouTube .
Voltz , a civil litigation lawyer , figured out the process for getting the videos removed .
But as copies kept reappearing , Voltz learned that he had to keep contacting YouTube to take down each new version .
The Mentos / Diet Coke video was seen 5.5 million times on Revver and made Grobe and Voltz $ 30,000 .
But Voltz estimates they lost another $ 30,000 to pirated copies .
And for several days recently , blogs buzzed with attempts to sort out the rights of artists to control uploaded videos .
As the prospect grows for making money online , what started as a lark for many is becoming all too serious .
User - generated content is going through a novelty phase , where most “ users ” are content with attention as a form of recompense for their efforts .
But for savvy “ users ” — or in this case video production artists , let ’s get real here — getting paid in attention while hosting platforms like YouTube get all the take - to - the - bank revenue is sheer lunacy .
To all the Web 2.0 sites that think they are going make a fortune off of “ free ” user - generated content — it ’s the users calling … they want their money .
And if you do n’t give it to them , they are going to take their content elsewhere .
UPDATE
Just came across this Heather Green post from a few days ago about Ze Frank ’s Video Blog :
Frank is deliberately trying to create a show and a brand and he wants to figure out a way to support himself .

HTTP Authentication with HTML Forms
Authentication in Web applications has been highjacked , HTTP defines a standard way of providing authentication but most apps use the evil spawn of Netscape , otherwise known as cookies .
Why is this ?
Cookies are n’t designed for authentication , they ’re a pain to use for it , insecure unless you know what you ’re doing , non-standard , and unRESTful .
Warning :
The solution outlined in this article is experimental and might be a complete lie , be warned that your mileage may / will vary .
The main reason people walk away from using HTTP authentication is that they want control over the look of the login form and most browsers display an awful looking dialog box .
So what we need is a way for HTML forms to pass HTTP auth data when it ’s submitted .
The HTML spec provides HTML forms as a way to create queries and to POST urlencoded data to a URL , but can we subvert it ?
With the power of Javascript we can
We could add an onsubmit event to our login form that pushes the username and password values within our form into the URL in the forms action attribute .
That way our login request would supply the users credentials in the URL and avoid the server returning a 401 response and causing our browser from showing the HTTP auth box .
Great , and pretty easy .
We could even write the HTML form out with Javascript and provide a simple link to non-Javascript enabled browsers .
But there ’s a problem , IE does n’t support usernames and passwords in URLs , they were removed due to a security scare , and anyway , the HTTP spec does n’t say we ’re allowed to have URLs with usernames and passwords in them so we ca n’t guarentee that they work anywhere else either .
So is there an alternative way that does n’t require us to mung the username and password into the URL ?
Yes , our new friend , XMLHTTPRequest , it can submit the correct HTTP auth headers for us .
Rather than adjusting the URL the form submits to , we can use XMLHTTPRequest to do a request before the form submits supplying the entered username and password .
This will set up the browser with the HTTP auth credentials so it ’ll also send them with our actual form submission login request .
An example
Enough talking , here ’s some code .
This is our login function that we bind to our form submission :
function login ( ) { var username = document.getElementById( this.id + " - username " ) .value ; var password = document.getElementById( this.id + " - password " ) .value ; this.http.open(" get " , this.action , false , username , password ) ; this .http.send ( " " ) ; if ( http.status == 200 ) { document.location = this.action ; } else { alert ( " Incorrect username and / or password . " ) ; } return false ; }
It sends our XHR request with the given username and password , and then redirects the client on success or displays a Javascript alert on error .
We need our standard getHTTPObject ( ) function that I introduced here , and then some code to create our login form and set everything up :
window.onload = function ( ) { var http = getHTTPObject ( ) ; if ( http ) { var anchors = document.getElementsByTagName ( " a " ) ; for ( var foo = 0 ; foo < anchors.length ; foo ++ ) { if ( anchors [ foo ] .
className == " httpauth " ) { createForm ( anchors [ foo ] ) ; } } } } function createForm ( jshttpauth ) { var form = document.createElement ( " form " ) ; form.action = jshttpauth.href ; form.method = " get " ; form.onsubmit = login ; form.id = httpauth.id ; var username = document.createElement ( " label " ) ; var usernameInput = document.createElement ( " input " ) ; usernameInput.name = " username " ; usernameInput.type = " text " ; usernameInput.id = httpauth.id + " - username " ; username.appendChild(document.createTextNode( " Username : " ) ) ; username.appendChild(usernameInput ) ; var password = document.createElement ( " label " ) ; var passwordInput = document.createElement ( " input " ) ; passwordInput.name = " password " ; passwordInput.type = " password " ; passwordInput.id = httpauth.id + " - password " ; password.appendChild(document.createTextNode( " Password : " ) ) ; password.appendChild(passwordInput ) ; var submit = document.createElement ( " input " ) ; submit.type = " submit " ; submit.value = " Log in " ; form.appendChild(username ) ; form.appendChild( password) ; form.appendChild(submit ) ; jshttpauth.parentNode.replaceChild(form , jshttpauth ) ; }
This looks for all anchors with the class of httpauth and replaces it with a nice HTML form with the login ( ) function bound to it ’s onsubmit event .
So now if we set up a HTML page like the following , the login link will be replaced with a login form ( if the user has Javascript support ) but authenticate the user using HTTP auth :
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD
HTML 4.01//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd " >
< html lang= " en " > < head > < title > Javascript HTTP Auth Test </ title > < script type= " text/ javascript " src= " jshttpauth.js " ></script > </ head > < body > < a class= " httpauth " id= " private " href= " private.php " > Log in </ a> </ body > </html >
If our private .
php looks like this , then we ’ll see that everything works as we ’d like :
<? php define ( ' USER ' , ' user ' ) ; define ( ' PASSWORD ' , ' password ' ) ; if ( ! isset ( $ _SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_USER ' ] ) || !isset ( $_SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_PW ' ] ) ) { header ( ' WWW - Authenticate : Basic realm = " My Realm " ' ) ; header ( ' HTTP /1.0 401 Unauthorized ' ) ; echo ' You hit cancel , good on you . ' ; } elseif ( isset ( $_SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_USER ' ] ) && $ _SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_USER '] == USER && isset($_SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_PW ' ] ) && $ _SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_PW '] == PASSWORD ) { echo " < p> Hello {$_SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_USER ']} . </p > " ; echo " < p > You entered '{$_SERVER [ ' PHP_AUTH_PW ']} ' as your password . </p > " ; } else { header ( ' HTTP / 1.0 400 Bad Request ' ) ; echo " < p > You shall not pass ! </p > " ; } ?>
The thing to notice about this script is the third part of the ‘ if ’ statement .
If the request does n’t have any auth details we send a standard auth response , if it does and the details are correct then we let them in , otherwise we send back a 400 error .
This stops the clients browser from asking the user for details again allowing the Javascript to process the failure .
This also means that if the client does n’t have Javascript and fails to authenticate correctly , it will never be asked for new credentials as long as it keeps sending the bad auth data ( which browsers will do ) .
Problems
It ’s not all good just yet , this technique works in IE6 and Firefox but is known not to work in both Opera and Safari , so if you care about those browsers you may want to think again about using this ( or to spend some time investigating why it fails in those browsers ) .
HTTP Digest Auth
HTTP
Digest is a way of authenticating a client while never sending the clients password over the wire .
To use Digest rather than Basic HTTP Auth , we only need to adjust our PHP script to implement digest :
<?php include ' digest.php ' ; $ HTTPDigest =& new HTTPDigest ( ) ; $users = array ( ' user ' => md5 ( 'user : '.$ HTTPDigest->getRealm ( ).': password ' ) ) ; if (!$ HTTPDigest->getAuthHeader ( ) ) { $ HTTPDigest -\> send ( ) ; echo ' You hit cancel , good on you . ' ; } elseif ( $username = $ HTTPDigest ->authenticate ( $users ) ) { echo " < p > Hello $ username . </p > " ; echo " < p > This resource is protected by HTTP digest . </p > " ; } else { header ( ' HTTP / 1.0 400 Bad Request ' ) ; echo " < p > You shall not pass ! </p > " ; } ?>
Conclusion
So there we have it , there is no need for HTTP authentication to be shunned , even for aesthetic reasons .
HTTP auth offers lots of advantages over using cookies :
It ’s simple to implement and no hassle to use , and clients love it .
It carries no baggage unlike cookies .
It ’s tried and tested , it ’s a standard and it works , your cookie based security model wo n’t be as good .
We can use HTTP Digest which is pretty secure .
It ’s about as RESTful as you can get with authentication .
So we should be using it , there ’s no excuses anymore .
I have put up an example of this code as a demonstration .
Note : I was first introduced to this idea by Christian Jensen and Jan Algermissen on the REST Discuss mailing list , so credit should be sent their way .
Update : Dimitri Glazkov made me revisit using HTTP
Digest with this technique and realise that it does actually work , thanks Dimitri .
Update : Travis Estill and David Kleinschmidt reminded me that 401 responses should n’t be returned without an Auth header and so a 403 is a better response code .
This also helps to make Safari behave too .

The Great Escape
Forty million American employees toil in soulless cubicles .
How did they get there -- and can business ever break out of the box ?
NEW YORK ( FORTUNE Magazine ) - Robert Oppenheimer agonized over building the A - bomb .
Alfred Nobel got queasy about creating dynamite .
Robert Propst invented nothing so destructive .
Yet before he died in 2000 , he lamented his unwitting contribution to what he called " monolithic insanity . "
Propst is the father of the cubicle .
More than 30 years after he unleashed it on the world , we are still trying to get out of the box .
The cubicle has been called many things in its long and terrible reign .
But what it has lacked in beauty and amenity , it has made up for in crabgrass - like persistence .
See a gallery of cubicles -- from futuristic workspace to box .
Reviled by workers , demonized by designers , disowned by its very creator , it still claims the largest share of office furniture sales - - $ 3 billion or so a year -- and has outlived every " office of the future " meant to replace it .
It is the Fidel Castro of office furniture .
So will the cubicle always be with us ?
Probably yes , though in recent years individuals and organizations have finally started to chart productive and economical ways to escape its tyranny .
The cubicle was not born evil , or even square .
It began , in fact , as a beautiful vision .
The year was 1968 .
Nixon won the presidency .
The Beatles released The White Album .
And home - furnishings company Herman Miller in Zeeland , Mich. , launched the Action Office .
It was the brainchild of Bob Propst , a Coloradan who had joined the company as director of research .
After years of prototyping and studying how people work , and vowing to improve on the open - bullpen office that dominated much of the 20th century , Propst designed a system he thought would increase productivity ( hence the name Action Office ) .
The young designer , who also worked on projects as varied as heart pumps and tree harvesters , theorized that productivity would rise if people could see more of their work spread out in front of them , not just stacked in an in - box .
The new system included plenty of work surfaces and display shelves ; partitions were a part of it , intended to provide privacy and places to pin up works in process ( see photo , above left ) .
The Action Office even included varying desk levels to enable employees to work part of the time standing up , thereby encouraging blood flow and staving off exhaustion .
But inventions seldom obey the creator 's intent .
" The Action Office was n't conceived to cram a lot of people into little space , " says Joe Schwartz , Herman Miller 's former marketing chief , who helped launch the system in 1968 .
" It was driven that way by economics . "
Economics was the one thing Propst had failed to take into account .
But it was also what triggered the cubicle 's runaway success .
Around the time the Action Office was born , a growing breed of white - collar workers , whose job titles fell between secretary and boss , was swelling the workforce .
Also , real estate prices were rising , as was the cost of reconfiguring office buildings , making the physical office a drag on the corporate budget .
Cubicles , or " systems furniture , " as they are euphemistically called , offered a cheaper alternative for redoing the floorplan .
Another critical factor in the cubicle 's rapid ascent was Uncle Sam .
During the 1960s , to stimulate business spending , the Treasury created new rules for depreciating assets .
The changes specified clearer ranges for depreciation and established a shorter life for furniture and equipment , vs. longer ranges assigned to buildings or leasehold improvements .
( Today companies can depreciate office furniture in seven years , whereas permanent structures -- that is , offices with walls -- are assigned a 39.5 - year rate . )
The upshot : A company could recover its costs quicker if it purchased cubes .
When clients told Herman Miller of that unexpected benefit , it became a new selling point for the Action Office .
After only two years on the market , sales soared .
Competitors took notice .
That 's when Propst 's original vision began to fade .
" They kept shrinking the Action Office until it became a cubicle , " says Schwartz , now 80 .
As Steelcase , Knoll , and Haworth brought their versions to market , they figured out that what businesses wanted was n't to give employees a holistic experience .
The customers wanted a cheap way to pack workers in .
Propst 's workstations were designed to be flexible , but in practice they were seldom altered or moved at all .
Lined up in identical rows , they became the dystopian world that three academics described as " bright satanic offices " in a 1998 book , Workplaces of the Future .
Designer Douglas Ball , for instance , remembers the first installation of cubicles he created for a Canadian company in 1972 .
" I thought I 'd be excited , but I came out depressed , " says Ball , now 70 .
" It was Dilbertville .
I 'd failed to visualize what it would look like when there were so many of them . "
Having taken over the world , the cubicle defeated several attempts to dethrone it .
One of the most ambitious assaults came in 1993 , when Jay Chiat , chairman of ad agency Chiat / Day , declared a sort of Bolshevik revolution when he moved his employees into newly renovated space in Venice , Calif .
The design " was loungy , like Starbucks , " remembers Stevan Alburty , then head of technology .
" It was 20 years ahead of its time . "
But it had a fatal flaw :
No one had a fixed place to work .
Employees were expected to park their belongings in lockers and check out laptops every morning as if renting a movie at Blockbuster .
It quickly sparked a counter - rebellion -- many employees simply stopped coming to the office , preferring to work at home .
After the firm was acquired by an advertising conglomerate , employees got workspaces again .
Designers since then have mostly limited themselves to trying to offset the cubicle 's most glaring defects .
A recent Steelcase offering , the Personal Harbor , can be fitted with its own lighting system , fan , door , and window .
Knoll offers the A3 ( or anticube ) , a colony of rounded , podlike structures with translucent mesh coverings for privacy .
Herman Miller , now a $ 1.5 - billion - a- year company , will launch two concepts in June that are the work of designer Ball .
He says the new designs are the culmination of more than 30 years of trying to undo his early mistakes .
The company wo n't release many details , but the systems will emphasize color and privacy ;
Ball says the workstations will be " more capsule - like , or cockpit - like . "
In all , more than 100 cubicle - variant office systems have come to market over the past three decades .
When openly challenged , the cubicle still gets the last laugh .
In California state - employed attorneys obtained relief from the cube through Title 13.3 of their union contract : " The State agrees to make a reasonable effort to provide private enclosed office space to each permanent full - time attorney who has confidentiality needs . "
Should an attorney be assigned to " other than enclosed private offices , " the union must be notified .
Rather than violate the rule , says union president Holly Wilkens , the state sticks some young attorneys in airless closets .
Is that really where we 're headed ?
No , says Stewart Brand , co-founder of the Global Business Network , an Emeryville , Calif. , consulting firm that helps companies make long - range plans .
Back in the '60s , right around the time Propst unveiled the cubicle , Brand created The Whole Earth Catalog , which became the bible of environmentally aware living and arguably had a much more benevolent effect on American culture .
He says that the most productive people he knows have developed ways to work outside offices , not in them .
Brand himself worked out of a converted shipping container in Sausalito for seven years and now commutes to a beached fishing boat a few yards from his house .
He sees two workspaces rising up to compete with the modern office : homes and what might be called the third space -- i.e. , Starbucks .
A living example of work in the third space is Diego Guevara , a 23 - year - old appraiser for a large mortgage and insurance company .
He camped out on a recent winter afternoon in a Manhattan Starbucks ; before him on the counter were his ruggedized computer , a calculator , a Wi -Fi card , a yellow pad , and a grande .
As he used a PDA - cellphone to check on a property , Guevara typed details of the morning 's appraisals into the laptop , which would sync the records with a database back at the office in West Orange , N.J .
He usually goes to the office only when he needs supplies .
And the last time he saw his boss ?
" Before Christmas , " said Guevara , adding that his boss mostly works at home .
If working at home is now part of the zeitgeist , one very large employer that seems increasingly tapped in is the U.S. government .
Congressman Frank Wolf , a Republican whose Virginia district is home to many federal worker bees , has made telecommuting his pet project .
" There is nothing magic in strapping ourselves into a metal box every day only to drive to an office where we sit behind a desk working on a computer , " he told a congressional committee .
Wolf sees telecommuting as a way to decrease traffic , reduce air pollution , increase productivity , and frustrate terrorists .
In 2004 he launched a campaign to penalize government agencies by docking funds if they fail to support telecommuting .
Now the SEC , the State Department , the Department of Justice , and four other big agencies are required to offer every eligible worker the opportunity to telecommute .
A 2005 survey by Milwaukee 's Dieringer Research Group reported that 26 million Americans use broadband to do work from home .
Sales reps and consultants have always worked remotely ; now finance people , lawyers , administrators , researchers , and creative types can too .
Just as infotech has enabled companies to offshore white - collar functions , it also untethers Stateside employees from their cubes .
Coming to the office for meetings and in - person collaboration is still important , of course , but as Brand points out , " People are realizing they do n't need face - to - face time all the time . "
Remember how economics helped turn the cube into a plague ?
Now giants like Cisco Systems see " workforce mobility " as a way to cut real estate costs .
Thanks to heavy use of mobile technology by employees , says real estate VP Mark Golan , " we discovered that Cisco offices and cubicles went vacant 35 % of the time . "
By switching to what it calls the Connected Workspace - - employees set up work areas wherever they are needed in the building -- Cisco says it has raised satisfaction while boosting density .
Now 140 employees are able to work comfortably where 88 would work in a traditional workspace .
Hewlett - Packard , which has introduced a similar scheme , expects to cut $ 230 million out of annual occupancy expenses by mid 2007 .
The new economics of the office wo n't actually kill the cube .
In fact , U.S. sales of office systems rose 11 % in 2005 .
But as the office occupies a smaller part of companies ' budgets , cubes will claim a smaller share of employees ' lives .

CSS Positioning
To use CSS for layout effectively , it helps to know how it 's used to position page content .
This article gives an overview of the methods and rules that govern visual rendering in the CSS2 specification .
It also points out some things to watch out for .
Although the specification applies to any device for displaying web pages , this article focuses on how it works in browsers .
Many details are left out for the sake of simplicity .
For a definitive reference , see the standards publication .
It 's important to remember that a given browser may not support a given feature or may even implement it incorrectly .
Also , there is some leeway provided within the standards where individual browsers are free to deal with situations as they please .
Where appropriate these inconsistencies are noted .
The Box Model
To understand positioning in CSS you must first understand the box model .
For display purposes , every element in a document is considered to be a rectangular box which has a content area surrounded by padding , a border and margins .
The illustration below shows these various parts .
content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content
margin border padding content
Margins are always transparent .
Borders come in various styles .
Background settings for an element apply to the the area just inside the borders which includes both the padding and content areas .
For purposes of illustration however , the padding area is shown in a slightly darker color .
When referring to boxes throughout this article , the term " margin edge , " " border edge " , etc. means the the outer boundary of the corresponding box area as shown above .
Margins , borders and padding are all optional but for purposes of calculating positions and sizes they are given a default width of zero if not specified .
Different widths can be set for each individual side ( top , right , bottom and left ) if desired .
Margins can even have negative values .
The width and height of each box is equal to the width and height of the outer margin box .
Note that this is not the necessarily the same as the width and height of the content area .
A box can contain any number of other boxes , creating a hierarchy of boxes that corresponds to the nesting of page elements .
The browser window serves as the root element for this hierarchy .
Box Types
There are two basic types of boxes , block and inline .
Block boxes are generated by elements such as P , DIV or TABLE .
Inline boxes are generated by tags such as B , I or SPAN and actual content like text and images .
The box type may also be set using the display property .
Setting a value of block on an inline element , for example , will cause it to be treated as a block element .
Note that if you set the display to none , no box is created .
The browser acts as if the element did not exist .
Likewise , any nested elements are ignored as well , even if they specifically declare some other display value .
There are other types of boxes which apply to special elements like lists and tables .
However , these are ultimately treated as block or inline boxes for positioning purposes .
As such , these other box types not covered here .
Containing Blocks
Block boxes act as a containing block for any boxes within them .
For example , in this code :
< div >
This is the first sentence .
< p > This is the second sentence .
</ p> </div>
the DIV element establishes a containing block for both the first string of text and the P element .
The P element in turn creates a containing block for the second text string .
It 's interesting to note that while the text of the first sentence in the above example generates an inline box , there is considered to be block box surrounding it .
These " anonymous " block boxes are used to simplify the positioning process .
The result is that a block box will only contain either all inline boxes or all block boxes , even if some of those block boxes only act as a wrapper for an inline box .
This containing block is used in determining both the position of the boxes within it and in some cases , the dimensions of those boxes .
For example , if an element has a style setting of width :50 % ; its width will be set to half the width of its containing block .
For any element that is not absolutely positioned , the containing block is considered to be the content edge of its most recent , block - level ancestor .
If none exists , the browser window serves as the containing block .
Absolutely positioned elements are discussed separately .
Positioning Schemes
There are three positioning modes or schemes in CSS2 : normal , float and absolute .
Each has its own set of rules .
Every box is positioned using one of these schemes but different boxes will use different schemes depending on their position and float style settings .
Normal Flow
Normal flow is the default scheme used for positioning .
It applies to any element that does not specify position : absolute or fixed and is not floated .
In this scheme , block boxes flow vertically starting at the top of their containing block with each placed directly below the preceding one .
Inline boxes flow horizontally from left to right .
You should note that vertical margins are collapsed in the normal flow .
That is , instead of adding the bottom margin of a box to the top margin of the one immediately below it , only the larger of the two values is used , as illustrated here .
content content content content content content content content content
content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content content
Horizontal margins , however , are never collapsed .
This is the original article substantially as first published .
See the book Exceptional C++ ( Addison - Wesley , 2000 ) for the most current version of this article .
The versions in the book have been revised and expanded since their initial appearance in print .
The book versions also incorporate corrections , new material , and conformance to the final ANSI / ISO C++ standard .
Namespaces and the Interface Principle
This article appeared in C++ Report , 11 ( 3 ) , March 1999 .
Use namespaces wisely .
If you put a class into a namespace , be sure to put all helper functions and operators into the same namespace too .
If you do n't , you may discover surprising effects in your code .
The Interface Principle Revisited
Exactly one year ago , in the March 1998 issue , [ 1 ] I dedicated the entire column to proposing and explaining the Interface Principle :
The Interface Principle For a class X , all functions , including free functions , that both
( a) " mention " X , and
( b ) are " supplied with " X
are logically part of X , because they form part of the interface of X .
In passing , that column showed why the " supplied with " requirement could be usefully interpreted as meaning " supplied in the same header or namespace with . "
It also described Koenig name lookup in detail , and showed that Koenig lookup had to operate the way it does because of the Interface Principle .
This column goes further , and shows why you should always put helper functions , especially operators , in the same namespace as a class .
That 's a simple rule , but it 's not entirely obvious why it 's necessary , so I 'll begin with a motivating example to demonstrate a hidden pitfall that comes from the way C++ namespaces and name lookup interact .
Consider the following simple program , based on code e-mailed to me by Astute Reader Darin Adler .
It supplies a class C , in namespace N , and an operation on that class .
Notice that the operator + is in the global namespace , not in namespace N. Does that matter ?
Is n't the code valid as written anyway ?
// Example 1 : Will this compile ?
//
// in some library header
namespace N { class C {} ; }
int operator +( int i , N : : C ) { return i+1 ; }
// a mainline to exercise it
#include < numeric >
int main ( ) {
N::C a [ 10 ] ;
std::accumulate(a , a+10 , 0 ) ;
}
Before reading on , stop and consider : Will this program compile ? [ 2 ]
Is it portable ?
Digression : Recap of a Familiar Inheritance Issue
For a moment , let 's put Example 1 aside and consider what looks like ( but is n't ) a completely unrelated example :
// Example 2a : Hiding a name
// from a base class
//
struct B {
int f( int ) ;
int f( double ) ;
int g( int ) ;
} ;
struct D : public B {
private :
int g( std:: string , bool ) ;
} ;
D d ;
int i ;
d.f( i ) ; // ok , means B :: f( int )
d.g( i ) ; // error : g takes 2 args
Most of us should be used to seeing this kind of name hiding , although the fact that the last line wo n't compile surprises most new C++ programmers .
In short , when we declare a function named g in the derived class D , it automatically hides all functions with the same name in all direct and indirect base classes .
It does n't matter a whit that D ::g " obviously " can't be the function that the programmer meant to call ( not only does D : :g have the wrong signature , but it 's private and therefore inaccessible to boot ) , because B ::g is hidden and can't be considered by name lookup .
To see what 's really going on , let 's look in a little more detail at what the compiler does when it encounters the function call d.g( i ) .
First , it looks in the immediate scope , in this case the scope of class D , and makes a list of all functions it can find that are named g ( regardless of whether they 're accessible or even take the right number of parameters ) .
Only if it doesn does it then continue " outward " into the next enclosing scope and repeat -- in this case , the scope of the base class B -- until eventually it either runs out of scopes without having found a function with the right name or else finds a scope that contains at least one candidate function .
If a scope is found that has one or more candidate functions , the compiler then stops searching and works with the candidates that it 's found , performing overload resolution and applying access rules .
There are very good reasons why the language must work this way .
[ 3 ]
To take the extreme case , it makes intuitive sense that a member function that 's a near - exact match ought to be preferred over a global function that would have been a perfect match had we considered the parameter types only .
Of course , there are the two usual ways around the name - hiding problem in Example 2a .
First , the calling code can simply say which one it wants , and force the compiler to look in the right scope :
// Example 2b : Asking for a name
// from a base class
//
D d ;
int i ;
d.f( i ) ; // ok , means B :: f( int )
d.B:: g( i ) ; // ok , asks for B :: g( int )
Second , and usually more appropriate , the designer of class D can make B ::g visible with a using - declaration .
This allows the compiler to consider B ::g in the same scope as D ::g for the purposes of name lookup and subsequent overload resolution :
// Example 2c : Un-hiding a name
// from a base class
//
struct D : public B {
using B::g ;
private :
int g( std:: string , bool ) ;
} ;
Either of these gets around the hiding problem in the original Example 2a code .
Back On Topic : Name Hiding in Nested Namespaces
So , with that example behind us , let 's go back and tackle Example 1 again :
// Example 1 : Will this compile ?
//
// in some library header
namespace N { class C {} ; }
int operator +( int i , N : : C ) { return i+1 ; }
// a mainline to exercise it
#include < numeric >
int main ( ) {
N::C a [ 10 ] ;
std::accumulate(a , a+10 , 0 ) ;
}
Well , at first glance , it sure looks legal .
But will it compile ?
The answer is probably surprising : Maybe it will compile , or maybe not .
It depends entirely on your implementation , and I know of standard - conforming implementations that will compile this program correctly and equally standard - conforming implementations that wo n't .
Gather ' round , and I 'll show you why .
The key to understanding the answer is understanding what the compiler has to do inside std::accumulate .
The std :: accumulate template looks something like this :
namespace std {
template < class Iter , class T >
inline T accumulate ( Iter first ,
Iter last ,
T value ) {
while ( first != last ) {
value = value + * first ; // 1
++ first ;
}
return value ;
}
}
The code in Example 1 actually calls std::accumulate <N:: C*, int >.
In line 1 above , how should the compiler interpret the expression value + * first ?
Well , it 's got to look for an operator + that takes an int and an N:: C ( or parameters that can be converted to int and N : : C ) .
Hey , it just so happens that we have just such an operator + ( int , N: : C ) at global scope !
Look , there it is !
Cool .
So everything must be fine , right ?
The problem is that the compiler may or may not be able to see the operator + ( int , N: : C ) at global scope , depending on what other functions have already been seen to be declared in namespace std at the point where std::accumulate < N:: C*,int > is instantiated .
To see why , consider that the same name hiding the we observed with derived classes happens with any nested scopes , including namespaces , and consider where the compiler starts looking for a suitable operator +.
( Now I 'm going to reuse my explanation from the previous section , only with a few names substituted : )
First , it looks in the immediate scope , in this case the scope of namespace std , and makes a list of all functions it can find that are named operator + ( regardless of whether they 're accessible or even take the right number of parameters ) .
Only if it doesn does it then continue " outward " into the next enclosing scope and repeat -- in this case , the scope of the next enclosing namespace outside std , which happens to be the global scope -- until eventually it either runs out of scopes without having found a function with the right name or else finds a scope that contains at least one candidate function .
If a scope is found that has one or more candidate functions , the compiler then stops searching and works with the candidates that it 's found , performing overload resolution and applying access rules .
In short , whether Example 1 will compile depends entirely on whether this implementation 's version of the standard header numeric : a ) declares an operator + ( any operator + , suitable or not , accessible or not ) ; or b ) includes any other standard header that does so .
Unlike Standard C , Standard C++ does not specify which standard headers may or may not include each other , so when you include numeric you may or may not get header iterator too , for example , which does define several operator + functions .
I know of C++ products that wo n't compile Example 1 , others that will compile Example 1 but balk once you add the line # include < vector > , and so on .
Some Fun With Compilers
It 's bad enough that the compiler can't find the right function if there happens to be another operator + in the way , but typically the operator + that does get encountered in a standard header is a template , and compilers generate notoriously difficult - to - read error messages when templates are involved .
For example , one popular implementation reports the following errors when compiling Example 1 ( note that in this implementation the header numeric does in fact include the header iterator ) :
error C2784 : ' class std::reverse_iterator<`template-parameter-1 ' , `template - parameter - 2 ' , `template - parameter - 3 ' , `template - parameter - 4 ' , `template - parameter -5'> __cdecl std::operator +( template - parameter - 5 , const class std::reverse_iterator < `template - parameter - 1 ' , `template - parameter - 2 ' , `template - parameter - 3 ' , `template - parameter - 4 ' , `template - parameter - 5'> & ) ' : could not deduce template argument for ' template - parameter - 5 ' from ' int ' error C2677 : binary '+' : no global operator defined which takes type ' class N:: C ' ( or there is no acceptable conversion )
Imagine the poor programmer 's confusion :
o The first error message is unreadable .
The compiler is merely complaining ( as clearly as it can ) that it did find an operator + but can't figure out how to use it in an appropriate way , but that does n't help the poor programmer .
" Huh ? " saith the programmer , scratching his forelock , " when did I ever ask for a reverse_iterator anywhere ? "
o The second message is a flagrant lie , and it's the compiler vendor 's fault ( although perhaps an understandable mistake , because the message was probably right in most of the cases where it came up before people began to use namespaces widely ) .
It 's close to the correct message " no operator found which takes ... , " but that does n't help the poor programmer either .
" Huh ? " saith the programmer , indignant with ire , " there is too a global operator defined that takes type ' class N:: C ' ! "
How is a mortal programmer ever to decipher what 's going wrong here ?
And , once he does , how loudly is he likely to curse the author of class N::C ?
Best to avoid the problem completely , as we shall now see .
The Solution
When we encountered this problem in the familiar guise of base / derived name hiding , we had two possible solutions : either have the calling code explicitly say which function it wants ( Example 2b ) , or write a using - declaration to make the desired function visible in the right scope ( Example 2c ) .
Neither solution works in this case ; the first is possible [ 4 ] but places an unacceptable burden on the programmer , while the second is impossible .
The real solution is to put our operator + where it has always truly belonged and should have been put in the first place : in namespace N .
// Example 1b : Solution
//
// in some library header
namespace N {
class C {} ;
int operator +( int i , N : : C ) { return i+1 ; }
}
// a mainline to exercise it
#include < numeric >
int main ( ) {
N::C a [ 10 ] ;
std::accumulate(a , a+10 , 0 ) ; // now ok
}
This code is portable and will compile on all conforming compilers , regardless of what happens to be already defined in std or any other namespace .
Now that the operator + is in the same namespace as the second parameter , when the compiler tries to resolve the " + " call inside std :: accumulate it is able to see the right operator + because of Koenig lookup .
Recall that Koenig lookup says that , in addition to looking in all the usual scopes , the compiler shall also look in the scopes of the function 's parameter types to see if it can find a match .
N::C is in namespace N , so the compiler looks in namespace N , and happily finds exactly what it needs no matter how many other operator +'s happen to be lying around and cluttering up namespace std .
Conclusion
The problem arose because Example 1 did not follow the Interface Principle :
The Interface Principle For a class X , all functions , including free functions , that both
( a) " mention " X , and
( b ) are " supplied with " X
are logically part of X , because they form part of the interface of X .
If an operation , even a free function ( and especially an operator ) mentions a class and is intended to form part of the interface of a class , then always be sure to supply it with the class -- which means , among other things , to put it in the same namespace as the class .
The problem in Example 1 arose because we wrote a class C and put part of its interface in a different namespace .
Making sure that the class and the interface stay together is The Right Thing To Do in any case , and is a simple way of avoiding complex name lookup problems later on when other people try to use your class .
Use namespaces wisely .
Either put all of a class inside the same namespace -- including things that to innocent eyes do n't look like they 're part of the class , such as free functions that mention the class -- or do n't put the class in a namespace at all .

2 . In case you 're wondering that there might be a potential portability problem depending on whether the implementation of std :: accumulate invokes operator + ( int , N: : C ) or operator + ( N:: C,int ) , there is n't ; the standard says that it must be the former , so Example 1 is providing an operator + with the correct signature .
3 . For example , you might think that , if none of the functions found in an inner scope were usable , then it could be okay to let the compiler start searching further enclosing scopes ; that would , however , produce surprising results in some cases ( consider the case where there 's a function that would be an exact match in an outer scope , but there 's a function in an inner scope that 's a close match requiring only a few parameter conversions ) .
Or , you might think that the compiler should just make a list of all functions with the required name in all scopes , and then perform overload resolution across scopes ; but , alas , that too has its pitfalls ( consider that a member function ought to be preferred over a global function , rather than result in a possible ambiguity ) .
4 . By requiring the programmer to use the version of std :: accumulate that takes a predicate and explicitly say which one he wants each time ... a good way to lose customers .
A new UK - based shoe company , Allbirds , wants you to know it cares about your carbon footprint .
The clothing industry alone is estimated to contribute 4 % of the global greenhouse gas emissions per year , meaning the industry has a lot of room for more efficient and sustainable practices .
Allbirds was founded with the goal of making sustainable shoes and to inspire the entire clothing and fashion industry to be more ecologically sustainable .
Of course , the best thing you do when it comes to fashion is to not buy new clothes and repair the ones you already one .
Allbirds ’ environmental goal is to eliminate carbon emissions from its products , from the raw materials it uses to the CO2 produced by shoes as they decompose in landfill sites .
Its approach is to measure its emissions , reduce its environmental impact by including recycled or natural fabrics , and then offset anything that remains .
Measuring emissions is complex because there are several processes involved in producing goods , but the company estimates the carbon footprint of an average Allbirds product is 7.6 kg CO2e ( carbon dioxide equivalent emissions ) .
That equates to putting five loads of laundry through a dryer , it has calculated , and compares to 12.5 kg CO2e for the average standard sneaker , per a method used by Allbirds based in part on an MIT study that looked at how to reduce emissions in footwear production .

But that was fine .
Because for Hatch , it was always about convincing the world that it made sense to bring back " Battlestar . "
And in fact , soon Universal would indeed be relaunching the Galactica -- although Richard Hatch would not be on board .
In December 2001 , David Eick , who was behind shows like " American Gothic " and " Xena : Warrior Princess , " got a call from David Kissinger , president of the media conglomerate Studios USA , which controlled the Universal library .
Over the previous year or two , the idea of reviving " Battlestar " had been floating around Universal .
Now , Kissinger said , there was some new interest at Studio USA 's sister company , the Sci Fi Channel .
Would Eick be interested ?
Eick had his misgivings about the idea .
But he had some experience sending out secret , under - the - radar cultural messages through pulp entertainment ( in Xena 's case , a nascent lesbian chic ) .
He saw an opportunity -- what he called " a great potential for irony . "
As he told me , " If you could do a show called ' Battlestar Galactica , ' with that title , that would harken toward the kind of sincere , dimensional , textured , emotional drama of ' 2001 ' and ' Blade Runner ' -- oh , my God .
You could blow everyone 's mind . "
Eick met Ron Moore a few years before , when Moore was consulting on " Good vs. Evil " for the Sci Fi Channel .
But even though Eick did n't know " Star Trek " particularly well , he knew that " Star Trek " was exactly what he did n't want this new series to be .
And he knew that " Star Trek " was not and would never be a subject that was close to Moore 's heart .
And so he called Moore and asked him if he was interested in bringing a second big spaceship show back to life .
Moore knew the original " Battlestar , " and after talking to Eick , he watched Larson 's original three - hour pilot again .
It surprised him .
Here was a deeply somber story about a civilization that had basically endured genocide , and for the first hour it was elegantly told and strangely affecting .
" They were trying , " he told me .
" It took a hard left turn to insanity when they reached the casino planet , but they were really trying . "
Moore said he would do it , but he wanted to make some changes .
After numerous meetings and a full script treatment , he wrote a two - page memo that laid out the basic tenets of what the new " Battlestar Galactica " would eventually become .
" We take as a given the idea that the traditional space opera , with its stock characters , techno - double - talk , bumpy - headed aliens , thespian histrionics and empty heroics has run its course , and a new approach is required , " it began .
" Call it ' naturalistic science fiction . " '
There would be no time travel or parallel universes or cute robot dogs .
There would not be " photon torpedoes " but instead nuclear missiles , because nukes are real and thus are frightening .
" To this day , " Eick says , " I do n't think either of us could have anticipated how valuable the memo would be . "
It would repair everything that had been worn down to convention in a genre Moore had once loved .
But " Battlestar " would be more than just an opportunity to do " Voyager " correctly .
" When I watched the original pilot , " Moore says , " I knew that if you did ' Battlestar Galactica ' again , the audience is going to feel a resonance with what happened on 9/11 .
That 's going to touch a chord whether we want it to or not .
And it felt like there was an obligation to that .
To tell it truthfully as best we can through this prism . "
In the miniseries Moore wrote to introduce the new " Battlestar , " the echoes of the war on terror were unapologetic and frequently harrowing : what happens when an advanced , comfortable , secular democracy endures a devastating attack by an old enemy that it literally created ( which enemy , in Moore 's version , also happens to be religious fanaticism ) ?
For a genre often derided as escapist , science fiction has a long tradition of social commentary , no small part of which comes from " Star Trek " itself , which embraced race and gender equality on the bridge of the Enterprise at a time when it was still largely being rejected in real - life America .
But Moore wanted a show that would move between the idealistic fantasies of " Trek " and the hard moral pragmatism of the military -- that would embrace both the binnacle and the bat 'leth , if you will .
He listed for me some of the thornier questions the show evokes : " What does it mean to be free in a society under attack ?
What are the limits of that freedom ?
Who 's right ?
Who 's wrong ?
Are you rooting for the wrong side ? "
Like Richard Hatch , Moore and Eick were taking " Battlestar Galactica " more seriously than it had been taken in a long time , though in a very different way .
And for this reason , Moore thought he would be a hero to those who had rallied to Hatch 's cause .
At last there would be someone who would get a new " Battlestar " made and , what 's more , who would be faithful to the original story 's dark premise -- perhaps even more faithful than the original had been .
As production progressed on the miniseries , details of the changes Moore and Eick had in mind for " Battlestar Galactica " began to circulate on the Internet , and to many fans they were deeply disturbing .
The Cylons would look human , and they would be sexy .
Even more troubling : Moore had killed the idea of any " continuation story , " as Hatch had long been championing .
All of the characters would be recast , including Hatch 's own Apollo , and the story would start over .
Fake Disease Created For Viral Movie Campaign ?
There 's a little rumor going around that a disease called Morgellons , a creepy skin disease that involves little bugs a bug - like sensation under the skin , and the websites associated with it are just a viral marketing campaign for the upcoming movie A Scanner Darkly .
Michael Shostack of The Halting Point has collected some information pointing to the likelihood the disease is , in fact his opinion , a viral campaign .
Shostack , who , since one never knows when it comes to virals , may actually be part of the viral campaign , points to a Slashdot story which says " Imagine having a disease that is so controversial that doctors refuse to treat you . "
The Slashdot story leads to a June 2005 Popular Mechanics story about the disease which has , reportedly , been around since 2002 when websites ( 1 , 2 ) about the disease began appearing .
There 's also a Wikipedia citation for Morgellons which , among other places , points to a April 2005 local CBS TV affiliate story on the disease .
That article says the disease has been around for a long time .
" In 1935 , an English physician wrote a paper about Morgellon 's including excerpts from medical journals from the 1600's , describing the disease . "
A disease with Morgellon - like symptoms is also mention in the first chapter of the 1977 Philip K. Dick novel , A Scanner Darkly , on which the movie is based .
The fact the disease has apparently been around for a while , is referenced in many places , was eluded to by Dick in his novel and has elicited many comments on this website in support of the disease 's validity might lead one to believe , however obscure , the ailment is legit .
On the other hand , the fact the disease 's websites are registered anonymously may give credence to the notion the movie studio co-opted the disease ( or created it along with a fake history ) and created a viral marketing campaign around it .
Additionally , much of the recent news coverage of the disease reads like it came from the same press release .
TV coverage looks like it came from a VNR .
And , interestingly enough , reports point out the highest concentration of the disease is in LA - home to the Hollywood movie - making machine .
In support of the create - a - disease theory , one might find it odd all this flurry of activity is occurring just prior to the movie 's July 7 release date .
Not to mention the disease 's websites making mention of some sort of major announcement in June or July .
Of course , all of this could simply be our jaded , skeptical excuse - for - a - brain run amok .
Anyone care to tell us we 're crazy ?
Anyone care to support the theory ?
We vote viral .
If so , it 's both masterful and scary .
To have created a viral campaign in 2002 , four years prior to the movie 's release and when viral was barely in a marketer 's toolkit , is amazing and commendable .
Of course , to create a fake disease that garners legitimate news coverage is likely to bring down heavily the wrath of the medical community .
One way or another , we 're likely to know the truth in a month or two .
UPDATE : We were completely wrong on this one .
Morgellons is a real disease and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reportedly forming a task force to look into the situation .
We apologize for our idiocy .
UPDATEI II :
We placed a call to the CDC press office and , while we await an " official " reply from a " qualified " press agent , the woman we spoke to in the press office had not heard of Morgellons , did not think the CDC had been made aware of the disease and stated that any prepared alert goes up on their website immediately .
A search of the website found no mention of Morgellons .
Stay tuned .
UPDATE III : CDC Communication Specialist Dan Rutz returned our call and has verified that Morgellons is a syndrome , as he refers to it , the CDC is looking into .
The CDC has received numerous calls from those citing symptoms associated with what is being called Morgellons Disease and has , in fact , formed a group to explore the syndrome and define it .
All angles from environmental to medial to psychological will be taken into consideration .
Rutz says , based on information the CDC has collected to date , it 's highly unlikely this syndrome was " invented " as some us originally thought .
Whether Morgellons is being leveraged in some clandestine fashion to promote A Scanner Darkly is unclear bit if it is , it 's sick , twisted and wrong .
Only a handful of scientists have security clearance to access the laboratory at 1600 Clifton Road in Atlanta , Georgia , home to the US government 's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention .
Before entering , they must pull on a protective hood , don breathing apparatus and pass through electronic fingerprint and retina scanners to prove their identity .
Inside the lab lies a batch of a virus , designated a " select agent " , that more than justifies the extreme level of security .
Resurrected nearly 90 years after it spread around the globe , leaving an estimated 50 million people dead , it is a replica of the 1918 Spanish flu virus .
The recreation of the virus , which was driven by an urge to unravel why the 1918 pandemic was so devastating , has raised as many fears as it has hopes .
While the researchers argue the work will hugely improve protection against natural flu viruses , critics say there is a real danger the virus will escape , with potentially disastrous consequences .
The recreation process was laborious .
Scientists collected fragments of the virus from lung tissue taken from victims at the time and preserved in formalin or , in one case , isolated from the lungs of a woman victim whose body had later become frozen in the Alaskan permafrost .
Using the fragments , they painstakingly pieced together and read the complete genetic code before using the sequence to rebuild the virus from scratch .
By injecting it into mice , the team led by Dr Jeffery Taubenberger at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Maryland was able to establish just how ferociously effective it was , compared with more common flu strains .
All the mice infected died within a few days ; all infected with contemporary strains recovered .
" I did n't expect it to be as lethal as it was , " Dr Terrence Tumpey , a scientist on the project from the US Centres of Disease Control and Prevention , told the journal Nature .
By creating flu strains with only certain parts of the 1918 virus , researchers investigated which of the eight genes that make up the virus were most responsible for its virulence .
They discovered that rather than being caused by one or two genes , they all played a part , which suggests that the virus had completely adapted to cause disease in humans , something they say could happen again with avian flu strains .
In a second paper , published in Nature today , Dr Taubenberger and colleagues at the US Centres for Disease Control and Protection analysed the genetic make - up of the recreated virus .
Surprisingly , they found it had no similarities to any of the human viruses in circulation , suggesting that the Spanish strain had jumped from birds to humans , and did n't mix with a human virus first , as had been believed .
The finding that Spanish flu came straight from birds has raised concerns among scientists .
Previously , a pandemic was only thought likely if an avian strain merged with a human flu virus .
" For me , it raises even more concern than I already had about the pending potential of a flu pandemic , " said Professor Ronald Atlas , co-director of the centre for the deterrence of biowarfare and bioterrorism at the University of Louisville in Kentucky .
" It looks as though an avian strain evolved in 1918 and that led to the deadly outbreak , in much the same way as we 're now seeing the Asian avian flu strains evolve . "
According to Dr Taubenberger , knowing what mutations gave rise to the 1918 Spanish flu virus will help scientists check viruses to work out which , if any , are evolving to the point where a pandemic is possible .
The H5N1 strain of bird flu in Asia is already mutating to make it more suited to humans , he said .
Despite the new insights given by the project , many scientists were alarmed at the recreation itself and particularly that the full genetic sequence was to be made public on an online genetic database .
" Assuming this is a replicant of the 1918 flu strain , if it got out , it could initiate disease in humans and given the work they 've done , one had to say it would be infectious , " said Prof Atlas .
Viruses have escaped from high - security labs before .
During the recent Sars outbreak the virus escaped at least twice , once in Taiwan and once in Singapore , when researchers became contaminated .
Other scientists warned that the 1918 virus 's genetic code could easily be misused .
Such has been the pace of progress in genetic science that companies now build genes to order for customers who send in details of sequences they want .
" If the genetic sequence is out there on a database , then that is a clear security risk , " said Dr John Wood , a virologist at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control , in Potters Bar .
According to Dr Julie Gerberding , director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Protection , a pandemic is unlikely even if the virus escapes because of most people 's natural immunities and the availability of antiviral drugs and flu vaccines .
Publication of the research still raises questions about the powers of academic journals who take ultimate responsibility for publishing the papers , said Dr Wood .
" That is some responsibility , " he said .
The US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity concluded at an emergency meeting last week to discuss the possible publication of the papers that their benefits outweighed their risks .
FAQ : 1918 flu pandemic
Why was the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic so lethal ?
The worst pandemic in human history , the 1918 strain killed an estimated 50 million people .
Because flu viruses were unknown at the time , no isolates of the pathogen were made , making it impossible for scientists to study .
Scientists believe the virus was originally found only in birds but jumped to humans and evolved to become very infectious
Whom did the 1918 flu virus kill ?
Most flu viruses kill the very young , the old and the infirm .
But the Spanish flu was unusual in striking young , fit people extremely hard .
Even with good healthcare , up to one third of those who picked up the infection died , many within days
What is a select agent ?
Its designation as a ' select agent ' by US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention puts it on a list of controlled pathogens and toxins including ricin , smallpox virus , anthrax and ebola
How secure is the virus ?
It is held in a biosafety level 3 enhanced laboratory , kept at a negative pressure to prevent air escaping .
Workers must wear protective clothing , breathing apparatus and gain entry via fingerprint and retina scans

| Special Report Novak : Rove confirmed Plame 's identity Columnist reveals cooperation in probe , wo n't name first source Bob Novak , shown in a file photo , has kept mum on his role in the CIA leak .
SPECIAL REPORT YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS
White House Iraq Joe Wilson Karl Rove or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
White House political adviser Karl Rove was one of Robert Novak 's sources for the 2003 disclosure of a CIA operative 's identity , the syndicated columnist wrote Tuesday .
Novak said Rove confirmed information from another source , whose identity Novak is still keeping under wraps .
But he said special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald knows the source 's identity , and Novak said he does not think that person will be charged with unmasking now - former CIA agent Valerie Plame .
He also wrote that prosecutors have told him his role in the investigation is over .
" I have been subpoenaed by and testified to a federal grand jury .
Published reports that I took the Fifth Amendment , made a plea bargain with the prosecutors or was a prosecutorial target were all untrue , " Novak wrote in a column released for publication Wednesday .
Rove is President Bush 's chief strategist and serves as a deputy White House chief of staff .
The White House declined comment on Novak 's account Tuesday evening .
In July 2003 the conservative syndicated columnist and former CNN commentator identified Plame as " an agency operative on weapons of mass destruction " in a column about her husband , Joseph Wilson , a former career diplomat and critic of the intelligence underlying the invasion of Iraq .
Novak has remained tight - lipped throughout much of the leak probe , which was disclosed in September of that year .
Novak wrote Tuesday that he has cooperated with investigators while trying to protect sources who have not yet revealed themselves publicly .
Fitzgerald 's office has known who his sources were , " independent of me , " for most of the time the investigation has been under way , Novak added .
Novak 's initial disclosure -- attributed to " two senior administration officials " -- triggered a criminal probe that resulted in last year 's indictment of Lewis " Scooter " Libby , who at the time was Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff .
Libby resigned and has pleaded not guilty to the charges of perjury , obstruction of justice and lying to investigators .
" In my sworn testimony , I said what I have contended in my columns and on television : Joe Wilson 's wife 's role in instituting her husband 's mission was revealed to me in the middle of a long interview with an official who I have previously said was not a political gunslinger , " Novak wrote .
" After the federal investigation was announced , he told me through a third party that the disclosure was inadvertent on his part . "
Fitzgerald spokesman Randall Samborn declined comment on the matter and would not say when the special prosecutor would have any further statement on the status of his probe .
Wilson has accused the Bush administration of effectively ending his wife 's career in retribution for his public questioning of the administration 's claim that Iraq was seeking to obtain from Africa uranium for nuclear weapons .
Novak : CIA confirmed identity Knowingly disclosing the identity of an undercover intelligence agent can bring a federal prison term of up to 10 years under the 1982 Intelligence Identities Protection Act.
Novak wrote Tuesday that none of his sources have been indicted .
The Libby indictment stated that Rove , identified as " Official A , " had discussed Plame 's identity with Novak .
But Rove 's lawyer Robert Luskin said in June that Rove had been informed that he would not face charges in connection with the probe .
Novak said a third source , CIA spokesman Bill Harlow , confirmed Plame 's identity .
Harlow was not available for public comment on Novak 's latest account .
But a former intelligence official said Harlow did not know what Plame 's position at the CIA was at first and that he tried to talk Novak out of publishing her name when he did find out , making it clear the disclosure could be damaging .
Novak has said his recollection of their conversation differs .
The CIA tapped Wilson , a former ambassador to Gabon , for a 2002 trip to Niger to investigate reports that Iraq had tried to restart its nuclear weapons program using uranium from that central African country .
He returned to report that the claim was unlikely and later publicly questioned whether the administration had " twisted " intelligence in its argument for war .
President Bush included the Niger allegation in his 2003 State of the Union speech , delivered just weeks before the invasion of Iraq .
But the White House was forced to disassociate itself from the claim after Wilson 's disclosure .
Novak reported that his sources said Plame had suggested sending her husband to Niger .
Libby told a grand jury that Bush had authorized the release of classified information to rebut Wilson , which Cheney 's office considered a " direct attack " on the credibility of the White House , according to court papers released in April .
In May prosecutors released handwritten notes from Cheney , written on The New York Times article in which Wilson went public , questioning whether the Niger trip was a " junket " arranged by his wife .

Users of Google 's search engine will soon see something they are not used to on the notoriously spare site : advertising with logos and graphics .
And the advertisers will not be limited to America Online , whose talks with Google prompted the change in policy , according to two executives close to the companies ' negotiations .
As part of their deal , which is expected to be formally announced this afternoon , Google is providing AOL with $ 300 million worth of advertising on Google 's Web sites , intended to use to draw Google search users to related content on AOL 's sites , the executives said .
That sum is on top of the $ 1 billion in cash that Google is to invest to buy a 5 percent stake in AOL .
Representatives of Google and AOL said yesterday that their companies would not comment on any aspect of the negotiations .
Google , which has been providing search technology and placing search - based advertising on AOL since 2002 , emerged Friday with a tentative deal to renew and expand that relationship , fending off a challenge from Microsoft .
The executives close to the talks said that at AOL 's request , Google would begin to experiment with various forms of graphical ads , and that it would make the same formats available to other advertisers .
Google has started to sell graphical ads for placement on other sites ; plans to do so on Google itself were accelerated by the AOL talks , an executive involved in the negotiations said .

The average startup probably does n't have much to show for itself after ten weeks .
But the average startup fails .
When you look at the ones that went on to do great things , you find a lot that began with someone pounding out a prototype in a week or two of nonstop work .
Startups are a counterexample to the rule that haste makes waste .
( Too much money seems to be as bad for startups as too much time , so we do n't give them much money either . )
A week before Demo Day , we have a dress rehearsal called Rehearsal Day .
At other Y Combinator events we allow outside guests , but not at Rehearsal Day .
No one except the other founders gets to see the rehearsals .
The presentations on Rehearsal Day are often pretty rough .
But this is to be expected .
We try to pick founders who are good at building things , not ones who are slick presenters .
Some of the founders are just out of college , or even still in it , and have never spoken to a group of people they did n't already know .
So we concentrate on the basics .
On Demo Day each startup will only get ten minutes , so we encourage them to focus on just two goals : ( a ) explain what you 're doing , and ( b ) explain why users will want it .
That might sound easy , but it's not when the speakers have no experience presenting , and they 're explaining technical matters to an audience that 's mostly non-technical .
This situation is constantly repeated when startups present to investors : people who are bad at explaining , talking to people who are bad at understanding .
Practically every successful startup , including stars like Google , presented at some point to investors who did n't get it and turned them down .
Was it because the founders were bad at presenting , or because the investors were obtuse ?
It 's probably always some of both .
At the most recent Rehearsal Day , we four Y Combinator partners found ourselves saying a lot of the same things we said at the last two .
So at dinner afterward we collected all our tips about presenting to investors .
Most startups face similar challenges , so we hope these will be useful to a wider audience .
1. Explain what you 're doing .
Investors ' main question when judging a very early startup is whether you 've made a compelling product .
Before they can judge whether you 've built a good x , they have to understand what kind of x you 've built .
They will get very frustrated if instead of telling them what you do , you make them sit through some kind of preamble .
Say what you 're doing as soon as possible , preferably in the first sentence .
" We 're Jeff and Bob and we 've built an easy to use web - based database .
Now we 'll show it to you and explain why people need this . "
If you 're a great public speaker you may be able to violate this rule .
Last year one founder spent the whole first half of his talk on a fascinating analysis of the limits of the conventional desktop metaphor .
He got away with it , but unless you 're a captivating speaker , which most hackers are n't , it 's better to play it safe .
2 . Get rapidly to demo .
This section is now obsolete for YC founders presenting at Demo Day , because Demo Day presentations are now so short that they rarely include much if any demo .
They seem to work just as well without , however , which makes me think I was wrong to emphasize demos so much before .
A demo explains what you 've made more effectively than any verbal description .
The only thing worth talking about first is the problem you 're trying to solve and why it 's important .
But do n't spend more than a tenth of your time on that .
Then demo .
When you demo , do n't run through a catalog of features .
Instead start with the problem you 're solving , and then show how your product solves it .
Show features in an order driven by some kind of purpose , rather than the order in which they happen to appear on the screen .
If you 're demoing something web - based , assume that the network connection will mysteriously die 30 seconds into your presentation , and come prepared with a copy of the server software running on your laptop .
3 . Better a narrow description than a vague one .
One reason founders resist describing their projects concisely is that , at this early stage , there are all kinds of possibilities .
The most concise descriptions seem misleadingly narrow .
So for example a group that has built an easy web - based database might resist calling their applicaton that , because it could be so much more .
In fact , it could be anything ...
The problem is , as you approach ( in the calculus sense ) a description of something that could be anything , the content of your description approaches zero .
If you describe your web - based database as " a system to allow people to collaboratively leverage the value of information , " it will go in one investor ear and out the other .
They 'll just discard that sentence as meaningless boilerplate , and hope , with increasing impatience , that in the next sentence you 'll actually explain what you 've made .
Your primary goal is not to describe everything your system might one day become , but simply to convince investors you 're worth talking to further .
So approach this like an algorithm that gets the right answer by successive approximations .
Begin with a description that 's gripping but perhaps overly narrow , then flesh it out to the extent you can .
It 's the same principle as incremental development : start with a simple prototype , then add features , but at every point have working code .
In this case , " working code " means a working description in the investor 's head .
4 . Do n't talk and drive .
Have one person talk while another uses the computer .
If the same person does both , they 'll inevitably mumble downwards at the computer screen instead of talking clearly at the audience .
As long as you 're standing near the audience and looking at them , politeness ( and habit ) compel them to pay attention to you .
Once you stop looking at them to fuss with something on your computer , their minds drift off to the errands they have to run later .
5 . Do n't talk about secondary matters at length .
If you only have a few minutes , spend them explaining what your product does and why it 's great .
Second order issues like competitors or resumes should be single slides you go through quickly at the end .
If you have impressive resumes , just flash them on the screen for 15 seconds and say a few words .
For competitors , list the top 3 and explain in one sentence each what they lack that you have .
And put this kind of thing at the end , after you 've made it clear what you 've built .
6 . Do n't get too deeply into business models .
It 's good to talk about how you plan to make money , but mainly because it shows you care about that and have thought about it .
Do n't go into detail about your business model , because ( a ) that 's not what smart investors care about in a brief presentation , and ( b ) any business model you have at this point is probably wrong anyway .
Recently a VC who came to speak at Y Combinator talked about a company he just invested in .
He said their business model was wrong and would probably change three times before they got it right .
The founders were experienced guys who'd done startups before and who'd just succeeded in getting millions from one of the top VC firms , and even their business model was crap .
( And yet he invested anyway , because he expected it to be crap at this stage . )
If you 're solving an important problem , you 're going to sound a lot smarter talking about that than the business model .
The business model is just a bunch of guesses , and guesses about stuff that 's probably not your area of expertise .
So do n't spend your precious few minutes talking about crap when you could be talking about solid , interesting things you know a lot about : the problem you 're solving and what you 've built so far .
As well as being a bad use of time , if your business model seems spectacularly wrong , that will push the stuff you want investors to remember out of their heads .
They 'll just remember you as the company with the boneheaded plan for making money , rather than the company that solved that important problem .
7 . Talk slowly and clearly at the audience .
Everyone at Rehearsal Day could see the difference between the people who'd been out in the world for a while and had presented to groups , and those who had n't .
You need to use a completely different voice and manner talking to a roomful of people than you would in conversation .
Everyday life gives you no practice in this .
If you can't already do it , the best solution is to treat it as a consciously artificial trick , like juggling .
However , that does n't mean you should talk like some kind of announcer .
Audiences tune that out .
What you need to do is talk in this artificial way , and yet make it seem conversational .
( Writing is the same .
Good writing is an elaborate effort to seem spontaneous . )
If you want to write out your whole presentation beforehand and memorize it , that 's ok .
That has worked for some groups in the past .
But make sure to write something that sounds like spontaneous , informal speech , and deliver it that way too .
Err on the side of speaking slowly .
At Rehearsal Day , one of the founders mentioned a rule actors use : if you feel you 're speaking too slowly , you 're speaking at about the right speed .
8 . Have one person talk .
Startups often want to show that all the founders are equal partners .
This is a good instinct ; investors dislike unbalanced teams .
But trying to show it by partitioning the presentation is going too far .
It 's distracting .
You can demonstrate your respect for one another in more subtle ways .
For example , when one of the groups presented at Demo Day , the more extroverted of the two founders did most of the talking , but he described his co-founder as the best hacker he'd ever met , and you could tell he meant it .
Pick the one or at most two best speakers , and have them do most of the talking .
Exception :
If one of the founders is an expert in some specific technical field , it can be good for them to talk about that for a minute or so .
This kind of " expert witness " can add credibility , even if the audience does n't understand all the details .
If Jobs and Wozniak had 10 minutes to present the Apple II , it might be a good plan to have Jobs speak for 9 minutes and have Woz speak for a minute in the middle about some of the technical feats he 'd pulled off in the design .
( Though of course if it were actually those two , Jobs would speak for the entire 10 minutes . )
9 . Seem confident .
Between the brief time available and their lack of technical background , many in the audience will have a hard time evaluating what you 're doing .
Probably the single biggest piece of evidence , initially , will be your own confidence in it .
You have to show you 're impressed with what you 've made .
And I mean show , not tell .
Never say " we 're passionate " or " our product is great . "
People just ignore that — or worse , write you off as bullshitters .
Such messages must be implicit .
What you must not do is seem nervous and apologetic .
If you 've truly made something good , you 're doing investors a favor by telling them about it .
If you do n't genuinely believe that , perhaps you ought to change what your company is doing .
If you do n't believe your startup has such promise that you'd be doing them a favor by letting them invest , why are you investing your time in it ?
10 .
Do n't try to seem more than you are .
Do n't worry if your company is just a few months old and does n't have an office yet , or your founders are technical people with no business experience .
Google was like that once , and they turned out ok .
Smart investors can see past such superficial flaws .
They 're not looking for finished , smooth presentations .
They 're looking for raw talent .
All you need to convince them of is that you 're smart and that you 're onto something good .
If you try too hard to conceal your rawness — by trying to seem corporate , or pretending to know about stuff you do n't — you may just conceal your talent .
You can afford to be candid about what you have n't figured out yet .
Do n't go out of your way to bring it up ( e.g. by having a slide about what might go wrong ) , but do n't try to pretend either that you 're further along than you are .
If you 're a hacker and you 're presenting to experienced investors , they 're probably better at detecting bullshit than you are at producing it .
11 . Do n't put too many words on slides .
When there are a lot of words on a slide , people just skip reading it .
So look at your slides and ask of each word " could I cross this out ? "
This includes gratuitous clip art .
Try to get your slides under 20 words if you can .
Do n't read your slides .
They should be something in the background as you face the audience and talk to them , not something you face and read to an audience sitting behind you .
Cluttered sites do n't do well in demos , especially when they 're projected onto a screen .
At the very least , crank up the font size big enough to make all the text legible .
But cluttered sites are bad anyway , so perhaps you should use this opportunity to make your design simpler .
12 . Specific numbers are good .
If you have any kind of data , however preliminary , tell the audience .
Numbers stick in people 's heads .
If you can claim that the median visitor generates 12 page views , that 's great .
But do n't give them more than four or five numbers , and only give them numbers specific to you .
You do n't need to tell them the size of the market you 're in .
Who cares , really , if it 's 500 million or 5 billion a year ?
Talking about that is like an actor at the beginning of his career telling his parents how much Tom Hanks makes .
Yeah , sure , but first you have to become Tom Hanks .
The important part is not whether he makes ten million a year or a hundred , but how you get there .
13 . Tell stories about users .
The biggest fear of investors looking at early stage startups is that you 've built something based on your own a priori theories of what the world needs , but that no one will actually want .
So it 's good if you can talk about problems specific users have and how you solve them .
Greg Mcadoo said one thing Sequoia looks for is the " proxy for demand . "
What are people doing now , using inadequate tools , that shows they need what you 're making ?
Another sign of user need is when people pay a lot for something .
It 's easy to convince investors there will be demand for a cheaper alternative to something popular , if you preserve the qualities that made it popular .
The best stories about user needs are about your own .
A remarkable number of famous startups grew out of some need the founders had : Apple , Microsoft , Yahoo , Google .
Experienced investors know that , so stories of this type will get their attention .
The next best thing is to talk about the needs of people you know personally , like your friends or siblings .
14 . Make a soundbite stick in their heads .
Professional investors hear a lot of pitches .
After a while they all blur together .
The first cut is simply to be one of those they remember .
And the way to ensure that is to create a descriptive phrase about yourself that sticks in their heads .
In Hollywood , these phrases seem to be of the form " x meets y . "
In the startup world , they 're usually " the x of y " or " the x y . "
Viaweb 's was " the Microsoft Word of ecommerce . "
Find one and launch it clearly ( but apparently casually ) in your talk , preferably near the beginning .
It 's a good exercise for you , too , to sit down and try to figure out how to describe your startup in one compelling phrase .
If you can't , your plans may not be sufficiently focused .

WASHINGTON — When President Bush met with a group of business school students in the Indian city of Hyderabad last week , he came face to face with the very people whose first - rate educations , rising aspirations and readiness to work for a fraction of U.S. wages were tugging jobs overseas , away from even well - educated Americans .
Bush used the occasion to offer some pointed advice to workers back home :
Get more training .
“ Let ’s make sure people are educated so they can fill the jobs of the 21st century , ” he said .
But the president ’s assertion that the answer to foreign outsourcing is education , a mantra embraced by Democrats as well as Republicans , is being challenged by a growing body of research and analysis from economists and other scholars .
Education — at least as delivered by most of the nation ’s colleges , universities and technical schools — is no longer quite the economic cure - all it once was , nor the guarantee of financial security Americans have come to expect from college and graduate degrees .
“ More education has been the right answer for the past few decades , ” said Princeton University economist and former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan S. Blinder , “ but I ’m not so convinced that it ’s the right course ” for coping with the upheavals of globalization .
Not that Blinder or other experts think workers would be better off not going to school .
Rather , they point to emerging evidence that education may not offer as much protection against the effects of globalization as Bush and others claim .
“ One could be educationally competitive and easily lose out in the global economic marketplace because of significantly lower wages being paid elsewhere , ” said Sheldon E. Steinbach , general counsel of the American Council on Education , an umbrella group that represents most of the nation ’s major colleges and universities .
Some analysts think that something like what Steinbach described is already underway .
Starting in 1975 , the earnings difference between high school - and college - educated workers steadily widened for 25 years .
But since 2000 , the trend appears to have stalled .
Census figures show that average , after - inflation earnings of college graduates fell by more than 5 % between 2000 and 2004 , whereas the earnings of those with only high school degrees rose slightly .
Most studies suggest that beyond the manufacturing sector , the “ offshoring ” of jobs has been comparatively modest .
But some analysts say the ground has been laid for a substantial pickup .
In a recent paper , Blinder offered a rough estimate that suggested that as many as 42 million jobs , or nearly one - third of the nation ’s total , were susceptible to offshoring .
These analysts warn that more education alone will do little to stop the flow of jobs to other countries .
“ What ’s missing here from both parties is a global economic strategy and a worker adjustment strategy , ” said Anthony P. Carnevale , a scholar at the National Center on Education and the Economy who was appointed to major commissions by Presidents Reagan and Clinton .
“ When they do n’t know what else to do , ” he remarked , “ there ’s a tendency among politicians to stand up and say ‘ education . ’ ”
In Bush ’s case , arguing for more schooling draws particular fire from some educators , because the administration ’s record of providing money to support the kind of training he advocates has been weak .
Bush previously has defended the offshoring of jobs as an economic reality and a trend that ultimately would work in America ’s favor .
But he was exceptionally candid about its downside during his exchange with the Indian students .
“ People do lose their jobs as a result of globalization , and it ’s painful for those who lose their jobs , ” he said .
Even so , Bush continued , the only way forward for Americans is through improved education and pro-growth economic policies , not protectionism .
“ The United States of America will reject protectionism , ” he said .
“ We wo n’t fear competition .
We welcome competition . ”
In coming down foursquare against erecting trade barriers , Bush extended a string of policy positions he has taken in recent weeks that favor unfettered interaction between countries and corporations over other concerns .
These positions have fueled intense controversy , even among fellow Republicans .
The president came out strongly , for example , in favor of a plan by an Arab company to take over operations at ports on the East and Gulf coasts , though White House aides subsequently said the administration backed a 45 - day review .
The proposal by Dubai Ports World provoked bipartisan criticism that Bush was shortchanging national security .
Bush also has offered a guest - worker program that ’s faced criticism in Congress , especially from conservative Republicans who have argued that the president ’s plan would encourage more migrants to enter the country illegally .
Bush ’s latest plug for the economic importance of education , especially college and graduate education , may contain the seeds for another controversy .
Although the president has endorsed education rhetorically , many analysts say that he has not put federal money where his mouth is .
“ The president ’s record for supporting college and post - secondary jobs training is anemic , ” Carnevale said .
Total spending on Pell grants , Washington ’s chief means of providing financial aid to poor college - bound students , rose from $ 10 billion in the 2001 - 2002 school year to $ 13.1 billion last year , but that was almost entirely because more students qualified .
The average amount of aid per student barely budged in after - inflation terms .
The maximum school loan under Pell grants has steadily declined since 2002 .
At $ 4,050 per year , it covers about one - third of tuition , room and board at a public four - year college , down from 42 % when the president took office , according to the College Board , the nonpartisan assessment organization .
The president ’s 2007 budget plan calls for cutting Education Department spending by , among other things , eliminating a major loan program to help needy students attend community college .
Last week , Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) , chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees education , labeled the proposal “ scandalous ” and “ insufficient . ”
But Bush may face a bigger challenge than defending the dollar amounts his administration directs to higher education .
He could soon find himself having to defend what until recently has been almost universally accepted as fact — that going to college or graduate school is a nearly certain route to higher pay , and a sure protection against the dislocation spawned by global competition .
What ’s undermining these comfortable assumptions , some analysts say , is a basic change in the kinds of jobs that are vulnerable to offshoring .
Declines in transportation costs and improvements in communications technology — including computers and the Internet — are vastly expanding the range of things that can be bought and sold across international borders , and also the range of American workers who are exposed to international competition .
Until the last decade or so , most of what could be traded were manufactured goods that could be boxed up and sent abroad or bought overseas .
Therefore , it was mostly American manufacturing workers who faced the brunt of competition .
Services workers appeared immune and that seemed especially true of highly educated doctors , lawyers , computer programmers and financial experts .
But with the growth of the Internet , analysts say , many — although not all — sorts of service work can be performed almost anywhere in the world .
Now many kinds of service workers are finding themselves exposed to the same global competition as their manufacturing counterparts .
“ Many people blithely assume that the critical labor - market distinction is , and will remain , between highly educated ( or highly - skilled ) people and less - educated ( or less - skilled ) people , doctors versus call - center operators , for example , ” Blinder wrote in a recent article in the magazine Foreign Affairs .
The assumption is that those with higher education are either better shielded from global competition or better able to adapt to it , he said .
And this leads many policymakers to call for “ more education and a general ‘ upskilling ’ of the workforce . ”
But , Blinder wrote , the crucial distinction in the future may not be between the more - educated and less - educated , but between “ those types of work that are easily deliverable through a wire and those that are not . ”
Some education - heavy jobs such as computer programming are proving easily deliverable by wire and many programming jobs have been shifted overseas , an irony in an era when many had thought that tech - savvy workers would be among the economy ’s big winners .
2005 is nearly over , and as everyone knows , December is the time for compiling hugely subjective Top 5 ( 10 , 20 , 100 ) lists for everything under the sun .
I think it would be fun to see everybody 's favorite papers ...
Here 's mine , totally off the top of my head ( I 'm sure I 'm forgetting something essential ) :
( Do n't worry about trying to post the " best " papers in some objective sense , just whatever excited you ...
Show me what I missed this year ! )

It is “ a steppingstone to war , ” said Rep. Dennis Kucinich , during the debate over the so - called Iran Freedom Support Act , and if this vote is any measure of the degree of congressional opposition to the looming prospect of war with Tehran , then we have a lot to worry about .
Only 21 members of the House stood up against the overwhelming bipartisan wave of support for the bill , which would impose economic sanctions on the Iranians  and openly proclaims the goal of effecting “ regime change . ”
Rep. Ron Paul , a Texas Republican , said the bill reminds him of a 1998 congressional resolution  the Iraq Liberation Act  that paved the way for the Iraqi debacle .
Yet most of the “ antiwar ” contingent in the House of Representatives caved and voted in favor , including Democrats John Conyers , Maxine Waters , Jack Murtha , Bernie Sanders , Barbara Lee , and Lynn Woolsey .
The bill was opposed by the Bush administration , which officially holds that diplomacy is the way to go on the Iranian nukes issue .
Thus it was supported by many Democrats , including the voluble Tom Lantos ( D - Calif. ) , a co-author of the bill along with Florida Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen .
Passage is a major goal of AIPAC , Israel ’s premier lobbying organization in the U.S. , which for the past two years has featured the alleged Iranian threat to America as its convention theme : this year ’s conclave featured a multimedia exhibit supposedly dramatizing how Iran is “ pursuing nuclear weapons and how it can be stopped . ”
As Middle East expert Trita Parsi , of the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , put it : “ I do n’t see any other major groups behind this legislation that have had any impact on it . ”
The Israelis have made no secret of their efforts to get Uncle Sam to launch an attack .
If you guys do n’t , a number of Israeli officials have implied , then we will .
This last , however , is an empty threat , as the Israelis do n’t have the military capacity to wipe out Iran ’s widely dispersed nuclear research facilities in a single blow , and , in any case , are more than likely to wait until the last possible moment before they take the unusual step of fighting their own war .
After all , why should they , when the U.S. is perfectly willing to sacrifice American troops and treasure on the altar of Israel ’s alleged national security interests ?
Iran represents a threat to nothing and no one but Israel , and everybody knows it .
It is likewise universally acknowledged that the one Middle Eastern power we definitely know to be in possession of a substantial nuclear stockpile is Israel .
The Iranians , then , could be seen as engaging in a defensive policy of deterrence : after all , Israel has never even acknowledged its nukes , let alone declared a policy of “ no first strike . ”
Unlike the Israelis , the Iranians are signatories of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
But of course we are n’t allowed to mention that , because depicting the government of Israel as a gang of duplicitous scheming aggressors intent on holding a nuclear sword of Damocles over the entire Middle East would be “ anti-Semitic , ” according to the latest definition of anti-Semitism , albeit all too true .
The timing on this vote is significant on two counts .
Coming as it did at a time when the debate about Israel ’s inordinate influence over U.S. foreign policy is getting heated , this vote demonstrates that , as John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt point out in “ The Israel Lobby “ :
“ AIPAC , which is a de facto agent for a foreign government , has a stranglehold on the U.S. Congress .
Open debate about U.S. policy towards Israel does not occur there , even though that policy has important consequences for the entire world . ”
The sheer power of what Mearsheimer and Walt call “ the Lobby ” is further demonstrated by the general public revulsion against the consequences of our very similar policy in Iraq .
The unpopularity of our military presence in the Middle East has not deterred politicians from jumping on the war - with - Tehran bandwagon .
Even as ( some ) Democratic lawmakers decry the occupation of Iraq and call for a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal , they join in the war whoops of the neoconservatives who are pushing to ignite a new war with Tehran .
So much for the Democratic Party as a vehicle for antiwar sentiment .
While the Iran Freedom Support Act contains language explicitly disavowing the charge that it represents a blank check for war with Iran , that is precisely what it does .
It sets the stage for isolating Iran economically and paves the way for the creation of an Iranian version of Ahmed Chalabi and his “ heroes in error . ”
We will , once again , pay for the privilege of being lied to .
As that old Peter , Paul , and Mary song goes : “ When will they ever learn ?
When will they ever learn ? ”
In the Senate , the primary proponents of this bill are likely to be Hillary Clinton and the rabidly neocon wing of the Republican Party .
Hillary came out for sanctions long ago , and , in a fiery speech to AIPAC , stopped just short of calling for war with Iran if the mullahs did not cease and desist .
Go here for an entirely plausible “ future history ” account of “ the tragedy that followed Hillary Clinton ’s bombing of Iran in 2009 . ”
The matter - of - fact opening of Timothy Garton Ash ’s near - future scenario is frighteningly plausible :
“ May 7 , 2009 , will surely go down in history alongside September 11 , 2001 .
‘ 5/7 , ’ as it inevitably became known , saw massive suicide bombings in Tel Aviv , London , and New York , as well as simultaneous attacks on the remaining Western troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Total casualties were estimated at around 10,000 dead and many more wounded .
The attacks , which included the explosion of a so - called dirty bomb in London , were orchestrated by a Tehran - based organization for ‘ martyrdom - seeking operations ’ established in 2004 .
‘ 5/7 ’ was the Islamic Republic of Iran ’s response to the bombing of its nuclear facilities , which President Hillary Clinton had ordered in March 2009 . ”
Seymour Hersh and others seem to think the Bush administration will beat President Hillary to it , and that military operations involving both the Americans and the Israelis have already commenced .
The Iran Freedom Support
Act would merely drag these covert activities up into the sunlight , although their roots would stay submerged in the murky underworld of shadowy exile groups and Pentagon subcontractors .
Passage of the Act would give rise to a whole new sector of the democracy - export business .
Iranian exile groups  including monarchists , Marxists , and a motley collection of alleged “ democrats ”  would vie for funds and the American imprimatur .
A new gold rush for the democracy exporters would commence , shifting the scene of the action from Iraq to Iran , even as the War Party sets its sights on the latter .
Let no one say they were against this war with Iran , when it comes , if they did n’t vote with the heroic 21 naysayers .
These sanctions against Iran are but a prelude to war , just as sanctions were the first step in the long run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
However , we may not enjoy such a lengthy interval between cause and effect this time around .
Events are proceeding at an ever accelerating pace , with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice now saying the time for talking is over and the time for action has begun  not military action ( at least not yet ) , but action by the Security Council of the United Nations , whose “ credibility is at stake . ”
I wonder if that same standard applies to the many UN resolutions that Israel continues to defy .
Has n’t the UN already lost all credibility when such brazen defiance has gone unnoticed by the Security Council ?
Let no one say they were n’t warned .
Using Iraq as a “ model ” for the methodology of the War Party , we can see , when it comes to Iran , that all the elements are falling neatly into place .
Once again , we have the specter of WMD and their possible existence or nonexistence : a mirage projected by the credulous Western “ mainstream ” media , one that is sure to dissipate only after we ’re waist - deep in an Iranian quagmire .
Another familiar phenomenon : dubious exile groups , along the lines of the infamous Iraqi National Congress , only this time even wackier , wilder , and woolier .
The Bush administration is going too slow for the Lobby ’s taste , and the House vote is a good indication of their displeasure .
In spite of widespread antiwar sentiment and a general disgust with the notion of meddling in the affairs of other nations , the War Party has effectively seized control not only of major policymaking bodies of the U.S. government , but also both major political parties .
Mearsheimer and Walt describe the campaign by Israel ’s amen corner to rush us into another war :
“ The Bush administration has responded to the Lobby ’s pressure by working overtime to shut down Iran ’s nuclear program .
But Washington has had little success , and Iran seems determined to get a nuclear arsenal .
As a result , the Lobby has intensified its pressure on the U.S. government , using all of the strategies in its playbook . ”
One new strategy is to be prepared to abandon the Republicans if a sufficiently warlike Democrat  such as Hillary Clinton  wins the nod for a White House run .
As for this White House , while it may have developed plans for an attack on Iran , the current administration seems eager to draw out the diplomatic dance as long as possible , even in the face of what Mearsheimer and Walt depict as a Katrina - like storm of propaganda and political pressure :
“ Op-eds and articles now warn of imminent dangers from a nuclear Iran , caution against any appeasement of a ‘ terrorist ’ regime , and hint darkly of preventive action should diplomacy fail .
The Lobby is also pushing Congress to approve the Iran Freedom Support Act , which would expand existing sanctions on Iran .
Israeli officials also warn they may take preemptive action should Iran continue down the nuclear road , hints partly intended to keep Washington focused on this issue . ”
The Lobby is on the march , and war is in the wind .
The cries of the banshee pundits and the sonorous resolutions coming out of Israeli - occupied Capitol Hill , are portents of the coming storm .
Mearsheimer and Walt , two distinguished professors from two of our nation ’s most prestigious universities , have been vilified by the Amen Corner and have had their thesis twisted and willfully misunderstood by ultra-Zionists and anti-Semites alike .
They have admirably refused to get down in the gutter with such dishonest , agenda - driven scribblers , and instead have let their work speak for itself as a predictor and critic of U.S. policy in the Middle East :
“ One might argue that Israel and the Lobby have not had much influence on U.S. policy toward Iran , because the United States has its own reasons to keep Iran from going nuclear .
This is partly true , but Iran ’s nuclear ambitions do not pose an existential threat to the United States .
If Washington could live with a nuclear Soviet Union , a nuclear China , or even a nuclear North Korea , then it can live with a nuclear Iran .
And that is why the Lobby must keep constant pressure on U.S. politicians to confront Tehran .
Iran and the United States would hardly be allies if the Lobby did not exist , but U.S. policy would be more temperate and preventive war would not be a serious option . ”
As for this essay ’s predictive value : in light of the knowledge that it was commissioned by The Atlantic magazine and written sometime last year , the section on the Iran nuke issue seems prescient , an ample demonstration of the paper ’s thesis  that the Israel lobby has hijacked American foreign policy , especially when it comes to the Middle East .
Mearsheimer and Walt ’s critique of U.S. policy , as distorted by neoconservative fealty to Israel , is more than borne out by the Iran nuke brouhaha .
Iranian missiles trained on Tel Aviv , or even London , do not a threat to the U.S. make .
It is doubtful they represent a plausible threat even to the targeted cities , as the threat of massive retaliation in kind would successfully deter such a heinous act , just as it deterred Stalin and his successors for half a century .
It is both alarming and baffling that we have any number of lobbies operating out of Washington on behalf of dozens of foreign countries : not only Israel , but all sorts of overseas potentates and unsavory dictators of one sort or another have their bought - and - paid - for Amen Corners in the form of at least one pricey public relations firm .
But I have yet to hear of a foreign policy lobby that operates on behalf of Americans  that looks out for exclusively American interests .
Why is n’t there a countering force arrayed against all these foreign agents and their domestic allies who push for the narrow interests of the “ homeland ”  usually at Uncle Sam ’s expense ?
Who will lobby Congress to start putting America first ?
FORTUNE EXCLUSIVE :
The world 's second richest man - who 's now worth $ 44 billion - tells editor - at - large Carol Loomis he will start giving away 85 % of his wealth in July - most of it to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
NEW YORK ( FORTUNE Magazine ) --
We were sitting in a Manhattan living room on a spring afternoon , and Warren Buffett had a Cherry Coke in his hand as usual .
But this unremarkable scene was about to take a surprising turn .
" Brace yourself , " Buffett warned with a grin .
He then described a momentous change in his thinking .
Within months , he said , he would begin to give away his Berkshire Hathaway fortune , then and now worth well over $ 40 billion .
This news was indeed stunning .
Buffett , 75 , has for decades said his wealth would go to philanthropy but has just as steadily indicated the handoff would be made at his death .
Now he was revising the timetable .
" I know what I want to do , " he said , " and it makes sense to get going . "
On that spring day his plan was uncertain in some of its details ; today it is essentially complete .
And it is typical Buffett : rational , original , breaking the mold of how extremely rich people donate money .
Buffett has pledged to gradually give 85 % of his Berkshire stock to five foundations .
A dominant five - sixths of the shares will go to the world 's largest philanthropic organization , the $ 30 billion Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , whose principals are close friends of Buffett 's ( a connection that began in 1991 , when a mutual friend introduced Buffett and Bill Gates ) .
The Gateses credit Buffett , says Bill , with having " inspired " their thinking about giving money back to society .
Their foundation 's activities , internationally famous , are focused on world health -- fighting such diseases as malaria , HIV / AIDS , and tuberculosis -- and on improving U.S. libraries and high schools .
Up to now , the two Gateses have been the only trustees of their foundation .
But as his plan gets underway , Buffett will be joining them .
Bill Gates says he and his wife are " thrilled " by that and by knowing that Buffett 's money will allow the foundation to " both deepen and accelerate " its work .
" The generosity and trust Warren has shown , " Gates adds , " is incredible . "
Beginning in July and continuing every year , Buffett will give a set , annually declining number of Berkshire B shares - starting with 602,500 in 2006 and then decreasing by 5 % per year - to the five foundations .
The gifts to the Gates foundation will be made either by Buffett or through his estate as long as at least one of the pair -- Bill , now 50 , or Melinda , 41 -- is active in it .
Berkshire 's price on the date of each gift will determine its dollar value .
Were B shares , for example , to be $ 3,071 in July - that was their close on June 23 - Buffett 's 2006 gift to the foundation , 500,000 shares , would be worth about $ 1.5 billion .
With so much new money to handle , the foundation will be given two years to resize its operations .
But it will then be required by the terms of Buffett 's gift to annually spend the dollar amount of his contributions as well as those it is already making from its existing assets .
At the moment , $ 1.5 billion would roughly double the foundation 's yearly benefactions .
But the $ 1.5 billion has little relevance to the value of Buffett 's future gifts , since their amount will depend on the price of Berkshire 's stock when they are made .
If the stock rises yearly , on average , by even a modest amount - say , 6 % - the gain will more than offset the annual 5 % decline in the number of shares given .
Under those circumstances , the value of Buffett 's contributions will rise .
Buffett himself thinks that will happen .
Or to state that proposition more directly :
He believes the price of Berkshire , and with it the dollar size of the contributions , will trend upward - perhaps over time increasing substantially .
The other foundation gifts that Buffett is making will also occur annually and start in July .
At Berkshire 's current price , the combined 2006 total of these gifts will be $ 315 million .
The contributions will go to foundations headed by Buffett 's three children , Susan , Howard , and Peter , and to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation .
This last foundation was for 40 years known simply as the Buffett Foundation and was recently renamed in honor of Buffett 's late wife , Susie , who died in 2004 , at 72 , after a stroke .
Her will bestows about $ 2.5 billion on the foundation , to which her husband 's gifts will be added .
The foundation has mainly focused on reproductive health , family planning , and pro-choice causes , and on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons .
Counting the gifts to all five foundations , Buffett will gradually but sharply reduce his holdings of Berkshire ( Charts ) stock .
He now owns close to 31 % of the company - worth nearly $ 44 billion in late June - and that proportion will ultimately be cut to around 5 % .
Sticking to his long - term intentions , Buffett says the residual 5 % , worth about $ 6.8 billion today , will in time go for philanthropy also , perhaps in his lifetime and , if not , at his death .
Because the value of Buffett 's gifts are tied to a future , unknowable price of Berkshire , there is no way to put a total dollar value on them .
But the number of shares earmarked to be given have a huge value today : $ 37 billion .
That alone would be the largest philanthropic gift in history .
And if Buffett is right in thinking that Berkshire 's price will trend upward , the eventual amount given could far exceed that figure .
So that 's the plan .
What follows is a conversation in which Buffett explains how he moved away from his original thinking and decided to begin giving now .
The questioner is yours truly , FORTUNE editor - at - large Carol Loomis .
I am a longtime friend of Buffett's , a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder , and a director of the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation .
F ull - time freelancing : 10 more things in 360 days
~ 24 April 2006 ~
Back in December when I authored the first “ 10 things learned ” article , two events were celebrated : 1 ) Suzanne ’s birthday and 2 ) 6 months of full - time freelancing .
This time around , three events warrant mention : 1 ) Hudson ’s first birthday , 2 ) my birthday ( the big 3 - 0 no less ! ) , and 3 ) 12 months of full - time freelancing .
All within the first week of May .
Yet again , somehow it — “ it ” being full - time freelancing — has worked out .
Not without plenty of ups and downs , of course : Passing up the chance to work at Apple , getting blasted with nasty email from grammarati , an appearance on stage with Craig Newmark , and so on .
I ’ve found myself in extremely good company the last 6 months , and I ’ve enjoyed the ride immensely .
But every rose has its thorn , right ?
Some of the best lessons offered in life seemingly come only following failure .
I ’ll be the first to admit I ’m no expert at offering freelancing advice , but I hope a few things I ’ve learned will assist you in setting up or optimizing your own shop .
1. Speed is paramount .
I ca n’t stress this enough .
I hate , HATE to sacrifice quality for speed .
Those of you familiar with my work know of the level of detail I put in my designs .
But truth of the matter is it ’s simply good business to be efficient more often than not .
We live , work , and sleep in a global economy that moves at lightening speed .
I repeat something I said a couple years back :
There ’s a point at which quality becomes too costly — find that point with every project .
If additional quality is both too expensive and unnoticeable by the client and its audience , it ’s time to move on to other things .
2 . Late fees a happy contract maketh .
Oops .
I missed the boat on this one .
I got stuck with a few past due balances owed to me by clients — a couple 60 + days late and even one 90 + days late .
Now , aside from the fact that billing is cyclical to begin with , i.e. revenue earned in one month is typically based on work from the previous month , having outstanding balances for two even three months at a time can be detrimental to one ’s income .
Guess what happens next ?
You start to be late on your own bills — phone , utilities , etc — and you then incur late fees of your own .
See where I ’m going with this ?
Long story short :
Be sure your contract includes stipulations for late fees as 1 ) a catalyst for encouraging faster payment and 2 ) a way to recoup losses .
3. Escape the trap of endless email .
I ’m still trying to escape this mother of a trap .
Sending and replying to email easily consumes over an hour of every morning .
Client mail comes first .
After that , I attempt to respond to nearly every note I receive from readers and colleagues .
I ’d hate to see that change , but perhaps there may come a time in the near future when necessity forces me to do otherwise .
And while I still have n’t found the optimal escape route , Keith Robinson ’s “ A Guide to Email Triage ” is at least a start .
4 . If there is n’t time to do it right now , you can bet on even less time to do it later .
Think you ’ll have time later to get around to something that could otherwise be done now ?
Think again .
Bite the bullet , knock it out now , and avoid accumulating that inevitable , overwhelming stack of pending work .
5 . Be slow to burn bridges .
Some orchids take years to produce their first bloom .
I ’ve heard six years , even fifteen .
Consider taking just as long to burn any bridges with clients , key contacts , and just plain old friends in general .
In my one - year tenure as a full - time freelancer , I ’ve already burned a couple bridges I wish I would n’t have .
Never underestimate the value of a working relationship , even if things go sour .
Yes , it ’s wise to know when to exit an ailing relationship — in love , in business , in friendship .
But wiser is he that knows how to exit .
Find a way out peaceably .
6 . Staying focused is a luxury few freelancers enjoy .
Did I just write that ?
I did .
Think about it :
You ’re on your own .
You ’re the boss .
If you lack the necessary self - control to stay on task , life as a freelancer may not be your cup of tea .
I struggle much like anyone else , so it ’s a continual battle to keep waywardness in check .
Refresh the RSS feeds only once per day .
Use IM sparingly .
Multi -task less ( yes , less ) .
“ Great souls have wills ; feeble ones have only wishes ” suggests one Chinese proverb .
Stay on task , or you ’ll be left wishing you had .
7 . Send a signed W - 9 with the contract or first invoice .
Want that deposit or up - front payment faster ?
Consider including a signed W - 9 when you fax the signed contract or first invoice and you may be one step closer .
Some clients require them , others do n’t .
But I ’ve found that some of my client contacts forget about this until it comes to time to cut the first check .
But by then , your contract / invoice has been sent to Accounting , and it ’s a bit of a run-around at that point .
8 . Trust your gut .
No really .
If something does n’t feel right — the pushy prospective client , the shady list of deliverables , the questionable revenue model , etc. — it probably is n’t .
I ’ve turned down a fair share of projects based solely on the fact that something did n’t feel right at the outset .
Fact of the matter is you ’ll inevitably be faced with unknown variables in any decision , no matter how well you do your homework .
So do n’t bite if you ca n’t see the hook .
9 . Do n’t under - promise , over - deliver .
Instead , promise consistency , deliver consistency .
We ’ve all heard the cliched phrase too many times before .
“ Under - promise , over - deliver ! ”
That ’s a noble ideal many aspire to , while failing to prepare for the costs incurred by over - delivering .
Further , it ’s easy to exceed expectations the first time with a client , but extremely difficult subsequent times .
Instead , analyze the deliverables as best you can , set reasonable expectations , word the contract accordingly , and then go give it your best .
Clients will typically come to you for one or two specific reasons — they ’ve been told you ’ve got a great turn - around time , or they know you as someone who always puts out quality , and so on .
So promise quality and deliver quality .
Or promise speed and deliver speed .
Whatever you excel in , be consistent at it .
10 . Do n’t Mess with Taxes .
I originally had a few thoughts to offer on this matter .
But Doug Bowman ’s “ Reserving Enough for Uncle Sam ” seems to say it all better than I could .
In summary , set up a separate interest - bearing account strictly for taxes , and then deposit a percentage of revenue immediately upon receiving any payment .
Your percentage will vary , but 30 % is probably a safe place to start .
And that ’s all she wrote .
This is probably the last time I ’ll author thoughts on the subject , as there are plenty of other resources offering even better advice than mine .
Hopefully my 2c helps you earn your 2c a little more wisely .

According to Klee Kleber , Segway ’s vice president for marketing , the new models have a technology called LeanSteer , which enables the vehicle to intuit whether the rider wants to go left or right .

Segway
“ We ’ve taken that last piece of conventional user experience ” — a steering wheel — and “ replaced it with the magic that existed elsewhere in the product , ” said Mr. Kleber .
In its first incarnation , Segway had movement controls for backward and forward only .
Now , he said , the riding experience is “ very fluid .
You lean whichever direction you want to go . ”
The new Segways also come with a wireless controller , resembling a big digital watch , that allows a user to turn the vehicle on from a distance .
In addition to keeping tabs on a rider ’s speed and mileage , the device has an alarm that notifies the owner when someone else steps on the vehicle .
“ It would beep or squawk , ” Mr. Kleber said .
Though Segway , which is privately held , does not disclose exact sales figures , Mr. Kleber said sales had climbed about 50 percent a year , with “ tens of thousands ” of vehicles sold around the world .
He noted that 40 percent of sales had been to commercial buyers , including tour guide companies and police departments .
Despite the Segway ’s environmental benefits , getting individuals to buy the vehicle remains a challenge , said Mr. Kleber .

How to help civilians
Lebanon president :
We will fight invaders ' Violence brings violence ... everybody will lose , ' Lahoud says Lebanese President Emile Lahoud is calling for a cease - fire but says the country will defend itself if invaded .
QUICKVOTE Can Israel 's offensive destroy Hezbollah ?
Yes No or View Results YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Lebanon Israel Emile Lahoud or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) -- President Emile Lahoud has urged the Lebanese to remain united in the face of an Israeli offensive against Hezbollah and logistical targets in Lebanon that was in its tenth day Saturday .
In an interview with CNN 's Nic Robertson , Lahoud again called for a cessation of the violence and said that if a cease - fire can't be brokered , the Lebanese army is prepared to defend the country -- and Lebanese solidarity ultimately will save the nation .
ROBERTSON : Mr. Lahoud , it 's now 10 days into this war .
Is your country any closer to a cease - fire ?
LAHOUD : I 'm afraid to say it is not .
And really all the time , massacres are happening in Lebanon .
All the infrastructure is being hit and we are paying very high price .
We have women , children , all are being hit by planes .
And they never stop , people think that they will stop for a few hours .
They go out to get their food or anything and suddenly they are hit again .
This is a real massacre .
( Watch Lahoud 's complete interview -- 10:25 ) ROBERTSON :
Do you think that the war is spiraling out of control and getting worse ?
LAHOUD : It is getting much worse , and day after day more targets are getting hit .
As you know the airport has been hit , all bridges , big bridges , small bridges , and now the roads .
Only yesterday , only 200 meters from here , at 11 at night , they hit the road .
Just like this , they are creating fear and , really , it is cycling to the point of no return .
That is why that as soon as possible we are asking that there be a cease - fire .
ROBERTSON :
Is there enough diplomacy under way , international diplomacy , to bring that cease - fire ?
LAHOUD : Yes , we 've had lots of visitors coming from abroad .
But unfortunately they are talking , going , and coming and talking all the time but with no result .
And this makes us think , is there anything behind that ?
Do they want to give more time to Israel to hit more ?
ROBERTSON : Do they ?
LAHOUD : Well , I think they are giving more time to Israel to hit , thinking that maybe Hezbollah will give up .
Hezbollah will not give up .
And because of that there will be more casualties , more destruction .
ROBERTSON : But as commander in chief of the army , why do n't you tell the Lebanese army to stop Hezbollah and then bring an end to this ?
LAHOUD : Well , if you knew the interior politics of Lebanon , you will understand that in 2000 Hezbollah was the main liberator of our land .
And at the time , the Lebanese army was and still is with what is happening on the frontier .
Because , you see , what was happening was Israel with airplanes ... but having the resistance , they think twice .
And because of that there is no animosity between the army and the resistance .
...
The resistance are Lebanese .
ROBERTSON : Do you mean the army supports Hezbollah at this time in their fight against Israel ?
LAHOUD : Believe me , what we get from our side is nothing compared to if there is an internal conflict in Lebanon .
So out thanks comes when we are united , and we are really united , and the national army is doing its work according to the government , and the resistance is respected in the whole Arab world from the population point of view .
And very highly respected in Lebanon as well .
ROBERTSON : If you were to call on the army now to stop Hezbollah from attacking Israel , to stop Israel therefore attacking Lebanon .
Would that divide the army along sectarian lines ?
Would the Shiites in the army go with Hezbollah ?
LAHOUD : In the first place , I would n't give such an order .
Believe me , Hezbollah has done a lot for Lebanon in liberating this land .
... Hezbollah is part of the government .
ROBERTSON : Would you call upon the Lebanese army to join the fight if Israel invades on a land invasion in large numbers across the border ?
( Watch how mismatched the Lebanese army would be against Israel -- 1:45 ) LAHOUD :
Of course , the army is going to defend its land , and inside Lebanon they can do a lot .
They can not be strong enough to be against Israel on the frontier , because they have much more stronger materiel and weaponry .
Inside [ Lebanon ] they know the land and , of course , they will fight the invading folks of Israel if it tries to come inside .
ROBERTSON : You will give them an order to go fight along the border ?
LAHOUD : It 's not Lahoud who gives them the order , it 's the government .
And I 'm sure the government will give the order not to allow Israelis to invade Lebanon , for sure .
ROBERTSON : How close is this country to moving its army into the fight now ?
LAHOUD : Well , I can't tell you now .
What we 're thinking is to have a cease - fire .
That 's what we 're thinking because things that have been happening have not been happening before .
I 'll give you an example :
Only yesterday , 23 tons of ammunition explosives came on one building , one mosque that is being built .
That is more than is a tactical nuclear bomb .
That means that they are using like a tactical nuclear [ bomb ] .
But because [ it is ] conventional weaponry , no one is saying anything .
But the result is really havoc , and we can not accept it .
So before thinking about anything else and telling the army what to do and all that , the international community must really , as soon as possible , stop this killing , stop this fire .
And then after that we can talk about what to do .
ROBERTSON : What are the terms of a deal that have to be worked out , and who is going to tell Hezbollah to stop fighting ?
LAHOUD : If there is a cease - fire then they will start talking about everything .
...
And they were discussing it , and they postponed the meeting for the end of this month to talk about the same subject .
So why not let the Lebanese between themselves solve this thing ?
ROBERTSON : Can the Lebanese government accept a buffer zone , an international buffer zone , with the strength of U.N. force between Lebanon and Israel ?
LAHOUD : All of these subjects can be talked about after the cease - fire , because if you talk about it now it 's up to the decision of the Lebanese to decide that and the government .
Now , if we start talking about this , this is between the Lebanese , and probably that is what Israel is trying to do because by hitting all the time it makes maybe some Lebanese have conflict with other Lebanese .
And it has been trying six years to do that .
...
And now that the Lebanese are united they are trying to find a way to divide them .
We 're going to stay united , and that 's what makes the strength of Lebanon .
And we want ourselves to solve our problems , not to force these problems on us .
Because when you force these problems , believe me , when we are united nobody can do it .
And the proof is that when in 2000 nobody believed we could liberate our land but we could do it because the Lebanese were united and the national army was with the united Lebanon and with the resistance .
ROBERTSON : Not everyone supports Hezbollah , and there are divisions in this community .
And this country fought a 15 - year civil war over those divisions .
Those divisions are re-emerging below the surface of support of the attacks that are going on .
Those figures could realistically grow bigger .
LAHOUD : Yes , but we 're not going to let them .
Because the Lebanese have learned the lesson .
Because when they fight between themselves it 's much worse than having someone come from outside .
Because we 've seen what happened in ' 75 because we paid a very high price .
Now , being united , whatever Israel can do we stay strong , because this makes the morale of the Lebanese stronger when they are united and no one can beat them .
ROBERTSON : Having so many displaced people moving around the country , half a million according to the U.N. , raising tensions .
We saw a situation yesterday where displaced people told us they were being turned away from collection centers along sectarian , religious and ethnic lines .
LAHOUD : Believe me , this is not true because they are welcome in all our homes .
And all Lebanese are saying whoever wants to come is very welcome , and they have made centers all over Lebanon to welcome them .
...
So let 's live together and , like the late Pope John Paul said , let Lebanon , who has 17 different religious sects , is a message to the world that we can live together .
So , if we can live together under stress like now , and after this finishes we can become even stronger .
And it will be a strong message to the world that religious sectarians and people in the world can live together in peace and harmony .
ROBERTSON : Are there any behind - the - scenes diplomatic talks under way that are going to de-escalate the situation right now ?
LAHOUD : Well , we hope so .
Talks are being made and many are trying to find ways how to solve things but they are slow .
ROBERTSON : Is there anything concrete on the table ?
Any concrete plans ?
LAHOUD : Until now , no .
We have just heard secretary - general of the U.N .
He proposed the plan and said we 'll talk about it .
But children are being killed , massacred .
And we do n't see these pictures of these children in the international media because of political reasons .
If you see them , well you can't wait to talk about it and wait for these children and women with nowhere to go and live under bombs and shells .
They just live outside .
They do n't have a shelter .
We can't wait for the talks to go on .
Meanwhile the aircrafts are bombing whatever they want in Lebanon .
It never happened .
... I do n't see anything in history that has happened like what is happening now .
Airplanes are hitting civilians all over the country and [ there is no ] retaliation on these airplanes because they are civilians .
Now , they want to solve this , they must stop the fire and sit around the table and talk about this .
ROBERTSON : But if there is nothing on the table right now , the implication is that this is going to spiral out of control , get worse , and spread throughout the region .
LAHOUD : Exactly , and that 's why we 're saying we do n't want to reach the point of no return .
ROBERTSON : Are you at the point of no return yet ?
LAHOUD : Not yet .
ROBERTSON : How close ?
LAHOUD : We are close , but not yet .
We can do a lot if we can stop the fighting now .
ROBERTSON : Days or weeks ?
LAHOUD : I hope ... that we solve this problem before it escalates and then we can't stop it .
Believe me , violence brings violence , and it will be a cycle that no one will be able to get out of and everybody will lose .
If Israel thinks it 's going to win , it 's very mistaken .
You can not solve things and have peace in the region with violence .
It might be now they have all this weaponry .
But what about the children and the people who have brothers and sisters now dying ?
Well , they 're pushing them to , really , well , they do n't have anything to lose .
For them , their life is nothing , so whatever will do to them .
In the future they will seek revenge .
So the only way [ is ] to stop the firing right now for the good of everybody .
ROBERTSON : There 's no timeframe yet for Secretary Rice to visit the region , how much does that concern you ?
LAHOUD : Well , I can tell you it was said two days ago that she was coming and she did n't come .
...
But it 's not coming and going that counts , it 's the solution that counts .
We hope they have a solution for the cease - fire .
ROBERTSON : What 's the solution that 's going to work here ?
LAHOUD : Cease - fire and then we talk .
ROBERTSON : How do you get the cease - fire ?
The Israelis want their soldiers back .
LAHOUD : There were three in Lebanon that have been in prison since 30 years .
And there were many , and there was an exchange .
So why now , suddenly , after taking two soldiers they have done such a retaliation ?
Because I believe all was planned from before and , unfortunately , they were waiting for the moment .
And when the moment came and these two soldiers were taken , they had the plan of attack .
It 's not for the reason that the soldiers were taken , it 's for other reasons .
Because since 2000 they have wanted to take their revenge because they had to leave Lebanon .
They have other things in mind as well .
ROBERTSON : Why did n't the government keep Hezbollah under control if the situation is so potentially divisive ?
LAHOUD : All I can say is now two soldiers have been taken and in response they are doing massive destruction in Lebanon .
Is that right ?
I do n't think so because it is very disproportionate .
Two soldiers have been taken , and in the past soldiers have been taken and they exchange .
So now , why they are doing that ?
Because they have a previous plan and they are executing that plan in that way thinking they will do what they did in ' 82 .
But things have changed since ' 82 .
ROBERTSON : How ?
LAHOUD : Because it 's not like ' 82 that they can come in Lebanon and make a promenade until they reach Beirut .
These people , underground Lebanese , are ready to die for their land .
ROBERTSON : Hezbollah ?
LAHOUD : Not only Hezbollah , many people are ready to die for their land .
Would n't you do that if they go inside your country ?
You 'd do the same .
And the Lebanese army as well .
We 're not going to let anyone take our land .
We 've done it in the past , we liberated our land .
We 're not going to let them come back and take it from us .
ROBERTSON : How bad is the humanitarian situation right now ?
LAHOUD : It 's a catastrophe .
If I told you there 's nothing to eat , nothing to put fuel in their cars , electricity is nearly always stopped .
You can't go on the road because you do n't know when an aircraft hits you .
...
And we know very well , by the satellite you can see the number of the part .
So how can they make that mistake ?
They 're using these ways to make people afraid and leave the country and then bring down the morale of the people .
And then at the end they come and occupy and do what they did at the end of ' 82 , or change everything in Lebanon and have it the way they want it like they did in ' 82 .
We 're not going to let them .
ROBERTSON : How bad is the destruction ?
How long will it take the country to rebuild ?
How much will it cost the country ?
LAHOUD : Only today I [ was ] told that everything is going up quickly .
Now it 's $ 3 billion , only two days ago it was $ 2 billion .
...
Well , some bridges take five years to build , so it will take the same .
But even then we do n't want to reach the point of no return .
Because once you reach the point of return , it becomes desperate , and he 's ready to die for his country and this becomes a big problem for everybody .

私はプログラマです 。
プログラムを書いて生活の糧を得ています。
プログラマというのは精神的にも肉体的にも過酷な仕事だと思われています。
夜遅くまでディスプレイに向かい、 キーボードを叩き、ジャンクフードを食べながらバグをとる…そんな職業だと思われています。
確かにそういうところもありますが、プログラマも人間です。
不健康な生活を長いこと続けることはできません。
趣味でプログラムを作っているならいざ知らず、
職業としてプログラムを作っている場合には、
ある程度のストレスはしかたがありません。 けれど、ちょっと考え方を変えたり、 休息の取り方を工夫するだけで驚くほど体と心の健康を守ることができるのです。
このページでは、 プログラマとしての私のささやかな経験談をお話しようと思います。 何らかの形であなたのお役に立てばいいのですが。
( 1996年10月10 日 )
もう一言 ： このページを公開してから、 驚くほどたくさんの方から反響のメールをいただきました。 ほとんどすべて が 「 おもしろかった 」 「 役に立った 」 「 同感である」という内容でした。 ここに深く感謝いたします。
興味深いのは、メールの多くが 「 私はプログラマではありませんが…」と注釈をつけて
書かれていたことです。 それによって結城は、 ここに書かれていることが プログラマという職業に限定されることではなく
多種の方々に当てはまることを知りました。
これを今、読んでいる「あなた」も、ぜひご意見ご感想をおよせください。 お待ちしております。

コンピュータの社会の変化は激しい。 何だか常に必死で走っていなきゃ脱落していく気分になる。
いや、実際そうやって仕事を失っていく人もいる（んじゃないか？）。
コンピュータの雑誌や専門紙を読む。 メールマガジンを購読し、インターネットで情報収集する。
そうしないと話題についていけないからだ。
次から次へと新製品が登場し、新しいプログラミング環境が登場し…。
そういうせかせかした生活を長年続けていると、神経が参ってくる。
実際、私も、そのような生活が続いて雑誌や専門紙を読むと気分が悪くなるときがあった。
いや、今でも少しそのケがある。
情報不安というのは、次から次へと情報を入手していないと不安になり、
けれどその情報の多さに圧倒されてしまう兆候だ。
こういう用語があるかどうかは知らない。 私は私の症状にそう名前をつけた。
情報不安から逃れるにはどうしたらいいんだろう。
私が情報不安に襲われたときにとる方法は、
「 いや、 これが飯のタネ だと考える 」ことである。
あーあ、こんなに新しい概念が出てきて勉強することがどんどん増えていく→いや、これが飯のタネだ。
こういう目にあっているのは自分だけじゃない。
だったら、自分の理解した分でも人にうまく伝えられたら何か仕事になるんじゃないか。
そのように前向きに考えるとだいぶよい。（私の場合はね）
もう一つの方法は 、 「 あ、また情報不安に襲われている。ということは私は疲れているのだ 」
と自覚することである。 ちょうどコンパイラが warning を出したら、ソースを再度チェックするように、
情報不安に襲われたら、自分の生活をチェックするのである。
不安に巻き込まれるのではない。 不安の症状を自分の健康を測ってくれるインジケータだと思うのである。
まあ、酒飲んで寝ちゃうというのもいい手ですが。

人間関係を円滑にする最もよい方法は「人の話を聞くこと」です。
「 人のいうことをきく」というのとちょっと違いますよ。
人の言うとおりにするわけではなく、 とにかく相手のしゃべっている話の内容を聞くのである。
自分の意見を出すのはちょっととめておく。
でもね…というのはわきにおいておく。 僕もそう思っていた…といいたくなるのをちょっと待ってみる。
それ、こないだも聞いた…というはなおさら。
とにかく、聞く。聞く。聞く。最後まで聞く。 中断せずに聞く。意見を言わずに聞く。 「 もっと聞きたい」というそぶりを見せて聞く。
とにかく聞く 。
やってみればわかるが、これはとても難しい。 ついついいろいろいいたくなるのである。一度やってみてください。
「 意見を言わずにとにかく聞く」というのは、 言い換えれば「 事実認定 」 と「価値判断」を分離することなのである。
相手があることを言っているという事実を尊重するということである。
価値判断（それはよい、わるい、私もそう思う、自分はそう思わない）というのはいつでもできる。
でも、相手が話しているという今の事実、今の経験は今尊重するしかない。
…その態度が相手と自分の人間関係をよくするのです。
いちおう理屈をつけてみたけれど、 私は経験上、 「人の話を最後まで聞く」という態度で人間関係が悪くなった例を知りません。
逆に人の話を最後まで聞かなかったためにトラブるという場合はよくあるのです。
とにかく聞く。人の話を最後まで聞く。一度やってみてくださいな。

睡眠はバグをとる 。
別に、眠っている間にバグがとれるわけではないです。
もちろん、デバッガを使い、ソースとにらめっこをして、
エディタをたたいて、バグはとれていくのです。
けれどもそれを支えているのは何でしょう。
あなたのデバッグ能力を支えているのは何でしょう。
知識？ 経験？ 情報収集能力？ もちろんそれも大事なこと。けれどももっと大事なことは、あなたの肉体的な条件です。
よく睡眠がとれているか。
きちんと運動しているか。
気力がみなぎっているか。
新しいことに挑戦しようという気迫に満ちているか。
論理的に一歩一歩つめていく根気があるか。
そういった肉体的な条件が、デバッグには有効なのです。
あなたはロボットではありません。 ろくに眠りもしないで、何日も何日も働けるわけはありません。
たとえ働けたとしてもそんな状態で書かれたコードにどれだけ信頼をおけるのでしょう…。
思い切って眠ること。 きちんと肉体を休ませてあげること。 それはとても大事なデバッグの方法の一つなのです 。
眠いときにやること --- 現在の状況をメモにして、 次に自分が覚醒したときのために情報を残しておくこと。
それは、いわば、眠ろうとしている自分から目覚めた自分への手紙です。
思い切って眠ろう。 自分の無意識に 「 いま休むことは、かえって効率があがるんだよ」と言い聞かせて眠ろう。
お腹をなでてあげよう。 自分の手を、足をさすってあげよう。
あなたは頭だけで生きているのではない。
デバッグしているとき、意識していない自分の体の各部分に
「君のことを忘れているわけじゃないんだよ」と言い聞かせよう。
睡眠はきっと、あなたのバグをとってくれるはず。

なぜか知らないが、急ぎたくなる。
コンピュータを使っていると、とても急ぎたくなる。
急ぐ必要がないはずなのに、何だか焦って、どこかあわてて、いらだって、
のろのろしている人を見ると腹が立ってきたりする。急げ、急げ。
それって、変ですよね 。
わざと、ゆっくり、してみよう。 ゆっくり、紙を広げ、手で文字を書いてみる。 一字、一字、丁寧に。 深呼吸をしてみよう。 一分でよいから、目をつぶってみよう。 ゆっくりと首を回し、今度は逆に回す。 人の話もゆっくり腰を落ち着けて聞いてみよう。 わざと馬鹿なふりをしてもいい。 自分の理解度や理解のスピードを誇るのをやめて、一度ゆっくり相手に語ってもらおう。 普段やらない手紙の整理や、机の上の整理をしてみよう。 もちろん、わざと、ゆっくりと 。
ともかく、ゆっくり 。
とにかく、ゆっくり 。
それは、ちょうど 、CPUのクロックを落として動作させるようなもの。
自分の普段の動作や思考のクロックを下げてやるのだ。 しかし、CPUと人間は違う。 人間は機械ではない。 人間が、わざとゆっくりと行動すると、
単にゆっくりになるだけではなく、暇になった脳は押し入れの奥からいろんなものを引き出してくれる。
「 最近、手で文字を書いてなかったなあ 」
「 呼吸って、胸やお腹まで動くんだなあ 」
「 あ、首がゴキゴキって鳴った 」
「 最近、あいつとゆっくり話してなかったなあ」
「 子どものとき、夕焼けを背にして家に帰ったなあ。下校のときの『家路』の音楽が悲しかった」
そんなこと、普段は考えなかったささやかなことがふわあっと心に広がっていく。
わざと、ゆっくり動いていると、心の奥の奥底で、誰かがあわてているのを見つけることもある。
誰かが大声を心の中で叫んでる。「おい、急げよ、もっと、急げよ 」
そんな風に叫んでいる小さなヤツがいる。 心の奥で一人であわてているヤツを見つけたら、しめたもの。
そいつをもっと焦らせてやりましょう。 もっともっとゆっくりと動作することで、もっともっとゆったりと過ごすことで。
いつも画面を見つめてプログラムしているなら、プリントアウトしてみよう。
いつも一人でデバッグしているなら、人にそのバグを話してみよう。
ゆっくりと、ゆっくりと。
まるで、世界に、今しか存在しないように、ゆっくりと。
まるで、そのことのために、自分が生まれてきたかのように心をこめて、ゆっくりと。
そういう時を過ごすことができたなら、あなたはいつもと違う自分を発見するでしょう。

私が 「ロビンソン式悩み解決法」と呼んでいる方法についてご紹介します。
まず、紙と鉛筆を用意します。 あ、ワープロやテキストエディタでもかまいません。
とにかく文章が書ける道具を用意します。 便宜上、紙と鉛筆で説明しますね。
紙を広げて、紙を二等分するように縦か横に線を引きます。
これで紙の上は二つの領域に別れました。
で、片方 に
よいこと
と書き、他方 に
よくないこ と
と書きます 。
で 「 よいこと 」 の方には、 自分が 「 これは今の自分にとってよいことだ 」 と思うことを箇条書きにします 。
ゆうべはよく眠れた 。
毎日出勤する会社がある。
家族は健康である 。
などなど。そして 、 「 よくないこと 」の方には、 自分が 「 これはよくないなあ」と思うことを 同じように箇条書きにしていきます。
ときどき歯が痛くなる 。
仕事が忙しくて本を読む暇がない。
昨日、大事な手帳をなくしてしまった。
などなど 。
このようにして 「 よいこと 」 「 よくないこと 」 を 思い付く限り紙の上に書いていくのです。
「 ロビンソン式悩み解決法」というのは、これだけです。
「 ちょっと待ってくれよ。何も解決してないじゃん」
と怒る前に、一度やってみてください。 これは自分でやらないとわからないのです。 お金もかからないし、自分一人でできるし、時間もかかりません。 大事なのは、自分が思い付く限り これはよいことかな、これはよくないこと、 というのをどんどん書き出していくことです。 できるだけ正直に、全部書き出します 。
確かに、箇条書きで書き出したからといって、 物事が解決するわけではないのです。 それは確かにそうなのですが、 不思議なことはあるもので、 箇条書きできちんと書き出してみると、
悩みの数が意外に少ないことがわかるのです。
紙に書かずに頭の中だけで考えていると、 あーだ、こーだと同じことを何度も何度も繰り返して
思い浮かべるものです。 その結果自分がたくさんの悩み事で埋もれてしまっている
ような錯覚に捕らえられてしまうことが多いのです。
一言で言えば、 自分で描いた幻想におびえていることが 案外多いものなのです。 ですから土俵を頭の中から紙の上にうつしてやるのが 有効なことなのです。
もちろん私も、 すべての悩みがこれで解決するとはいいません。 いいませんが、やってみて損はないと思いますよ。
紙を広げる。よいこととよくないことを 箇条書きにして、思い付く限り書いてみる。 それがすべてです。
お試しあれ 。
( 1996年12月18 日 )
（確か、私はこの話（箇条書きに問題を書く）を『ロビンソン・クルーソー』の中で
見たように記憶しています。でも、間違っていたらごめんなさい）
仕事上、あるいは人間関係上でトラブルを減らすポイントは何でしょう。
私はその答え（の一つ）を知っています。 それを一言で言えば、 驚き、最小の法則 となります。
「 驚き、最小の法則」というのは、 仕事を円滑に（人間関係を円滑に）進めるには「相手の驚き」を最小にすることが大切だ、 という法則です。
具体的にお話しましょう。 プログラムを作っていて、明日お客さんに納品するとしましょう。
で、プログラマである私はそのプログラムに三つの重大なバグがあるのを知っているとします。
さあ、そのバグのことをお客さんに伝えるべきでしょうか？
「 驚き、最小の法則」に従えば 、 きちんとそのバグについてお客さんに説明すべきです。
なぜなら、そのバグのことをお客さんに教えずにプログラムを渡したとしましょう。
もし、お客さんのところでその「重大なバグ」が露見したら…！？
お客さんはびっくりしますよね。「なんだこりゃ！」
でももし、お客さんに 、
「 大変申し訳ないが、現在こういうバグが残っているのです」
と伝えていたら、お客さんのところでその「重大なバグ」が露見しても
「 ああ、これが言ってたバグだな、しょうがないなあ 」 ということになるでしょう。 当然、後者の方が「驚き」が少ないわけです。
驚きが少ないときには、 将来の作戦がたてやすくなります。 お客さんは、そのプログラムを使っ て
５００人の聴衆の前でデモンストレーションをしなくちゃいけないかもしれない。
で、そのときに「重大なバグ」が露見したら…ああ、恐ろしや。
でも、きちんと「こういうバグがあるんです」と聞かされていたら、
そのバグを回避したデモをすることでしょう。
「 どうしようかな？」と思ったときには、 相手の「驚き」を最小にするような選択をすべきなのです。 それが 「 驚き、最小の法則」です。
「 驚き、最小の法則」という感じ、わかりましたか？
実はこれはすべての人間関係に応用が効くのですが…、
それはまた別の話、違うところでお話することにいたしましょう。
( 1996年12月21 日 )
あいつだけはゆるせない。
あいつのせいで、今回の仕事は失敗したのだ。
あいつのことを思い出すだけで腹が立つ。
あいつのことなんか考えたくもない。
… という相手はいますか？ 私にもそういう相手がいます。 何か、理屈じゃなく腹が立つ相手。 「 坊主憎けりゃ袈裟まで憎い」じゃないけれど、
その相手の属性すべてが嫌いになるような、 そんな相手がいるのです。 そういうときって、 どうしたらいいんでしょうか。 まあ、どうもしなくてもいいのですが、
何か心にひっかかるものがあるのです。
「 あいつのこれこれこういうところがヤなんだよな。だって…」
と理路整然と説明したつもりでも、 怒りは鎮まらない。 ずうっと昔のことなのに、 まるで今日のことのように腹が立つ。 私はそれを理不尽だと感じてしまいます 。
そんなとき、 どうしたらいいんだろう…。
二年ぐらい前、私は 発見してしまいました。 どういうときに私はむしょうに腹が立つか、 その原因を発見したように思います 。
単純なことでした。 私は、 私にそっくりな人に腹を立てている のでした 。
あいつは細かいことばかり気にする、というときは、
実は自分自身も細かいことばかり気にしているのでした(冷静に考えてみるとね ) 。
あいつは自分のことばかりしゃべっていて、人の話を聞いていない、 というときには、 自分自身もまったく同じことを他の場面でしているのでした。
ううむ。
憎らしい相手、妙にカンにさわる相手、 その気になる部分というのは、まさに私自身に似ている部分なのでした。
言い換えれば、私は、 自分自身を憎む代りとして、相手を憎んでいたのでした 。
それを知ってから、私はちょっと変わりました。
理由のよく分からない怒りに襲われたとき、 むしょうに腹が立つ相手が現れたとき、
「 もしかして、私に似ている部分があるんじゃないかな？」
と思うようになったのです。 もちろん、腹が立つ気持ちを止めることはできませんが、
「 私に似ている」と思うだけで、 何かがちょっと変わってきたように思うのです。
ほんのちょっと、ですけれど、ね。
( 1996年12月24 日 )
私は以前、以下のような状況に苦しんだことがある。
自分に満足できない 。
達成感がない 。
まわりの人は 「よくやっているよ」と言ってくれるのだけれど、自分では到底そうは思えない。
他の人から低い評価を受けるのがいやで、ものすごく頑張ってしまう。
一言で言うのは難しいのだけれど 、 「 自己評価基準が厳しい」というのかな？ 「 自分自身を採点するとき、きびしい点をつける」というのかな。 走り高飛びで言えば、 バーすれすれで飛びたくない、というのかな。
バーよりもはるかに高いところを飛ぼうとするのである。
人には厳しくないんです。 人には寛容でやさしく接することができる。
でも自分に対してすごく厳しい。 完璧主義。と一言でいってもいいかもしれないけれど、
その言葉では不全感やイライラはうまく表現できていないように思う。
ともあれ、そういう感じです。 伝わりました？
自己評価の基準が厳しいと、仕事が順調のときにはいいのだけれど、
自分の力を超えたトラブルがやってきたとき、
「 ものすごく」苦しくなるんです。 いや、ほんとに。死にたくなるほど苦しい。
「 真面目すぎるから」と言われたこともある。
でもだからどうしろというのだ、と反発を感じてしまったのを覚えています。
他の人から高い評価を得ても、 自分自身でちっとも満足できない。
もっとちゃんとやらなきゃ、やらなきゃ、 と倒れそうになるまで仕事してしまう。 もっと、もっと。早く、早く。
こんなこと、書いてるだけで苦しさを思い出します。
（読んでいてもイライラするでしょ？）
で、ふと、最近の自分を振り替えると、 そういう不全感からかなり解放されているように思うのです。
自分の仕事に満足と感謝を覚えている
仕事だけじゃなく、自分自身がとても好き
他の人の評価と自分の評価のずれが少なくなった（ここはよかったね。うん。ここはさぼったね。うん）
前よりも楽にすごしているのに、前よりも他の人からの評価が高くなった
どうしてだろう ？
秘密は 「 結婚」にありました。 もっと正確にいえば 「 奥さんからの愛」です。 （これから書くのはノロケに聞こえるかもしれないけれど、
私は自分の状況をできるだけ正確に書こうとしているのです）
奥さんはいつも、 私に接するときに、無条件に接してくれているのです。 私の仕事がうまくいったからとか、 家事をよく手伝うからとか、 そういう条件を抜きにして接してくれる。 私が例によって無理矢理自分にむち打って何かをしようとするとき、 いつ も
「 そんなに頑張らなくてもいいのよ 。 あなたはそのままでいいのだから 」
というメッセージを私に送り続けてくれるのです。
不思議なことに、 そういうメッセージを長い間受け取っていると、 いつのまにか私も自分自身に対し て
「 あ、わたしはわたしのままでいいのだ（と思ってみよう）」
という気分になってくるのです。 習慣ってすごいですね。
そうこうしているうちに、 仕事での焦りとか、 不全感が少しづつ減っていくのです （話がきれいごとすぎるように聞こえるかもしれませんが、 事実なのでしょうがないです）。 で、焦りが少なくなると、 自然と余裕が出てきて回りからの信頼が増してくる。 以前は 「 あいつは頑張ってくれるが、ここ一番というときにガクっとくる」という評価 だったの に 「
あいつは最近、安定している」という評価に変わってくる。
もちろんストレスがゼロになるわけでも、 仕事でのポカがゼロになるわけでもないですよ。
でも、何だか自分を等身大に見ることができるようになったような感じなのです。
ときどき私の心の奥で誰かがこう言います。 「 おまえはもっと頑張んなきゃダメだ 」 でも、最近はそんな声は、無視無視。 けとばしちゃいます。
順番が逆だからです。 頑張ったから愛されるのじゃないんです。 愛されるから、愛されているから、いろいろ頑張れるのです。
私の場合は、奥さんから 「そのままの私」を受け入れてもらい、
その愛の力で「そのままの自分自身」を受け入れることができました。
だからわたしは、ことあるごとに他の人を受け入れたい。 みんなに
「 あなたはそのままでいいんだよ 」
というメッセージを送りたい。
この文章を読んでいるあなたにも。
( 1997年3月26 日 )
仕事がある程度の段階まで進むと、 あちこちに歪みやアラが目立ってきて、 全部「 はじめからやり直した い 」という気持ちが強くなってきます。 これを私は「はじめからやり直したい症候群」と呼んでいます。
この症候群の特徴は、以下のような言葉で表現できます。
あっちとこっちが 統一されていない のが気にな る
いま はＡとＢとＣと別れているけれど実は 汎用的な Ｇで対応できるはずだ
ＸとＹがごちゃごちゃしていてわかりにくいので 全体的に整理 したい
要するに、全部捨ててゼロから作った方が 絶対 よいものになるの だ
でも、安易にはじめからやり直すと、 たいていは失敗します。
仕事にアラが目立ってくるのは、 仕事のやり方がまずかったからというよりは、
仕事がかなりの段階まで進んできたからなのです。
はじめからやり直した方がいいように思えるのは、
そっちの方向がまだ「手つかず」で、 詳細に検討されていないからです。 詳細な検討がなされ、 時と現実という荒波に揉まれた後では
やはり以前と同じように歪みやアラが目立ってくるものなのです。
まだ手つかずの方法は、 遠くに見えるお花畑 のようなものです。 遠くに見えるお花畑の方が、 足元のお花畑よりも奇麗な花が密集しているように見えます。 けれどもそれはお花畑の違いではなく、 自分の立っている位置の違い なのです 。
足元のお花畑をすべて捨て、 遠くに見えるお花畑に行ってみたとしても、
そこに着いたとたん、全然花が密集していないことに気がつくのです。
そしてふとさっきのお花畑を振り返ると…不思議なことに
さっきのお花畑の方が綺麗に見えるではないですか。
どうしてもはじめからやり直したい、 絶対その方がうまくいく…という気持ちが抑えられないときは、
現在の状態に復帰できるようにした上で、
はじめからやり直してみるのもよいかもしれません。 そのときには、 やり直しを本格的にするのか、 やめるのかを再検討する時期を決めておくのがよいでしょう。
もちろん 、 「 はじめからやり直す」ことで質が向上した仕事も数多くあるとは思います。
ここで言いたいのは、詳細な検討もせずに 「 はじめからやり直したらうまくいく 」 と考えるのは危険である、ということなのです。
( 1997年5月22 日 )
人から信頼してもらいたい、人から信用してもらいたい、
多くの人がそう望んでいるでしょう。
プライベートで、恋人や友人から信頼してもらいたいが、どうしたらよいか。
ビジネスで、顧客から信頼してもらいたいが、どうしたらよいか。
多くの人がそういうことを思っています。
真面目に相手と信頼関係を結びたいと願っているが
具体的な方法がわからない、という人のためにヒントを差し上げます。
シンプルで覚えやすく、具体的で実現可能な方法です。 それは、一言で表すことができます。
「 相手と約束をして、それを守る 」
相手の信頼を得る方法は、これに尽きます。 相手と約束をして、それを守る。
具体例をあげましょう 。
奥さんに 「今晩は何時に帰るよ」と約束し、それを守る。
顧客に 「 じゃあ、この資料は明日まで にＦＡＸしておきます」と約束し、それを守る。
恋人に 「今度の土曜日にあの映画を見に行こう」と約束し、それを守る。
上司に 「報告書は来週の火曜日に先方に届けておきます」と約束し、それを守る。
いかがですか？ とっかかりとしては、どんな簡単な、どんな小さな約束でもいいです。 どんな約束で も 「 約束」したことは守る、 という態度が信頼を得るためのよい方法です。
もしかしたら最もよい方法かもしれません。
そんなこと言っても、守れない場合はどうするの？
ふむ。当然の質問ですね。もちろん約束はしたものの、
事情が変って守れなくなることはあるわけです。 そういうときにはどうするか。
守れなくなることが判明したら、できるだけ早く「守れなくてすみません」ということを相手に伝える。
いかなる理由があろうとも、相手に謝る。謝罪は約束の内容、守れなくなった理由に関わらず行なう。この謝罪は「いったんした約束が守れなかったこと」に関する謝罪なのだ。
守れなくなった理由を言いたいときでも、自己保身のためにくどくど長くなることを避ける。短く、事実を率直に。
今回の約束が守れないなら、その埋め合わせはどうするか、どうするつもりか、まで考えておく。
「 約束というのは重要なものであり 、 いったんした約束は本来きちんと守られるべき筋合いのものなのだ 」
ということを意識する、というのが心がけになります。
恥ずかしながら、結城自身、 なかなかここで述べたようにいつもできているわけではありません。
しかしここに書いたのは、私の経験的事実でもあります。 あなたがもし 「 相手と約束をして、それを守る 」 をいままで意識したことがないなら、 試してみる価値があると思います。

仕事をしていると、客先からトラブルが飛び込んでくることがある。
トラブル発生 ！
仕事の相手から突然電話がかかってくる。 そのときのこちらの受け答えが重要だ。
相手のことを考えて、相手の視点にたって応答する。
自分はもちろん緊急の仕事をたくさんかかえている。
自分が相手のトラブルにすぐに動けないことはわかっている。
けれども、まずは 相手の話を聞こう 。 落ち着いて、落ち着いて。 相手はパニックになっている。 その相手のつらさを ぐっと受け止めて 、少なくとも話をじっくり聞こう。 自分の時間をすぐに使えるかどうかは自分だけでは決められないから、 明日できます、なんて 安請け合いはしない こと。 でも、最善の努力はすることを本気になって伝えよう。 相手が何か調査する手がかりをすぐに思い付くなら、教えてあげよう。 やりすぎはいけないが、可能な限り情報を出してあげよう。 バグが直るまでは時間がかかるから、思い付く 回避策 を教えてあげよう。 自分の 保身に走るのをやめよう 。 相手の 「 困った」を軽減させる方向で考えよう。
失敗・バグ・トラブルが原因でプロジェクトがダウンしてしまうことだってある。
自分の責任のこともあるし、相手の責任のこともある。
どちらの責任でもなく、不可抗力のときもある。
プロジェクトの失敗は大きな痛手だ。
けれど、相手に次のように感じてもらえたら、 長い目で見たら実は成功かもしれない。
「 今回はうまくいかなかったが 、 あの会社と、あの人ともう一度仕事をしてみたい」

あなたはひとりではありません。
徹夜あけでふらふらになりながらデバッグしていると、
とんでもなく情けない気持ちになります。
残っている仕事量を納期までの日数で割り算して、
目の前がくらくらします。 完成直前にとんでもない事態が持ち上がって、
大量のやり直しが発生します。
けれども、あなたはひとりではありません。
いま情けない気持ちでキーボードをたたいている自分。
納期までをどうやりくりしようかと考える自分。
やり直しをするのはやっぱり自分か…と思う自分。
けれども、あなたはひとりではありません。
確かに、 目の前には自分しかいない、 この仕事は自分がやらなきゃだめだ、 他に誰がやってくれるというのだ、と思う。 そしてそれはそうなのでしょう 。
けれども、けれども、あなたはひとりぼっちではありません。
いま、世界のどこかで、あなたと同じ思いを抱いている人が必ずいます。
髪の色も違い、職業も違い、言葉も違い、
あなたと一度も会ったことがなく、これからも会うことがないかもしれないけれど…
あなたと同じように、自分の目の前の問題に途方にくれつつも、
何とかしようと考えている人がいるんです。
そして、まわりをよくみると、自分のまわりをよくみると、
あなたのすぐそばに、 あなたが、いま、あなたの言葉を伝える相手が見つかりはしないでしょうか。
仕事の状況を報告する上司か、 困った事態だと訴える同僚か、 自分の弱さと心の痛みをうちあける恋人か、伴侶か、
今日はこんな私です、と話す友人か…
決して、あなたはひとりぼっちではありません。
…
あなたは、これまでいろんな時を過ごして、現在ここにいます。
きっと今の困難も（どんな形でかはわかりませんが）解決することでしょう。
そして、今よりも少し楽になったとき、 もう一度あなたのまわりをよくみてください。
あなたのまわりに、あなたが耳を傾けるべき相手はいませんか？
「わたしはひとりぼっちだ」と思い込んでいる誰かはいませんか？
ぜひ、その方の話を聞いてあげてください。 じっくりと、最後まで。

Before I begin , I 've been asked to make an announcement .
Whoever parked 14 black bulletproof S.U.V.'s out front , could you please move them ?
They are blocking in 14 other black bulletproof S.U.V.'s and they need to get out .
Wow .
Wow , what an honor .
The White House correspondents ' dinner .
To actually sit here , at the same table with my hero , George W. Bush , to be this close to the man .
I feel like I 'm dreaming .
Somebody pinch me .
You know what ?
I 'm a pretty sound sleeper -- that may not be enough .
Somebody shoot me in the face .
Is he really not here tonight ?
Dammit .
The one guy who could have helped .
By the way , before I get started , if anybody needs anything else at their tables , just speak slowly and clearly into your table numbers .
Somebody from the NSA will be right over with a cocktail .
Mark Smith , ladies and gentlemen of the press corps , Madame First Lady , Mr. President , my name is Stephen Colbert and tonight it 's my privilege to celebrate this president .
We 're not so different , he and I .
We get it .
We 're not brainiacs on the nerd patrol .
We 're not members of the factinista .
We go straight from the gut , right sir ?
That 's where the truth lies , right down here in the gut .
Do you know you have more nerve endings in your gut than you have in your head ?
You can look it up .
I know some of you are going to say " I did look it up , and that 's not true . "
That 's ' cause you looked it up in a book .
Next time , look it up in your gut .
I did .
My gut tells me that 's how our nervous system works .
Every night on my show , the Colbert Report , I speak straight from the gut , OK ?
I give people the truth , unfiltered by rational argument .
I call it the " No Fact Zone . "
Fox News , I hold a copyright on that term .
I 'm a simple man with a simple mind .
I hold a simple set of beliefs that I live by .
Number one , I believe in America .
I believe it exists .
My gut tells me I live there .
I feel that it extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific , and I strongly believe it has 50 states .
And I cannot wait to see how the Washington Post spins that one tomorrow .
I believe in democracy .
I believe democracy is our greatest export .
At least until China figures out a way to stamp it out of plastic for three cents a unit .
In fact , Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong , welcome .
Your great country makes our Happy Meals possible .
I said it 's a celebration .
I believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least .
And by these standards , we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq .
I believe in pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps .
I believe it is possible -- I saw this guy do it once in Cirque du Soleil .
It was magical .
And though I am a committed Christian , I believe that everyone has the right to their own religion , be you Hindu , Jewish or Muslim .
I believe there are infinite paths to accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior .
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe it 's yogurt .
But I refuse to believe it 's not butter .
Most of all , I believe in this president .
Now , I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32 % approval rating .
But guys like us , we do n't pay attention to the polls .
We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in " reality . "
And reality has a well - known liberal bias .
So , Mr. President , please , pay no attention to the people that say the glass is half full .
32 % means the glass -- it 's important to set up your jokes properly , sir .
Sir , pay no attention to the people who say the glass is half empty , because 32 % means it 's 2/3 empty .
There 's still some liquid in that glass is my point , but I would n't drink it .
The last third is usually backwash .
Okay , look , folks , my point is that I do n't believe this is a low point in this presidency .
I believe it is just a lull before a comeback .
I mean , it 's like the movie " Rocky . "
All right .
The president in this case is Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed is -- everything else in the world .
It 's the tenth round .
He 's bloodied .
His corner man , Mick , who in this case I guess would be the vice president , he 's yelling , " Cut me , Dick , cut me ! , " and every time he falls everyone says , " Stay down !
Stay down ! "
Does he stay down ?
No. Like Rocky , he gets back up , and in the end he -- actually , he loses in the first movie .
OK .
Does n't matter .
The point is it is the heart - warming story of a man who was repeatedly punched in the face .
So do n't pay attention to the approval ratings that say 68 % of Americans disapprove of the job this man is doing .
I ask you this , does that not also logically mean that 68 % approve of the job he 's not doing ?
Think about it .
I have n't .
I stand by this man .
I stand by this man because he stands for things .
Not only for things , he stands on things .
Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares .
And that sends a strong message : that no matter what happens to America , she will always rebound -- with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world .
Now , there may be an energy crisis .
This president has a very forward - thinking energy policy .
Why do you think he 's down on the ranch cutting that brush all the time ?
He 's trying to create an alternative energy source .
By 2008 we will have a mesquite - powered car !
And I just like the guy .
He 's a good Joe .
Obviously loves his wife , calls her his better half .
And polls show America agrees .
She 's a true lady and a wonderful woman .
But I just have one beef , ma'am .
I 'm sorry , but this reading initiative .
I 'm sorry , I 've never been a fan of books .
I do n't trust them .
They 're all fact , no heart .
I mean , they 're elitist , telling us what is or is n't true , or what did or did n't happen .
Who 's Britannica to tell me the Panama Canal was built in 1914 ?
If I want to say it was built in 1941 , that 's my right as an American !
I 'm with the president , let history decide what did or did not happen .
The greatest thing about this man is he 's steady .
You know where he stands .
He believes the same thing Wednesday that he believed on Monday , no matter what happened Tuesday .
Events can change ; this man 's beliefs never will .
As excited as I am to be here with the president , I am appalled to be surrounded by the liberal media that is destroying America , with the exception of Fox News .
Fox
News gives you both sides of every story : the president 's side , and the vice president 's side .
But the rest of you , what are you thinking , reporting on NSA wiretapping or secret prisons in eastern Europe ?
Those things are secret for a very important reason : they 're super - depressing .
And if that 's your goal , well , misery accomplished .
Over the last five years you people were so good -- over tax cuts , WMD intelligence , the effect of global warming .
We Americans did n't want to know , and you had the courtesy not to try to find out .
Those were good times , as far as we knew .
But , listen , let 's review the rules .
Here 's how it works : the president makes decisions .
He 's the Decider .
The press secretary announces those decisions , and you people of the press type those decisions down .
Make , announce , type .
Just put 'em through a spell check and go home .
Get to know your family again .
Make love to your wife .
Write that novel you got kicking around in your head .
You know , the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the administration .
You know - fiction !
Because really , what incentive do these people have to answer your questions , after all ?
I mean , nothing satisfies you .
Everybody asks for personnel changes .
So the White House has personnel changes .
Then you write , " Oh , they 're just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic . "
First of all , that is a terrible metaphor .
This administration is not sinking .
This administration is soaring .
If anything , they are rearranging the deck chairs on the Hindenburg !
Now , it 's not all bad guys out there .
Some are heroes : Christopher Buckley , Jeff Sacks , Ken Burns , Bob Schieffer .
They 've all been on my show .
By the way , Mr. President , thank you for agreeing to be on my show .
I was just as shocked as everyone here is , I promise you .
How 's Tuesday for you ?
I 've got Frank Rich , but we can bump him .
And I mean bump him .
I know a guy .
Say the word .
See who we 've got here tonight .
General Moseley , Air Force Chief of Staff .
General Peter Pace , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
They still support Rumsfeld .
Right , you guys are n't retired yet , right ?
Right , they still support Rumsfeld .
Look , by the way , I 've got a theory about how to handle these retired generals causing all this trouble : do n't let them retire !
Come on , we 've got a stop - loss program ; let 's use it on these guys .
I 've seen Zinni and that crowd on Wolf Blitzer .
If you 're strong enough to go on one of those pundit shows , you can stand on a bank of computers and order men into battle .
Come on .
Jesse Jackson is here , the Reverend .
Have n't heard from the Reverend in a little while .
I had him on the show .
Very interesting and challenging interview .
You can ask him anything , but he 's going to say what he wants , at the pace that he wants .
It 's like boxing a glacier .
Enjoy that metaphor , by the way , because your grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is .
Justice Scalia is here .
Welcome , sir .
May I be the first to say , you look fantastic .
How are you ?
[ After each sentence , Colbert makes a hand gesture , an allusion to Scalia 's recent use of an obscene Sicilian hand gesture in speaking to a reporter about Scalia 's critics .
Scalia is seen laughing hysterically . ]
Just talking some Sicilian with my paisan .
John McCain is here .
John McCain , John McCain , what a maverick !
Somebody find out what fork he used on his salad , because I guarantee you it was n't a salad fork .
This guy could have used a spoon !
There 's no predicting him .
By the way , Senator McCain , it 's so wonderful to see you coming back into the Republican fold .
I have a summer house in South Carolina ; look me up when you go to speak at Bob Jones University .
So glad you 've seen the light , sir .
Mayor Nagin !
Mayor Nagin is here from New Orleans , the chocolate city !
Yeah , give it up .
Mayor Nagin , I 'd like to welcome you to Washington , D.C. , the chocolate city with a marshmallow center .
And a graham cracker crust of corruption .
It 's a Mallomar , I guess is what I 'm describing , a seasonal cookie .
Joe Wilson is here , Joe Wilson right down here in front , the most famous husband since Desi Arnaz .
And of course he brought along his lovely wife Valerie Plame .
Oh , my god .
[ looks horrified ]
Oh , what have I said ?
I -- Je- minetti ( sp ? ) .
I am sorry , Mr. President , I meant to say he brought along his lovely wife Joe Wilson 's wife .
Patrick Fitzgerald is not here tonight ?
OK .
Dodged a bullet .
And , of course , we can't forget the man of the hour , new press secretary , Tony Snow .
Secret Service name , " Snow Job . "
Toughest job .
What a hero .
Took the second toughest job in government , next to , of course , the ambassador to Iraq .
Got some big shoes to fill , Tony .
Big shoes to fill .
Scott McClellan could say nothing like nobody else .
McClellan , of course , eager to retire .
Really felt like he needed to spend more time with Andrew Card 's children .
Mr. President , I wish you had n't made the decision so quickly , sir .
I was vying for the job myself .
I think I would have made a fabulous press secretary .
I have nothing but contempt for these people .
I know how to handle these clowns .
In fact , sir , I brought along an audition tape and with your indulgence , I 'd like to at least give it a shot .
So , ladies and gentlemen , my press conference .
BEGINNING OF " AUDITION TAPE "
Colbert shows a video of a mock press conference .
It opens with an empty podium .
Colbert 's head rises from behind the podium until Colbert is standing at the podium .
He addresses the assembled Washington press corps .
COLBERT : I have a brief statement : the press is destroying America .
OK , let 's see who we 've got here today .
COLBERT ( acknowledging various reporters ) : Stretch !
( David Gregory nods )
Sir Nerdlington !
( reporter nods )
Sloppy Joe! ( reporter nods )
Terry Lemon Moran Pie! ( Terry Moran nods )
Oh , Doubting Thomas , always a pleasure .
( Helen Thomas smiles )
And Suzanne Mal -- hello!!
( Suzanne Malveaux stares at Colbert , looking unhappy .
Colbert mimics putting a phone to his ear and mouths " call me . " )
REPORTER : Will the Vice President be available soon to answer all questions himself ?
COLBERT : I 've already addressed that question .
You ( pointing to another reporter ) .
REPORTER : Walter Cronkite , the noted CBS anchor , . . .
COLBERT ( interrupting ) : Ah , no , he 's the former CBS anchor .
Katie Couric is the new anchor of the CBS Evening News .
Well , well , how do you guys feel about that ?
You , tousle - haired guy in the back .
Are you happy about Katie Couric taking over the CBS Evening News ?
DAN RATHER : No , sir , Mr. Colbert .
Are you ?
( Laughter )
COLBERT : Boom !
Oh , look , we woke David Gregory up .
Question ?
DAVID GREGORY : Did Karl Rove commit a crime ?
COLBERT : I do n't know .
I 'll ask him .
( Colbert turns to Rove ) Karl , pay attention please !
( Rove is seen drawing a heart with " Karl + Stephen " written on it . )
GREGORY : Do you stand by your statement from the fall of 2003 when you were asked specifically about Karl , and Elliott Abrams , and Scooter Libby , and you said " I 've gone to each of those gentlemen , and they have told me that they are not involved in this . "
Do you stand by that statement ?
COLBERT : Nah , I was just kidding !
GREGORY : No , you 're not finishing .
You 're not saying anything !
You stood at that podium and said . . .
COLBERT ( interrupting ) : Ah , that 's where you 're wrong .
New podium !
Just had it delivered today .
Get your facts straight , David .
GREGORY : This is ridiculous .
The notion that you 're going to stand before us after having commented with that level of detail and tell the people watching this that somehow you 've decided not to talk .
You 've got to . . .
( Colbert is seen looking at three buttons on the podium , labeled " EJECT , " " GANNON " and " VOLUME . "
He selects the " VOLUME " button and turns it .
We see Gregory 's lips continue moving , but can't hear any sound coming out . )
COLBERT : If I can't hear you , I can't answer your question .
I 'm sorry !
I have to move on .
Terry .
TERRY MORAN : After the investigation began , after the criminal investigation was underway , you said . . .
( Colbert presses a button on the podium and fast - forwards through most of Moran 's question . )
MORAN ( continuing ) :
All of a sudden , you have respect for the sanctity of a criminal investigation ?
COLBERT ( seen playing with rubber ball , which he is bouncing off attached paddle ) :
No , I never had any respect for the sanctity of a criminal investigation .
Activist judges !
Yes , Helen .
HELEN THOMAS : You 're going to be sorry .
( Laughter )
COLBERT ( looking vastly amused , mockingly ) :
What are you going to do , Helen , ask me for a recipe ?
THOMAS : Your decision to invade Iraq has caused the deaths of thousands ( Colbert 's smile fades ) of Americans and Iraqis , wounds of Americans and Iraqis for a lifetime .
COLBERT ( interrupting ) : OK , hold on Helen , look . . .
THOMAS ( continuing ) : Every reason given , publicly at least , has turned out not to be true .
My question is , why did you really want to go to war ?
COLBERT ( again interrupting ) : Helen , I 'm going to stop you right there .
( Thomas keeps talking . )
That 's enough !
No !
Sorry , Helen , I 'm moving on .
( Colbert tries to turn her volume off , but the knob falls off his controls . )
( Various reporters start shouting questions at Colbert . )
COLBERT ( agitated ) : Guys , guys , please do n't let Helen do this to what was a lovely day .
( Reporters keep shouting at him . )
COLBERT ( putting his fingers over his ears and shouting in a high - pitched voice ) : Bllrrtt !
No , no , no , no , no .
I 'm not listening to you !
Look what you did , Helen !
I hate you !
( Helen Thomas glowers at Colbert . )
COLBERT ( frantic ) : I 'm out of here !
( Colbert pulls back the curtain behind him , desperately trying to flee .
He says , " There is a wall here ! "
The press corps laughs .
Colbert has difficulty finding a door from which to exit the room , echoing Bush 's experience in China .
He finally finds the door and hurries through it . )
COLBERT : It reeks in there !
Ridiculous !
I 've never been so insulted in my life !
Stupid job .
( Colbert continues walking away .
We hear sinister - sounding music playing .
We see Helen Thomas walking behind Colbert . )
( Colbert looks behind him , sees Thomas , and starts running . )
( Colbert trips over a roller skate .
He yells " Condi ! "
We see a close - up of Helen Thomas ' face , looking determined and angry .
Colbert , increasingly panicked , gets up and continues running , running into a parking garage .
He reaches an emergency call box , and yells into it . )
COLBERT : Oh , thank God .
Help me !
ATTENDANT : What seems to be the problem , sir ?
COLBERT : She wo n't stop asking why we invaded Iraq !
ATTENDANT : Hey , why did we invade Iraq ?
COLBERT : NO !!!
( runs toward his car )
( We see Helen Thomas , still walking toward him . )
( Colbert reaches his car , and fumblingly attempts to open it with his key .
He is in such a desperate hurry that he fumbles with the keys and drops them .
When he picks them up , he looks back and Helen is even closer .
In his frantic rush , Colbert just can't get the key into the lock . )
( Just as his anxiety is getting completely out of control he suddenly remembers that he has a keyless remote -- so he just pushes the button on the keychain and the car unlocks immediately with the usual double squeak noise .
Colbert jumps in and locks the door , and continues to fumble trying to start the car .
He finally succeeds , and looks up to see Helen standing in front of the car , notepad in hand . )
COLBERT : NO !!!
NO !!!
( Colbert puts the car into reverse and drives off , tires squealing .
Thomas smiles . )
( Colbert is shown taking the shuttle from Washington , D.C. to New York .
A car and driver are waiting for him at Penn Station .
The uniformed man standing alongside the car opens the door and lets Colbert in . )
COLBERT : What a terrible trip , Danny .
Take me home .
( The driver locks the doors , turns around , and says , " Buckle up , hon . "
IT 'S HELEN THOMAS !!!)
COLBERT ( horrified face pressed against car window ) : NO !!!
END OF " AUDITION TAPE "
STEPHEN COLBERT : Helen Thomas , ladies and gentlemen .
Mr. Smith , members of the White House Correspondents Association , Madame First Lady , Mr. President , it 's been a true honor .
Thank you very much .
Good night !
Although in a true democracy they must remain subordinate to their political masters , they have a clear responsibility to point out when political strategies are flawed or inadequately resourced .
Since they might also have to ask their soldiers to sacrifice their lives , they must be assured that a war is just , legal and the last resort available .
Yet three years ago this country was somehow led by the prime minister into war in Iraq where few , if any , of these requirements were met .
Most importantly a clear justification for the war in Iraq was never sufficiently made by Tony Blair - for the intelligence he presented was always embarrassingly patchy and inconsistent .
What is more , his unequivocal statement to the House of Commons that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction that could be used within 45 minutes was made without being properly validated - for it was decided in Washington and London to launch the invasion of Iraq early , on the basis of the flimsy evidence available .
This was done without asking the UN weapons inspectors , who were actually on the ground in Iraq , to investigate this allegation .
Ultimately , as the inspectors suspected and as we now all know , it turned out that there were no such weapons .
Britain had been led into war on false pretences .
It was a war that was to unleash untold suffering on the Iraqi people and cause grave damage to the west 's prospects in the wider war against global terror .
Nevertheless , today the prime minister seeks to persuade the world that the war was justifiable because Saddam Hussein was toppled and there now exists in Iraq a slender hope of democracy .
The Iraqi elections are a creditable achievement by the coalition forces .
But it must be remembered that a general election was previously held in Iraq in 1956 , and within two years the country had fallen under military rule .
Without adequate security and the necessary democratic institutions in place , there are absolutely no long - term guarantees that democracy will endure .
Before the invasion , regime change was never cited as a reason for going to war .
Indeed , Mr Blair insisted that regime change was not , nor ever could be , a reason for going to war .
Had such a justification been fully debated in parliament , it is exceedingly unlikely that the necessary political support would have been forthcoming .
It was the apparent need to defend ourselves against a dire threat - so vividly described by Mr Blair in the Commons - that finally won the political argument .
During the build - up to war and since , most of the electorate of this country have consistently opposed the decision to invade .
People have seen their political wishes ignored for reasons now proved false .
But there has been no attempt in parliament to call Mr Blair personally to account for what has transpired to be a blunder of enormous strategic significance .
It should come as no surprise therefore that so many of this country 's voters have turned their backs on a democratic system they feel has so little credibility and is so unresponsive .
One obvious way of re-engaging these disaffected voters would be for parliament to accept that it wrongly supported the war - but only because it believed what Mr Blair told them .
Now it is clear that parliament was misled by Mr Blair , either wittingly or unwittingly , parliament should also call on him for a full explanation as to why he went to war .
It is not a sufficient excuse for Mr Blair to say that he acted in good faith and that his decisions were based on the intelligence he had been given .
For it is the clear responsibility of people in his position to test intelligence .
No intelligence can ever be taken at face value .
Indeed it is negligent so to do .
Parliament should therefore ascertain how far the prime minister did evaluate intelligence regarding WMD and how he assessed the reliability of the many sources that provided that intelligence .
It should ask him what corroborating evidence there was for his specific statement about WMD - and why more use was not made of the UN inspectors on the ground in Iraq to test the validity of that statement .
It should inquire just how much he discounted the mass of intelligence that came in from the Iraqi National Congress - a body that had a vested interest in removing Saddam from power .
The list of possible questions is huge and would no doubt be usefully expanded during any hearings .
Mr Blair is an able barrister who should relish the opportunity to put his side of the case .
No one can undo the decision to go to war .
But the impeachment of Mr Blair is now something I believe must happen if we are to rekindle interest in the democratic process .

FOO -OF !
Everyone has their own style of naming accessors , but here 's a meme I 've occasionally tried to spread :
( defclass bar ( ) ( ( foo :accessor foo - of ) ) )
This works like a charm , and with good reason .
You are highly unlikely to ever want to name a function with arity other then 1 with the postfix - OF .
It just does n't make sense .
In this way this style is superior to plain FOO , and to a lesser extent better then GET - FOO and friends .
If you are partial to BAR - FOO , then you are beyond help .
The problems with this approach in conjuction with subclassing are amply documented , so nuff said .
If your objection is purely aesthetic then I can only assure you that the eye gets used to it .
CLASS - OF and TYPE - OF provide sufficient precendent to my satisfaction .
If you find yourself needing either of the above as accessors , this is what shadowing and generic functions are there for !
( defpackage " EXAMPLE " ( : use " COMMON - LISP " ) ( : shadow " TYPE - OF " ) ) ( in-package " EXAMPLE " ) ( defgeneric type - of ( instance ) ( : method ( instance ) ( cl:type - of instance ) ) )
Done .
What 's wrong with the standard undergraduate computer science curriculum
What 's right with graduates of a standard U.S. CS program ?
Sadly this turns out to be an increasingly poor match with the marketplace .
Consider an employer with a big stack of well - defined clearly specified problems to be solved .
That stack of problems is ideal for handing off to programmers in a low - wage country on the other side of the globe .
Top graduates from a standard Computer Science undergraduate program are well - prepared to go on to graduate school in Computer Science and ultimately to become professors of Computer Science themselves .
In other words academics are doing a fine job of replicating themselves .
But the majority of graduates will be looking for jobs as software engineers and the focus of this article will on how best to prepare people for those jobs .
What 's wrong with graduates of a standard U.S. CS program ?
Graduates have n't done much group work .
Universities spend $ billions on facilities so that students can sleep together ; $ 0 on facilities so that students can work together .
We have a society that , at least to judge by the prescriptions written by pediatric psychiatrists , is suffering an epidemic of Attention Deficit Disorder .
We have students who watched MTV in their cradles .
Yet we structure learning so that students take homework back to their dorm rooms and try to work on problems by themselves while fighting off distraction from dormmates in unrelated majors , TV , DVDs , video games , instant messages , email , and the Web .
Students who come to the university with pre-existing excellent study habits will still get an excellent education .
Students who managed to hop over the low hurdles of junior high and high school despite poor study habits may get minimal benefit from college .
Graduates are not good at taking vague goals from a non-technical person and turning them into concrete specifications that can be implemented within a fixed budget of time and resources .
Graduates are not good at communicating ( writing , presentations , asking questions of users and customers ) .
Lack of experience with user interface design and testing and no experience handling real users ' suggestions , complaints .
Lack of professionalism , i.e. , graduates are not dedicated to completing something of value to end -users .
Students learn to feel good about themselves when they solve well - specified problems and get something for themselves , usually a good grade .
Students do not learn that value is generated only when the first end - user accomplishes a task with the new information system .
Consequently most CS graduates are happy to draw a salary for building a system that is 90 percent finished but never installed or used .
Lack of focus on big picture ; graduates can't understand how their work relates to larger organizational goals .
Graduates are not very experienced with quickly making sense of large commercial tools and libraries and writing small pieces of code that control or extend those libraries .
The result is a tendency to start from scratch or rewrite code that is not fully understood rather than reuse .
Many early
Web applications were plagued with bugs from half - tested database management systems written by computer science graduates who were more interested in writing C code than in learning to apply standard relational database management systems .
What do we want graduates to be able to do ?
The news articles are correct but not complete .
While it is true that U.S. employment for software development has shrunk and hundreds of thousands of people are being fired it is also true that hundreds of thousands of people are being hired .
The newspapers are correct in that number of people hired has been smaller than the number fired .
The question that journalists have n't asked is " Who is getting fired ? "
For nimble employers the first people to get pink slips are older programmers whose performance is average but whose salaries and benefits costs are high .
Who is getting hired ?
New college graduates , thanks to youth , have a high energy level and low employment costs .
Among those desirable young relatively cheap workers the ones who get hired first will be those whose education matches current employer needs .
For the foreseeable future , every young person graduating in Computer Science who gets a job in the United States will owe his or her career to the firing of an older worker .
It is a cruel marketplace but our task in this document is to improve computer science education and help young people , not to reduce cruelty in the American employment market .
Thus our goal during a computer science bachelor 's program ought to be to give a young energetic person the open - ended project and group work experience that the best older programmers have .
Second , we want our graduates to have satisfying careers where they have autonomy , responsibility , and job security .
Consider the typical computer programmer who takes specifications for a subsystem from a manager , unthinkingly produces a program to meet the spec , and hands the resulting code back for testing , integration , and evaluation by other departments .
This is really a factory job where the workers ' hands do n't get dirty .
What 's wrong with that ?
Sociologists have tracked a substantial loss in worker satisfaction as craft jobs were replaced by factory jobs .
A craftsman builds a complete product and delivers it directly into the hands of a customer , seeing and hearing the satisfaction that the new product delivered .
A factory worker , by contrast , builds a small component of a product and is typically several distribution layers removed from the customer .
A craftsman is responsible for whether and when a product goes out the door to the customer .
In a classical factory a totally separate part of the bureaucracy , the quality control department , decides whether or not a product should be shipped .
A craftsman listens to customer needs and adapts the resulting product accordingly .
Factory workers never talk to customers ; a separate marketing department assesses customer needs and determines changes in product design .
Not only is a job in a code factory not very satisfying it is neither very secure .
There is a near - perfect abstraction barrier between the manager and the programmer : specs in , code out .
One of the things that students learn as computer science undergraduates is the virtues of abstraction barriers .
You can replace Module A ( expensive programmer in the U.S. ) with Module B ( cheap programmer in another country ) and never notice as long as Modules A and B present the same interface to the outside world ( email specs in ; source code out ) .
What actual skills will a graduate need in order to get a job ?
To get a satisfying job ?
To keep a job in the face of pressure from younger and / or cheaper workers ?
A professional programmer ought to be able to pick worthwhile problems to attack .
Engineering is the art of building cost - effective solutions to problems that society regards as significant .
A person who blindly does what he or she is told , without independently figuring out the context and significance of the problem , is not doing engineering .
A professional programmer needs to be able to sit at a meeting with decision makers , prepared with substantial domain knowledge , and make significant contributions to the discussion .
A professional programmer needs to be skilled at clean - sheet - of - paper designs .
Some Ideas for a 21st - Century Undergrad Computer Science Program
Our students should be able to study 48 weeks per year , perhaps in four 12 - week quarters , and finish their bachelor 's degree in 30 - 36 calendar months .
Most universities operate in most respects as copies of Ivy League schools .
In many ways it makes sense to copy leaders such as Harvard and Yale but the calendar is n't one of them .
Top universities in the United States are only in session for 26 - 28 weeks .
It makes sense if the customers are wealthy families .
There needs to be a long summer break so that the kids are free to join the family on its yacht in the Mediterranean .
And there needs to be a long winter break so that the kids can come down to the beach house in the Caribbean tax - haven .
And what fun is spring skiing in Aspen if Biff and Muffy can't take a week off from school ?
Computer science , however , is not a commonly chosen major for children of the American aristocracy .
For a middle class parent the traditional university calendar means that not only do they have to pay tuition but they also have to pay for the spring break trip to South Padre Island and , in a world where summer jobs are scarce , support the kid through long summer and winter breaks .
Why not have Johnny , Jr. in school on a more - or - less full - time basis so that he graduates and is off the family payroll by age 20 ?
Students should graduate with a portfolio of work and credentials to show employers .
Nearly all programmers think that they are above average in talent and achievement .
Precious few have any concrete evidence to support this belief .
The curriculum needs to include enough open - ended projects and time for producing good write - ups and presentations that every student graduates with a portfolio showing what problems were attacked , what designs were produced , and to what extent a complete solution was implemented .
The curriculum should also provide opportunities for achieving recognized national certifications .
As of the date of this writing the most common certification standards are from Cisco , Microsoft , and Oracle and are too closely tied to those companies ' products for most academicians ' taste .
Unless and until a consortia of universities and employers develops a competing set of standards it is probably worth helping students meet the currently recognized standards .
Grade inflation is so rampant at most good schools that a transcript is no longer meaningful .
Students should be graded exclusively by outsiders .
In some cases it will be a computer scanning the results of their Microsoft certification test .
In some cases it will be an external client for whom a student team has built a project .
In some cases it might be professional engineers or academics in a low - wage foreign country applying written standards .
But in no case should it be a teacher whose salary is being paid by the student 's tuition .
The potential for conflict of interest and therefore grade inflation is too high and furthermore we want the faculty to be regarded as coaches rather than evaluators .
All student work should have the character of an engineering project : client talks about a problem ; student team prepares a written plan for solving the problem ; student team discusses the plan with the client ; student team builds a prototype ; student team tests the prototype with the client and users ; student team refines the prototype in response to the testing ; student team documents its results .
Everything in a standard engineering curriculum can be taught with this process .
For example , students building a flight simulation game might need to refer to a Physics textbook and do some practice Physics problems in order to learn enough to build their prototype .
This makes it a bit tough for the faculty , who need to be clever enough to weave such courses as Physics , Calculus , and Biology into engineering projects .
The payoff is that by the time the student graduates he or she will be completely comfortable with the engineering process of listen , design , discuss , implement , test , refine , and write up .
Weaving such subjects as literature and history into the curriculum present more of a challenge and are left as an exercise for the reader :-) .

Introduction
The Holy Grail of online music sales is the ability to offer iPod - compatible tracks .
Like the quest for the mythical cup itself , the search for iPod compatibility has been largely fruitless for Apple 's competitors , whose DRM schemes are incompatible with the iconic music player .
For a music store that wants to succeed , reaching the iPod audience is all but a necessity in the the US market , where Apple products account for 78 percent of the total players sold .
Perhaps that 's why eMusic CEO David Pakman sounds downright gleeful when he points out that " there 's only two companies in the world that can sell to them Apple and eMusic . "
It 's rather a startling point — given the worldwide success that Apple has had selling iPods , one would think that music stores would do whatever it takes to make their offerings iPod-compatible .
Attempts at bypassing or emulating Apple 's FairPlay have not been successful , however , and FairPlay is ( famously ) unavailable for licensing .
So what 's a music store to do ?
To eMusic , the answer was simple : you offer songs as high quality , variable bit rate MP3 files instead .
DRM is removed , consumers are happy , and the vast white fields of the iPod are ready for harvest .
It sounds like such a simple idea , but in the context of the music business , this is radical , French Revolution - type stuff .
What 's perhaps even more interesting is the fact that eMusic 's decision to offer unprotected MP3 files was not an ideological one ; the idea made great business sense , and has established eMusic as the # 2 retailer of downloadable music behind the iTunes Music Store .
The fact that it opened the way for iPod compatibility was really just a bonus , since a couple of years back , it was much less clear that Apple would come to dominate the market in the way that it does today .
" It 's really not a philosophical decision ; it 's a practical one , " says Pakman .
" Early on , the belief was that we had to sell music in the only universally compatible format that existed .
TiVo was just about to come out with MP3 playback on their machine and we did n't know if that was going to be big .
There were a bunch of MP3 players on the market , including the iPod , and that market was growing .
There were MP3 car stereos happening .
There were n't any phones , but you can see that 's where it was going .
Everyone was putting MP3 in their device , so why not sell in a format that works in all those places ? "
Indeed , when put this way , it sounds amazing that no one else ( apart from some dubious Russians ) has released music that will play on the widest possible array of devices .
There 's a reason this does n't happen , of course : the music labels wo n't allow it .
Actually , the major music labels wo n't allow it — but there 's a whole ecosystem of independent music labels that want nothing more than wide exposure and fair compensation .
What eMusic has done is to construct a business model built around indie music — and they 're now selling 5 million tracks a month doing it .
That 's because indie music does n't ( necessarily ) mean bands with a fan club of six .
A good chunk of the best work being done today comes from indie musicians like Bloc Party , the Drive - By Truckers , Gomez , Interpol , Belle & Sebastian , Tom Waits , Nick Cave , Pedro the Lion , Dolorean , Calexico , Arcade Fire , Spoon , Dar Williams , Ron Sexsmith , Modern Skirts , and Ryan Adams , all of whom are carried by eMusic .
The company has built itself into an indie music powerhouse that now offers more than a million tracks and 175,000 subscribers , and it sells its songs for about a quarter each .
Though in no danger of eclipsing Apple 's one billion track sales , the company looks well - placed to cater to the over - 25 music lover , a group not always well - served by the major labels .
But things have n't always gone so well for the company ...
